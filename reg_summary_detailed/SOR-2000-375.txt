**Detailed Summary of the Canada Post Corporation Withdrawal Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under the following statutory authorities:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(v.7)a and subsection 46.3(6)b of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
  → These provisions authorize the Treasury Board to make regulations concerning the withdrawal of pension benefits for certain public servants transitioning from public service employment.

- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**  
  → Grants the Treasury Board the power to make regulations related to the financial administration of public service pension plans.

The regulations are formally published in *Statutes Canada* (S.C. 1999, c. 34, s. 92(6) and s. 97), and come into force upon registration.

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms used in the regulations:

- **"Act"** = The *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA)  
  → The foundational legislation governing public service pension plans.

- **"Canada Post Pension Plan"** = The pension plan established by Canada Post under paragraph 46.3(1)(a) of the PSSA  
  → A specific pension plan for employees of Canada Post, distinct from the broader Public Service Pension Plan.

- **"Pensionable service"** = Service that qualifies for pension benefits under the PSSA  
  → Defined in accordance with the Act’s standard definition.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to individuals who meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Ceased public service employment** on **October 1, 2000**, due to the coming into force of **Section 227 of the Public Sector Pension Investment Board Act** (which effectively ended their status as public servants for the purposes of the PSSA).

2. Were **employed by Canada Post** and were **active contributors** to the Canada Post Pension Plan on **September 30, 2000**.

3. **Remained employed by Canada Post for at least one day after September 30, 2000**.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This ensures that the individual was not merely terminated or left on September 30 but had a continuing employment relationship with Canada Post after that date — a key condition to qualify for the withdrawal benefits under these regulations.

### **4. Calculation of Benefit Accrual (Actuarial Present Value)**

The **actuarial present value** of pension benefits accrued up to **September 30, 2000** is calculated using:

- The **Actuarial Report on the Pension Plan for the Public Service of Canada**, tabled in Parliament on **March 18, 1998**, and as at **March 31, 1996**.

This report provides the baseline assumptions used for actuarial calculations in the public service pension system.

#### **Variations to Actuarial Assumptions (Effective October 1, 2000)**

The original assumptions from the 1996 report are adjusted as follows:

| Assumption | Adjustment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Interest Rate** (October 1, 2000 – September 30, 2015) | 3.9% per annum **plus** the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during that period (as detailed in the Actuarial Report). |
| **Interest Rate** (after September 30, 2015) | Fixed at **6.5% per annum**. |
| **Salary and Pensionable Earnings Growth** | - 3.9% per annum from October 1, 2000 to September 30, 2001<br>- 4% per annum after September 30, 2001. |
| **Retirement Rates** | As specified in **Schedule 1** (e.g., retirement age, pension percentages based on years of service). |
| **Termination Rates** | As specified in **Schedule 2** (e.g., severance or termination benefit rates). |
| **Transfer Values on Termination** | Calculated using the interest rates specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Actuarial Report. |

> These adjustments reflect updated economic and demographic conditions and ensure that the pension value is fairly calculated over time.

### **5. Adjustment for Instalment Payments (Netting Out)**

The calculated benefit amount is **net of the present value** of any **instalment payments** that would have been due and payable **after September 30, 2000** if the employee had remained in the Public Service.

#### Special Rule for Leave of Absence

- If an employee was on **leave without pay**, any associated **instalment payment** attributable to that leave is treated as if it were due and payable on **October 1, 2000**.

- The **present value** of such payments is calculated using an interest rate of **6.9% per annum**.

> This ensures that employees who took time off without pay do not receive inflated benefits due to the deferral of payments.

---

### **6. Payment Terms**

- The **total amount** (calculated under section 3) **plus interest** must be paid by the **Minister of Finance** over a period **not exceeding two years**, starting from **October 1, 2000**.

- **Interest on each payment** is calculated at **7.25% per annum**, from **October 1, 2000**, up to the **day before each payment**.

> This ensures timely and fair compensation, with interest reflecting a reasonable return on the value of the pension benefit.

---

### **7. Distribution to the Canada Post Pension Plan**

The total amount is paid to the **Canada Post Pension Plan** in two parts:

| Payment Component | Source Fund |
|------------------|-------------|
| Benefits related to pensionable service **prior to April 1, 2000** | **Superannuation Account** |
| Benefits related to pensionable service **credited after March 31, 2000** | **Public Service Pension Fund** |

> This reflects a transition in funding structure:  
> - Pre-April 2000 contributions were managed through the Superannuation Account (a dedicated fund for Canada Post).  
> - Post-March 31, 2000 contributions were integrated into the broader Public Service Pension Fund (managed by the Public Service Pension Investment Board).

---

### **8. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **day of registration** in the Canada Gazette.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

1. **Transition Management**  
   These regulations provide a structured and fair mechanism for employees of Canada Post who lost their public service status on October 1, 2000, to receive a calculated pension benefit based on their accrued service.

2. **Actuarial Fairness**  
   By using a standardized actuarial report and adjusting interest and salary growth assumptions, the regulations ensure that pension values are consistent with economic conditions and actuarial best practices.

3. **Clarity in Funding and Distribution**  
   The distinction between pre- and post-April 2000 service clarifies how pension liabilities are allocated between two different pension funds, ensuring accountability and transparency.

4. **Interest and Timing**  
   The 7.25% interest rate and two-year payment window ensure that the benefit is both timely and economically justified.

5. **Special Treatment for Leave Without Pay**  
   Recognizes that employees on unpaid leave do not lose pension entitlements, and adjusts calculations accordingly.

### **Conclusion**

The **Canada Post Corporation Withdrawal Regulations** serve as a critical transitional mechanism to ensure that public servants who lost their status under the Public Sector Pension Investment Board Act on October 1, 2000, receive a fair, actuarially sound, and timely pension benefit. By applying specific interest, salary, and retirement assumptions, and clearly defining the distribution of benefits between the Superannuation Account and the Public Service Pension Fund, the regulations balance fairness, financial prudence, and administrative clarity.

These rules are a key example of how federal government pension systems adapt to structural changes in public service employment while maintaining equity and financial sustainability.
