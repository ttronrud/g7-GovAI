The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-103"** — is a statutory instrument (SI) of the United Kingdom that has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Title**: The specific title of the regulation is not provided in your query. However, SI/2018-103 refers to a Statutory Instrument published in 2018, numbered 103 of that year.  
- **Status**: This instrument is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force. It was formally revoked by a subsequent legislative or regulatory action.  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through another statutory instrument or legislation, and the exact date of repeal would typically be specified in the repealing instrument. In this case, the repeal is noted in the citation itself ("Repealed, SI/2018-103"), which suggests that the repeal may have been part of a later SI or a legislative amendment.  
- **Purpose (Prior Function)**: While the exact content of SI/2018-103 is not available without access to the full text (which may be archived in the UK legislation database), such instruments typically relate to administrative, regulatory, or procedural matters. Examples could include rules governing licensing, compliance, environmental standards, or public sector operations — depending on the subject matter.  
- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They are superseded by a more comprehensive or modern regulation.
  - They conflict with newer legislation.
  - They are redundant due to changes in policy or structure.

### Key Points:
- **SI/2018-103 is not currently active** — it has been formally removed from legal force.
- The repeal itself is a legal act that nullifies the previous regulation, and any references to it in current legal or operational contexts are no longer valid.
- To understand the **original purpose** of SI/2018-103, one would need to consult the archived version of the instrument, which may be available via the [UK Government's legislation website](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) or the [UK Statutory Instruments database](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/si).

### Recommendation:
To obtain a precise summary of what SI/2018-103 originally regulated, you should:
1. Search the UK legislation database using the exact reference: **SI 2018/103**.
2. Review the original text to determine the subject matter (e.g., waste management, health and safety, transport, etc.).
3. Check the repeal notice (likely another SI) to understand the legal basis for its removal.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the full title or subject of SI/2018-103, a detailed summary cannot be provided beyond its status as a repealed instrument.

If you can provide the **full title** or **subject matter** (e.g., "Regulations on food safety" or "Licensing of construction sites"), I can offer a more detailed and accurate summary of the original regulation and its repeal.
