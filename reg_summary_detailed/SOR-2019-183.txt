**Detailed Summary of the Preclearance in Canada Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

The *Preclearance in Canada Regulations* are established under a combination of federal statutes and legislative provisions, reflecting the multi-jurisdictional nature of preclearance operations at Canadian international border facilities (e.g., U.S. border crossings such as those in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal). The regulations are made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on recommendations from two key ministers:

- The **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**
- The **Minister of Transport**

These powers are derived from the following legislative sources:

| Statute | Provision |
|--------|----------|
| **Aeronautics Act** | Section 4.71a (relating to preclearance activities at airports) |
| **Customs Tariff** (R.S., c. A-2) | Paragraph 133(b) and subparagraph 133(h)(i) (authorizing customs enforcement at preclearance points) |
| **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36) | Subsection 5(1) (regarding entry and processing of individuals) |
| **Preclearance Act, 2016** (S.C. 2017, c. 27) | Section 43 (authorizing preclearance operations and related powers) |

> **Note:** In these regulations, “Act” refers specifically to the *Preclearance Act, 2016*.

### **2. Who May Enter a Preclearance Area (Paragraph 17(d) of the Act)**

The following individuals are permitted to enter a preclearance area without requiring a full travel authorization:

1. **Pass Holders**  
   - Individuals who hold a **pass issued by or under the authority of the facility operator**.  
   - The pass grants access during a specified period for employment-related functions.  
   - Entry is required to perform their job duties.

2. **Persons Authorized by a Preclearance Officer**  
   - Individuals granted temporary access by a preclearance officer for legitimate, time-limited purposes.

3. **Law Enforcement Officers**  
   - Officials authorized to **administer or enforce Canadian law** (e.g., police, customs, or immigration officers) who must enter the area to carry out their duties.

4. **Emergency Service Providers**  
   - Personnel from emergency services (e.g., fire, medical, search and rescue) who must enter to perform essential duties.

> This provision ensures that only authorized and necessary personnel are allowed into the preclearance zone, balancing operational needs with security and public safety.

### **3. Operator Responsibilities for Authorized Entries (Paragraph 17(e) of the Act)**

The **operator of the facility** (e.g., a private company managing a border crossing facility) has specific obligations when allowing non-traveller access:

#### a) **Urgent Repair Personnel**
- If a person is authorized to perform **urgent repairs** (e.g., fixing a damaged infrastructure or equipment), the operator must:
  - **Notify a preclearance officer** of the entry.
  - Ensure **constant surveillance** of the individual while in the area.

#### b) **All Other Authorized Persons**
- For any other authorized entry (e.g., maintenance, inspections), the operator must:
  - Provide **reasonable notice** to a preclearance officer.
  - Ensure **constant surveillance** of the individual throughout their stay.

> These rules emphasize transparency, accountability, and oversight of non-traveller access to protect border integrity and ensure compliance with security protocols.

### **4. Identification Requirements for Travelers (Paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act)**

A **Canadian citizen under the age of 16** traveling by **non-air transport** (e.g., bus, train, car) to the United States **does not need to present photographic identification**.

> This reflects a policy of reducing administrative burden on minors and promoting ease of access for young travelers, while maintaining the integrity of border control for adults and other categories.

---

### **5. Traveler Obligations in a Preclearance Area (Paragraph 18(3) of the Act)**

All travelers must comply with the following requirements when in a preclearance area:

- **Report to a preclearance officer** upon arrival.
- **Identify themselves** and **state their reason for being in the area**.
- **Leave the area immediately** if they are not authorized to be there.

> This ensures that all individuals in the preclearance zone are accounted for and that unauthorized persons are quickly removed to prevent security risks.

---

### **6. Security and Armed Presence Requirements**

To ensure safety and response capability, especially where **preclearance officers are not permitted to carry weapons**, the operator of the facility must:

- Maintain the **continuous presence of at least one armed police officer** during all hours when preclearance activities are ongoing.
- Ensure that this officer conducts **regular patrols** within the preclearance areas and perimeters.
- Respond **rapidly and in person** to any emergency call or alarm raised by a preclearance officer.

> This provision reinforces public safety and provides a reliable, visible layer of security in areas where law enforcement officers may not be allowed to carry firearms.

### **7. Reporting to Senior Officials (Section 26.1 of the Act)**

A traveler who chooses to **inform Canadian senior officials** of the Preclearance Consultative Group about any situation involving:

- Sections 22, 23, and 24 (e.g., threats, suspicious activity, or breaches)
- Subsection 31(2) (e.g., potential security risks)
- Section 32 (e.g., incidents involving contraband or illegal goods)

**must do so in writing**.

> This requirement ensures that sensitive or potentially high-risk situations are formally documented and escalated to the highest levels of government oversight, promoting transparency and accountability.

### **8. Seizure and Disposal of Goods (Subsection 34(1) and (3) of the Act)**

### **10. Additional Notice for Other Seized Goods (Not Covered in Paragraphs 7(1)(a)–(c))**

If goods are seized under subsection 34(1) or (3) but **do not fall under the specific categories listed in paragraphs 7(1)(a) to (c)**, the officer must provide a written notice that includes:

- Confirmation of seizure and reason
- **U.S. legal requirements** that must be met before goods can be imported into the United States (if applicable)
- **Steps to avoid forfeiture** to the U.S. government (if applicable)

> This is critical for travelers to understand potential consequences and to take corrective action to prevent loss of property.

---

### **11. Detention of Specific Goods (Subsection 34(2) of the Act)**
