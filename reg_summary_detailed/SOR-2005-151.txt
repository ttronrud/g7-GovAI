Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive, and structured summary** of the *Canada Education Savings Regulations* (S.C. 2004, c. 26), enacted under the *Canada Education Savings Act* and administered by the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, on the recommendation of the Governor in Council.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Education Savings Regulations (S.C. 2004, c. 26)**

These regulations establish the administrative framework governing the **Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)** system in Canada, including rules for **CES grants**, the **Canada Learning Bond (CLB)**, **educational assistance payments (EAPs)**, **withdrawals**, **repayments**, and **trustee responsibilities**. The goal is to ensure that contributions to RESPs are used effectively for post-secondary education and that government subsidies are properly administered and safeguarded.

### 🔹 1. **Definitions and Key Terms**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | The *Canada Education Savings Act* (CESA) |
| **RESP** | A registered education savings plan established for the benefit of a beneficiary (e.g., a student) |
| **Assisted Contribution** | A contribution to an RESP for which a **Canada Education Savings (CES) grant** has been paid by the government |
| **Unassisted Contribution** | A contribution made without a CES grant |
| **CES Grant** | A government grant (up to $500 per year) provided to an RESP for eligible contributions |
| **CLB** | The **Canada Learning Bond**, a $500 government contribution paid into an RESP when a beneficiary is born or when the RESP is established |
| **CLB Account** | An account within an RESP that holds the CLB amount |
| **Grant Account** | An account within an RESP that holds all CES grants paid into it |
| **Common-law Partner** | As defined in subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act |
| **Brother/Sister in Relation** | A son or daughter of the common-law partner or spouse of a parent of the beneficiary |
| **Trustee Agreement** | A legally binding agreement between the Minister and the RESP trustee outlining obligations related to CES grants, CLB, and reporting |

> These definitions are critical for interpreting eligibility, withdrawal order, and reporting requirements.

### 🔹 2. **Order of Withdrawal of Contributions**

When both assisted and unassisted contributions are in an RESP, withdrawals are **prioritized** as follows:

1. **Assisted contributions** are withdrawn **before** unassisted contributions.
2. Among unassisted contributions:
   - Those made **after 1997** are withdrawn **before** those made **before 1998**.

> This ensures that government-subsidized contributions are used first, preserving the value of the CES grant.

---

### 🔹 3. **CES Grant Calculation and Timing**

A CES grant is **not automatically paid** for every contribution. It is subject to strict conditions and **timing adjustments**:

#### ⚖️ **Grant Reduction Rule (to prevent double-dipping):**
If a CES grant would otherwise be payable in a later year, it is **reduced** by the total amount of **other CES grants paid after the original contribution year but before the due date** — adjusted as if those grants had been paid in the original year.

> This prevents overpayment and ensures fairness in grant allocation across years.

---

### 🔹 4. **Eligibility for CES Grant Payment**

The Minister may pay a CES grant **only if** the following conditions are met:

#### ✅ Required Conditions:
- A **trustee agreement** is in place with the Minister, containing the terms in Section 8.
- The **application is submitted** by a subscriber (beneficiary’s parent or guardian) at the request of the subscriber:
  - For contributions **after 2004**: within **3 years** of the contribution.
  - For contributions **before 2005**: no later than **December 31, 2007**.
- The beneficiary **must meet one of these age or contribution thresholds** at the time of application:
  - Attains **16 or 17 years of age**:
    - Minimum of **$2,000** in contributions (not withdrawn) **before** age 16.
    - Minimum of **$100 annual contributions** in **at least four years** before age 16.
  - For **1998**: beneficiary was a beneficiary under an RESP in **at least four years before 1998**.
  - For **1999**: beneficiary was a beneficiary under an RESP in **at least four years before 1998**.
- The **total contributions** (including deemed contributions under Part X.4 of the Income Tax Act) must not exceed the **RESP lifetime limit** (as defined in subsection 204.9(1) of the Income Tax Act).
- The RESP must **comply with registration requirements** under subsection 146.1(2) of the Income Tax Act (specifically for plans entered into on or after Jan. 1, 1999).
- The beneficiary is **not an ineligible beneficiary**.
- The trustee **complies with all terms and conditions** of these regulations and the trustee agreement.

> This ensures that grants are not awarded to beneficiaries with insufficient or inconsistent saving behavior.

---

### 🔹 5. **Eligibility for Multiple Beneficiaries (EAP and Grant Rules)**

The Minister may pay a CES grant **only if**:
- The RESP has **one beneficiary**, OR
- All beneficiaries are **brothers or sisters** of each other.

> This prevents the grant from being used for non-related beneficiaries and maintains the family-based nature of the program.

---

### 🔹 6. **Restrictions on Withdrawals After March 22, 2004**

If **assisted contributions** are withdrawn after **March 22, 2004**, the Minister **will not** pay a CES grant for that individual **during the period** that begins on the day of withdrawal and ends on the last day of the **second year following the withdrawal**, **unless**:

1. At the time of withdrawal, **at least one beneficiary is eligible** to receive an **EAP**.
2. The withdrawal is an **eligible transfer** (e.g., to another RESP or to a parent).
3. The withdrawal is part of an **excess contribution** (to reduce tax under Part X.4) and the excess is **not greater than $4,000**.

> This rule protects the grant system from misuse and ensures that withdrawals do not disqualify future grant eligibility.

---

### 🔹 7. **Ineligibility for Beneficiaries (Post-Withdrawal Rule)**

If contributions made **before 1998** are withdrawn **after February 23, 1998**, any beneficiary of the RESP **during the period from February 24, 1998, to the date of withdrawal** is considered an **ineligible beneficiary** for the period starting on the day of withdrawal and ending on the last day of the second year following the withdrawal.

> This prevents beneficiaries from receiving benefits after a certain date, especially to avoid misuse of the system during a transitional period.

---

### 🔹 8. **Exemptions from Withdrawal Restrictions**

A withdrawal is **not subject** to the above restrictions if:
- The total withdrawal for the year is **$200 or less**.
- The withdrawal occurs when **at least one beneficiary is eligible** for an EAP.
- It is an **eligible transfer**.
- It is part of an **excess contribution** (≤ $4,000).

> These exceptions allow for small, legitimate withdrawals (e.g., for emergency expenses or transfers to another RESP).

---

### 🔹 9. **Canada Learning Bond (CLB) Rules**

The Minister may pay a CLB **only if**:

- A **trustee agreement** is in place with the required terms (Section 8).
- The application is made by the **trustee at the request of a subscriber**.
- The RESP **complies with registration rules** under subsection 146.1(2) of the Income Tax Act.
- The RESP has **only one beneficiary**, or all beneficiaries are **brothers or sisters**.
- The RESP has a **CLB account** for each beneficiary.
- The trustee complies with all regulatory terms.

> The CLB is paid upon the **birth of the beneficiary** or when the RESP is established (whichever comes first), and is **non-refundable**.

---
