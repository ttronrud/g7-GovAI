**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Rocky Mountain Sculpin (Cottus sp.) Eastslope Populations Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
November 30, 2017  
(Ottawa)

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)*  
S.C. 2002, c. 29

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The Rocky Mountain Sculpin (*Cottus sp.*) Eastslope population is legally designated as a **threatened species** under *Part 3 of Schedule 1* to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification means the species is at risk of becoming extinct and is entitled to protection and recovery support under federal law.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for this sculpin population was developed and includes a detailed identification of its **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery. This critical habitat has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the information.

3. **No Conflict with Protected Areas (Subsection 58(2)b):**  
   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion of the identified critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This subsection protects areas that are designated as reserves or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of Indigenous bands (First Nations). By confirming that the critical habitat does not overlap with such protected Indigenous lands, the regulation avoids triggering additional legal or procedural complications under SARA.

4. **Consultation with Indigenous Partners:**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFOD) has determined that the proposed Order may affect **reserves or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation band**. In accordance with **subsection 58(7)** of SARA, which requires consultation with Indigenous governments when a regulatory action may impact their lands or rights, the MFOD conducted formal consultations with:
   - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)**  
   - The **relevant First Nation band**  
   These consultations ensured that Indigenous perspectives, rights, and interests were considered and respected in the decision-making process.

### **Legal Basis for the Order**

The Order is made under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Section 58(4):** Authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat for a species listed under SARA.
- **Section 58(5):** Requires that the designation be based on scientific evidence and recovery strategies, and that it be made in accordance with the principles of the Act, including consultation where necessary.

Additionally, **subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Rocky Mountain Sculpin Eastslope population. This means that once designated, the critical habitat is legally protected, and any development, alteration, or activity that could harm the habitat is subject to regulatory scrutiny or restriction.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Designation of Critical Habitat:**  
  The Order formally designates specific geographic areas as critical habitat for the Rocky Mountain Sculpin (Cottus sp.) Eastslope population. These areas are defined in the annex to the Order and are based on the recovery strategy, which identifies the ecological requirements (e.g., water quality, substrate type, temperature, streamflow) necessary for the sculpin’s survival and reproduction.

- **Legal Effect:**  
  Once registered, the Order comes into force on the day it is officially registered (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette). After registration, the designated critical habitat is legally protected under SARA. This means:
  - Any activity that could result in the destruction, degradation, or impairment of the habitat is prohibited unless authorized by a permit or exemption.
  - Proponents of development or infrastructure projects must assess and mitigate impacts on the habitat through environmental assessments or other regulatory processes.

- **Exclusion from Indigenous Lands:**  
  The Order explicitly confirms that the designated critical habitat does **not** fall within any reserve or land set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation, thereby avoiding conflicts with Indigenous land rights and ensuring compliance with SARA’s consultation requirements.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Provide legal protection for the essential ecological areas required by the Rocky Mountain Sculpin Eastslope population.
- Support the species’ recovery by ensuring that its habitat remains intact and undisturbed.
- Promote biodiversity conservation in the region.
- Ensure compliance with SARA’s requirements for species recovery and habitat protection.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Ecological Protection:** This Order helps safeguard a rare and ecologically sensitive fish species that is adapted to cold, high-elevation streams in the Rocky Mountains.
- **Legal Clarity:** It provides clear, legally binding boundaries for critical habitat, which can be used by regulators, land managers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions.
- **Indigenous Engagement:** The inclusion of consultation demonstrates a commitment to inclusive governance and respect for Indigenous rights and interests, even when federal actions involve protected species.
- **Enforcement and Monitoring:** The designation enables future enforcement mechanisms, including monitoring and compliance checks, to ensure that habitat remains protected over time.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding designation of critical habitat for the Rocky Mountain Sculpin (Cottus sp.) Eastslope population under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, respects Indigenous rights through formal consultation, and ensures that the species’ essential habitat is protected from harmful activities. The Order strengthens conservation efforts for this threatened species and reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity and species recovery under SARA.

**Effective Date:** Upon registration in the Canada Gazette.  
**Jurisdiction:** Federal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans).  
**Applicability:** Applies to all federal activities and land use decisions affecting the designated critical habitat.
