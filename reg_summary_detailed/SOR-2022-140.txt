### **Detailed Summary of the Clean Fuel Regulations (Canada)**

The **Clean Fuel Regulations**, enacted under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, represent a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of liquid fossil fuels in Canada. These regulations were formally introduced on **December 19, 2020**, in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, following a public consultation period during which stakeholders—including provinces, Aboriginal governments, and the public—were invited to submit comments or file objections. The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, ultimately approved and enacted the regulations on the basis of their significant potential to mitigate air pollution and combat climate change.

## **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Authority**

The regulations are made under:
- **Section 332(1)a of CEPA 1999**: Allows the Minister of the Environment to promulgate regulations to prevent or reduce air pollution from liquid fossil fuel combustion.
- **Section 140c and 326 of CEPA 1999**: Provides authority for setting fuel standards and establishing compliance mechanisms.
- **Section 330(2)**: Enables the Minister to issue regulations that address environmental protection.
- **Section 5(1) of the Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act (EVAMPA)**: Grants the Minister power to impose administrative monetary penalties for non-compliance.

This legislative foundation ensures that the regulations are both environmentally grounded and enforceable through administrative penalties where necessary.

## **2. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Clean Fuel Regulations are:

- To **reduce greenhouse gas emissions** from the use of liquid fossil fuels (gasoline and diesel) by promoting cleaner, lower-carbon alternatives.
- To **encourage innovation and investment** in renewable and low-carbon fuels such as renewable natural gas (RNG), renewable propane, hydrogen, and biofuels.
- To **establish a transparent, science-based, and market-driven compliance system** that enables gradual transition away from high-carbon fuels.
- To **align with international standards** (e.g., ISO 14040, ISO 14064) and support Canada’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The regulations are considered a significant step toward achieving Canada’s goal of reducing GHG emissions by 40–45% below 2005 levels by 2030.

## **3. Key Definitions and Concepts**

A detailed set of definitions establishes the legal and technical framework of the regulations:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Baseline Carbon Intensity** | The weighted average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel used in Canada in 2016 (as defined in subsection 5(3)). This serves as a benchmark for measuring future reductions. |
| **Carbon Intensity (CI)** | Measured in grams of CO₂e per megajoule (MJ) of energy. It includes emissions across the entire life cycle: feedstock extraction, processing, transportation, and combustion. |
| **Low-Carbon-Intensity Fuel (LCIF)** | A fuel (liquid or gaseous) that has a carbon intensity **no more than 90% of the reference intensity** set out in Schedule 1 for each compliance period. Specific thresholds apply based on fuel type. |
| **Liquid Class** | Fossil fuels that are liquid at standard conditions (e.g., gasoline, diesel). These are subject to reduction requirements. |
| **Gaseous Class** | Includes propane and natural gas. Separate rules apply. |
| **Eligible Feedstock** | Biomass or other biological materials used to produce LCIFs, meeting criteria under sections 48–52 and not exempted under sections 53–55. |
| **Primary Supplier** | A person who owns, operates, leases, or controls a facility producing gasoline/diesel in Canada or imports such fuels into Canada. |
| **Registered Creator** | A person registered with the Minister to produce or supply low-carbon fuels (e.g., RNG, renewable propane). |
| **Compliance Period** | Defined in stages: <br> - Initial: January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2022 <br> - 2023: Jan 1 – Jun 30 <br> - 2023: Jul 1 – Dec 31 <br> - After 2023: Annual periods. |
| **Reduction Requirement** | The amount of carbon intensity reduction that primary suppliers must achieve annually, calculated under section 9. |
| **Deferred Portion of Reduction Requirements** | A portion of the required reduction that may be deferred under section 16, adjusted by sections 17 and 18. |
| **Compliance-Credit Transfer System** | A market-based mechanism allowing credits to be transferred between primary suppliers, registered creators, and foreign suppliers. This enables flexibility in meeting reduction targets. |
| **Provisional Compliance Credit** | A temporary credit issued to participants to support early compliance and transition. |

## **4. Fuel Categories and Standards**

### **A. Liquid Fossil Fuels (Gasoline & Diesel)**
- Must meet **specific quality standards** (e.g., vapor pressure, anti-knock index, distillation range).
- Subject to **mandatory reduction requirements** in carbon intensity relative to the baseline (2016).
- Must reduce emissions over time, with targets increasing progressively.

### **B. Low-Carbon-Intensity Fuels (LCIFs)**
These are **non-liquid, non-gaseous fuels** that meet strict carbon intensity thresholds:

| Fuel Type | Carbon Intensity Threshold |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **Renewable Natural Gas (RNG)** | ≤ 90% of reference intensity (item 2 in Schedule 1) |
| **Hydrogen** | ≤ 90% of reference intensity (item 2 in Schedule 1) |
| **Renewable Propane** | ≤ 90% of reference intensity (item 3 in Schedule 1) |
| **Co-processed Low-Carbon-Intensity Propane** | ≤ 90% of reference intensity (item 3 in Schedule 1) |
| **Biogas** | ≤ 90% of reference intensity (item 2 in Schedule 1) |

> Note: "Co-processed" means blending petroleum feedstock with non-petroleum feedstock (e.g., biomass) in a refinery. The portion derived from non-petroleum sources qualifies as low-carbon.

### **C. Fuel Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) Model**
- Developed by the Minister in accordance with **ISO 14040 and ISO 14044**.
- Uses life-cycle inventories to calculate carbon intensity across all stages:
  - Feedstock extraction and production
  - Processing, refining, and upgrading
  - Transportation and distribution
  - Combustion
- Ensures **scientific rigor and consistency** in emissions calculations.

## **5. Compliance and Accountability Mechanisms**

### **A. Registration Requirements**
- **Primary Suppliers** must register with the Minister under subsection 10(1).
- **Registered Creators** must register under subsection 25(1) to produce or supply LCIFs.
- Registration includes verification of eligibility and compliance with feedstock and production standards.

### **B. Reduction Requirements**
- Primary suppliers must achieve a **net reduction in carbon intensity** of gasoline and diesel over time.
- The required reduction is calculated using a formula in **section 9**, based on baseline intensity and actual performance.
- Reductions can be offset by:
  - Using low-carbon-intensity fuels (LCIFs)
  - Transferring compliance credits
  - Meeting certain renewable fuel volume targets

### **C. Compliance-Credit Transfer System**
- Allows participants to:
  - Generate compliance credits by producing or using low-carbon fuels.
  - Transfer credits to other suppliers (domestic or foreign).
  - Offset their own reduction obligations.
- Supports **market-based flexibility**, enabling innovation and investment in clean technologies.

### **D. Verification and Certification**
- A formal **Verification and Certification Process** is established via the *Methods for Verification and Certification* document.
- Requires:
  - Independent audits by accredited bodies (ISO/IEC 17021-1 and 17065 accredited).
  - Adherence to **ISO 14064-2** (for GHG quantification) and **ISO 14064-3:2019** (for verification and validation).
  - Use of **GPS and data logging** for charging stations to ensure accurate reporting of energy use.
- Any **misstatement** (error, omission, or misreporting) in applications or reports may result in penalties.

## **6. Stakeholder Engagement and Consultation**

Before final adoption, the Minister:
- Offered **formal consultation** with:
  - Provincial governments
  - Members of the **National Advisory Committee** representing Aboriginal governments
- Provided a **public comment period** during which individuals and organizations could submit feedback or file objections.
- Established a **board of review** process if objections were filed, ensuring transparency and democratic accountability.

This engagement process strengthens the legitimacy and inclusivity of the regulation.

## **7. Enforcement and Penalties**

- The Minister has authority under **EVAMPA** to impose **administrative monetary penalties** for non-compliance.
- Penalties may apply for:
  - Failing to meet reduction requirements
  - Submitting false or misleading data
  - Unauthorized transfer of
