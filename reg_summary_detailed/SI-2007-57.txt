The regulation you provided is a formal government notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Below is a detailed and accurate summary of its content, context, and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Notice of Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments under Section 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*

**Citation:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Instrument 2002-29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment

**Key Provision:**  
This regulation acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** regarding specific species listed in an annexed schedule. These assessments were prepared in accordance with **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**.

---

**Context and Purpose:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), enacted in 2002, is a federal law designed to prevent wildlife species from becoming extinct and to recover species that are at risk of extinction.
- One of the key responsibilities of SARA is to establish a formal process for identifying species at risk and assessing their status.
- Under **section 23(1)** of SARA, the Minister of the Environment is required to receive and consider scientific assessments from COSEWIC — an independent scientific body — on the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada.
- COSEWIC evaluates species based on scientific data and determines whether a species is "endangered," "threatened," "special concern," or "not at risk."

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Formal Acknowledgment:**  
   The Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) formally recognizes and accepts the COSEWIC assessments as having been received by the federal government. This is a procedural step that confirms the government's access to and recognition of the scientific evaluation.

2. **Species Covered:**  
   The regulation refers to a schedule (attached to the regulation) that lists specific species for which COSEWIC has completed assessments. These species are subject to formal evaluation under SARA and may be considered for listing, protection, or recovery planning.

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The action is grounded in **section 23(1)** of SARA, which mandates that the Minister receive and consider COSEWIC assessments before making decisions about species at risk. This ensures that federal policy decisions are informed by independent, science-based evaluations.

4. **Procedural Significance:**  
   This step is not a decision on whether a species is at risk, but rather a formal acknowledgment that the assessments have been received and are now part of the official process. It triggers the next phase of the SARA process, which may include:
   - The Minister determining whether to list a species as "endangered" or "threatened" under SARA.
   - The development of recovery strategies and action plans.
   - The implementation of protection measures.

**Implications:**

- This regulation ensures transparency and scientific rigor in the federal government’s approach to species conservation.
- It establishes a clear administrative pathway for how scientific assessments are integrated into policy.
- It supports the principle of evidence-based decision-making in environmental policy.

**Note on the Schedule:**  
The "annexed schedule" (not included in this excerpt) would contain the names and scientific classifications of the species assessed. These species may include mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, or plants, and could represent a range of conservation statuses identified by COSEWIC.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a procedural and administrative instrument that formalizes the federal government’s receipt of scientifically grounded evaluations of species at risk. It is a critical step in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that conservation decisions are based on current, peer-reviewed assessments by COSEWIC. While it does not itself list species or impose protections, it initiates the official process that may lead to formal listing, recovery planning, and legal protection under SARA.

---

**Additional Notes:**
- This regulation was published in 2002 as part of the initial implementation of SARA.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation through science-based, transparent governance.
- Subsequent amendments to SARA and related regulations have expanded the scope of species assessments and recovery efforts.
