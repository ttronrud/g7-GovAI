## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Source of Authority**:  
  These regulations were made under **subsection 15(1)** of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (COGOA), which allows the Governor in Council to adopt regulations to establish administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) for violations of the Act or its regulations.

- **Publication and Public Consultation**:  
  A proposed version of the regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 11, 2015**. This provided a **reasonable opportunity** for stakeholders (e.g., industry, environmental groups, Indigenous communities) to submit representations or comments to the **Minister of Natural Resources**.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  Based on the recommendations of both the **Minister of Natural Resources** and the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, the Governor in Council formally enacted the regulations on **October 13, 2015**, pursuant to **subsection 71.01(1)b** of the COGOA.

> ✅ **Legal Basis**:  
> - *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (R.S., c. O-7; S.C. 1992, c. 35, s. 2)  
> - *Energy Safety and Security Act* (S.C. 2015, c. 4, s. 27)

### 📚 **2. Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*.

#### ✅ Types of Violations Covered:

| Violation Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Type A or Type B Violation** | Any contravention of a provision in **Column 1 of a Part of Schedule 1** of the regulations. |
| **Direction, Requirement, Decision or Order** | Any contravention of a directive, requirement, decision, or order issued under the Act. |
| **Operating Licence, Approval, Leave or Exemption** | Any contravention of terms, conditions, or requirements set out in an operating licence, approval, leave, or exemption granted under the Act. |

> These violations are all **eligible for administrative monetary penalties** under **Sections 71.01 to 72.02** of the COGOA.

### ⚖️ **3. Classification of Violations: Type A vs. Type B**

| Violation Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Type A Violation** | Contravention of a provision listed in **Column 1 of a Part of Schedule 1** that is classified as "Type A" in **Column 2** of that Part. |
| **Type B Violation** | Contravention of: <br> - A direction, requirement, decision, or order under the Act; <br> - A term, condition, or requirement of an operating licence, approval, leave, or exemption. |

> 🔍 **Key Point**:  
> All violations of directions, requirements, decisions, or orders (under subsection 2(2)) or of licence/authorization terms (under subsection 2(3)) are **automatically classified as Type B violations**, regardless of the nature of the breach.

### 💰 **4. Penalty Structure: Gravity-Based Penalties**

#### 🔢 Penalty Determination:

- The **penalty amount** depends on:
  - The **type of violation** (Type A or Type B),
  - The **total gravity value** assigned to the violation.

#### 📊 How Total Gravity Value is Calculated:

1. **Identify all relevant criteria** listed in **Column 1** of the gravity table (in the regulation).
2. **Assign a gravity value** to each criterion based on the **specific circumstances** of the violation:
   - Lower value = less gravity (e.g., minor, isolated, no harm)
   - Higher value = greater gravity (e.g., repeated, systemic, environmental harm)
3. **Sum all assigned gravity values** to determine the **total gravity value**.

> ⚠️ This system allows for **proportionate and context-sensitive penalties**, ensuring fairness and consistency based on the severity and nature of the breach.

#### 💵 Penalty Amounts:

| Violation Type | Penalty Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Type A Violation** | Amount specified in **Column 2** of the gravity table (Schedule 2) |
| **Type B Violation** | Amount specified in **Column 3** of the gravity table (Schedule 2) |

> Example: A Type A violation with a total gravity value of 2 may result in a $10,000 penalty; a Type B violation with the same gravity value may result in a $20,000 penalty — reflecting greater seriousness.

### 📨 **5. Service of Regulatory Documents**

Proper service of notices (e.g., violation notices, compliance orders) is critical for legal enforceability.

#### For Individuals:

- Leave a copy at the individual’s **last known address or usual place of residence**.
- Leave it with an **adult household member** if the individual is not present.
- Send by **registered mail, courier, fax, or electronic means** to their address.

#### For Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, corporations):

- Leave a copy at the **head office or place of business** with an officer or person managing/control the business.
- Send by **registered mail, courier, or fax** to the head office.
- Send by **electronic means (not fax)** to an officer or individual managing the business.

#### 📅 When Service is Considered Effective:

| Method | Effective Date |
|-------|----------------|
| Left with household member | On the day it is left |
| Sent by registered mail or courier | 10 days after receipt date (as shown on postal/courier receipt) |
| Sent by fax or electronic means | On the day it is transmitted |

> ✅ This ensures **clear timelines** and **legal certainty** in enforcement actions.

### 🚀 **6. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day that **Section 27 of the Energy Safety and Security Act** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> 📅 **Note**: These regulations were in force as of **February 27, 2016**.

### 🎯 **Purpose and Key Features**

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proportionality** | Penalties are based on gravity, not just on the presence of a breach — ensuring fairness. |
| **Transparency** | Clear definitions, classification, and penalty tables make enforcement predictable. |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Public consultation process ensured industry and community input. |
