### 🔹 **Introduction and Legal Basis**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **Sections 2 and 3 of the United Nations Act**.

This means that the regulations are **binding Canadian law** enacted to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions related to **sanctions against individuals and entities linked to the Taliban, ISIL (Da’esh), and Al-Qaida** in Afghanistan.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: A number of definitions and references in the original text have been **repealed** (e.g., Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, Committee of the Security Council, etc.), reflecting updates or replacements in UN sanctions frameworks. The current regulation focuses on **two primary sanctions committees**:

> - The **1988 Sanctions Committee** (established under UN Resolution 1988)

These are the **only active committees** referenced in the current version of the regulation.

### ✅ **Section 2 – Exemptions for Humanitarian Assistance**

Despite the broad prohibitions, **Section 2 does NOT apply** to activities necessary to deliver **humanitarian assistance** or support **basic human needs** in Afghanistan, including:
