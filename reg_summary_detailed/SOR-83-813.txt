### **Core Provisions: Terms and Conditions for Advances**

#### 1. **Securing the Advance with a Promissory Note**
- Every advance to the Unemployment Insurance Account must be **secured by a promissory note**.
- The note must be:
  - In a form substantially similar to that set out in the **Schedule** (not included in this summary).
  - Signed by **duly authorized officers** of the Commission.
  - Delivered by the Commission to the **Minister of Finance**.

#### 2. **Date of the Promissory Note**
- The promissory note must be **dated on the day the advance is made**.

#### 3. **Due Date of Repayment**
- The total amount of an advance (principal plus interest) becomes due and payable on the **maturity date** of the promissory note.

#### 4. **Interest on Advances**
- Interest accrues from the **date of the advance** until the full amount (principal + interest) is repaid.
- The **annual interest rate** is set by the Minister at the time the advance is made.
- Interest is **calculated and compounded semi-annually** (every six months).

#### 5. **Interest on Overdue Amounts**
- If principal or interest is **overdue**, it shall bear interest at the **same rate** established under paragraph (d) of the relevant section (presumably the rate set by the Minister) until the amount is fully paid.

#### 6. **Prepayments**
- The Commission may make **prepayments** of principal and accrued interest on an advance.
- Such prepayments are **only permitted with the prior concurrence (approval)** of the Minister of Finance.
- Prepayments must be made in accordance with the terms of the Regulations.

#### 7. **Application of Payments**
- Payments made by the Commission are applied in a **specific order**:
  1. **First**, to pay interest accrued on the **earliest advance**.
  2. **Second**, to reduce the **principal** of that same advance.
  3. Then, similarly, to the next advance in the **chronological order** of when it was made.

> This ensures that older advances are prioritized in terms of interest and principal repayment, maintaining a fair and orderly repayment sequence.

### **Commission’s Acknowledgement and Promise to Repay**

The Commission formally acknowledges and commits to the following:

- An advance of **a specified amount** has been made to the Unemployment Insurance Account from the Consolidated Revenue Fund on a specific date (e.g., "on [date]").
- The Commission promises to repay the advance **on or before a specified maturity date**.
- Interest will be charged on the **unpaid principal** at an annual rate of **[X]%**, calculated from the date of the advance and compounded semi-annually.
- Interest will also accrue on any **overdue principal or interest** at the same rate.
- The Commission may make **prepayments** at any time, subject to:
  - The **approval of the Minister of Finance**.
  - Compliance with the terms of the Regulations.

### **Waiver of Rights**

The Commission **waives** the following rights:
- **Presentment** (the requirement to formally demand payment).
- **Demand** (the need to be formally asked to pay).
- **Protest** (the right to object or challenge a payment).
- **Notice of any kind** (the requirement to give prior notice before enforcement).

> This waiver simplifies enforcement and ensures that the Minister or Commission can proceed with repayment without needing to issue formal notices or protests, enhancing administrative efficiency.
