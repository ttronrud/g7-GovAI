## 📌 IV. Contribution Calculation Rules

### A. Base and First Additional Contributions (for qualifying payments)

- **Qualifying Payment**: Portion of remuneration that is ordinary remuneration from pensionable employment.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Contribution} = (\text{Payment} - \text{Basic Exemption}) \times (\text{Base Rate} + \text{First Additional Rate})
  $$
- **Rounding Rule**: Rounded to nearest $0.01; if equidistant, rounded **up**.

> Example: If an employee earns $200 in a pay period with a $14.58 basic exemption, and rates are 9.9% and 1.5%, the contribution is calculated accordingly.

---

### B. Basic Exemption Amounts (by payment frequency)

| Payment Frequency | Basic Exemption |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Hourly | $1.75 |
| Daily | $14.58 |
| Weekly | $67.30 |
| Bi-weekly | $134.61 |
| Quadri-weekly | $269.23 |
| Semi-monthly | $145.83 |
| Monthly | $291.66 |
| Quarterly | $875 |
| Semi-annually | $1,750 |
| Annually | $3,500 |

> Special cases:
> - For employees paid only for 10 months/year:
>   - 22 payments → $159.09
>   - Semi-monthly → $175
>   - Monthly → $350
> - Otherwise: greater of:
>   - ($3,500 × (days in period / 365))
>   - $67.30

> ⚠️ **Adjustment for 27 bi-weekly or 53 weekly periods**:
> - Add to each pay period:  
>   $$
>   \left(\frac{\text{Annual Basic Exemption}}{27 \text{ or } 53}\right) \times (\text{Base Rate} + \text{First Additional Rate})
>   $$
> - This adjustment ensures fairer distribution of contributions across more frequent pay periods.

---

### C. Minimum Contribution Rule

- If a payment exceeds the basic exemption for the pay period, **at least $0.01** must be deducted as contribution.

---

### D. Annual Contribution Caps

- Total base and first additional contributions **cannot exceed**:
  - Year’s maximum base contribution + year’s maximum first additional contribution.

---

## 🚀 V. Second Additional Contribution (for high earners)

- **Applies only when**:
  $$
  \text{Payment} > \text{Total remuneration to date} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{Total remuneration} > \text{Max Pensionable Earnings}
  $$
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Second Additional Contribution} = (\text{Payment} - \text{Total Remuneration to Date}) \times \text{Second Additional Rate}
  $$
  (Only if result > 0)

> This is designed to capture contributions from **high-income earners** who exceed the standard pensionable earnings limit.

- **Annual cap**: Total second additional contributions **cannot exceed** the year’s maximum second additional contribution.

---

## 🔁 VI. Coordination with Provincial Pension Plans

To avoid **double contribution**, the CPP adjusts contributions when employees already contribute under provincial plans.

### A. For Base & First Additional Contributions:
- The employee’s CPP contribution **cannot exceed**:
  $$
  (\text{Max Base + Max First Additional}) - (\text{Previous contributions under provincial plan})
  $$
- Adjustment factor:  
  $$
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{CPP Rate (base + first)}}{\text{Provincial Plan Rate (base + first)}}
  $$

> So if a provincial plan has a lower rate, the CPP contribution is reduced proportionally.

### B. For Second Additional Contributions:
- Similarly, the CPP contribution **cannot exceed**:
  $$
  \text{Max Second Additional} - (\text{Previous provincial contributions})
  $$
- Adjustment factor:  
  $$
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{CPP Second Rate}}{\text{Provincial Second Rate}}
  $$

## 💼 VII. Employer Remittance Rules

- **General Rule**:  
  Employer must remit employee and employer contributions to the **Receiver General** **on or before the 15th day of the following month** after paying remuneration.

> Example: Remuneration paid in May → remittance due by June 15.

### Exception for Large Employers (Average Monthly Withholding ≥ $25,000)

- **If average monthly withholding ≥ $25,
