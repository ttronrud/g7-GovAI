**Detailed Summary of the Additional Legislative Powers Designation Order**

**Order Title:**  
*Additional Legislative Powers Designation Order*

**Purpose and Scope:**  
This regulation serves to expand the legislative authority of the Commissioner in Council of the Northwest Territories by designating specific administrative actions as matters within the Commissioner’s power to regulate through Ordinances.

**Key Provision:**  
The Order explicitly designates the following activities as matters "in relation to which the Commissioner in Council of the Northwest Territories may make Ordinances":

1. **The making of grants and loans to individuals**  
2. **The making of loans to persons**

This means that the Commissioner in Council is empowered to create and issue statutory regulations (ordinances) governing the conditions, criteria, eligibility, procedures, and administrative frameworks under which grants and loans are provided to individuals and to other persons.

**Implications of the Designation:**

- **Legislative Authority:** The Commissioner in Council is granted the authority to legislate on these matters without requiring a full legislative act (such as a bill passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories). This allows for more flexible, responsive, and timely regulation of financial assistance programs.

- **Scope of Application:** The designation applies broadly to both individual recipients and other persons (which may include organizations, Indigenous communities, or other entities), enabling the Commissioner to tailor loan and grant programs to meet regional needs, priorities, or economic conditions.

- **Regulatory Flexibility:** By allowing ordinance-making power, the government can adapt policies to changing circumstances—such as economic downturns, infrastructure needs, or community development goals—without lengthy legislative processes.

- **Administrative Oversight:** The Commissioner in Council can establish rules on matters such as:
  - Eligibility requirements
  - Application procedures
  - Interest rates or repayment terms (where applicable)
  - Funding allocations
  - Reporting and accountability mechanisms

- **Legal Effect:** Any ordinance made under this Order will have the force of law within the Northwest Territories and will be enforceable in accordance with territorial laws and constitutional principles.

**Limitations and Context:**  
While this Order grants significant administrative power, it does not authorize the Commissioner to:
- Create loans or grants without a clear policy framework or funding source
- Override existing legislation or constitutional rights
- Make decisions that are arbitrary or capricious (subject to administrative law principles)

The power is exercised within the broader framework of territorial governance and is subject to oversight, transparency, and accountability mechanisms as required by law.

**Citation:**  
The Order may be cited as the *Additional Legislative Powers Designation Order*.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order enhances the Northwest Territories’ capacity to manage financial assistance programs by empowering the Commissioner in Council to issue ordinances governing the provision of grants and loans. It provides a streamlined, responsive mechanism for delivering targeted support to individuals and persons, aligning with the territorial government’s role in promoting economic development, social equity, and community well-being.
