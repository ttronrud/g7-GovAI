### What This Means:

The specific regulation that was previously in force and referenced by "SOR/2017-84, s. 1" no longer exists. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the repeal order. This means:

2. **No current legal effect**: Any prior provisions, requirements, or obligations derived from it are now void.
3. **Replacement or successor**: There is no indication that a new regulation replaced it — the repeal implies it was either obsolete, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or policy.

   - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
   - It was redundant due to the enactment of a more comprehensive or modern law.
   - It conflicted with other legislation.
   - It was deemed unnecessary or inefficient.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated listing of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggests that the original regulation may have been cited in multiple places (e.g., in a legal database or policy document) and was identified as being repealed by the same instrument.
- SOR/2017-84 is a **repeal order**, not a new regulation. Its purpose is to remove outdated or obsolete provisions from the law.
