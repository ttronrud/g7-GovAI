- A **remission of up to $256,000** is granted to the **Lacroix Trustee**.
- This amount represents the **estimated bankruptcy dividend** that would have been payable to creditors (including the government) for **taxes owed by Vincent Lacroix in the 2005 taxation year** under **Part I of the Income Tax Act**.

---

#### **5. Conditions for Remission**

The remission is subject to the following **seven key conditions**:

1. **Claim for Misappropriation Must Be Filed**  
   The **liquidator** or the **Groupe Norbourg Trustee** must file a claim in the bankruptcy of Vincent Lacroix alleging that funds were **misappropriated** from investments and securities managed by Groupe Norbourg.

2. **Claim Must Be Validated**  
   The **Lacroix Trustee must accept** the validity of this claim, either directly or by agreeing that it will be recognized as valid by a **tribunal** (court).

3. **Claim Cannot Be Fully Settled**  
   At the time of distribution, the **assets of Vincent Lacroix’s bankruptcy estate must not be sufficient** to fully settle the claim filed by the liquidator or Groupe Norbourg Trustee. This ensures that the remitted funds are not redundant and are used to supplement the estate’s limited resources.

4. **Funds Must Be Remitted to the Liquidator**  
   In accordance with instructions from the **Crown (federal government)**, the **Lacroix Trustee must remit** the $256,000 dividend amount to the **liquidator**.

5. **Liquidator Must Accept and Distribute**  
   The **liquidator must accept the amount** and distribute it to investors **in accordance with directives from the tribunal** having jurisdiction over the matter.

6. **Remaining Funds Must Be Returned to the Crown**  
   Once **all investor claims have been fully satisfied**, any **remaining balance** of the $256,000 must be **returned to the Crown as soon as possible**.

7. **Reporting and Accountability Requirements**  
   - Upon request from the **Crown**, the **liquidator must provide a final report** detailing how the funds were distributed to investors.
   - The **Crown is not liable** for any administrative or legal fees incurred in determining or distributing the amounts.
   - The **Crown retains the right** to require any **investor to repay** any amount they received under this order **if the total compensation exceeds the actual claim** of that investor.

#### **7. Public Interest Justification**

The Order is justified on the grounds that:
- The **mismanagement and misappropriation** of funds by Vincent Lacroix and his affiliated companies led to significant losses for investors.
- The bankruptcy process was already constrained by limited assets, and the remission allows for **fairer compensation** to investors without overburdening the bankruptcy estate.
- The government, through the Crown, is acting in the **public interest** to ensure accountability and to prevent further harm to investors in similar cases.

---

#### **8. Key Legal and Ethical Implications**

- **Balance of Rights**: The order protects investor interests while respecting the obligations of bankruptcy trustees and the integrity of the bankruptcy system.
- **Prevention of Double Recovery**: The requirement that any surplus be returned to the Crown prevents investors from receiving more than their legitimate claim.
- **Transparency and Oversight**: The mandatory final report and the Crown’s right to request repayment ensure accountability and transparency in the distribution process.

---

#### **9. Conclusion**

This **Remission Order** is a targeted, legally grounded intervention designed to:
- Provide **partial compensation** to investors in the Norbourg and Evolution funds who suffered losses due to the bankruptcy and mismanagement of Vincent Lacroix.
- Enable a **structured, accountable process** for distributing funds to investors while ensuring that the bankruptcy estate remains properly managed and that public funds are not improperly used.
- Uphold the principles of **fairness, transparency, and public interest** within the framework of Canadian bankruptcy and tax law.

It reflects a nuanced approach to resolving investor claims in cases of financial misconduct, balancing the need for justice with fiscal responsibility.
