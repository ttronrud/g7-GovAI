**Detailed Summary of the Specified Crown Agents (GST) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The *Specified Crown Agents (GST) Regulations* were issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This action is grounded in two key provisions of the **Excise Tax Act**:

- **Subsection 123(1)**: Defines the term *"specified Crown agent"* — a category of Crown entities that are subject to specific tax treatment under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.
- **Section 277b**: Provides the legal basis for designating certain Crown agents as "specified Crown agents" for GST purposes.

These regulations serve to **formally identify and list** which entities are considered *specified Crown agents* for the purposes of the GST, thereby determining their tax obligations and exemptions under Canadian tax law.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **clarify which Crown agencies are classified as "specified Crown agents"** under subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act. This classification has significant implications for **GST registration, tax liability, and compliance**, particularly in relation to whether these entities are exempt from GST or are treated as taxable suppliers.

By specifying which entities qualify, the regulations ensure consistent application of GST rules across government-operated institutions and avoid ambiguity in tax treatment.

### **List of Specified Crown Agents**

The following entities are explicitly designated as **specified Crown agents** under the regulations:

1. **The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)**  
   – A national public broadcaster responsible for producing and distributing news, entertainment, and educational programming.

2. **Telefilm Canada**  
   – A federal agency that supports and promotes Canadian film and television production through funding, development, and distribution.

3. **The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB)**  
   – A government-owned organization that manages the marketing and sale of Canadian wheat and grain. It plays a key role in ensuring stable grain prices and market access for Canadian farmers.

4. **The Bank of Canada**  
   – Canada’s central bank, responsible for monetary policy, financial stability, and issuing currency.

5. **Every agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada that is included in Schedule III to the Financial Administration Act**  
   – This provision broadly includes all Crown agencies or departments listed in **Schedule III** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA).  
   – Schedule III contains a comprehensive list of federal government agencies and departments (e.g., Health Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, etc.) that are designated as "Crown agents" for administrative and financial purposes.  
   – This clause ensures that **all such entities** are automatically considered specified Crown agents under the GST regime.

6. **Every agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada that is a subsidiary of a corporation referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (e)**  
   – This clause refers to a list of specific corporations (paras. a to e) — though the full list is not provided in the excerpt — which are designated in the *Financial Administration Act* or related legislation.  
   – Any **subsidiary** of such a corporation is also considered a specified Crown agent.  
   – This provision extends the scope to **indirect Crown entities**, such as government-owned subsidiaries, ensuring that even entities not directly listed in Schedule III may qualify if they are part of a Crown-controlled corporate structure.

> ⚠️ *Note: The exact list of corporations referenced in paragraphs (a) to (e) would be found in the Financial Administration Act, but it is not included in the provided text.*

### **Effective Dates (Coming Into Force)**

The regulations are not effective immediately. Their implementation is phased, with different sections coming into force on different dates:

- **General Regulation (Section 1)**:  
  Deemed to have come into force on **December 31, 1990**.  
  → This establishes the foundational definition and list of specified Crown agents.

- **Section 2**:  
  Deemed to have come into force on **April 1, 1997**.  
  → Likely relates to amendments or updates to the definition or application of the rules (e.g., changes in tax treatment, compliance requirements, or administrative procedures).

- **Section 3**:  
  Deemed to have come into force on **February 27, 1991**.  
  → Likely pertains to specific operational or procedural changes, possibly related to reporting, registration, or record-keeping obligations for specified Crown agents.

> ⚠️ *Note: The exact content of Sections 2 and 3 is not provided in the excerpt, but their phased implementation suggests that the rules were refined or clarified over time in response to evolving administrative or fiscal needs.*

---

### **Amendments and Repeals**

- **[Amendment]**: Indicates that the regulations may have been updated at a later date (not detailed here).  
- **[Repeal]**: Indicates that any prior versions or overlapping provisions have been formally revoked or replaced.

This structure ensures that the regulations remain current and aligned with changes in federal governance, tax policy, or financial administration.

### **Key Implications for Taxation and Compliance**

1. **GST Exemption or Special Treatment**:  
   Specified Crown agents are generally **exempt from GST** on certain supplies, particularly those made in the course of their public service functions. However, they may still be subject to GST on non-exempt supplies or when acting as private entities.

2. **Compliance Obligations**:  
   These entities must maintain proper records and may be subject to audit or reporting requirements to demonstrate compliance with the exemption criteria.

3. **Administrative Clarity**:  
   By clearly defining which Crown agencies are included, the regulations reduce uncertainty for tax authorities, auditors, and government departments.

4. **Interconnection with Financial Administration Act**:  
   The reliance on Schedule III of the *Financial Administration Act* ensures that the list of Crown agents is aligned with official government structures and administrative classifications.

### **Conclusion**

The *Specified Crown Agents (GST) Regulations* provide a clear, legally binding framework for identifying which Crown entities are subject to special GST treatment under the Excise Tax Act. By including major public institutions like CBC, Telefilm Canada, and the Bank of Canada, and extending coverage to all Crown agents listed in Schedule III and certain subsidiaries, the regulations ensure consistent and equitable application of GST rules across the federal government.

The phased implementation reflects a deliberate approach to integrating these rules into existing administrative and fiscal systems, allowing time for departments to adjust their operations and compliance procedures.
