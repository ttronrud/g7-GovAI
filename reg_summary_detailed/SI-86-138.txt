**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acts on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board, under the authority granted by **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Revocation of Prior Order**:
   - The regulation formally **revokes** the previous *Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order* issued on **June 27, 1972**, under **Order in Council P.C. 1972-1/1430**.
   - This prior order had established a framework for setting and enforcing fees for animal blood typing services.
   - By revoking this 1972 order, the government effectively removes the previous fee structure and any associated fee prescriptions that were in place at that time.

2. **Authorization of New Fee Prescriptions**:
   - The current regulation **authorizes the Minister of Agriculture** to issue new orders prescribing fees for services related to **animal blood typing**.
   - Specifically, the Minister is empowered to determine and set the **fee to be charged to individuals or entities** who request blood typing of animals.
   - This authority allows the Minister to adjust fees based on current costs, market conditions, administrative needs, or policy objectives, ensuring that pricing remains appropriate and sustainable.

3. **Legal Basis**:
   - The power to revoke and reauthorize fee prescriptions is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**.
   - This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on ministerial recommendations) the authority to make or amend fee-related orders, particularly where such fees are tied to government-administered services or programs.

4. **Purpose and Implication**:
   - The revocation and reauthorization signal a **review or update** of the animal blood typing fee policy.
   - It enables the government to reassess the financial model for animal blood typing services, which may be critical for animal health, disease control (e.g., bovine tuberculosis or other infectious diseases), breeding programs, or food safety initiatives.
   - It provides a mechanism for **flexibility and responsiveness** in fee setting, allowing the Minister to adapt fees to current economic or operational realities.

5. **Effective Date and Implementation**:
   - While the specific effective date is not included in the excerpt, such regulations typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon the Minister’s issuance of a new fee order.
   - The new fee structure will be implemented through future **Orders in Council** issued by the Minister of Agriculture, which will be subject to public notice and potentially consultation.

**In Summary:**

This regulation removes the outdated 1972 fee order for animal blood typing and grants the Minister of Agriculture the authority to establish new, current, and appropriate fees for such services. It reflects a modernization of the fee-setting process under the Financial Administration Act, ensuring that animal blood typing services are financially sustainable and responsive to evolving needs in agriculture and animal health.
