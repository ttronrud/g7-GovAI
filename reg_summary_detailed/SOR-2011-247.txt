**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation formally transfers certain portions of the federal public administration within the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** to a new organizational structure. Specifically, it establishes the transfer of specific units and their associated responsibilities, personnel, and functions under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Transfer of Units:**  
   The regulation transfers two specific units within the Canadian Food Inspection Agency:
   - The **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**  
   - The **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

   These units are now reorganized under a new administrative framework, reflecting a shift in operational responsibilities and service delivery within the federal public service.

2. **Applicability of Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act:**  
   Subsection 132(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* applies to all individuals who are employed or engaged in the operations of these two transferred units.  
   This means that the employment terms, conditions, rights, and obligations of staff in these units are governed by the provisions of subsection 132(1), which typically includes:
   - Employment status and classification
   - Terms of service
   - Job security
   - Rights to fair treatment, performance reviews, and disciplinary procedures
   - Procedures for transfers, promotions, or dismissals

   The application of this subsection ensures that employees in these units are protected under the broader public service employment framework, maintaining consistency and fairness in personnel management.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The regulation comes into force on **November 15, 2011**.  
   This date marks when the transfer of the units and the application of subsection 132(1) become legally binding and operational for all affected employees and administrative functions.

**Context and Implications:**

- The transfer of these IT and infrastructure support units suggests a strategic realignment of the CFIA’s internal operations, likely to improve efficiency, modernize IT services, or align with broader government digital transformation goals.
- By placing these units under the public service employment framework, the government ensures that staffing, performance, and accountability standards are consistent with federal public service norms.
- The move may also reflect a broader trend of centralizing or consolidating IT services across federal agencies to enhance interoperability, reduce redundancy, and improve cybersecurity and data management.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal administrative action that reorganizes key IT support functions within the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. It ensures that the employees working in the Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit and its Support Unit are subject to the standard employment protections and governance mechanisms under the Public Service Employment Act. The regulation is effective as of November 15, 2011, and serves as a foundational step in aligning CFIA operations with federal public service standards in personnel management and service delivery.
