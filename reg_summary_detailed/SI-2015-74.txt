**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision of the National Search and Rescue Secretariat**

**Legal Authority and Procedural Background:**

- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which authorizes the transfer of certain functions, responsibilities, and administrative control within the federal public service.
- This transfer is part of a broader governmental reorganization aimed at improving the efficiency, coordination, and effectiveness of public services, particularly in areas related to emergency response and public safety.

**Subject of the Transfer:**

- The **National Search and Rescue Secretariat (NSRS)** — a federal agency responsible for coordinating and managing search and rescue (SAR) operations across Canada.
- The NSRS operates under the broader mandate of ensuring the safety of individuals in emergency situations involving missing persons, natural disasters, aviation accidents, maritime incidents, and other high-risk scenarios.

**Transfer Details:**

- The **control and supervision** of the NSRS are being **transferred from the Department of National Defence (DND)** to the **Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (DPSEP)**.
- This transfer is not merely a change in administrative oversight; it involves a shift in **organizational responsibility, policy direction, and operational accountability**.
- The NSRS remains a federal entity and continues to operate under the same legal and financial framework, but now falls under the jurisdiction of DPSEP, which is responsible for overall public safety, emergency management, and the coordination of national emergency response systems.

**Rationale and Strategic Intent:**

1. **Improved Coordination with Emergency Services:**
   - The NSRS is a critical component of Canada’s emergency response infrastructure. By moving it to DPSEP, the government ensures that search and rescue operations are better integrated with other public safety and emergency management functions (e.g., fire services, police, disaster response, and health services).

2. **Alignment with Public Safety Mandate:**
   - DPSEP’s mandate includes emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. Placing the NSRS under this department ensures that SAR operations are aligned with broader public safety goals and national emergency planning.

3. **Enhanced Inter-Agency Collaboration:**
   - The transfer facilitates better coordination between SAR operations and other emergency services, such as the Canadian Coast Guard, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and provincial emergency management agencies.

4. **Reflects Evolving Government Structure:**
   - This reorganization reflects a shift in how the federal government organizes public safety responsibilities, moving away from a military-centric model (where DND historically oversaw SAR) to a more civilian-focused, public safety-oriented structure.

**Legal and Administrative Implications:**

- The transfer is formalized through statutory authority and does not require new legislation, as it is authorized under existing provisions of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- The NSRS will retain its existing personnel, programs, and operational capabilities, but will now be subject to the policies, funding, and strategic direction of DPSEP.
- The Department of National Defence will no longer have direct oversight or administrative responsibility for the NSRS, though it may still contribute resources or expertise in specific operational contexts (e.g., military SAR support in extreme environments).

**Effective Date and Implementation:**

- The regulation is effective as of the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which is typically within the same year (2003) as the enactment.
- Implementation involves internal administrative adjustments, interdepartmental communication, and potential updates to intergovernmental agreements and operational protocols.

**Relevance to Public Safety and National Resilience:**

- This transfer underscores the federal government’s commitment to strengthening national resilience and ensuring a unified, responsive, and effective emergency management system.
- It supports Canada’s ability to respond rapidly and efficiently to a wide range of emergencies, including natural disasters, accidents, and missing persons incidents.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. By transferring the control and supervision of the National Search and Rescue Secretariat from the Department of National Defence to the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the government enhances the integration of search and rescue operations into the broader national emergency management framework. The move strengthens coordination, improves public safety outcomes, and aligns with modern government priorities focused on civilian-led emergency response and public safety.
