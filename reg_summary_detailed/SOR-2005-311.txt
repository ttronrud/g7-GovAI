Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the regulation you provided, which is part of the *Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Regulations* (S.C. 2005, c. 34), made under section 43 of the *Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act*.

## **Detailed Summary of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 34)**

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of State styled Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development**.
- It is enacted under **Section 43 of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act**.
- The regulation applies to the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (DHRSD)**, although the reference in the text mistakenly or incorrectly names the *Act* as the *Department of Employment and Social Development Act* — this appears to be an error in the original text. The correct Act referenced in the regulation is the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act**.

> ✅ **Clarification**: The regulation is not about the Department of Employment and Social Development (which is a different federal agency), and the reference to "Act" as the Department of Employment and Social Development Act is likely a typographical or administrative error.

### **2. Definition of "Prescribed Individual" (in relation to Public Officer)**

#### **Purpose**:
To define who qualifies as a "public officer" under **subsection 30(1)** of the *Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act*.

A **"prescribed individual"** includes:

- A person whose services are **required by a federal institution**, on a:
  - **Casual or temporary basis**, or
  - Under a **student employment program**.

#### **Implication**:
This definition expands the scope of who may be considered a public officer for regulatory or administrative purposes.

## **Key Themes and Implications**

| Theme | Summary |
|------|--------|
| **Data Sharing Framework** | Establishes a formal, legally grounded framework for inter-agency data sharing within the federal government. |
| **Privacy and Accountability** | While enabling data sharing, the regulation limits disclosures to specific, legitimate purposes and legal frameworks. |
| **Sensitivity of Data** | Includes sensitive information (e.g., pension, veteran status, criminal investigations), requiring strict adherence to legal and ethical standards. |
| **Public Interest Justification** | Disclosures are justified only in relation to law enforcement, administrative compliance, or national security. |
| **Error in Text** | The reference to "Department of Employment and Social Development Act" is likely a typographical or administrative error — the correct Act is the *Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Act*. |

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation is a critical piece of administrative law that:
- Defines who qualifies as a "public officer" in federal institutions,
- Outlines a **clear and structured framework for the sharing of personal and administrative data** among federal departments,
- Ensures that such sharing is **authorized, purpose-limited, and subject to legal oversight**,
- Balances the need for **inter-agency cooperation** with **individual privacy and data protection**.

It reflects the Canadian government’s approach to managing sensitive personal information in the context of social programs, law enforcement, and public administration — all within a legal and accountable framework.

---

**Final Note**: This regulation is not a privacy law in itself but rather a **procedural rule** that enables data sharing under existing legislative authority. It
