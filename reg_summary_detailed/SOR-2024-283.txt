### **Detailed Summary of the Preclearance in the United States Regulations (S.C. 2017, c. 27)**

This regulation, issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, amends and adapts the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)** and its associated **Regulations** to apply specifically to **travellers entering Canada through preclearance areas or preclearance perimeters** — primarily located in the United States, such as at **U.S. ports of entry near Canadian border regions** (e.g., at the U.S.-Canada border in places like Windsor, Toronto, or Vancouver).

The purpose of these amendments is to **ensure consistent immigration and border control processes** for individuals entering Canada via **preclearance arrangements**, where **customs and immigration officers conduct screening before the traveller reaches Canadian territory**, thus reducing delays and improving border security.

## **1. Grounds of Inadmissibility (Under Subsection 48(4) of the Preclearance Act, 2016)**

The regulation specifies **which grounds of inadmissibility** apply to different categories of travellers entering Canada through a **preclearance area or perimeter**:

| Category | Grounds of Inadmissibility |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Permanent Resident** | Sections 34, 35, subsection 36(1), and section 37 of the IRPA |
| **Protected Person** (under IRPA) | Sections 34 to 35.1, subsection 36(1), and section 37 of IRPA |
| **Foreign National with Permanent Resident Visa** | Sections 34 to 35.1, subsection 36(1), and section 37 of IRPA |
| **Foreign National with Permanent Resident Visa + Family Member inadmissible** | Sections 34 to 35.1, subsection 36(1), **sections 37 and 42** of IRPA |
| **All Foreign Nationals** | Sections 34 to 42 of IRPA |

> **Key Note**: The inclusion of **section 42** (relating to inadmissibility due to threats to national security or public order) in the last two categories expands the scope of inadmissibility checks for family members and foreign nationals entering via preclearance.

## **2. Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**

To align the law with preclearance operations, several key provisions of the IRPA are **revised or reinterpreted** to reflect that entry occurs **outside of Canada** — in a **preclearance area or perimeter**.

### **Subsection 11(1): Visa and Document Requirements**
> **Amended to**:  
> A foreign national must apply for a **visa or other required document** **before entering Canada or a preclearance area/perimeter**.

> **Purpose**: Ensures all entry requirements are met prior to arrival — reinforcing pre-entry compliance.

---

### **Subsection 11(1.01): Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA)**
> **Amended to**:  
> Despite subsection (1), a foreign national must apply for an **electronic travel authorization (ETA)** via an **electronic system** before entering Canada or a preclearance area/perimeter — **unless regulations allow alternative methods**.

> **Purpose**: Promotes digital compliance and streamlines entry processes, especially for visa-exempt travellers.

---

### **Section 19: Reference to "on their entry"**
> **Reinterpreted**:  
> "On their entry" → **"in a preclearance area or preclearance perimeter"**

> **Purpose**: Clarifies that certain obligations (e.g., reporting, documentation) are triggered upon arrival **within the preclearance zone**, not upon arrival in Canada.

---

### **Paragraph 20(1)(a): "Have come to Canada"**
> **Reinterpreted**:  
> "Have come to Canada" → **"Are coming to Canada through a preclearance area or preclearance perimeter"**

> **Purpose**: Ensures accurate application of rules related to residency, status, and eligibility for benefits.

---

### **Subsection 24(2): "Upon arrival in Canada"**
> **Reinterpreted**:  
> "Upon arrival in Canada" → **"Upon arrival in a preclearance area or preclearance perimeter"**

> **Purpose**: Aligns timing of administrative actions (e.g., processing, inspection) with actual entry point.

---

### **Subsection 31(3): "Outside Canada"**
> **Reinterpreted**:  
> "Outside Canada" → **"Outside a preclearance area or preclearance perimeter"**

> **Purpose**: Defines jurisdictional boundaries for certain legal provisions (e.g., reporting obligations, travel restrictions).

---

## **3. Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations**

---

### **"Enters Canada" or "Entering Canada" → "Enters Canada through a preclearance area or perimeter"**
Applies to:
- The portion of **subsection 184(2)** before paragraph (b)

## **4. Provisions That Do Not Apply in Preclearance Areas/Perimeters**

Certain rules in the IRPR are **exempted** from application in preclearance zones:

- **Paragraphs 38(b) to (h)**  
- **Paragraph 41(c)**  
- **Subsection 188(2)**  

> **Purpose**: These provisions may relate to specific immigration or customs requirements that are **not practical or necessary** in the preclearance context (e.g., certain family reunification rules or specific reporting obligations). Exempting them avoids unnecessary administrative burden and ensures operational feasibility.

---

## **5. Application of Other Regulations (Alcohol, Settlers, etc.)**

### **Returning Persons Exemption Regulations (paragraph 3(2)(a))**
