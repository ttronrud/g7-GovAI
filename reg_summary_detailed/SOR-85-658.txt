**Detailed Summary of the Northern Transportation Company Limited Exemption and Transfer Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
This Order is issued under the authority of **subsection 3(3)** of the *Northern Transportation Company Limited Disposal Authorization Act* (the "Act"). It serves two primary purposes:

- To **exempt specific property, rights, or interests** from the mandatory disposal provisions of **subsection 3(2)** of the Act, which generally requires the disposal of assets held by Northern Transportation Company Limited (NTCL).
- To **transfer control, management, and administration** of certain designated assets to designated government entities.

The Order may be cited as:  
**The Northern Transportation Company Limited Exemption and Transfer Order**.

### **2. Scope of Exemption**
The following property, rights, and interests are **exempt from the application of subsection 3(2)** of the Act:

- All real property, rights, title, and interests in real property:
  - Situated within the **municipal boundaries of Fort McMurray, Alberta**;
  - Registered in the name of **Northern Transportation Company Limited** in the **Land Titles Office of the North Alberta Land Registration District**;
  - **Except** for a specific portion of **Lot 1 in Block 2 on Plan 3359 T.R. (R.L.S. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Fort McMurray)**, which is explicitly excluded from exemption.

- All real property, rights, title, and interests in real property that are **not registered in the name of NTCL** in any public land registry or land titles office.

> **Note**: This exemption effectively shields these assets from being disposed of under the Act’s general disposal requirements, allowing them to remain under the ownership or control of NTCL or its successors for administrative, operational, or strategic reasons.

### **3. Transfer of Control, Management, and Administration**

The Order transfers control, management, and administration of certain specified assets to the following government bodies:

#### **A. To the Minister of Public Works**
- The property, rights, and interests listed in **Items 1 to 4 of Part I of the Schedule** are transferred to the **Minister of Public Works**.

#### **B. To the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)**
- The property, rights, and interests listed in **Items 5 to 8 of Part I of the Schedule** are transferred to the **Canadian Commercial Corporation**.

### **5. Key Implications and Rationale**

- **Preservation of Critical Infrastructure**: The Order ensures that key assets—especially those supporting Arctic operations, defense logistics, or access to remote communities—remain in place and are not subject to disposal.
  
- **Continuity of U.S.-Canada Defense Cooperation**: The inclusion of long-standing agreements with the U.S. Air Force (dating back to 1957 and 1985) reflects the importance of maintaining bilateral defense logistics, particularly in the Canadian Arctic.

- **Operational and Strategic Value**: Assets such as the lightering vessel, tank farm, and trucks are essential for maintaining supply chains in isolated areas where transportation is difficult or costly.

- **Exemption from Disposal Provisions**: By exempting these assets from subsection 3(2), the government avoids the need to sell or otherwise dispose of them, preserving their value and functionality.

- **Transfer to Appropriate Entities**:
  - The **Minister of Public Works** is responsible for managing public infrastructure and transportation assets.
  - The **Canadian Commercial Corporation** is better positioned to manage commercial or operational equipment, especially those used in logistics or remote service delivery.
