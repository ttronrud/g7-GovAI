**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Access to Information Act Heads of Government Institutions Designation Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 3.2(2)a of the Access to Information Act** (A-1, R.S.). Specifically, it is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Justice**. This means the Governor General formally enacts the order based on advice from the Minister responsible for justice and access to information.

The legal foundation for this designation is found in **S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 142**, which authorizes the designation of individuals as heads of government institutions for the purposes of the Access to Information Act. This provision enables the government to clearly identify who is responsible for overseeing the institution’s access to information obligations.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **designate specific individuals as the heads of government institutions** under the Access to Information Act. This designation is critical because:

- It establishes **legal accountability** for the institution’s compliance with access to information requirements.
- It designates a single point of responsibility for responding to information requests, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
- It ensures that individuals in key positions are formally recognized as having the authority to manage and respond to access requests under the Act.

---

**3. Key Provision**  
The Order designates the **person holding a position listed in Column 2 of the Schedule** as the **head of the government institution listed in Column 1** of the Schedule.  

For example:
- If the institution is the *Ministry of Health*, and the person holding the position of *Minister of Health* is listed, then that individual is formally recognized as the head of the institution under the Act.
- This designation applies **only for the purposes of the Access to Information Act**, meaning it does not necessarily confer other administrative or managerial powers outside of information access and disclosure.

This designation is not automatic; it is made explicitly through the Schedule, which must be attached to the Order and clearly define the institutional structure and leadership roles.

---

**4. Repeal of Prior Order**  
This Order **repeals the previous Access to Information Act Heads of Government Institutions Designation Order (SI/83-113)**. This indicates that the government is updating or replacing an earlier designation to reflect current organizational structures, leadership changes, or policy developments. The repeal ensures that the most current and accurate designations are in effect.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **30th day after the day on which it is made**. This delay provides a transition period to allow for administrative implementation, notification to stakeholders, and compliance with internal procedures.

For instance, if the Order is made on January 1, 2025, it will come into effect on **February 1, 2025**.

---

**6. Scope and Limitations**  
- The designation applies **only under the Access to Information Act** and does not extend to other legislative or administrative functions.
- The head of the institution is responsible for ensuring that the institution complies with the Act, including receiving and responding to information requests, maintaining records, and protecting privacy rights.
- The designation does not imply that the individual has broader executive or managerial authority over the institution outside of information access matters.

---

**7. Importance and Implications**  
This Order strengthens the transparency and accountability framework of the Access to Information Act by:

- Clarifying institutional leadership for information access purposes.
- Ensuring that the public and requesters can identify who is responsible for responding to access requests.
- Supporting the government’s commitment to openness and public accountability.

It also supports the effective operation of the Act by reducing ambiguity in responsibility and improving the consistency and reliability of information disclosure processes.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a formal, legally binding designation that assigns responsibility for access to information within government institutions. It reflects the current organizational structure and leadership, replaces outdated designations, and ensures compliance with the Access to Information Act. By clearly identifying heads of institutions, it enhances transparency, accountability, and public trust in government operations.
