**Citation:** S.C. 1986, c. 1  
**Date of Issuance:** July 14, 1986

### **Purpose of the Order**

This regulation establishes a formal delegation of certain powers from the **Minister of National Revenue** to designated officers under the *Customs Act*. It enables administrative efficiency by allowing authorized officers to exercise specific powers that were originally granted to the Minister, without requiring direct ministerial intervention in routine matters.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **Section 134 of the Customs Act**. This section authorizes the Minister of National Revenue to delegate certain powers to officers of the Department of National Revenue (now the Canada Revenue Agency, CRA) when such delegation is in the public interest and consistent with the Act’s objectives.

The powers being delegated are those conferred by **Sections 131 to 133** of the *Customs Act*, which relate to the administration and enforcement of customs laws, including:

- The power to investigate and examine goods entering or leaving Canada;
- The power to issue and enforce compliance orders;
- The power to conduct inspections and audits of customs operations;
- The power to take enforcement actions, including the seizure of goods or assets in violation of customs regulations.

### **Scope of Delegation**

The officers named in the **Schedule** to this Order are granted the full range of powers specified in Sections 131 to 133 of the *Customs Act*. These powers include, but are not limited to:

- Conducting investigations and inspections of goods, shipments, or commercial activities;
- Issuing notices, orders, or directives to persons involved in customs transactions;
- Taking enforcement actions, including the seizure or forfeiture of goods;
- Collecting information from individuals or entities;
- Making decisions regarding compliance with customs laws and regulations.

Importantly, the delegation **does not extend** to the powers explicitly excluded from the delegation by the Order’s effective date condition — namely, the provisions in the *Customs Act* that are specifically omitted:

- **Paragraph 99(1)(b)** – Likely relates to certain types of exemptions or special authorizations.
- **Subsections 99(2) to (4)** – May involve specific administrative or procedural rules concerning the handling of certain goods or exceptions.
- **Sections 192 to 194** – These sections typically pertain to the powers of the Minister in relation to the granting of licenses, permits, or special authorizations (e.g., for bonded storage, export controls, or temporary imports).

These excluded provisions remain under the direct authority of the Minister of National Revenue and are not delegated.

### **Effective Date**

The Order becomes effective on the day the *Customs Act* (excluding the specified sections) comes into force. This means that the delegation of powers begins only after the rest of the Act is in operation, ensuring that the framework for customs enforcement is fully operational before delegation takes effect.

This timing is critical because it ensures that the delegated powers operate within a legal and procedural context that is already established and in force.

### **Key Features and Implications**

1. **Administrative Efficiency:**  
   By delegating powers to officers, the government streamlines customs enforcement, allowing frontline officers to act more independently and promptly in response to violations or compliance issues.

2. **Accountability and Oversight:**  
   While the powers are delegated, the Minister retains ultimate responsibility for the exercise of these powers. Officers must act within the scope of the delegation and remain subject to supervision, review, and accountability mechanisms.

3. **Clarity and Transparency:**  
   The inclusion of a **Schedule** naming the specific officers who are authorized to exercise these powers ensures transparency and clarity about who has the authority to act in customs enforcement matters.

4. **Legal Limitations:**  
   The exclusion of specific provisions (99(1)(b), 99(2)–(4), 192–194) ensures that certain high-level or sensitive decisions — such as granting exemptions or special licenses — remain under ministerial control, preserving oversight in areas requiring greater discretion or policy judgment.

### **Conclusion**

The *Delegation of Powers (Customs) Order* of 1986 is a foundational administrative instrument that enables the Minister of National Revenue to delegate operational enforcement powers to designated officers under Sections 131 to 133 of the *Customs Act*. This enhances the capacity of customs authorities to enforce compliance, conduct investigations, and respond to violations efficiently. However, the delegation is carefully limited to avoid extending authority to areas requiring direct ministerial discretion, particularly in matters involving exemptions, special authorizations, or complex licensing decisions.

This Order remains a key component of Canada’s customs enforcement framework and reflects a balance between operational efficiency and legal accountability.
