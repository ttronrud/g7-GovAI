### **3. Context and Background**
- The *Cannabis Act* received Royal Assent on June 20, 2018, and came into force on July 17, 2018.
- The Act legally legalized the cultivation, sale, and use of cannabis in Canada for both medical and non-medical (recreational) purposes.
- The initial regulatory framework (Order P.C. 2018-1417) was intended to establish the operational structure of the Cannabis Regulatory Agency (CRA) and set out the rules for licensing, compliance, and oversight.
- The repeal and re-designation in SI/2018-103 represent a **refinement or reorganization** of that initial structure, likely to improve clarity, accountability, or operational efficiency.

- By designating the Minister of Health, the government ensures that cannabis regulation is integrated into broader public health policy, enabling coordination with health agencies, monitoring of public health impacts, and the development of health-based guidelines (e.g., age restrictions, product safety, advertising standards).

### **5. Key Takeaway**
This Statutory Instrument (SI/2018-103) serves as a **critical administrative step** in the implementation of the *Cannabis Act*. It:
- Removes the previous regulatory order (P.C. 2018-1417), signaling a policy update or correction.
