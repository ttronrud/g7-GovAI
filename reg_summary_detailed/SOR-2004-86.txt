## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Edmonton Garrison Heliport Zoning Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Enactment Context**

- **Governing Legislation**: The regulations are made under **section 5.4(2)(b)a** of the *Aeronautics Act* (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1).
- **Public Consultation Requirement**: Pursuant to **subsection 5.5(1)a**, a copy of the proposed regulations was published:
  - In **two successive issues of a local newspaper** (March 28–29, 2002),
  - In **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette, Part I** (March 30–April 6, 2002).
- This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** to submit written representations to the **Minister of National Defence**.
- After review, the regulations were **approved and enacted** by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister.

> ✅ This ensures transparency, public participation, and adherence to procedural requirements under Canadian environmental and aviation law.

### 🏢 **Definition of Key Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Heliport** | Refers specifically to the *Edmonton Garrison Heliport*, located in the Municipal District of Sturgeon, Province of Alberta. |
| **Heliport Zoning Reference Point** | A fixed point at **677 meters above sea level**, located at the intersection of the centerlines of runways 11–29 and 02–20. This serves as a central reference for all spatial measurements. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from the heliport boundary or runway ends, designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by preventing obstructions. |
| **Bird Hazard Area** | A defined zone adjacent to or near the heliport, whose outer limits are specified in **Part 5 of the Schedule**. This area is critical for minimizing bird-related aviation risks. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the heliport designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Includes runways and adjacent safety zones. |
| **Plan** | The official Department of Public Works and Government Services Plan, *Edmonton Garrison Heliport, No. E.3104*, dated December 31, 2001. All spatial descriptions are referenced to this plan. |

---

### 📍 **Geographic Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the heliport**, excluding land that forms part of the heliport itself.
- The outer limits of these lands are defined in **Part 4 of the Schedule**.
- This includes **public road allowances** and surrounding private properties.

> 🚨 **Purpose**: To protect the safe operation of the heliport by preventing obstructions and hazards that could interfere with aircraft operations.

---

## 🚫 **Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

### 1. **Building and Structure Prohibitions**
> *No person may place, erect, construct, or permit the construction of any building, structure, or object* on regulated lands **if**:
- The **highest point** of the structure exceeds the elevation of the **approach surface** at the location of the structure.

> ⚠️ **Natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, mounds) is also regulated:
- No owner or lessee may allow **natural growth** to exceed the elevation of the **approach surface** directly above the land.

> 💡 *Rationale*: Prevents visual or physical interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

### 2. **Interference with Aeronautical Communications**
> No use of land may cause interference with:
- Aeronautical radio frequencies,
- Navigation systems,
- Communication signals.

> 📡 *Purpose*: Ensures uninterrupted and safe air traffic control and flight operations.

---

### 3. **Bird Hazard Restrictions (Environmental Protection)**

To reduce bird activity and associated collision risks, the following uses are **prohibited** in the **bird hazard area** (defined in Part 5 of the Schedule), **except where specifically allowed**:

| Prohibited Use | Exception |
|---------------|---------|
| **Sanitary landfill** | Only permitted on lands listed in **Division 1 of Part 6** of the Schedule |
| **Food garbage disposal** | Prohibited entirely (no exceptions) |
| **Sewage lagoon** | Only permitted on lands listed in **Division 2 of Part 6** |
| **Open water reservoir** | Only permitted on lands listed in **Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 6** |

> 🔍 *Note*: The bird hazard area is a sensitive ecological zone where bird populations may be attracted to food, water, or waste.

---

### 4. **Open Water Reservoirs – Conditional Permissibility**

Under **specific conditions**, open water reservoirs may be used in the bird hazard area:

#### ✅ Permitted Conditions:

| Condition | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Short-term use (≤48 hours)** | No special approval needed — only requires that all reasonable measures are taken to minimize bird hazards. |
| **Long-term use (>48 hours)** | Requires **approval by the appropriate authority** based on reservoir size: |
| - Reservoir size: **>2.5 ha to ≤6 ha** | Approval from the **National Defence Airport and Heliport Zoning Manager** |
| - Reservoir size: **>6 ha** | Approval from the **Minister of National Defence** |
| - Reservoir consists of **dry ponds** | Requires that all reasonable bird hazard mitigation measures are implemented. If used for **more than 48 hours more than once per year**, approval from the **Minister** is required. |

> 🚨 *Purpose*: Balances environmental needs (e.g., water storage, irrigation) with aviation safety by enforcing strict oversight and mitigation.

---

### 5. **Bird Attraction Prohibitions**

> No owner or lessee of lands listed in **Part 7 of the Schedule** may:
- Modify or improve the land in a way that **increases its attractiveness to birds** (e.g., planting dense vegetation, creating wetlands, installing food sources).

> 🚫 Examples of prohibited actions:
- Creating or maintaining ponds,
- Planting grasses or shrubs that attract birds,
- Using open fields for bird feeding.

> ✅ *Goal*: Prevents bird congregation near heliport operations, which could lead to mid-air collisions.

## 📐 **Detailed Descriptions of Key Elements**

### 🔹 Runways and Strips

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 02–20** | 300 m wide (150 m on each side of centerline), 2,192.8 m long |
| **Runway 11–29** | 300 m wide (150 m on each side), 4,387.3 m long |

> These strips are critical for aircraft movement and define the operational boundaries.

### 🔹 Approach Surfaces (Critical Safety Zones)

The approach surfaces are imaginary planes designed to ensure aircraft can approach safely without obstructions. They include:

#### (a) **Main Outer Limit Surface**
- Extends from the heliport boundary outward.
- Starts at **2 meters above general ground level**.
- Rises to a **maximum elevation of 792 m above sea level** at the outer edge.
- Outer boundary is a **circle of radius 5,000 meters** centered on the **heliport zoning reference point**.

#### (b) **End-of-Strip Approach Surfaces**
Each runway end has a unique approach surface with two segments:

1. **Initial Inclined Plane**:
   - Slope: **1:20** (1 meter vertical per 20 meters horizontal)
   - Rises until it meets the outer limit surface (from part a)

2. **Secondary Slope**:
   - Slope: **1:50** (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal)
   - Rises to an **imaginary horizontal line** 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end.

> The final elevation of this horizontal line varies by runway:
- Runway 11 → 379.4 m above end elevation
- Runway 29 → 389 m above end elevation
- Runway 02 → 403.3 m above end elevation
- Runway 20 → 430.9 m above end elevation

> ⚙️ These surfaces ensure that even at long distances, aircraft have a clear path with no obstructions.

### 🔹 Bird Hazard Area Boundary (Perimeter)

The boundary is defined by a **complex, multi-leg survey line** involving:
- Bearings (directions),
- Distances (in meters),
- Intersections with roads, railway rights-of-way, and property lines.

#### Key Features:
- Starts at the **South West corner of runway 11–29 strip**.
- Travels through several townships, ranges, and road allowances.
- Includes a **loop around a circle
