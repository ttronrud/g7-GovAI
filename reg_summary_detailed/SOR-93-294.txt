  - The Minister of National Revenue

  - The Minister of Finance
- **Legal Basis**: Section 21 of the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. 28 (3rd Supp.), s. 289).
- **Purpose**: To **revoke the previous Air Transportation Tax Regulations (C.R.C., c. 583)** and **replace them with updated regulations** governing the air transportation tax in Canada.

> These regulations are now officially known as the **Air Transportation Tax Regulations, 1992**.

---

### 🔹 **Key Definitions**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S. c. 28 (3rd Supp.)), which establishes the framework for excise taxes, including the air transportation tax.
- **"Licence"**: A formal authorization granted by the Minister under Section 17 of the *Excise Tax Act* to an air carrier to operate and be subject to the air transportation tax regime.

---

### 🔹 **Return and Reporting Requirements**
- All licensed air carriers **must submit** their required tax returns under Section 20 of the *Excise Tax Act*.
- The return must be:
  - **Delivered or mailed** to either:
    - The **Chief of Collections**, or
    - The **Chief of Compliance**
    - at the **Regional Excise Office** where the air carrier’s licence was issued.

> This ensures accountability and proper tracking of tax obligations based on location and licensing jurisdiction.

---

### 🔹 **Tax Payment and Ticketing Requirements**
#### 1. **Indication of Canadian Tax on Tickets**
- Any payment made **to a licensed air carrier or its agent** before a passenger boards an aircraft in Canada must:
  - Be clearly **marked and identified as "Canadian tax"** on the ticket.

#### 2. **Submission of Ticket at Emplanement (International Flights)**
- For **international flights**, when a passenger boards at a Canadian airport:
  - The ticket must be **submitted to a person authorized by the emplaning air carrier** to:
    - Accept tickets
    - Allow emplanement
    - Process the flight as described on the ticket

> This requirement ensures that the tax is properly documented and verified at the point of departure in Canada.

---

### 🔹 **Evidence of Prepayment (Under Section 10(2) of the Act)**
For **commercial air services** where the journey begins and ends within Canada:
- **Valid evidence of prepayment** of the air transportation tax must be:
  - A **ticket, boarding pass, or sales invoice**
  - That **clearly indicates the prepayment of tax**
- This evidence must be **submitted at the time of emplanement** to:
  - A **licensed air carrier**, or
  - The **agent of a licensed air carrier**

> This rule ensures that the tax is paid in advance and properly recorded in the tax system.

---

### 🔹 **Exemptions from the Air Transportation Tax (Part II of the Excise Tax Act)**

Certain types of air transportation are **exempt** from the operation of Part II of the *Excise Tax Act*:

1. **Rotary-Wing Aircraft (e.g., helicopters)**  
   - Commercial air services provided by a **certified air carrier** using rotary-wing aircraft are **exempt**.

2. **Fixed-Wing Aircraft with Maximum Certificated Take-Off Weight (MCTOW) ≤ 8,000 kg**  
   - Any fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of **not more than 8,000 kg** is exempt from the air transportation tax when operating commercial air services.

> These exemptions apply only to **commercial services** provided by certified carriers.

---

### 🔹 **Tax Calculation When Transporting Both Persons and Goods**

When an air carrier charges a single fare that includes both:
- Transportation of **passengers**, and
- Transportation of **goods** (excluding personal baggage or equipment),

then the tax is calculated separately.

#### 1. **Amount for Transportation of Persons**
- = Total amount charged for air transportation  
  − Amount attributed to the **transportation of goods**  
  (excluding personal baggage/equipment)

#### 2. **Amount for Transportation of Goods**
- = (Total amount charged for air transportation)  
  × (Percentage of passenger seats that are **unoccupied** during the segment where goods are transported)

> This rule ensures that the tax is applied only to the value attributable to passenger transport, and not to goods being carried — especially when seats are empty.

> Example: If a flight has 100 seats and 20 are unoccupied during a segment, and goods are being transported, the tax on goods is calculated based on 20% of the total fare.

---

### 🔹 **Tax Treatment of Credit-Based Air Travel**

When an air carrier provides air transportation **on credit** (i.e., payment is deferred):
- The **amount payable** is deemed to be paid or payable:
  - **At the place and time** when the air carrier agrees to provide the service.
- This avoids ambiguity in determining when tax liability arises.

> This ensures that tax is triggered at the moment of agreement, not upon actual payment.

---

### 🔹 **Adjustment of U.S. Ad Valorem Air Transportation Taxes**

When an air passenger travels internationally and the **U.S. imposes an ad valorem tax** (a percentage-based tax on the value of the flight), the Canadian air transportation tax on such a flight is **reduced**.

#### Reduction Rules:
| Case | Tax Reduction Amount |
|------|------------------------|
| **After December 31, 1997**, for **emplanements after February 28, 1998** | The **lesser of**: <br> - $2 + 3% of the amount paid or payable <br> - $15 |
| **All other cases** (before the above dates or otherwise) | The **lesser of**: <br> - $4 + 5% of the amount paid or payable <br> - $27.50 |

> This rule ensures that Canadian tax is not applied at full value when a U.S. tax is already imposed, and limits the tax burden through a cap.

> Example:  
> If a flight costs $1,000 and is after the 1997/1998 threshold:  
> - $2 + (3% × $1,000) = $32  
> - $15  
> → The Canadian tax is reduced to **$15**.
