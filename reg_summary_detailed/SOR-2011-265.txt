### **Detailed Summary of the Personal Health Information Custodians in New Brunswick Exemption Order**

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes an **exemption** for certain entities in New Brunswick from the general provisions of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)* — specifically, **Part 1** — when they handle **personal health information**.

The exemption applies **only** to personal health information that is managed under the *Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act (PHIPIAA)*, which is a provincial law enacted in New Brunswick (S.N.B. 2009, c. P-7.05).

#### **2. Legal Basis**
- The Order is made under **paragraph 26(2)(b)** of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*.
- This provision allows the Governor in Council (the federal government's representative) to **exempt certain personal information practices** from Part 1 of PIPEDA **if** they are governed by a **provincial law** that provides a more appropriate or comprehensive privacy framework — specifically, when that provincial law applies to personal health information.

#### **3. Scope of the Exemption**
- The exemption applies to **personal health information custodians** (i.e., organizations or individuals responsible for holding or managing personal health information) that are **subject to the Personal Health Information Privacy and Access Act (PHIPIAA)**.
- The exemption covers the **collection, use, and disclosure** of personal health information that occurs **within the province of New Brunswick**.
- This means that such custodians are **not subject to the strict requirements of Part 1 of PIPEDA** (such as those relating to consent, purpose limitation, accuracy, and access rights) when handling personal health information in the context of health care delivery or management.

#### **4. Key Provisions**
- **Applicability**: The exemption applies **only** to custodians that are covered by the *PHIPIAA* (S.N.B. 2009, c. P-7.05).
- **Exemption Scope**: The exemption specifically protects the **collection, use, and disclosure** of personal health information — all of which occur within New Brunswick.
- **No General Exemption**: The exemption does **not** apply to other types of personal information or to non-health-related activities.
- **Provincial Law Supersedes**: The *PHIPIAA* is considered to be **substantially similar** to Part 1 of PIPEDA in scope and purpose, and thus provides a sufficient and appropriate privacy framework for health information.

#### **5. Regulatory Authority**
- The Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- This reflects a collaborative process where federal and provincial authorities work together to ensure that privacy protections are both effective and aligned with provincial health care needs.

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette* or officially published.
- This is a standard practice in Canadian regulatory law, ensuring that the exemption becomes enforceable once formally adopted.

#### **7. Implications and Significance**
- **Health Sector Flexibility**: Health care providers, hospitals, clinics, and other health-related institutions in New Brunswick can operate under the **provincial health privacy law (PHIPIAA)** rather than the federal PIPEDA framework, allowing for more tailored and practical privacy rules.
- **Consistency with Provincial Jurisdiction**: This ensures that health information privacy is managed in a way that reflects local health system practices, patient expectations, and cultural norms.
- **Compliance Pathway**: Organizations in New Brunswick that manage personal health information must comply with **PHIPIAA**, not PIPEDA, in their day-to-day operations — which simplifies compliance and reduces administrative burden.

#### **8. Limitations**
- The exemption **does not extend** to:
  - Personal information outside of health care.
  - Situations where the information is shared across provincial or federal boundaries without proper safeguards.
  - Violations of the core principles of privacy or patient rights under PHIPIAA.
- The exemption is **conditional** upon the custodian being subject to the *PHIPIAA*.

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a **critical piece of regulatory harmonization** between federal and provincial privacy laws. It recognizes that health information requires a **specialized privacy framework** that is better suited to the unique context of health care delivery. By exempting New Brunswick’s personal health information custodians from Part 1 of PIPEDA, the Order enables a more effective, patient-centered, and practical approach to privacy protection in the province’s health sector — all while maintaining compliance with federal privacy standards through the use of a robust provincial law.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**
| Stakeholder | Key Takeaway |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Healthcare Providers** | Must follow PHIPIAA instead of PIPEDA for health data; benefits from more flexible and relevant rules. |
| **Patients** | Have rights under PHIPIAA (e.g., access, consent, privacy) that are enforced at the provincial level. |
| **Regulators** | The provincial law (PHIPIAA) is now recognized as a valid and sufficient basis for health information privacy. |
| **Federal Government** | Maintains oversight through PIPEDA, but allows provincial laws to govern sensitive health data where appropriate. |

This regulation exemplifies how Canada balances **federal consistency** with **provincial autonomy** in the realm of personal information privacy — particularly in the sensitive area of health data.
