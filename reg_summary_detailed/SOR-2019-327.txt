**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Northern Riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation, known as the *Critical Habitat of the Northern Riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, a federal Canadian law enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29). SARA provides a legal framework for the protection of wildlife species at risk and mandates the identification and protection of their critical habitat—defined as the specific areas required by a species for survival and reproduction.

The Northern Riffleshell (*Epioblasma torulosa rangiana*) is a freshwater bivalve mollusk (a type of mussel) that is classified as **endangered** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate conservation action.

**2. Basis for the Order**

The Order is grounded in several key provisions and facts:

- **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**: A formal recovery strategy for the Northern Riffleshell was developed and includes a detailed description of its **critical habitat**—the specific physical and biological features essential for the species' survival and reproduction. This recovery strategy has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database that documents the status and management plans for species at risk in Canada.

- **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**: Section 58(2)(b) of SARA prohibits the development or alteration of critical habitat in certain areas—specifically, where the habitat is located in a **prohibited zone** (e.g., areas subject to major development or land-use change). However, this Order explicitly states that **no portion of the identified critical habitat** falls within any such prohibited area referenced in subsection 58(2)(b). This is a key legal justification, as it confirms that the critical habitat is not in a zone where development protections would otherwise prevent its designation.

**3. Legal Authority**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) is empowered under **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA to designate and regulate critical habitat for species at risk. These provisions allow the Minister to:

- Identify and designate critical habitat based on scientific recovery strategies;
- Ensure that the designation is consistent with the species’ conservation needs;
- Prohibit or regulate activities that could degrade or destroy critical habitat.

By issuing this Order, the Minister is formally exercising this authority to **legally define and protect** the specific areas essential to the survival of the Northern Riffleshell.

**4. Scope and Content of the Order**

- The Order **officially designates** the critical habitat for the Northern Riffleshell (*Epioblasma torulosa rangiana*), as identified in its recovery strategy and published in the Species at Risk Public Registry.
- The designated areas are **specific geographic locations** (typically defined by coordinates, water bodies, or ecological features) where the mussel relies on conditions such as water quality, substrate type, flow rate, and temperature for survival and reproduction.
- The Order is **annexed** to the regulation, meaning the actual geographic boundaries and features are included as an attachment.

**5. Application of Subsection 58(1)**

Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to all critical habitat designations. This means that once the critical habitat is legally defined in this Order, any activity that would **destroy, degrade, or interfere with** that habitat is subject to regulation under SARA. This includes:

- Construction or alteration of infrastructure (e.g., dams, roads, dredging);
- Pollution or land-use changes that affect water quality;
- Activities that alter stream flow or sediment dynamics.

The Order ensures that these activities are either prohibited or subject to environmental assessment and mitigation measures to prevent harm to the species.

---

**6. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which is typically within a few days of its publication.
- Once registered, it becomes legally binding and enforceable under SARA.
- Enforcement is carried out by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, in coordination with provincial and territorial authorities, through environmental assessments, permits, and compliance monitoring.

**7. Significance and Conservation Implications**

This Order is a significant step in the conservation of the Northern Riffleshell because:

- It provides **formal legal protection** to the specific areas where the species depends on for survival.
- It ensures that future development and land-use planning must take into account the presence of critical habitat.
- It supports the broader recovery strategy by creating a legally enforceable baseline for habitat protection.
- It contributes to the long-term recovery of a species that is both ecologically unique and vulnerable to habitat loss due to pollution, dam construction, and climate change.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Northern Riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana) Order* is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that formally identifies and protects the essential habitat required by an endangered freshwater mussel. By designating these areas and ensuring they are not located in development-prohibited zones, the Order fulfills key obligations under SARA to conserve biodiversity and support species recovery. It represents a critical component of Canada’s commitment to protecting endangered species through science-based, legally enforceable conservation measures.
