## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: S.C. 1986, c. 1**

### 📌 **1. Background and Legal Basis**
- This regulation was **issued by the Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) under:
  - **Section 40(1)** and **paragraph 164(1)(i)** of the *Customs Act*.
- It came into effect upon the coming into force of those provisions in the *Customs Act*.
- A **proposed version** of these regulations was published in *Part I of the Canada Gazette* on **March 15, 1986**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the Minister.
- The regulation was **repealed in 2005** (SOR/2005-384, s. 2), meaning it is **no longer in force** as of that date. However, this summary focuses on its **original content and intent**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: While this regulation was historically significant, it has been **replaced or superseded** by more modern regulations, particularly under the *Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations* and other updated record-keeping rules. The principles it established (e.g., six-year record retention, detailed documentation of imports and sales) remain foundational in Canadian customs policy.

### ✅ Special Requirements for Goods Released Free of Duty or at Reduced Duty

When goods are released **free of duty or at a reduced rate** due to:
- Their **intended use**, or  
- Being intended for a **specific person**,

then the importer must maintain **additional records** for **six years** after importation:

#### Option 1: Goods Released Based on Intended Use
- A **certificate or record signed by the actual user** must be kept, including:
  - User’s name, address, and occupation
  - Clear evidence of the **actual use** made of the goods

#### Option 2: Goods Released Under Tariff Item 9948.00.00
- If the goods were released under **tariff item 9948.00.00** (often related to specific non-commercial or exempt uses), the importer must provide:
  - An **attestation** signed by the importer stating:
    - Name, address, and occupation
    - The **intended use** of the goods
    - Confirmation that the goods fall within the description of that tariff item

#### Option 3: Goods Diverted from Original Use or Sold to Unauthorized Party
- If the goods are **diverted** from their original use or sold to someone **not entitled** to receive them at reduced duty:
  - Records must show that **full applicable duties have been paid**  
    → This ensures compliance and prevents fraud or misuse.

> 💡 Purpose: To verify that the conditions for duty exemption were met and that no duty was improperly avoided.

## 📂 **How Records Must Be Kept**

The regulation sets strict standards for **how records are stored and preserved**:

1. **Accessibility for Audits**  
   → Records must be kept in a **manner enabling detailed audits** by customs officers.  
   → Officers must be able to verify all information used in duty calculations (paid, payable, refunded, or deferred).

2. **Acceptable Formats**
   - **Photographic, microfilm, or electronic imaging** is allowed **if compliant with National Standard CAN/CGSB-72.11-93** (published by the Canadian General Standards Board, November 1993, as amended).
   - **Electronic records** are permitted **if**:
     - They can be **traced back to original source documents**
     - They are stored on **machine-sensible media**
     - The system supports **accessible, readable copies** at any time

> ✅ This ensures flexibility while maintaining integrity and auditability.

## ⚖️ **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

Failure to maintain required records can lead to **loss of preferential tariff treatment** under international trade agreements:

- **Under NAFTA (now USMCA)**  
- **Under CCFTA (Canada-China Free Trade Agreement)**  
- **Under CCRFTA (Canada-Central America Free Trade Agreement)**

### Key Provisions:
- If a person **(not covered under section 3.1)** fails to keep records as required:
  - Preferential tariff treatment **may be denied or withdrawn** for the affected commercial goods.
- If a person **fails to produce records under subsection 43(1)** of the *Customs Act*:
  - Preferential tariff treatment **may also be denied or withdrawn**.

> ⚠️ This is a critical enforcement mechanism — it ties compliance with record-keeping directly to access to lower tariffs and trade benefits.
