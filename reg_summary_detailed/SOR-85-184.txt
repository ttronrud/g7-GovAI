**Detailed Summary of the Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6* of the Aeronautics Act** (S.C. 1976-77, c. 28, s. 2 and 49). These regulations establish specific spatial and elevation controls around the Cambridge Bay Airport in the Northwest Territories to ensure safe aircraft operations, particularly during takeoff and landing.

These regulations are formally titled:  
👉 **"The Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Cambridge Bay Airport, located in the vicinity of Cambridge Bay, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a datum for measuring distances and elevations. It is located on the centerline of Runway 13–31, 762.0 meters from the 31 end of the runway. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the strip (runway area) associated with Runway 13–31. It rises at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 50 meters horizontally**. It extends 300 meters vertically above the strip ends and 15,000 meters horizontally from the ends, with the outer ends of the horizontal lines located 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal surface located at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP’s assigned elevation** (18.9 m above sea level), unless the ground is lower than 9 meters. In that case, the surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**. This surface defines the maximum allowable height for structures and natural features beyond the immediate airport zone. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing on Runway 13–31. It is **300 meters wide** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,948.8 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally**, extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces up to the outer surface. This surface ensures a smooth transition between the runway zone and the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 18.9 meters above sea level.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to all lands that:
- Are **within** the designated airport boundaries; **or**
- Lie **directly under** any portion of the approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This includes:
- Public road allowances
- Private land adjacent to the airport
- Any land within the outer limits described in the zoning plan

The zoning plan referenced is **Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1756**, dated **September 9, 1983**.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions**

No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means all structures (including buildings, towers, antennas, trees, or even temporary constructions) must remain below these imaginary surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft during approach and departure.

---

### **5. Natural Growth and Vegetation**

If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a directive requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that vegetation does not create hazards such as wind shear, turbulence, or visual obstructions during flight operations.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**

No owner or occupier of land subject to these regulations may allow such land or any part of it to be used for:
- The **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**  
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This rule is designed to prevent bird attraction, which could lead to bird strikes — a serious aviation hazard.

---

### **7. Boundary Description of the Outer Limits**

The outer boundary of the regulated lands is defined precisely in the zoning plan and follows this path:

1. **Start**: At the southerly boundary of **Lot 8, Group 1419, Plan 57185 (C.L.S.R.) 701 (L.T.O.)**, where it intersects the **circumference of a circle with a 4,000-meter radius**, centered at the Airport Reference Point (ARP).
2. **Travel**: Along the **clockwise circumference** of this circle in a **southeasterly direction** until it intersects the **northerly limit of a road** north of **Lot 16, Block 9, Plan 68005 (C.L.S.R.) 1545 (L.T.O.)**.
3. **Move eastward** along the northerly limit of that road and its extension to the **Ordinary High Water Mark (O.H.W.M.) of Cambridge Bay**.
4. **Travel southerly** along the O.H.W.M. until it intersects the circumference of the 4,000-meter circle again.
5. **Continue southeasterly** along the circumference of the circle until it meets the **northerly limit of Lot 7, Group 1419, Plan 57185**.
6. **Travel easterly** along the northerly limits of **Lots 7 and 8**, including any unsurveyed land between them, to the **northeasterly corner of Lot 8**.
7. **Travel southerly** along the easterly edge of Lot 8 to its **southeasterly corner**.
8. **Travel westerly** along the southerly edge of Lot 8 back to the **point of commencement**.

This boundary forms a large circular buffer zone around the airport, protecting a significant area from development or construction that could interfere with flight operations.

### **8. Key Features of the Approach and Transitional Surfaces**

- **Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined at **1:50** (1 meter rise per 50 meters run).
  - Extends 300 meters vertically above the runway ends and 15,000 meters horizontally from the ends.
  - Outer ends of the horizontal lines are **2,400 meters** from the runway centerline.
  - Ensures clear visual and physical space for aircraft during final approach.

- **Transitional Surface**:
  - Inclined at **1:7** (1 meter rise per 7 meters run).
  - Begins at the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces.
  - Rises to meet the **outer surface**.
  - Provides a gradual slope between the runway zone and the outer surface, minimizing abrupt changes in terrain or structure height.

### **9. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Safety**: To prevent obstacles (buildings, trees, structures, or waste) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Visual Clearance**: To maintain unobstructed visibility for pilots, especially during low-visibility or night operations.
3. **Environmental Protection**: To reduce bird hazards by prohibiting waste disposal that attracts birds.
4. **Zoning Clarity**: To define clearly the spatial boundaries and height limits for all land adjacent to the airport.

---

### **10. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** is responsible for:
  - Enforcing the height restrictions.
  - Issuing directives to remove excessive natural growth.
  - Monitoring compliance with waste disposal rules.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative action, including fines or removal orders if violations occur.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Cambridge Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to manage land use and development around the Cambridge Bay Airport. By defining key elevation surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), setting strict height limits, and restricting waste disposal and vegetation, the regulations prioritize **aviation safety** and **operational efficiency** in one of the remote and challenging Arctic environments.

These rules reflect a balance between development needs and the imperative to maintain safe flight operations in a region where terrain, climate, and remoteness amplify the risks of aviation hazards.
