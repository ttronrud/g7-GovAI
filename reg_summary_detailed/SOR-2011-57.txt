### **Detailed Summary of the Credit for Provincial Relief (HST) Regulations**

These regulations, made under **section 277a and 277.1b of the Excise Tax Act (Act)**, establish a mechanism allowing **registrants (taxpayers)** in Ontario to claim a **credit for provincial relief**—specifically, a refund or credit of a portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) or other applicable taxes—when a qualifying amount has been credited to a customer under the **Ontario regulation on rebates for First Nations**.

This regulation is part of a broader effort to **align provincial and federal tax policies** and ensure **fairness in tax treatment** when certain tax amounts are reimbursed or credited to individuals or businesses under provincial programs.

## **I. Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Made by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Authority:** Sections 277a and 277.1b of the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. E-15).
- **Statutory references:**
  - S.C. 1993, c. 27, s. 125(1)
  - S.C. 2009, c. 32, s. 37(1)

These provisions empower the federal government to create regulations that allow for the **recognition of credits or rebates** when a person has received a tax credit or rebate from a province (in this case, Ontario) under a sales tax harmonization agreement.

## **II. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. E-15), which governs federal excise taxes, including HST. |
| **Ontario Regulation** | Ontario Regulation 317/10 (*Rebates for First Nations in Ontario*), as amended and in effect on **October 17, 2018**, under the *Retail Sales Tax Act* (R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31). This regulation provides rebates to First Nations communities for certain taxes. |
| **Qualifying Amount** | A specific amount of tax (HST or other) that is either: <br> - Paid or payable under subsection 165(2) or sections 212.1 or 218.1 of the Act, or <br> - Under Division IV.1 of Part IX of the Act, <br> and which may be **credited to a person** by the Crown in right of Ontario under the Ontario Regulation. |

> The qualifying amount is essentially the **amount of tax that a business or individual has already been reimbursed or credited by the province (Ontario)** under its First Nations rebate program.

---

## **III. How the Credit Works**

### **1. Eligibility to Claim a Credit**
A registrant (e.g., a business selling goods or services in Ontario) may claim a **credit equal to all or part of a qualifying amount** if:
- The registrant made a supply (sale) in Ontario to a person.
- The registrant **credited** the qualifying amount to that person in respect of the supply during a reporting period.

> This means: If a business sells a product to a First Nations person and the Ontario government has already credited that person with a tax amount under the First Nations rebate program, the business can apply for a credit to offset its own tax obligations.

---

### **2. Application Process**
- An application must be submitted in **prescribed form** with **prescribed information**.
- Must be filed with the **Minister of Finance** in a **prescribed manner** (e.g., via the official tax portal or form).
- The application can be filed for a return in the **same reporting period** or a **subsequent reporting period**.

---

### **3. Deemed Remittance and Payment**
If:
- A registrant files a return under Part IX of the Act (for a reporting period), and
- The return includes an application for a credit under subsection (1),

Then:
- The registrant is **deemed to have remitted** an amount equal to the **lesser of**:
  - The **remittance amount** (required to be paid under sections 228(2), (2.3), (2.1), or (4), or Division IV or IV.1 of Part IX), and
  - The **amount of the credit** being claimed.

> This means the tax owed is reduced by the credit, and the government treats the credit as having been paid by the business.

- Any **unpaid portion of the credit** may be **paid directly by the Minister** to the registrant.

---

### **4. Tax Treatment – Deemed Rebate**
For **section 263.02 and 263.1 of the Act**:
- A credit paid under paragraph (3)(b) is **deemed to be a rebate** under Part IX of the Act.

For **sections 264(1) and 297(4)**:
- The credit is treated as a **rebate under Division VI of Part IX**.
- The **filing date** of the rebate is the **later of**:
  - The day the return is filed (in which the application is made), and
  - The day the application is filed.

> This ensures clarity in tracking when the rebate is considered effective for audit or compliance purposes.

---

### **5. Exclusion from Tax Reporting**
If a registrant credits a qualifying amount to a customer:
- The registrant is **not required** to include the **tax amount equal to the qualifying amount** in:
  - The **total tax payable**, or
  - The **total rates of tax payable** under subsection 223(1) or (1.1) of the Act.

> This prevents double-counting of tax—since the tax has already been offset by a provincial rebate.

---

### **6. Penalty for Misreporting**

If, in determining net tax:
- The registrant **deducts** a qualifying amount (i.e., removes it from tax payable), or
- Fails to **add** the qualifying amount (i.e., omits it as tax due),

Then the registrant is liable to a **penalty** calculated as:

> **Penalty = Misreported Amount × (Lesser of 5 or Number of Complete Months)**  
> Where the period runs from:
> - The day **on or before** the return must be filed,  
> to the **earlier of**:
>   - The day the registrant reports the misreported amount to the Minister (in writing or otherwise), or  
>   - The day the Minister issues a notice of assessment including the misreported amount.

> Example: If the misreported amount is deducted in a return filed on January 1, 2024, and the assessment is issued on June 1, 2024, the penalty applies for 5 months (January–May), capped at 5 months.

> **Note:** The penalty applies only if the return is filed **before** the day the regulations are published in the *Canada Gazette*.

---

### **7. Penalty for Late Applications**

If a registrant files an application for a qualifying credit **more than four years** after crediting the amount:
- The registrant is liable to a penalty equal to the **amount of the particular credit**.

> This encourages timely claims and discourages long-term delays.

---

### **8. Waiver or Cancellation of Penalties**

The Minister may **waive or cancel** penalties under two circumstances:
- **Under subsection (1):** On or before **10 calendar years after the end of the reporting period** (e.g., if a return is filed in 2023, the waiver window ends on December 31, 2033).
- **Under subsection (2):** On or before **10 calendar years after the date the application was filed** (e.g., if an application is filed in 2023, the waiver window ends on December 31, 2033).

> This provides a **10-year grace period** for correcting errors or resolving disputes.

---

### **9. Application of Qualifying Amounts to Tax Payments**

#### a) For Tax Payable under Section 212.1 (HST on certain goods/services)
- If a person owes HST under section 212.1 and **all or part of that tax equals a qualifying amount** that was credited to them under the Ontario regulation:
  - That qualifying amount is **applied as a deduction** from the total tax owed.

> This reduces the amount the person must pay to the federal government.

#### b) For Tax Payable under Section 218.1 or Division IV.1 of Part IX
- If a person owes tax under these provisions and the amount equals a qualifying amount:
  - The qualifying amount is **credited to the person by the Minister**.
  - It is then **applied as a deduction** from the tax due—**only if**:
    - The person files a **prescribed application** in prescribed form with the return where the tax is reported.

> This ensures that only those who actively apply for the credit benefit from it.

### **10. Prohibition on Double Counting or Tax Benefits**

No amount of:
- Input tax credit,
- Rebate,
- Refund,
- Remission,
- Or
