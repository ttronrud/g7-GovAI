### **Detailed Summary of the United States Surtax Remission Order (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j); S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Customs Tariff** and made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, establishes a framework for the **remission (forgiveness or refund)** of **surtaxes** imposed under the **United States Surtax Orders**, specifically related to **steel and aluminum** and **other goods**. These surtaxes were originally imposed in response to U.S. trade policies affecting Canadian exports, particularly during periods of trade tensions.

The Order is designed to provide **relief to Canadian importers** who have paid or are liable to pay these surtaxes under specific conditions, primarily to ensure fairness and economic stability in the face of international trade disruptions.

---

## **I. Purpose of the Order**
To **grant remission of surtaxes** paid or payable under:
1. The **United States Surtax Order (Steel and Aluminum)**
2. The **United States Surtax Order (Other Goods)**  
in respect of certain goods imported into Canada, under defined conditions.

This remission aims to:
- Offset the financial burden on Canadian businesses due to unexpected surtaxes.
- Encourage compliance with import regulations while ensuring equitable treatment.
- Support economic stability in key sectors (e.g., manufacturing, construction, transportation).
