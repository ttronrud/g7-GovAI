**Detailed Summary of the Interest Rates (Excise Tax Act) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The *Interest Rates (Excise Tax Act) Regulations* are a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the **Excise Tax Act (R.S., c. 15 (1st Supp.))**, specifically:

- **Subsection 59(3.1)a** and **(3.4)b** of the Excise Tax Act  
- **Section 277c** of the Excise Tax Act  

These provisions empower the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to establish interest rates applicable to various financial transactions under the Excise Tax Act.

**Purpose**:  
To define and set the interest rates used in the Excise Tax Act for different types of interest payments or applications, particularly in relation to the Receiver General and payments made by the Minister of Finance to individuals, corporations, or other entities.

### **2. Effective Date**

- The regulations came into force on **July 1, 2003**.  
- A prior version was repealed by **SOR/2008-36, s. 2**, which removed certain outdated provisions.  
- The current version supersedes the repealed one.

### **3. Key Definitions**

#### **Act**  
Refers to the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. 15 (1st Supp.)), which governs excise taxes in Canada, including the collection, administration, and related financial obligations.

#### **Basic Rate (in respect of a particular quarter)**  
This is the foundational interest rate used in the calculations. It is defined as:

> The **simple arithmetic mean**, expressed as a **percentage per year** and **rounded up to the next higher whole percentage** (if not already a whole number), of all amounts that represent the **average equivalent yield** (as a percentage per year) of:

- **Government of Canada Treasury Bills**  
- That mature approximately **three months after their date of issue**  
- Sold at **auctions** during the **first month of the quarter preceding** the particular quarter being considered.

**Example**:  
To determine the basic rate for the quarter beginning **April 1, 2024**, one would look at Treasury Bill auctions held in **March 2024** (the first month of the preceding quarter). The average yield of the three-month bills sold during those auctions would be calculated, averaged, and then rounded up to the nearest whole percentage.

This ensures that the basic rate reflects current market conditions and is tied directly to the benchmark interest rate of Canadian government debt.

#### **Quarter**  
A period of **three consecutive months** beginning on one of the following dates:
- January 1  
- April 1  
- July 1  
- October 1  

Thus, the quarters are:
- Q1: January 1 – March 31  
- Q2: April 1 – June 30  
- Q3: July 1 – September 30  
- Q4: October 1 – December 31  

These quarters are used to determine the applicable interest rate for each fiscal period.

### **4. Prescribed Interest Rates by Recipient or Transaction Type**

The interest rate applied depends on the **nature of the payment or application** under the Excise Tax Act. The prescribed rate is derived from the **basic rate** for the relevant quarter, plus additional percentages where applicable.

| **Type of Interest Payment or Application** | **Interest Rate** |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Interest paid to the Receiver General** | Basic rate + **4%** |
| **Interest paid or applied on an amount payable to a person (other than a corporation)** | Basic rate + **2%** |
| **Interest paid or applied on an amount payable to a corporation** | **Basic rate only** |
| **Any other case** (not covered above) | Basic rate + **4%** |

---

### **5. Key Implications and Practical Applications**

#### **a) Receiver General (Government Collections)**  
- When the government pays interest to the Receiver General (e.g., for tax receivables or administrative funds), a **higher rate (basic + 4%)** applies.  
- This reflects the higher risk or administrative cost associated with these payments.

#### **b) Payments to Individuals (Non-Corporate Persons)**  
- Interest paid to individuals (e.g., tax refunds, penalties, or recoveries) uses a **lower rate (basic + 2%)**.  
- This may reflect a lower risk profile or administrative cost compared to corporate transactions.

#### **c) Payments to Corporations**  
- Interest applied to corporate entities (e.g., interest on loans or tax obligations) uses **only the basic rate**.  
- This may be due to the perceived financial stability or larger scale of corporations, allowing for a more market-aligned rate without added premiums.

#### **d) Other Cases**  
- Any other interest-related transaction not explicitly covered (e.g., special payments or administrative adjustments) defaults to **basic rate + 4%**, aligning with the standard rate for government payments.

### **6. Repeal and Amendments**

- A prior version of these regulations was **repealed by SOR/2008-36, section 2**, which removed outdated or inconsistent provisions.  
- The current version is the **current, active version** as of July 1, 2003, and remains in force unless amended or replaced.

---

### **7. Regulatory Significance**

- These regulations provide **clarity and consistency** in how interest rates are determined in excise tax administration.  
- They link interest rates directly to **market benchmarks** (Treasury Bills), ensuring that rates are **real-world, transparent, and responsive** to economic conditions.  
- The use of the **simple arithmetic mean** and **rounding up** ensures that rates are conservative and not overly precise, reducing potential volatility in financial outcomes.

---

### **8. Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations set the interest rates used in the Excise Tax Act based on current government bond yields. The base rate is calculated from the average yield of three-month Canadian Treasury Bills auctioned in the first month of the quarter before the one in question. Then, depending on who receives the interest:

- **Government (Receiver General)**: +4%  
- **Individuals**: +2%  
- **Corporations**: No additional percentage  
- **All other cases**: +4%  

This system ensures that interest rates are fair, market-based, and differentiated according to the recipient type.

### **Conclusion**

The *Interest Rates (Excise Tax Act) Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s excise tax administration framework. By linking interest rates to real-time financial market data and differentiating rates based on recipient type, they ensure transparency, fairness, and economic relevance in financial transactions involving excise taxes. The regulations remain in effect since July 1, 2003, and have been updated to reflect current market practices and administrative needs.
