**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Asparagus Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**  
*SOR/78-859, 1978 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 4217*  
*Dated: March 7, 1980*  
*May be cited as: The Ontario Asparagus Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish and enforce a **minimum price framework** for asparagus produced in Ontario that is intended for **interprovincial trade and export**. This ensures fair market pricing for producers, protects them from being undercut by lower prices, and supports the economic viability of Ontario’s asparagus industry.

The regulation is enacted under **Section 3 of the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order**, which authorizes the Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board") to set pricing rules for asparagus used in processing.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act (Ontario)*, which provides the legal foundation for the Commodity Board’s authority to regulate marketing and pricing. |
| **Asparagus** | Specifically refers to asparagus grown in Ontario and used by processors for further processing (e.g., canning, freezing, dehydration). It excludes asparagus used for fresh retail sales. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Ontario Asparagus Growers’ Marketing Board*, a statutory body established under the Farm Products Marketing Act to oversee the marketing and pricing of Ontario-grown asparagus. |
| **Processing** | Includes any transformation of asparagus into a different form such as canning, dehydrating, drying, freezing, or treating with chemicals like sugar or sulfur dioxide. This defines the scope of the regulation. |
| **Producer** | A person who, on **May 1st of any given year**, is either: <br> - The beneficial owner of land where asparagus is growing, or <br> - The tenant of such land. <br> This definition determines who is eligible for protection under the minimum price rule. |

### **3. Scope of Application**

- Applies **only** to:
  - The **marketing of asparagus** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside Canada).
  - Persons and property located **within the Province of Ontario**.

- **Does not apply** to:
  - Producers whose land on which asparagus is grown is **less than one-half acre** (i.e., small-scale growers).
  - Asparagus that has been **planted on a producer’s property for less than two years** (i.e., newly planted crops are excluded from the price protection).

> This exclusion recognizes that new plantings may not yet be economically viable or have established yield patterns, and thus do not qualify for the minimum price protection.

---

### **4. Core Prohibition: Minimum Price Requirement**

No person may:
- **Sell or offer to sell**, or  
- **Buy**  
asparagus in interprovincial or export trade at a price **below the minimum price** set by the Commodity Board from time to time.

#### Key Implications:
- The **minimum price** is established and adjusted by the Commodity Board based on market conditions, production costs, and other relevant factors.
- This rule creates a **price floor**, ensuring that producers are not exploited by buyers (such as processors or exporters) who might otherwise offer below-market prices.
- It applies to **all transactions** involving asparagus destined for processing, regardless of the buyer or seller, as long as the trade is interprovincial or export-based.

---

### **5. Regulatory Enforcement**

While the regulation does not specify enforcement mechanisms in detail, the authority to set minimum prices and the legal framework under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* imply that:
- The Commodity Board has the power to **monitor and investigate** pricing practices.
- Violations of the minimum price rule could lead to penalties, including fines or legal action, though specific sanctions are not outlined in this regulation.
- Compliance is expected to be enforced through industry oversight and possibly through audits or reporting requirements (not detailed here).

---

### **6. Significance and Impact**

- **Supports Producer Stability**: By preventing undercutting, the regulation helps stabilize income for Ontario asparagus growers, especially during periods of market volatility.
- **Promotes Fair Trade**: Ensures that processors and exporters pay a fair price for Ontario-grown asparagus, which is essential for maintaining the competitiveness of Ontario’s processing industry.
- **Targets Specific Market Segments**: Focuses only on processed asparagus, excluding fresh market sales, which are governed by different rules.
- **Excludes Small and New Operations**: Acknowledges practical realities of farming by excluding very small plots and new plantings, which may not yet contribute meaningfully to the market.

---

### **7. Legal and Historical Context**

- These regulations were introduced in **1978** and remain in force as of 1980, indicating their long-standing role in Ontario’s agricultural policy.
- They reflect a broader trend in Canadian agricultural policy of using **marketing boards** to stabilize prices and ensure fair returns for farmers.
- The regulation is part of a larger system of **farm product marketing controls** under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, which allows for price stabilization, quality control, and market development in key agricultural commodities.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Asparagus Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations* serve as a critical tool for protecting the interests of Ontario asparagus producers in the processing and export markets. By establishing a legally enforceable **minimum price** for asparagus used in processing, the regulation ensures fair competition, prevents market exploitation, and supports the long-term sustainability of Ontario’s asparagus industry. However, its application is limited to specific producers and crops, recognizing the diversity of farm operations and market realities.

This regulation remains a foundational piece of agricultural policy in Ontario, demonstrating how government-supported marketing boards can play a vital role in balancing supply, demand, and producer welfare in the agri-food sector.
