## 🔎 Key Provisions (as historically applicable)

---

### 1. **Definition of Violations**
A violation occurs when any of the following are contravened:

#### a) **Provisions of the Act** listed in **Column 1 of Part 1 of the Schedule**
- Direct breaches of specific provisions in the *Act* (e.g., failure to report suspicious transactions, failure to maintain records, etc.).

#### b) **Combined Provisions** from:
- **Column 1 (Act)** and **Column 2 (Regulations)** of **Part 2 of the Schedule**
- OR, if no Act provision is listed in Column 1, then only the **Regulation provision in Column 2** applies.

> Example: If a provision in the *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations* (e.g., failure to file a report) is not explicitly tied to an Act provision, the violation still occurs under the regulation alone.

#### c) **Combined Provisions** from:
- **Column 1 (Act)** and **Column 2 (Regulations)** of **Part 3 of the Schedule**
- Relates to **suspicious transaction reporting requirements**.

> This ensures that failure to report suspicious activity — both under the Act and under the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations — constitutes a violation.

---

### 2. **Classification of Violations**
Violations are categorized into three levels based on severity:

| Violation Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Minor Violation** | Less serious breaches (e.g., minor record-keeping errors) |
| **Serious Violation** | More significant breaches (e.g., failure to report a suspicious transaction) |
| **Very Serious Violation** | Severe, high-risk breaches (e.g., deliberate concealment of funds, fraud, or participation in terrorist financing) |

> Classification is determined by **Column 2 of Part 1** (for Act provisions) and **Column 3 of Parts 2 and 3** (for combined Act/Regulation or Regulation-only provisions).

---

### 3. **Aggregation of Minor Violations**
A **series of minor violations** listed in a single **Notice of Violation** may be treated as a **serious violation** under **section 73.21 of the Act** if:
- The **total penalty amount** for all minor violations in the notice is **$10,000 or more**.

> This provision allows regulators to escalate penalties when a person or entity has multiple small infractions that collectively represent a significant breach of compliance.

---

### 4. **Penalty Ranges (Monetary Penalties)**

| Violation Type | Penalty Range |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Minor Violation** | **$1 to $1,000** |
| **Serious Violation** | **$1 to $100,000** |
| **Very Serious Violation** | **$1 to $500,000** |

> These penalties are **administrative** and are imposed under **sections 73.11 to 73.5 of the Act**, which govern penalty enforcement.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The actual penalty amount is not fixed — it is determined by the regulator based on the violation, the entity's history of compliance, and other factors.

---

### 5. **Compliance History as a Penalty Factor**
Under **section 73.11 of the Act**, the **history of compliance** of a person or entity (excluding specific regulations such as Part 2, Part 3, and the Registration Regulations) is a **prescribed factor** in determining the appropriate penalty amount.

> This means that:
- A company with a strong compliance record may receive a lower penalty.
- A repeat offender or one with prior violations may face significantly higher penalties.
- The regulator must consider past performance when assessing penalties.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions**: Compliance history is not considered for violations under:
> - Part 2 of the Act (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulations)
> - Part 3 (Suspicious Transaction Reporting Regulations)
> - Registration Regulations

---

### 6. **Service of Regulatory Documents**
Regulatory notices (e.g., Notices of Violation) may be served on individuals or entities in the following ways:

#### For a **Person**:
- **Personal service**: Delivered directly to the individual.
- **Left with an adult household member**: If the person's last known address or usual residence is known.
- **Electronic or postal delivery**: Via registered mail, courier, fax, or other electronic means (e.g., email) to the person’s address.

#### For an **Entity**:
- **Left at head office or place of business**: With an officer or person in control or management.
- **Sent via registered mail, courier, or fax** to the entity’s head office.
- **Sent electronically (not via fax)** to any person in control or management.

> ⚠️ **Repealed**: This provision was repealed by **SOR/2023-193, s. 41**. Current service rules may differ.

---

### 7. **Deemed Service Dates**
In the absence of contrary evidence, a document is deemed to have been served on the following dates:

| Service Method | Deemed Service Date |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Left with adult household member | **On the day it was left** |
| Sent by registered mail or courier | **10 days after the date on the receipt** (issued by postal or courier service) |
| Sent by fax or electronic means | **On the day of transmission** |

> This ensures legal certainty in determining when a notice is effective.

---

### 8. **Interest on Penalties (Prescribed Rate)**
For the purpose of **section 73.28 of the Act**, the interest rate applied to penalties is calculated as follows:

> **Prescribed rate of interest =**
> (Simple arithmetic mean of average equivalent yields of Government of Canada Treasury Bills)  
> + 4%

#### How it's calculated:
- For each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31):
  - Look at **Treasury Bills** that mature **3 months after issue**.
  - Consider **all bills auctioned during the first month of the preceding quarter**.
  - Compute the **average equivalent yield** (as a percentage per year) for those bills.
  - Take the **simple arithmetic mean** of those yields.
  - Round **up to the next whole percentage** (e.g., 3.4% → 4%; 3.9% → 4%).
  - Add **4%** to this mean to get the total prescribed rate.

> Example:
> - If the mean yield is 3.2%, the prescribed rate is **7.2%**.
> - If the mean yield is 5.9%, the prescribed rate is **9.9%** (rounded up to 10%).

#### Interest Calculation:
- Interest is **calculated and compounded monthly**.
- This means penalties grow over time if not paid.

> ⚠️ **Repealed**: This interest rate provision was repealed by **SOR/2019-240, s. 110**.
