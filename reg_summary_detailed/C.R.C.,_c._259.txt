**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Turkey Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Quebec Turkey Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader framework of Quebec’s agricultural marketing laws.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Quebec* (Loi). This is the foundational legislation that authorizes the regulatory bodies and provides the legal basis for the Order’s operations.

- **Board**: Refers to the *Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board* (Régie), a government body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of agricultural products, including turkeys.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Fédération des producteurs de volailles du Québec* (Office de commercialisation), a producer-led organization representing turkey producers in Quebec. It functions as a cooperative body to manage marketing and pricing for turkey products.

- **Turkey**: Defined as a turkey that is *produced or grown in the Province of Quebec* specifically for the purpose of slaughter. This definition ensures that only domestic turkeys meet the criteria for regulation under this Order.

---

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**  
Both the Board and the Commodity Board are granted broad powers to regulate the **marketing of turkeys** in two key markets:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Quebec)

These powers are derived from **Sections 109 to 112 of the Farm Products Marketing Act**. Importantly, the Order allows each body to exercise, by way of *order*, the same powers they would have over the *local marketing* of turkeys within Quebec. This means they can regulate pricing, distribution, sales, and other marketing activities in both domestic and external markets with the same authority as they have locally.

This provision ensures consistency in regulation and enables the bodies to act effectively across provincial and international markets.

**4. Specific Authority of the Commodity Board (Relevant Provisions)**  
The Commodity Board is explicitly empowered to:

- **Make orders** that:
  - Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in the **production or marketing of turkeys** within Quebec.

- **Classify producers into groups** based on their type of operation, size, or other relevant criteria.  
  For example, small-scale producers, large-scale farms, or different types of marketing entities may be grouped separately.

- **Set different levies or charges** for members of different groups. This allows for a tiered or differentiated system that may reflect the varying economic capacity or market role of producers.

- **Use the collected levies and charges** for various purposes, including:
  - Establishing **reserves** (funds set aside for future use, e.g., during market downturns)
  - Covering **operating expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of turkeys
  - Facilitating **equalization or adjustment** among producers

    Specifically, the Commodity Board may use the funds to:
    - Equalize the financial outcomes among producers when market prices fluctuate
    - Adjust payments so that producers receive fair compensation during periods of low demand or price volatility
    - Provide financial support during downturns or to stabilize the market

- The adjustment or equalization may be applied over **specific periods or periods of time** as the Board determines appropriate.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The section stating that this authority was "Revoked, SOR/80-90" indicates that the original provision granting such powers was repealed or replaced by a subsequent regulation in 1980 (SOR/80-90). However, the current version of the Order appears to restore or reaffirm this authority, suggesting a re-authorization or correction of the prior revocation. This may reflect a policy shift or legislative update to re-establish producer support mechanisms.

---

**5. Purpose and Impact**  
The primary objectives of this Order are:

- To ensure **stable and fair marketing conditions** for turkey producers in Quebec.
- To provide **financial protection** during market fluctuations.
- To promote **equitable distribution of market gains or losses** among producers.
- To support **market stability** in both interprovincial and export markets.

By enabling the Commodity Board to impose levies and use the funds for reserves and equalization, the Order acts as a form of **market stabilization mechanism**, protecting producers from adverse price swings and helping to maintain a viable and sustainable turkey industry in Quebec.

---

**6. Scope and Application**  
The powers conferred under this Order apply only to:

- Persons and property located **within the Province of Quebec**
- Activities related to the **production or marketing of turkeys** (defined as those raised specifically for slaughter)

This ensures that the regulation remains geographically and functionally focused on Quebec’s domestic turkey sector.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Quebec Turkey Order* is a targeted regulatory tool that empowers both the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board and the Fédération des producteurs de volailles du Québec to manage turkey marketing in interprovincial and export markets. The Commodity Board, in particular, is granted significant authority to impose tiered levies, use collected funds for financial stability, and ensure equitable outcomes among producers. Despite a prior revocation of its levy powers (SOR/80-90), the current Order appears to restore or reaffirm this critical function, reinforcing the role of producer organizations in maintaining market resilience and fairness in Quebec’s turkey industry.

This Order reflects a balance between market efficiency and producer protection, aligning with broader agricultural policy goals of sustainability, equity, and economic stability.
