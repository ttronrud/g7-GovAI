## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Context and Authority**

These regulations are established under several Canadian statutes and international agreements:

- **International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974** and its **1988 Protocol**, which form the foundation for maritime safety standards.
- The regulations **complement and expand upon** these international standards, ensuring that Canadian vessels meet or exceed global safety benchmarks.
- The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) enacted these regulations based on recommendations from:
  - The **Minister of Transport** (for all provisions except sections 425–427),
  - The **Minister of Natural Resources** (for sections 425–427).

The regulations are made under the authority of:
- **Subsection 149(1)a** of the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*
- **Subsection 153(1)c** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*
- **Subsection 14(1)e** of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*
- Various provisions of the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, including:
  - s. 7(2), 35(1)g, 35.1(1)h, 120(1)i, 120(2), 136(1)j, 207(1)k, and 274(2)

This demonstrates that the regulations are both **federally mandated** and **aligned with regional and sector-specific agreements**, particularly those involving offshore energy and maritime safety in Atlantic Canada.

- **Recommendations are mandatory** – not discretionary.
- Expressions like *"at the discretion of the Administration," "satisfactory to the Administration," or "unless the Administration decides otherwise"* are **excluded** from interpretation.
- Documents incorporated by reference are to be read **without reference to administrative discretion** or "satisfactory" standards.
- The **date of construction** is defined as the earliest of:
  - Keel laying
  - Start of construction
  - Assembly reaching 50 tonnes or 1% of total structural mass (whichever is less)

### 🔹 **4. Scope of Application**

#### ✅ Applies to:
- All **Canadian vessels** anywhere in the world.
- **Non-Canadian vessels** operating in **Canadian waters**.

#### ❌ Exemptions:
- Vessels involved in **oil or gas drilling, production, conservation, or processing** in areas specified in:
  - Section 3 of the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*
  - Subsection 8(1) of the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*
  - Subsection 8(1) of the *Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*

### 🔹 **5. Equipment Requirements**

#### 🔧 General Rule:
Every vessel of **150 gross tonnage or more** must be fitted with equipment that:
- Is **type-approved** by a **competent authority** (government, classification society, or testing body)
- Meets **three core standards**:
  1. **Performance standards** in the Annex to IMO Resolution A.694(17) – covering **GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System)** and **Electronic Navigational Aids (ENAs)**
  2. **Testing standards** in **IEC 60945** – methods and results for testing navigation and radio equipment
  3. **Standards listed in columns 2 to 4 of Schedule 1** for specific equipment or AIS

> **Alternative Compliance**: Equipment may be accepted if it meets **a safety level equivalent to or higher** than the required standards.

#### 📌 Type Approval:
- Must be **evidenced by a label or document**
- If a **label**: securely affixed in a **readily visible location** on the equipment
- If a **document**: kept in a **readily accessible location** on board
- If in a language other than English or French, a **translation must be provided**

#### ⚠️ Special Rule for Equipment Not Required by This Part:
Even if not required, equipment must still comply if:
- It is specified in **Schedule 1**
- The vessel is **500 gross tonnage or more** and on a voyage **other than sheltered waters**
- The vessel is **not a fishing vessel**
- The equipment was fitted **on or after July 1, 2002**

> This ensures retroactive compliance for modern equipment installed after a key date.

#### 🚫 Exceptions for Pre-2002 Equipment:
Equipment in **Schedule 2** that was fitted **before July 1, 2002** is exempt from the stricter A.694(17) and IEC 60945 requirements **if** it:
