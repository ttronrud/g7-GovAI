**Detailed Summary of the Involuntary Retirements Remission Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled the **Involuntary Retirements Remission Order**.
- It may be cited as such and is designed to address tax consequences for certain public service employees who experience involuntary retirement.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (Loi), which governs the superannuation (pension) system for public service employees in Canada. This Act forms the legal foundation for pension entitlements and related benefits.

- **Employee**: A person who is or was employed in the public service of Canada. This includes individuals who were hired under the public service framework and who may have been affected by involuntary retirement measures.

- **Pension**: Defined as an *annuity* within the meaning of the Public Service Superannuation Act. This means the financial benefit provided to an employee upon retirement, typically in the form of a regular income stream.

- **Settlement**: An amount received by an employee or their legal representative as compensation for a loss of salary or pension benefits resulting from the termination of employment. This settlement arises specifically due to the termination of employment under certain conditions.

- **Termination of Employment**: Defined as the termination of an employee’s employment under **subsection 20(12) of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**, as it was interpreted and read on **October 19, 1972**. This regulatory provision historically governed the circumstances under which employees could be involuntarily retired, often due to restructuring, downsizing, or other organizational decisions.

### **3. Core Provision – Tax Remission**

This is the central and most significant part of the Order:

> Where, in the **1972 or any subsequent taxation year**, an employee or their legal representative receives a settlement because of the termination of employment, **remission of income tax** is granted under the following conditions:

#### **Amount of Remission**
The remission is equal to the **amount by which**:
- The **income tax payable** by the employee or their legal representative for that taxation year  
**exceeds**  
- The **aggregate of two components**:

1. **Tax that would have been payable if the settlement had not been received**  
   → This represents the tax liability that would have existed had the employee not received the settlement.

2. **Tax that would have been payable** if the salary or pension (which was lost due to the termination) **had actually been received** during the relevant taxation years  
   → Minus the **tax that was already paid** in respect of those years.

#### **Inclusion of Interest**
If interest is due on the settlement (e.g., interest on the unpaid portion of a pension or salary), such interest is also included in the calculation of the remission amount.

### **4. Scope and Application**

- The remission applies to **taxation years starting from 1972** and all subsequent years.
- It applies to **any employee** who received a settlement due to termination of employment under the 1972 regulations (or later versions).
- The provision extends to:
  - The **widow or child** of the employee, **as the circumstances require**.
    → This means that if a spouse or dependent child is financially affected by the employee’s involuntary retirement and receives a settlement or benefit, they may also be entitled to the tax remission under the Order.

---

### **5. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objective of this Order is to **mitigate the adverse tax impact** on individuals who suffer a loss of income due to involuntary retirement. By remitting the excess tax that results from receiving a settlement (which is often a compensation for lost salary or pension), the government acknowledges that such settlements are not purely windfalls but are compensatory in nature.

The remission helps to:
- Prevent undue financial hardship for employees and their families.
- Align tax treatment with the economic reality of involuntary retirement, where individuals lose income and may receive compensation that is not fully offset by tax consequences.
- Promote fairness in the taxation system for those affected by public service restructuring or downsizing.

---

### **6. Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Tax Benefit**: Employees or their legal representatives receive a direct reduction in their income tax liability for the year in which the settlement is received.
- **Timing**: The remission is calculated for the **taxation year in which the settlement is received**, not necessarily the year the termination occurred.
- **No Limit on Settlement Size**: The remission is based on the excess tax, so even large settlements may qualify for partial or full remission depending on the tax impact.
- **No Requirement to Claim**: The Order appears to be automatic — once a settlement arises from a termination under the 1972 regulations, the remission is granted, though administrative processes may be required for claim filing or verification.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Order **only applies** to settlements arising from termination of employment under **subsection 20(12)** of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations as read on **October 19, 1972**.
- It does **not apply** to voluntary retirements, resignations, or terminations under different regulatory provisions.
- The Order does **not cover** other types of compensation (e.g., severance pay not tied to pension/salary loss) unless such compensation is directly linked to the loss of salary or pension.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Involuntary Retirements Remission Order** serves as a targeted tax relief mechanism for public service employees who are involuntarily retired under the 1972 regulations. It ensures that the financial burden of receiving a settlement for lost salary or pension benefits is not disproportionately high due to income tax consequences. By remitting the excess tax liability, the Order provides a measure of fiscal protection and fairness to those affected by organizational changes in the public service.

This regulation reflects a broader principle in Canadian tax policy: that compensation for lost income should not result in a net tax increase, especially when the loss is involuntary and not the result of individual choice. It remains a key reference in discussions on public service retirement, tax equity, and employee protection.
