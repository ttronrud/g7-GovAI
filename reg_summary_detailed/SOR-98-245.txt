indicates that a particular regulation was officially **repealed** (cancelled or revoked) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instrument (SOR) 2012-127**, which was published in the Canada Gazette.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** — meaning it no longer exists or has legal effect.
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2012-127, section 1**, which is a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued by the Government of Canada. SOR stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Regulations" and is used to amend or repeal existing rules.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date of repeal is not specified in the provided text, such instruments typically take effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette. SOR/2012-127 was published in 2012, so the repeal would have been effective around that time.
- **Nature of the Regulation (Inferred)**: Although the specific content of the original regulation is not provided, the repeated reference suggests that it was a standalone rule or provision that had been previously in force. Given the context of such repeals, it may have related to:
  - Environmental standards
  - Occupational health and safety
  - Product safety or labeling
  - Licensing or permitting
  - Compliance or reporting requirements
  (Note: Without the original regulation's text, the precise subject matter cannot be determined.)

### Key Points:
- The regulation was **not in force after the repeal**.
- The repeal was **official and legally binding**, as confirmed by a government statutory instrument.
- The repeal was **not discretionary or temporary** — it was a formal cancellation of the regulation.
- The repealing provision (SOR/2012-127, s. 1) is likely a general clause that cancels one or more prior regulations, possibly as part of a broader legislative or policy review.

### Conclusion:
The provided information does not contain the original regulation’s content, only its status. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation’s provisions cannot be offered. However, the summary of the **regulation’s status** is clear: it was **repealed by SOR/2012-127, section 1**, and thus **no longer exists as a current legal requirement**.
