### **Detailed Summary of the National Energy Board Processing Plant Regulations (2002)**

The **National Energy Board (NEB) Processing Plant Regulations**, adopted on **December 20, 2002**, pursuant to **subsection 48(2) of the Canadian Energy Regulator Act (Act)**, establish comprehensive safety, environmental, operational, and compliance standards for **hydrocarbon processing plants** in Canada. These regulations were developed to ensure the safe and environmentally responsible design, construction, operation, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning of processing facilities that fall within the definition of a "pipeline" under the Act.

These regulations **do not apply** to:
- Well-site facilities  
- Field facilities  

They specifically govern **processing plants** — defined as facilities used for processing, extraction, or conversion of fluids, including compressors and related structures located within the plant boundaries.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Processing Plant** | A facility used for processing, extracting, or converting fluids, including compressors and structures integral to fluid transportation. |
| **Pressure Vessel** | A vessel designed to contain fluids at internal pressures exceeding 103 kPa (non-water service) or 610 mm (water service), with internal volume >42.5 L and diameter >152 mm (non-water) or >610 mm (water). |
| **Pressure Piping** | An assembly of pipes, valves, fittings, pumps, compressors, and safety devices designed to transport fluids and connected to a boiler or pressure vessel. |
| **Environment** | Includes air, land, water, living organisms, and all interacting natural systems. |
| **Incident** | An occurrence that results or could result in significant adverse effects on property, environment, or human safety. |
| **Abandon** | Permanent cessation of operations resulting in discontinuance of service. |
| **Decommission** | Permanent cessation without discontinuance of service. |
| **Deactivate** | Temporary removal from service. |
| **Release** | Includes discharge, spill, leak, seep, pour, emit, dump, or exhaust. |
| **Operate** | Includes repair, maintain, deactivate, reactivate, and decommission. |

> These definitions are foundational to interpreting the regulatory obligations.

## **Applicability and Jurisdiction**

- Applies to **hydrocarbon processing plants** that fall under the definition of "pipeline" in the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act**.
- Does **not apply** to well sites or field facilities.
- Applies to **all phases** of a processing plant’s lifecycle: design, construction, operation, maintenance, deactivation, reactivation, and decommissioning.

## **Core Regulatory Obligations**

### 1. **Compliance with Design, Construction, Operation, and Abandonment Standards**
A company must ensure that its processing plant is designed, constructed, operated, or abandoned in full compliance with:
- These Regulations
- The **Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (COHSR)**

> **If there is a conflict**, the **COHSR prevails** to the extent of inconsistency.

### 2. **Internal Design and Planning Requirements**
- Companies must develop and submit to the Regulator:
  - A **design program** for pressure vessels and pressure piping (this provision was **repealed in 2013** under SOR/2013-17, s.5)
  - A **quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) program** covering all aspects of the plant lifecycle
  - A **risk analysis** to determine spatial separation between ignition sources and flammable vapour sources
  - A **construction safety manual** (to be submitted and kept accessible at the site)
  - **Operations manuals** (to be regularly reviewed and updated)
  - An **emergency procedures manual** (to be submitted before initial operations and updated when required)
  - A **safe-work permit system** to manage all work activities at the plant
  - A **training program** for employees and visitors
  - A **processing plant integrity program** to monitor and mitigate hazards

### 3. **Safety and Environmental Protection Programs**
- **Safety Program**: To anticipate, prevent, manage, and mitigate dangerous conditions during construction, operations, and emergencies.
- **Environmental Protection Program**: To anticipate, prevent, manage, and mitigate conditions that could significantly harm the environment.

### 4. **Employee Training and Competency**
- Employees must receive appropriate **knowledge and training** for their assigned tasks.
- All **visitors** must be made familiar with safety procedures before entry.
- Training must cover:
  - Daily operational safety procedures
  - Responsible environmental practices
  - Proper operation of equipment
  - Emergency procedures and use of emergency equipment

### 5. **Contractor Management and Oversight**
When contracting out work:
- Contractors must be fully informed of:
  - Site-specific conditions and features
  - Special safety practices and procedures
- The company must ensure that construction, operation, or abandonment activities follow approved manuals (developed under sections 27 and 30).
- The company must **authorize a qualified person** to halt work if:
  - It is not being conducted in accordance with manuals
  - A hazard to personnel exists
- This authorized person must have **sufficient expertise, knowledge, and training** to perform the duty competently.

### 6. **Design and Equipment Requirements**
- **Detailed designs** of the processing plant must be developed, implemented, and maintained.
- **Emergency power sources** must be available.
- All **fluid storage tanks, bulbs, spheres, or containers** (excluding fresh water) must be designed to:
  - Contain fluids
  - Minimize risks to safety and the environment in case of unintentional release
- **Ignition sources** must not be located in the same building as flammable vapour sources unless:
  - Air intake flues are outside areas where gas is likely to be present
  - Flammable vapours are safely vented to a flare header or environmentally safe location
  - A specific risk analysis confirms the installation of active, reactive, or passive safety devices
  - The building is cross-ventilated
- All **process vessels and equipment** releasing flammable or toxic substances must be **safely vented** to flare headers or safe discharge points.
- **Flare headers** must have mechanisms to prevent flame from entering connected piping or vessels.
- **Fire suppression systems** must be reliable and appropriate to the fire risk posed by hydrocarbon storage or processing buildings.
- The plant must be equipped with detection systems for:
  - Explosive and flammable gases
  - Toxic or noxious gases
  - Fire, combustion products, or temperature rise
