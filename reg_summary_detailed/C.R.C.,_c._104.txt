### **Detailed Summary of the Quebec Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Quebec Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes zoning and height restrictions for land adjacent to and in the vicinity of **Quebec Airport (L’Ancienne Lorette)** in the Province of Quebec.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

Several key terms are defined within the regulation to ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Quebec Airport (L’Ancienne Lorette)**, located in the Province of Quebec.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A specific geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 200 feet above sea level**, even though its actual elevation may vary.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that begins at the end of a runway strip (at the strip end on the centerline) and slopes downward at a 45-degree angle (implied by the horizontal surface) to form a safe zone for aircraft during landing and takeoff. The dimensions vary by runway:
  - For **Runway 12–30**: 600 feet on each side of the centerline at the strip ends.
  - For **Runway 06–24**: 750 feet on each side at the strip ends.
  - At the **outer ends** (200 feet above the strip end elevation), the surface extends **2,000 feet horizontally** from the strip ends, measured over 10,000 feet from the strip ends.

- **Horizontal Surface**: An imaginary flat plane centered on and located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point**. This forms the base level for height restrictions.

- **Strip**: A designated rectangular area of the airport used for takeoff and landing. The strip includes the runway and has specific minimum lengths:
  - **Runway 12–30**: 1,200 feet (including runway).
  - **Runway 06–24**: 1,500 feet (including runway).

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface, rising at a slope of **1 vertical foot for every 7 horizontal feet** (a 1:7 slope). This surface connects the approach surface to the horizontal surface.

> *Note: All these surfaces are illustrated on **Plan No. M-2440 (A, B, C)**, dated December 5, 1962, which is recorded in the Department of Transport at Ottawa.*

#### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to **all lands**, including public road allowances, that are **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Quebec Airport**, as **specifically described in Part II of the Schedule**.

This includes not only private property but also public rights-of-way and adjacent land parcels.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

**No person may construct or erect any building, structure, or object — including additions to existing ones —** such that the **highest point** of that structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **directly above the land at that location**:

1. **Horizontal Surface**  
   - A flat plane 150 feet above the ARP (assigned elevation of 200 feet above sea level).
   - The outer limits of this surface are defined by a detailed **legal description** in the Schedule (Part II), involving a long chain of boundary lines and intersections between:
     - Highway No. 2
     - Parish lines (e.g., L’Ancienne Lorette, Ste Foye, St. Ambroise de la Jeune Lorette)
     - Lot lines
     - Road boundaries (e.g., Notre Dame Road, Drolet Road, St. Jean Baptiste Road)
     - Hydro-Quebec right-of-way
     - Canadian National Railway right-of-way
     - Calvaire Lake

2. **Approach Surfaces**  
   - For **Runway 12–30**:
     - 600 feet on each side of the centerline at the strip ends.
     - 2,000 feet on each side at outer ends (200 feet above strip end elevation), measured horizontally over 10,000 feet from the strip ends.
   - For **Runway 06–24**:
     - 750 feet on each side at the strip ends.
     - Same 2,000-foot outer extension at 200 feet above strip end elevation.

3. **Transitional Surfaces**  
   - These surfaces rise at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal) from the outer lateral limits of the strips and their approach surfaces, extending up to the horizontal surface.

> ⚠️ **Key Principle**: Any structure (new or existing) must not have its highest point **above** any of these defined surfaces at the location of that point on the land.

---

#### **5. Coordinates and Bearings**

- The **bearings** used in the legal description of the airport reference point are **astronomical**, referenced to the **centerline of Runway 06–24**.
- **Starting Point**: Intersection of the centerline of Runway 06–24 with the centerline of Runway 12–30.
- **Directional Bearings**:
  - **N 44°49′ E** along the centerline of Runway 06–24 for 2,000 feet.
  - Then **N 45°11′ W** for 750 feet to reach the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- The ARP is located at:
  - **Elevation**: 1,899.1 feet above a reference monument (concrete monument at intersection of concession line V–VI and lot line 376–383).
  - **Assigned True Elevation**: **200 feet above sea level** (as per regulation).

> This elevation is used as the **baseline** for the horizontal surface (150 feet above it).

#### **6. Land Described in the Regulation**

The regulation applies to a **specific parcel of land** composed of **numerous lots and parts of lots** across three parishes:

- **Parish of L’Ancienne Lorette**
- **Parish of Ste Foye**
- **Parish of St. Ambroise de la Jeune Lorette**

The list includes a detailed sequence of lot numbers, such as:
- 112, 112–1 to 112–7, 114–1 to 114–7, 114–9 to 114–16, etc.
- Up to lot **163** and various sub-lots (e.g., 155–1–30, 156–86 to 156–127).

> This list defines the **exact geographic boundaries** of the regulated zone, which may include both residential, commercial, and agricultural land adjacent to the airport.

---

#### **7. Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **ensure aviation safety** by:

- Preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff and landing.
- Maintaining clear airspace and visibility for pilots.
- Reducing risks from buildings or structures that could interfere with flight paths, approach patterns, or radar coverage.

The height restrictions are designed to protect the **approach zones**, **runway visibility**, and **transition areas** between the ground and the sky.

---

#### **8. Status and Revocation Note**

- The **Minister** is noted as **revoked** under **SOR/93-401, Section 2**.
- This suggests that the original authority (Minister of Transport or related department) was removed or replaced, and the regulation may now be governed under another legal framework or agency.
- However, the **content and applicability** of the zoning restrictions remain in force as they are detailed in the Schedule and referenced plan.

> ⚠️ This revocation of the Minister does **not** invalidate the regulation itself — it only removes the ministerial authority to amend or repeal it. The regulation stands as a **binding zoning rule** based on technical and safety criteria.

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulation is enforceable by municipal or provincial authorities.
- Any construction or alteration of structures within the defined zone must be reviewed to ensure compliance with the height limits.
- Violations may result in penalties, orders to remove structures, or fines, depending on local enforcement laws.
