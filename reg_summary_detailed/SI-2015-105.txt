The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2016-43" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 43 of 2016 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter — e.g., environmental protection, employment, health, or transportation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the *content* of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, a statutory instrument (SI) is a form of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (and some other Commonwealth jurisdictions) that implements or details primary legislation. SI/2016-43 would have been a piece of such legislation introduced in 2016, and its repeal in the same year (or later) means that it is no longer in force.

Key points about the repeal:

1. **Repeal Status**: The regulation is now legally inactive. It has been formally removed from the statute book, and any legal effect it previously had has ceased.

2. **Reason for Repeal**: Common reasons include:
   - The regulation being outdated or redundant.
   - A more comprehensive or modern version being introduced.
   - A change in policy or legislative priorities.
   - A conflict with newer legislation.

3. **Legal Effect**: Any references to SI/2016-43 in legal documents, court cases, or administrative procedures must now be treated as obsolete or incorrect.

4. **Source of Information**: The repeal is typically recorded in the UK Statutory Instruments database (https://www.legislation.gov.uk), where you can find the official text of the SI, the repeal notice, and the date of repeal.

To provide a detailed summary of the *original content* of SI/2016-43, further information such as the full title (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2016") or the subject area (e.g., "Road Traffic," "Food Safety," "Education") would be required.

**Conclusion**:  
SI/2016-43 has been repealed and is no longer in force. A detailed summary of its original content cannot be provided without additional information. For accurate historical or legal reference, consult the official UK legislation database (legislation.gov.uk) and search for "SI 2016/43" or its full title.

If you can provide the full title or subject of the regulation, I would be happy to offer a detailed summary of what it originally covered.
