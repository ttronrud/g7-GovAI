## 📚 Key Definitions

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing banks in Canada. |
| **Designated Entity** | Any entity that is *not* a joint venture, insurance company, securities dealer, or a subsidiary of such. This includes most corporate entities not directly involved in financial intermediation. |
| **Insurance Company** | An insurance company incorporated under Canadian or provincial law. |
| **Joint Venture** | A real property entity formed by a bank or a designated entity controlled by a bank, with one or more others, for a specific business purpose. The bank or its controlled entity must have a *substantial investment*, and there must be *joint control* (regardless of equity distribution). |
| **Real Property Entity** | An entity primarily engaged in holding, managing, or dealing with real property. Includes: <br> - Incorporate bodies (e.g., REITs, real estate trusts) <br> - Shares in such bodies <br> - Ownership interests in unincorporated entities (e.g., partnerships) engaged in real property activities. |
| **Related Real Property Entity (of a bank)** | A real property entity where: <br> (a) The bank or a designated entity controlled by it beneficially owns sufficient shares/interests to constitute a *substantial investment*; or <br> (b) It is controlled by such an entity. |
| **Third Party (in respect of a bank)** | Any person *other than*: <br> - The bank itself <br> - A designated entity controlled by the bank <br> - A related real property entity of the bank. |

> ⚠️ These definitions are foundational for determining what constitutes an "interest in real property" and how it is valued under the regulations.

## 📊 Valuation of Assets in Real Property

For the purposes of sections 8 to 11 of the Bank Act, the **book value** of an asset representing a bank’s interest in real property is defined as:

- **If the asset is real property**:  
  Gross book value of the property *minus* accumulated depreciation, as reported on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions' accounting principles** (as per subsection 308(4) of the Bank Act).

- **If the asset is a security or loan**:  
  The book value as reported on the bank’s balance sheet under the same accounting standards.

> This ensures consistency in valuation and aligns with standard financial reporting practices.

## 🚫 Exemptions from Sections 476 to 478 of the Bank Act

Sections 476 to 478 (which normally impose investment limits on banks in real property) **do not apply** to the following:

1. **Widely held banks** with **equity of $1 billion or more**;  
2. **Banks with $1 billion or more in equity** that are controlled by any of the following:  
   - A widely held bank holding company  
   - A widely held insurance holding company  
   - An *eligible financial institution* (as defined in subsection 370(1) of the Bank Act), *except foreign banks*  
   - A *foreign bank that is widely held*

> This provides a **risk-based exemption** for large, well-capitalized institutions, especially those under the control of large holding companies or foreign entities.

---

## 📌 Prescribed Subsidiaries

For the purposes of sections 476 and 477, a **prescribed subsidiary** of a bank is a subsidiary that is **not**:

- An insurance company  
- A securities dealer  
- A subsidiary of an insurance company or securities dealer  

> Thus, only certain subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investment firms, infrastructure companies) are subject to the investment limits.

---

## 🔢 Prescribed Percentages

- **Section 476 and 477**: The prescribed percentage is **70%**.  
  → This means that if a bank or its prescribed subsidiary holds more than 70% of a real property entity, it may be subject to investment limits.

- **Section 478**: The prescribed percentage is **100%**.  
  → This applies when a bank or its subsidiary has full ownership (100%) in a real property entity.

> These thresholds help determine whether a bank has a "substantial" or "controlling" interest in a real property entity.

---

## 💰 Valuation of Participating Shares & Ownership Interests

For sections 477 and 478, the **value of participating shares and ownership interests** beneficially owned by a bank or its subsidiaries is equal to their **book value** as reported on the **consolidated balance sheet** of the bank.

> This ensures that valuation is consistent with financial reporting and avoids overvaluation or subjectivity.

### 1. **Direct Ownership**
- Real property beneficially owned by the bank or a designated entity controlled by the bank  
- A debt obligation issued to finance or improve real property, where the bank or its controlled entity is liable

> **Valuation**:  
> - For real property: book value  
> - For debt obligation: amount by which the book value of the debt exceeds the book value of the real property

---

### 2. **Interests via Joint Ventures or Related Entities**
- Real property beneficially owned by a **related real property entity** that is a **joint venture**  
- Shares/ownership interests in a related real property entity (not a joint venture)

> - For real property: book value  
> - For shares/interests: book value of those shares/interests

---

- Loan to a real property entity controlled by another real property entity (as defined)

> **Valuation**:  
> - For debt/loan: book value  
> - For **guaranteed debt/loan**:  
>   - If the entity owns real property (and is an interest of the bank), then:  
>     → *Amount by which face value of guarantee exceeds value of real property*  
>   - Otherwise: face value of the guarantee
