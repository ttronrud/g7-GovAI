The provided text consists of four repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2011-16, s. 4]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by **SOR/2011-16, section 4**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument No. 2011-16**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR – Statutory Orders).
- **Section of the Repealing Instrument**: The repeal specifically targets **Section 4** of SOR/2011-16.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or provisions previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer valid** under current law. Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals who previously relied on that regulation must now refer to updated or alternative legislation.

### Contextual Notes:
- SOR/2011-16 is a statutory instrument that typically contains amendments or repeals to existing regulations.
- The repetition of the same entry four times may be due to formatting or data entry errors, but it does not imply multiple distinct regulations were repealed — rather, it reflects the same repeal notice being listed multiple times.
- Since the regulation itself is not provided, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice. Without the original regulation's content, we cannot describe its prior scope or purpose.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially removed from the legal framework** by **SOR/2011-16, section 4**. It is no longer enforceable, and any prior references to it must be disregarded in legal or administrative contexts. For accurate interpretation of current law, one must consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, which may have been replaced or amended by subsequent legislation.
