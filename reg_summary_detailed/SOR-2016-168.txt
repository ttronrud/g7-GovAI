The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2018-82, s. 4]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2018-82, section 4**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2018-82*, section 4
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted in 2018, as indicated by the SOR (Statutory Rules) reference.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The specific regulation being referenced is no longer in force. It was a provision that had previously governed certain aspects of regulation, likely related to licensing, safety, or administrative procedures — however, the exact subject matter is not specified in the reference alone.

### Interpretation of the Reference:
- "SOR/2018-82" refers to a Statutory Instrument published in 2018, which amends or repeals existing regulations.
- "s. 4" means Section 4 of that instrument.
- The fact that the regulation is listed four times as "[Repealed, SOR/2018-82, s. 4]" indicates that this section of the instrument formally repealed a prior regulation (or set of provisions) that had previously been in effect.

### Implications:
- Any legal or operational requirements previously derived from this regulation are **no longer valid**.
- Entities or individuals who were previously subject to its rules must now refer to current, active regulations that have replaced it (if any).
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory reform, streamlining, or modernization effort.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active, enforceable regulation** currently in force under the reference "[Repealed, SOR/2018-82, s. 4]" because it has been formally canceled. The detailed content of the original regulation — such as the specific rules, definitions, or enforcement mechanisms — is no longer available in current law, as it was superseded or removed by the 2018 Statutory Instrument.

To determine what regulation was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of **SOR/2018-82**, particularly **Section 4**, which would identify the prior regulation being repealed and provide context for the change.
