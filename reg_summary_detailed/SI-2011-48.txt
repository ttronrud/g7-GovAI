The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-13"** — indicates that the specific legislative instrument (Statutory Instrument) numbered **SI 2015/13** has been **repealed** (officially cancelled or withdrawn) by subsequent legislation or administrative action.

However, **no detailed content** of SI 2015/13 is provided in your query, and as such, a detailed summary of its original provisions cannot be offered without access to the full text of the instrument.

### General Interpretation of "Repealed, SI/2015-13":

- **SI/2015-13** refers to a Statutory Instrument issued in the United Kingdom in 2015 (specifically, the 13th Statutory Instrument of that year).
- The designation "Repealed" means that this instrument is no longer in force and has been formally cancelled.
- The repeal may have occurred due to:
  - A new law replacing it (e.g., a primary or secondary act).
  - A decision by the government to remove outdated, redundant, or conflicting provisions.
  - A change in policy or administrative structure.

### How to Find the Original Content:
To obtain a detailed summary of the original SI 2015/13, you would need to consult:
- The **UK Parliament's official legislation website** (https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
- Search for **"SI 2015/13"** and check if it was repealed by another instrument (e.g., SI 2015/XX or a statute).
- Look for the **title and subject matter** of the original instrument (e.g., it may have been related to health, environment, education, or transport).

### Example (Hypothetical):
If SI 2015/13 had been titled *"The Health and Safety at Work (Amendment) Regulations 2015"*, a summary might include:
- Amendments to workplace safety standards.
- New requirements for risk assessments.
- Changes to reporting procedures for workplace incidents.
- Repealed due to being superseded by the *Health and Safety (Workplace Safety) Act 2016*.

But **without the actual text or title of SI 2015/13**, this remains speculative.

### Conclusion:
**There is no detailed summary available for SI/2015/13 as it is listed only as "Repealed" and no content is provided.** To obtain a detailed summary, you must identify the full title and subject of the original Statutory Instrument (e.g., "The X Regulations 2015") and access its full text through official UK legislation databases.
