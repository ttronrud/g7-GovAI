  - Paragraph (b) of the definition “deputy head” in subsection 2(1) of the Act

**1. Designation of the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA) as a Department**

Under paragraph (b) of the definition of “department” in subsection 2(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act*, a department is defined as an agency or organization that is established under a federal statute and is responsible for carrying out public service functions in a manner consistent with the principles of public administration.

On August 6, 2021, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, formally designated the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)** as a **department** for the purposes of the Public Service Employment Act.

**Significance of this designation:**
- PEDA is now subject to the full scope of employment regulations, policies, and oversight mechanisms established under the PSEA.
- This includes the application of public service employment standards, such as:
  - Employment equity and diversity requirements
  - Pay equity and compensation policies
  - Recruitment, promotion, and performance management practices
  - Protection of public service employees’ rights and responsibilities
- The designation affirms PEDA’s status as a core federal institution within the public service, with the same legal and administrative standing as other departments (e.g., Environment and Climate Change Canada, Health Canada).
- It enables PEDA to operate under the same employment framework as other departments, ensuring consistency in governance, accountability, and workforce management.

**2. Designation of the President of PEDA as the Deputy Head**

Pursuant to paragraph (b) of the definition of “deputy head” in subsection 2(1) of the PSEA, a deputy head is defined as the individual who exercises the authority and responsibility for the management and administration of a department or agency.

On the same date (August 6, 2021), the **President of the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada** was formally designated as the **deputy head of PEDA** for the purposes of the Public Service Employment Act.

**Significance of this designation:**
- The President now holds formal authority and responsibility for the management and operational leadership of PEDA.
- This includes:
  - Overseeing the agency’s programs and strategic direction
  - Managing human resources, including hiring, performance evaluations, and disciplinary actions
  - Ensuring compliance with public service employment standards and accountability requirements
- The designation aligns the leadership structure of PEDA with the formal public service hierarchy, reinforcing transparency and accountability.
- It ensures that the President is recognized as the principal officer responsible for the agency’s day-to-day operations under the PSEA framework.

**Additional Context from S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13**

These provisions (from the *Public Service Employment Act* and related enabling legislation) provide the legal foundation for:
- The establishment of formal deputy heads in public agencies
- The application of public service employment laws to designated agencies
- The integration of such agencies into the broader federal public service structure

They ensure that agencies like PEDA, even if not traditionally classified as departments, can be brought into the formal public service employment regime when they meet certain criteria—such as statutory establishment and public service function.

**Conclusion**

This regulation, effective August 6, 2021, formally integrates the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada into the federal public service framework by:
1. **Designating PEDA as a department** under the Public Service Employment Act, thereby subjecting it to all employment standards and governance rules applicable to departments.
2. **Appointing the President of PEDA as the deputy head**, thereby establishing a clear leadership structure and accountability mechanism under the Act.

This move strengthens the institutional legitimacy of PEDA, enhances workforce management practices, and ensures that its operations align with federal public service standards in terms of equity, transparency, and accountability.

**Note:** This regulation does not alter the agency’s mandate or funding, nor does it change its operational goals. It primarily affects the administrative and employment governance structure of PEDA under the Public Service Employment Act.
