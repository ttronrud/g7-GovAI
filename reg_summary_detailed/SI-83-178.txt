**Detailed Summary of the Airline Guide Catalogue Remission Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
The regulation, known as the **Airline Guide Catalogue Remission Order**, is issued under the authority of **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. It is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**. 

The primary purpose of this order is to provide **remission (i.e., relief or cancellation) of customs duties and part of the sales tax** on specific imported goods—official airline guide catalogues—imported by **Professional Courier Limited**, a company based in **Mississauga, Ontario**.

This action is taken in the **public interest**, reflecting a policy consideration to support or promote specific commercial activities that may have economic or operational justifications, such as the distribution of essential industry information (e.g., airline itineraries, pricing, and services) to professionals.

### **2. Scope of the Remission**

#### **A. Customs Duty Remission**
- **Who**: Professional Courier Limited, Mississauga, Ontario.
- **What**: A remission of **customs duties** that were paid or are payable under the **Customs Tariff**.
- **When**: Applies to airline guide catalogues imported **on and after June 1, 1983**.

> This means that any official airline guide catalogue imported by the company from that date onward will be exempt from the customs duty that would otherwise be due on the goods.

#### **B. Sales Tax Remission (Partial)**
- **What**: A partial remission of **sales tax** (under the *Excise Tax Act*) is granted on the same catalogues for which customs duty is remitted.
- **How much**: The amount of sales tax remitted is calculated as the **difference between**:
  1. The **actual sales tax payable** on the catalogues, based on their **duty-paid value** (i.e., the value of the goods including customs duty), and  
  2. The **sales tax that would have been payable** if the **duty-paid value had been reduced** by the amount of the customs duty remission.

> In simpler terms:  
> If the customs duty had been paid, the sales tax would have been calculated on a higher value. By remitting the customs duty, the value used to compute sales tax is reduced, which results in a lower sales tax. The remission compensates for this difference—effectively reducing the total tax burden by the amount of the savings due to the duty reduction.

> Example:  
> - Original value of catalogue: $100  
> - Customs duty: $10 (paid) → duty-paid value = $110  
> - Sales tax at 10%: $11  
> - If customs duty is remitted (i.e., $10 not paid), duty-paid value = $100  
> - Sales tax at 10%: $10  
> - Remission amount = $11 – $10 = $1  

Thus, the **sales tax remission is equal to the tax savings** achieved by reducing the duty-paid value.

### **3. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue** within **two years from the date of importation** of the catalogues.

- This is a strict time limit: **no claims will be accepted after two years**.
- The claim must be submitted **in a timely manner** and must include proper documentation or evidence of importation and the relevant details of the goods.

> This condition ensures that the government can manage administrative costs and maintain accountability, while also encouraging prompt action by importers.

### **4. Legal Basis and Citation**

- The order is made under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to issue orders for the remission of taxes or duties in the public interest.
- The order may be cited as: **The Airline Guide Catalogue Remission Order**.

### **5. Key Implications and Rationale**

- **Economic Justification**: The remission supports the distribution of official airline information, which is essential for professionals (e.g., travel agents, tour operators, logistics planners) to provide accurate services.
- **Fairness**: It prevents a double tax burden—customs duty and sales tax—on goods that are informational in nature and not consumed as final consumer products.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: By remitting both customs and sales tax, the government streamlines the process and avoids the need for importers to pay taxes on goods that are not intended for resale or consumption by the general public.
- **Targeted Policy**: The order is narrowly focused—only applies to **official airline guide catalogues** imported by **one specific company**, which reflects a targeted intervention rather than broad tax relief.

### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Any catalogues imported before June 1, 1983.
  - Any catalogues imported by other companies.
  - Any non-official or non-authorized airline guide catalogues.
- The remission is **not a blanket exemption** but is conditional and limited to the specified time frame and circumstances.

### **Conclusion**

The **Airline Guide Catalogue Remission Order** is a targeted, legally sound, and economically justified measure that provides relief from customs and sales taxes for specific imported informational goods. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and public interest, ensuring that essential business information can be distributed without undue financial burden on a specific importer. The two-year claim window ensures accountability and administrative feasibility.

This order serves as a model for future targeted tax remissions in the public interest, particularly where goods are informational, non-consumable, and vital to professional services.
