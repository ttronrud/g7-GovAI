### **Detailed Summary of the Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999**

The **Onshore Pipeline Regulations, 1999**, made under **subsection 48(2) of the National Energy Board Act**, are a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the **National Energy Board (NEB)** — now succeeded by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)** — to ensure the **safety, security, and environmental protection** of onshore hydrocarbon pipelines in Canada. These regulations came into force on **May 26, 1999**, and apply to all onshore pipelines designed, constructed, operated, or abandoned after that date.

---

## **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**

- The regulations were issued by the **National Energy Board** under its statutory authority under **subsection 48(2)** of the *National Energy Board Act*.
- The **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Natural Resources**, formally approved the regulations.
- The regulations are part of a broader regulatory regime under the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act (Act)**, which governs energy infrastructure, including pipelines.

---

## **2. Scope and Applicability**

### **Applicable Entities and Activities**
- The regulations apply to:
  - Onshore pipelines (pipelines not located in offshore areas).
  - Activities including **design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, deactivation, and abandonment** of such pipelines.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Does **not apply** to hydrocarbon processing plants, which are governed by separate regulations — the *Canadian Energy Regulator Processing Plant Regulations*.
  - Does **not apply** to pipelines or parts of pipelines that:
    - Existed prior to the coming into force of these regulations; or
    - Had an authorization to construct, maintain, or repair issued **on or before** the regulation’s effective date.

> **Effective Date Principle**: Only pipelines designed, constructed, operated, or abandoned *after May 26, 1999* are subject to these rules.

## **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Abandon** | Permanent cessation of operations leading to discontinuance of service. |
| **Decommission** | Temporary removal from service (not resulting in service discontinuation). |
| **Deactivate** | Temporary removal from service. |
| **Change of Service** | Switching fluid types requiring updates to design per **CSA Z662**. |
| **Class Location** | As defined in **CSA Z662**, indicating hazard level (e.g., high-traffic areas). |
| **Component** | Any part of the pipeline system (e.g., valves, fittings). |
| **CSA Standards** | Key standards referenced: Z662 (pipeline design), Z276 (LNG), Z341 (underground storage), Z246.1 (security). |
| **Incident** | Includes death, serious injury, environmental harm, uncontrolled releases, or operation beyond design limits. |
| **Serious Injury** | Includes amputation, third-degree burns, blindness, internal bleeding, unconsciousness, etc. |
| **Release** | Any discharge, spill, leak, or emission of hydrocarbons. |
| **Toxic Substance** | Any substance that poses immediate or long-term danger to environment or human health. |
| **Station** | Facilities such as pumping, compression, storage, metering, or delivery points. |
| **Storage Facility** | Includes land and associated infrastructure for storing oil. |
| **Operate** | Encompasses repair, maintenance, deactivation, reactivation, and decommissioning. |

## **4. Compliance with Standards**

A company must ensure that its pipeline design, construction, operation, or abandonment complies with:

- **CSA Z662** – For all pipelines transporting **liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons**.
- **CSA Z276** – If transporting **liquefied natural gas (LNG)**.
- **CSA Z341** – For **underground hydrocarbon storage**.
- **CSA Z246.1** – For **security management** of all pipelines.

> **Hierarchy of Standards**: If there is a conflict between these regulations and a referenced CSA standard, **the Regulations prevail**.

> **Design Approval Process**: For any design, specification, program, manual, or procedure not covered by a standard, the company must submit it to the **Regulator for approval**.

> **Approval Criteria**:
> - Must provide at least the same level of safety as a comparable CSA standard, or
> - If no comparable standard exists, must provide an **adequate level of safety** in the specific context.

## **5. Management System Requirements**

This is the **core of the regulation** — a mandatory **comprehensive safety and environmental management system** that companies must establish and maintain.

### **Key Requirements of the Management System**:

#### a. **Structure and Scope**
- Must be **explicit, comprehensive, and proactive**.
- Must integrate operational activities with **human and financial resources**.
- Must cover all aspects of pipeline lifecycle: **design, construction, operation, maintenance, abandonment**.
- Must ensure **coordination among programs** (e.g., hazard identification, training, emergency response).

#### b. **Implementation Timeline**
- Must be established **within 90 days** of receiving a certificate or order to construct or operate a pipeline.

#### c. **Appointing an Accountable Officer**
- A designated **accountable officer** must be appointed to oversee compliance with the management system and all regulatory obligations.
- The officer must:
  - Submit a **signed statement of acceptance** of responsibilities within **30 days** of appointment.
  - Have **authority over human and financial resources** needed to implement the system.
  - Ensure activities are conducted safely and in compliance.

#### d. **Policies and Goals**
- Must establish documented **policies and goals**, including:
  - A policy for **internal reporting of hazards, incidents, and near-misses** — with **immunity from disciplinary action** under certain circumstances (e.g., reporting unsafe conditions).
  - Goals for preventing:
    - Ruptures
    - Liquid/gas releases
    - Fatalities and injuries
    - Incidents and emergencies

#### e. **Organizational Structure**
- Must have a **clear, documented organizational structure** that:
  - Defines roles, responsibilities, and authority at all levels.
  - Demonstrates annually that allocated human resources are sufficient to meet obligations.

## **6. Required Processes and Systems**

The company must implement a full suite of internal processes to manage safety, security, and environmental protection. These include:

| Process | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment** | Identify and analyze all hazards and potential hazards (normal and abnormal conditions). Maintain an inventory. |
| **Risk Evaluation** | Assess risks associated with identified hazards. |
| **Control Implementation** | Develop and enforce controls to prevent, manage, and mitigate risks. Communicate controls to affected personnel. |
| **Legal Compliance Monitoring** | Identify, track, and manage all applicable legal requirements (safety, security, environment). Maintain a list. |
| **Change Management** | Monitor and manage changes that could affect safety, security, or environment — including design changes, procedures, or organizational shifts. |
| **Competency & Training** | Develop training programs and verify employee competence. Supervise performance. |
| **Communication Processes** | Ensure internal and external communication of safety, security, and environmental information. |
| **Document Management** | Identify, prepare, review, revise, and control all required documents. Obtain approval from the Regulator where necessary. |
| **Record Keeping** | Generate, retain, and maintain records of system implementation. Provide access to authorized personnel. |
| **Coordination of Operations** | Ensure employees are aware of others’ activities and have necessary information to perform safely. |
| **Internal Reporting & Corrective Action** | Encourage reporting of hazards, incidents, near-misses; take corrective and preventive actions, including for **imminent hazards**. |
| **Data Management System** | Monitor and analyze trends in incidents, hazards, and near-misses. |

## **7. Annual Reporting and Compliance Monitoring**

- A company must prepare and submit an **annual report** signed by the **accountable officer** by **April 30** each year.
- The report must describe:
  1. Performance in achieving goals, objectives, and targets (evaluated using performance measures).
  2. Effectiveness of the management system (evaluated through internal review processes).
  3. Actions taken to correct deficiencies identified in the **quality assurance program**.

> This ensures **transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement**.
