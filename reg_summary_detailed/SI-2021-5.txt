### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

#### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under **subsection 83.05(1)d** and **83.05(8.1)a** of the **Criminal Code of Canada (R.S.C., c. C-46)**, as amended by **S.C. 2019, c. 13, s. 141**, and further referenced in **SOR/2002-284**.

The regulation is part of Canada’s national effort to combat terrorism by maintaining a **list of entities designated as terrorist organizations**. These designations are critical tools for restricting financial transactions, blocking assets, and preventing the financing of terrorist activities.

---

#### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- **Confirm and reaffirm the status** of specific terrorist entities as "listed entities" under Canadian law.
- Provide **legal justification** for continued restrictions on these groups based on credible evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities.
- Ensure that the **designations remain valid and enforceable**, even after periodic reviews, due to ongoing reasonable grounds for suspicion.

---

#### **Key Provisions and Legal Justification**

1. **Review and Determination by the Minister**  
   Pursuant to **subsection 83.05(8.1)a**, the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** conducted a comprehensive review of each entity listed in the **Annexed Schedule** (not shown here but referenced in the regulation).  
   The review was based on the criteria established in **subsection 83.05(1)d**, which requires that there be **reasonable grounds to believe** that an entity:
   - Has **knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated** a terrorist activity;
   - Or has **knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** another entity engaged in such activity.

2. **Administrative Approval by the Administrator in Council**  
   Based on the Minister’s findings, the **Administrator in Council** (the highest decision-making body of the Government of Canada) has formally accepted the recommendation.  
   This decision is not arbitrary—it is grounded in **objective, verifiable, and credible evidence** of terrorist links and actions.

3. **Continuation of Designation**  
   The regulation **upholds the status** of each listed entity as a terrorist organization. It does **not** remove or downgrade any designation; instead, it confirms that the **reasons for listing remain valid and sufficient** under current legal standards.

#### **Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Financial and Operational Restrictions**  
   Being listed under Canadian law means that:
   - Canadian financial institutions **cannot engage in transactions** with these entities.
   - Canadian citizens or companies **cannot provide financial support** or facilitate any form of funding.
   - Assets of these entities **may be frozen** or subject to seizure.

2. **International Cooperation**  
   This designation supports Canada’s participation in **international counter-terrorism efforts**, including coordination with the **United Nations**, **EU**, **U.S.**, and other allies through shared intelligence and sanctions regimes.

3. **Ongoing Monitoring and Review**  
   The designation is **not permanent**. The Minister is required to **re-evaluate** these entities periodically. The current decision is based on **current evidence**, and future reviews will determine whether the reasonable grounds for listing continue.

4. **Legal Accountability**  
   The regulation establishes a **clear chain of authority**:
   - Minister conducts review → Recommends continuation → Administrator in Council approves → Designation is legally binding.

#### **Significance and Broader Context**

- **Global Relevance**: These groups are active or have been active in conflict zones such as **Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Arabian Peninsula**.
- **Terrorism Trends**: The inclusion of **ISKP** and **AQIS** reflects Canada’s concern about the **geographic expansion** of al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates into South and South-East Asia.
- **Evolution of Terrorist Networks**: The use of **multiple aliases** underscores how terrorist groups rebrand and restructure to evade detection and maintain operational resilience.

---

#### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a **formal, legally binding confirmation** that the following terrorist entities—Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, Al-Ashtar Brigades, Fatemiyoun Division, Islamic State – Khorasan Province, Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, Al Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, and Al Shabaab—**remain subject to Canadian sanctions and restrictions** due to **reasonable grounds** for believing they have engaged in or supported terrorist activities.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to:
- Preventing terrorist financing,
- Protecting national security,
- Enforcing international counter-terrorism norms,
- And maintaining a dynamic, evidence-based approach to terrorist entity listings.

The decision is both **proactive and precautionary**, ensuring that Canada remains vigilant against evolving threats from global terrorist networks.
