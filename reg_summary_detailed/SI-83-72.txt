### **Detailed Summary of the Pari-Mutuel Payments Order (SI/81-1, 1981)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulation is issued under **subsection 188(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada**.
- It is authorized by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board**.
- This means the government, through its executive branch, has the power to revoke or amend regulations related to criminal law enforcement matters, specifically those involving financial oversight of betting systems.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary purpose is to **revoke an outdated Order in Council** (P.C. 1980-3512) that governed payments for the supervision of **pari-mutuel systems of betting**.
- The new Order replaces the 1980 regulation with a **modernized and updated framework** for determining the payments due to authorities or entities responsible for supervising pari-mutuel betting systems.
- The revised Order is effective **April 1, 1983**.

#### **3. Scope and Application**
- The Order applies specifically to **pari-mutuel systems of betting**, which are systems where the payout is determined by a pool of bets placed by the public (commonly seen in horse racing, greyhound racing, and other forms of sports betting).
- It establishes a **clear, standardized mechanism** for calculating and making payments to the government or designated bodies for the **supervision and oversight** of these systems.

#### **4. Key Provision: The "Fixed Fraction"**
- For the purposes of subsection 188(4) of the Criminal Code, the regulation establishes a **fixed fraction** of **eight-tenths of one per cent (0.8%)**.
- This fraction is used as a **proportionate rate** to determine the amount of payment due to the government or supervising authority from the total revenue generated by pari-mutuel betting systems.
- In essence, **0.8% of the gross revenue** from pari-mutuel betting operations is designated as a payment to be made to the government for supervision.

> This fraction serves as a **legal benchmark** under criminal law provisions, ensuring that any financial transaction related to betting supervision is transparent, predictable, and legally enforceable.

#### **5. Legal Citation and Publication**
- The Order is officially cited as the **Pari-Mutuel Payments Order**.
- It was published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, page 105**, on **January 1, 1981** (SI/81-1).
- This publication in the Gazette makes the Order **legally enforceable and publicly accessible**.

#### **6. Historical Context**
- The original P.C. 1980-3512 Order (issued on December 19, 1980) was likely outdated or no longer aligned with evolving regulatory, financial, or legal standards.
- The 1981 revocation and replacement reflect a **policy update** to modernize the financial oversight of betting operations, ensuring consistency with current practices and legal frameworks.

#### **7. Implications**
- **Transparency**: The fixed 0.8% rate ensures transparency in how supervision payments are calculated.
- **Predictability**: Operators and regulators can anticipate the financial obligations associated with operating pari-mutuel systems.
- **Legal Compliance**: The use of a fixed fraction under subsection 188(4) of the Criminal Code strengthens legal compliance, as it provides a clear, non-arbitrary basis for financial obligations tied to criminal or regulatory oversight.

### **Conclusion**
The **Pari-Mutuel Payments Order (SI/81-1, 1981)** is a legally binding regulation that:
- Revokes an older, outdated order governing payments for pari-mutuel betting supervision,
- Introduces a new, standardized payment mechanism (0.8% of gross revenue),
- Is effective from **April 1, 1983**,
- Is grounded in **section 188(4) of the Criminal Code**, which provides the legal basis for such financial oversight arrangements.

This regulation ensures that the government receives a consistent and legally defined share of revenue from pari-mutuel betting operations in exchange for regulatory supervision, promoting accountability, transparency, and legal integrity in the industry.
