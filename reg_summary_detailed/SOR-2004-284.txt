**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (Subsection 4(1) and Paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2004-1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
This exemption order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**.  
- **Statutory Basis**: The order is grounded in the *Radiocommunication Act*, specifically subsection 3(2)a, which allows for temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.  
- **Reference to Statutes**:  
  - S.C. 2004, c. 7, s. 37(2): Provides the legal basis for the issuance of the exemption.  
  - S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2: Establishes the general framework for exemptions under the Act.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant a temporary exemption** from two key provisions of the *Radiocommunication Act*:
- **Subsection 4(1)**: Prohibits the intentional interference with or obstruction of radiocommunications without authorization.
- **Paragraph 9(1)(b)**: Prohibits the use of radio apparatus to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications, except under specific, authorized circumstances.

The exemption is granted **for security, safety, or international relations** purposes — a narrow and high-level justification requiring exceptional justification.

### **3. Scope of the Exemption**

#### **(a) Time Period**
- The exemption is **temporary**, effective from **November 30, 2004**, to **December 2, 2004** (a period of 48 hours).
- This limited duration ensures that the exemption is used only in urgent, time-sensitive situations.

#### **(b) Geographic Scope**
The exemption applies only within specific geographic boundaries:

##### **1. Ontario and Quebec**
A rectangular area defined by the following coordinates:
- **NW Corner**: 45.8°N latitude, 76.4°W longitude  
- **NE Corner**: 45.8°N latitude, 75.3°E longitude  
- **SE Corner**: 45.0°S latitude, 75.3°E longitude  
- **SW Corner**: 45.0°S latitude, 76.4°W longitude  

> ⚠️ **Note**: This area spans from northern Ontario and Quebec down to near the southern edge of the region, extending into the southern part of the Great Lakes and bordering the U.S. This area includes parts of the Canadian Shield and border regions.

##### **2. Nova Scotia**
A separate rectangular area defined by:
- **NW Corner**: 45.0°N latitude, 63.8°W longitude  
- **NE Corner**: 45.0°N latitude, 63.4°E longitude  
- **SE Corner**: 44.4°S latitude, 63.4°E longitude  
- **SW Corner**: 44.4°S latitude, 63.8°W longitude  

> ⚠️ **Note**: This area covers the central and eastern parts of Nova Scotia, including coastal regions and the Halifax area. The southern boundary (44.4°S) is geographically incorrect — **44.4°S is far south of Nova Scotia**, which lies entirely between 44°N and 46°N.  
> 🔍 **Likely Error or Typo**: The southern boundary of Nova Scotia should be **44.4°N**, not 44.4°S. This appears to be a **critical error in the original text**, possibly a typographical or transcription mistake.  
> ✅ **Interpretation**: The intended area is likely the **northern and central part of Nova Scotia**, and the southern latitude should be **44.4°N**, not 44.4°S. This is a significant flaw in the Order’s drafting.

### **4. Conditions for Exemption**

#### **(a) Subsection 4(1) Exemption**
- Applies **only if** the radio apparatus is used to:
  - **Interfere with or obstruct** a radiocommunication,
  - **In accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order,
  - And **for the purpose of security, safety, or international relations**.

#### **(b) Paragraph 9(1)(b) Exemption**
- Applies **only if** the interference or obstruction is:
  - Done for the purposes of **security, safety, or international relations**.

> 🔍 **Key Point**: The exemption is **not a blanket permission** to interfere with radio signals. It is strictly tied to specific, legitimate national interests.

---

### **5. Proportionality and Minimization Requirement**
To ensure responsible use and minimize unintended harm:
- **Every reasonable effort must be made** to:
  - **Confining interference** to the **smallest possible physical area**,
  - Limiting the number of **affected frequencies**,
  - Reducing the **duration** of the interference to the **absolute minimum** required to achieve the stated objective.

> ✅ This principle reflects a **proportionality requirement**, ensuring that the government does not overreach or cause unnecessary disruption to legitimate radio services (e.g., emergency communications, aviation, or public broadcasting).

---

### **6. Responsible Authority**
- The exemption is exercised by **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- The RCMP is the designated authority responsible for carrying out the interference or obstruction activities under this Order.

> ⚠️ This indicates that the operation is **state-sanctioned and closely monitored**, likely in response to a national emergency, threat, or diplomatic necessity.

---

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette*).

---

### **8. Key Observations and Implications**

| Aspect | Summary |
|-------|--------|
| **Temporary Nature** | Only valid for 48 hours — designed for urgent, short-term actions. |
| **Geographic Limitation** | Clearly defined zones, though a **critical error exists in Nova Scotia's southern boundary** (44.4°S instead of 44.4°N). |
| **Strict Justification** | Exemption is only valid for **security, safety, or international relations** — not for any other reason. |
| **Proportionality** | Mandates minimal impact — prevents widespread or indiscriminate interference. |
| **Enforcement Body** | RCMP is the only authorized entity to use the exemption — ensures accountability. |
| **Legal Precedent** | This Order exemplifies how Canada balances the need for national security with the protection of radio spectrum rights. |

### **9. Potential Issues and Concerns**
- **Geographic Inaccuracy**: The inclusion of 44.4°S latitude in Nova Scotia is **geographically impossible** — Nova Scotia lies entirely between 44°N and 46°N. This error may have resulted in a misinterpretation of the area or a typo during drafting.  
  > ✅ Recommendation: The Order should be corrected to reflect **44.4°N** as the southern boundary.
- **Lack of Public Notification**: No public notice or justification for the specific event or threat is provided in the Order — raising transparency concerns.
- **No Post-Event Review**: There is no provision for review or reporting after the exemption is used, limiting accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**

This exemption Order is a **temporary, narrowly scoped authorization** allowing the **RCMP** to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications in specific regions of Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia — for **security, safety, or international relations** — during a 48-hour window in late November 2004.

It reflects Canada’s ability to invoke emergency powers under the Radiocommunication Act to protect national interests, but it does so with **strict limitations** to prevent abuse and minimize disruption. However, the **geographic error in Nova Scotia** undermines the validity and clarity of the Order and must be corrected.

> 🔍 **Overall Assessment**: A legally sound, operationally limited exemption under emergency provisions — but requires correction of a critical drafting error to be fully valid and enforceable.

--- 

**Final Note**: This Order is a historical document, likely issued in response to a specific incident (e.g., a national security threat, a border dispute, or an emergency involving foreign communication intercepts). Its existence demonstrates the balance between regulatory compliance and national security needs in Canadian telecommunications policy.
