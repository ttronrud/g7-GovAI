**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation is a formal administrative designation issued under the **Canada Wildlife Act**, specifically pursuant to **subsection 4(1)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to assign public lands for wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation.

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, a constitutional body that acts on the advice of the federal government.
- The authority stems from **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**, which allows the federal government to designate and assign public lands for the purposes of:
  - Wildlife research
  - Conservation
  - Interpretation (i.e., public education and awareness about wildlife and ecosystems)

This provision enables the federal government to ensure that lands critical to the protection and understanding of wildlife are managed effectively by a designated authority—here, the **Minister of the Environment**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Designation**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **designate specific public lands** as part of a **national wildlife area** and a **sanctuary unit**, with the goal of:
- Protecting and preserving natural habitats
- Supporting scientific research on wildlife populations
- Enabling public interpretation and environmental education
- Ensuring long-term conservation of biodiversity and ecological integrity

The lands are deemed essential for these purposes, and the Governor General in Council has concluded that they are **required** for such activities.

### **3. Designated Lands**
The regulation identifies two specific parcels of land located in **Nova Scotia**, within the **County of Cumberland**:

#### a) **Chignecto National Wildlife Area**
- A designated **National Wildlife Area (NWA)** under federal jurisdiction.
- This area is established to protect and manage wildlife habitats, particularly those of migratory species and native flora and fauna.

#### b) **Amherst Point Sanctuary Unit**
- A **sanctuary unit** within the broader Chignecto area.
- Sanctuary units are typically established to provide protected spaces for wildlife, often with a focus on habitat restoration, species recovery, and public engagement.

### **4. Geographic Description**
- The lands are described in **plan 66108** of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records**, maintained at Ottawa.
- The boundaries are defined by a **heavy line** on the survey plan.
- This precise geographic description ensures clarity and legal enforceability of the land boundaries.

---

### **5. Area and Size**
- The total area of the two parcels is **409.56 hectares** (approximately **1,012 acres**).
- The measurement is stated as "more or less," acknowledging minor variations due to surveying or land boundary adjustments.

---

### **6. Management and Control**
- Upon issuance of this regulation, the **Minister of the Environment** is assigned full responsibility for:
  - **Administration** (day-to-day management)
  - **Management** (planning, monitoring, and implementation of conservation strategies)
  - **Control** (regulating access, use, and activities on the land to ensure conservation goals are met)

This includes the authority to:
- Enforce environmental protection measures
- Permit or restrict public access
- Coordinate with local stakeholders and Indigenous communities
- Conduct or support research and educational programs

---

### **7. Jurisdiction and Significance**
- The regulation applies in the **Province of Nova Scotia**, specifically within the **County of Cumberland**.
- As a federal designation, the Chignecto National Wildlife Area and the Amherst Point Sanctuary Unit fall under **federal jurisdiction** in terms of management and policy, even though they are located in a provincial province.
- This reflects the federal government’s role in protecting wildlife and ecosystems across Canada, especially in ecologically significant regions.

---

### **8. Implications**
- **Conservation Focus**: The designation ensures that these lands will be protected from development or inappropriate land use.
- **Research Opportunities**: Scientists and researchers may use the area for ecological studies, monitoring species populations, and assessing habitat health.
- **Public Access and Education**: Interpretation activities (e.g., guided tours, educational programs) may be developed to promote environmental awareness.
- **Legal Protection**: The land is now subject to federal environmental laws and protections, including restrictions on activities that could harm wildlife or habitats.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally establishes the **Chignecto National Wildlife Area** and the **Amherst Point Sanctuary Unit** as federally managed conservation areas in Nova Scotia. By assigning administrative, management, and control responsibilities to the **Minister of the Environment**, the federal government ensures that these lands will be preserved and used for wildlife research, conservation, and public education. The precise geographic description and legal basis under the Canada Wildlife Act provide a clear, enforceable framework for long-term environmental stewardship in this ecologically important region.
