It appears that you've started a request to provide a detailed summary of a regulation, but no specific regulation has been included in your message. Could you please provide the full text or reference to the regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the regulation (e.g., a statute, rule, executive order, or policy), I will offer a comprehensive, detailed summary covering key provisions, objectives, scope, applicability, definitions, requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and any relevant implications or context.

Please share the regulation you'd like summarized.
