- **Diverts river or stream flow**, affects currents, causes **siltation**, or reduces water depth;
- **Causes a nuisance**;
- **Injures persons or damages ships**;
- **Adversely affects sediment or water quality**.

This is a **core safety and environmental protection provision**, ensuring that all activities in the harbour do not compromise navigation, safety, or ecological integrity.

---

### **4. Response to Accidents or Pollutions**
If a person **drops, deposits, discharges, or spills**:
- Refuse, pollutants, cargo, ship gear, or other objects into the harbour,

They must:
1. **Immediately** make every **technically feasible and reasonable effort** to remove the substance.
2. **Notify a harbour official without delay**, providing:
   - Description of what was spilled/deposited;
   - Approximate location;
   - Efforts made to remove it.
3. **Submit a detailed written report** as soon as possible, including the same information.

> **Note**: If the person fails to remove the substance immediately, the **harbour official may take action** to remove it.

---

### **5. Fire and Safety Obligations**
Every person in a harbour must:
- Comply with **fire protection and prevention measures** established for the safety of persons and ships.
- These measures must take into account **all activities** occurring in the harbour.

> This ensures that fire risks are managed proactively in high-activity zones.

---

### **6. Emergency Situations and Exceptions**
Despite other provisions, a person may conduct an activity listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** (e.g., construction, maintenance, emergency response) **without a licence or contract** during an **emergency** if:
- The activity is **required** to prevent a threat to safety (persons or ships);
- The person **notifies the harbour official** (if practicable) about the activity and emergency;
- The person **submits a detailed written report** immediately explaining the emergency and the activity.

> This provides **flexibility during urgent situations** where formal authorizations may not be feasible.

---

### **7. Reporting Requirements for Emergencies**
If an activity **causes or is likely to cause** an emergency threatening safety, the person (or authorized party) must:
- **Notify the harbour official without delay**;
- Submit a **detailed written report** as soon as the emergency ends;
- If requested, provide a **copy of all reports** submitted to **municipal, provincial, and federal authorities**.

### **9. Authorizations for Activities (Schedule-Based Activities)**
#### **Column 1 of the Schedule** lists specific activities (e.g., construction, excavation, vessel operations) that may be conducted in a harbour.

##### **General Rule:**
- A person may conduct an activity in Column 1 **only if**:
  - They have a **written authorization** from:
    - The **Minister of National Defence** (via contract, lease, or licence); **or**
    - A **harbour official** (via formal authorization).

##### **Conditions for Authorizations:**
- If the activity is **likely to result in prohibited outcomes** (e.g., pollution, obstruction), the harbour official may:
  - **Set conditions** to mitigate or prevent those outcomes;
  - Post these conditions **prominently** (e.g., on signs, maps, forms) for public visibility.

> These conditions must be clearly communicated and **readily accessible**.

##### **No Authorization Without Conditions:**
- If an “X” is in **Column 2** (indicating the activity is restricted), **no one may conduct it** unless they comply with posted conditions.

> This ensures that high-risk activities are strictly regulated.

##### **Exceptions to Restrictions (Column 3):**
- A harbour official may authorize an activity in Column 1 **if**:
  - An “X” is in **Column 3** (indicating the activity is permitted under certain conditions); **or**
  - An “X” is in **Column 2** (restricted), **but** the person or entity cannot comply with the posted conditions (e.g., due to technical or operational constraints).

> This allows for **flexibility in rare or exceptional cases**.

---

### **10. Authorization Process (Section 15)**
When a person requests authorization to conduct an activity in Column 1, they must provide:
- Full **name and address**;
- Information relevant to the activity to assess risks (e.g., type, duration, location);
- **Proof of insurance** (with **adequate coverage**, naming **Her Majesty in right of Canada as an additional insured**, and requiring the insurer to notify the harbour official of policy changes);
- **Performance security** and/or **damage security** (financial guarantees) if required.

> These requirements ensure accountability and financial responsibility.

---

### **11. Conditions and Cancellation of Authorizations**
A harbour official may:
- **Cancel an authorization** if:
  - The activity results in or is likely to result in a prohibited outcome;
  - The authorization was based on **incorrect or misleading information**;
  - The person fails to comply with conditions.

- **Change conditions** of an authorization if circumstances change.

> Cancellation is effective at the **earliest of**:
1. End of **5 business days** after registered mail notice;
2. **Two hours** after facsimile or electronic transmission;
3. **Immediately** upon service (delivery) of notice.

> This ensures timely enforcement and prevents continued risk.

---

### **12. Enforcement Powers of the Harbour Official**
The harbour official may **instruct a person** to:
- **Cease the activity**;
- **Remove materials** brought into the harbour;
- **Return materials** removed from the harbour;
- **Restore affected property** to its original state.

> These actions must be taken **immediately**.

If the person fails to comply:
- The harbour official may **conduct the removal or restoration** and **store the materials**.

> This empowers authorities to act decisively when risks are present.

---

### **13. Regulatory Effectiveness and Entry into Force**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered**.
- They are **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province**.

> This ensures immediate legal effect and enforceability.
