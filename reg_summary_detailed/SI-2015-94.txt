The regulation you have provided is a formal government order that revises and updates the administrative structure for the **Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act** (CSIFA). Below is a detailed and accurate summary of the regulation, based on the language and context provided:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, under the authority granted by **section 2 of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act**. This section defines the role of the "Minister for the purposes of the Act," which is essential for the administration and oversight of the fund.

The regulation is effective from **November 4, 2015**, and is issued under the **Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 9, section 47**, which provides the legal basis for the Governor General to make such appointments or designations in relation to the CSIFA.

**2. Repeal of Prior Order**  
The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2014-376**, issued on **April 7, 2014** (also referenced as SI/2014-41). This prior order had previously established the ministerial designation responsible for administering the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund. By repealing it, the government removes the previous designation and eliminates any conflicting or outdated administrative arrangements.

This repeal reflects a change in ministerial responsibility, likely due to changes in government structure, cabinet reorganizations, or shifts in policy priorities related to infrastructure funding.

**3. Designation of the Minister for the Fund**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** as the **Minister for the purposes of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act**. This means that this minister is now the official responsible for:

- Overseeing the administration of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund;
- Approving funding decisions;
- Ensuring compliance with the Act’s requirements;
- Representing the federal government in matters related to infrastructure investment and funding allocation.

This designation is formalized within the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, a body that includes senior ministers who are authorized to act on behalf of the Crown in matters of policy and governance.

**4. Significance and Implications**  
- **Clarity in Accountability**: By clearly assigning the ministerial responsibility, the regulation ensures accountability and transparency in how public infrastructure funding is managed.
- **Policy Continuity**: Despite the change in ministerial title, the continuity of the fund’s operations is preserved, with the new designation ensuring that the fund remains under the stewardship of a senior minister with relevant expertise in infrastructure and community development.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: The repeal of the 2014 order streamlines the administrative framework, removing outdated or redundant provisions and aligning the fund’s governance with current government structures.

---

**5. Legal and Procedural Notes**  
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 47 of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund Act**, which allows the Governor General to designate a minister for administrative purposes.
- The designation is not a permanent appointment but a functional one, tied specifically to the operation of the fund.
- The change is effective as of **November 4, 2015**, and takes effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation marks a key administrative update to the governance of the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund. It removes an outdated ministerial designation (from 2014), and formally assigns responsibility to the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**. This ensures that the fund is managed by a minister with direct oversight of infrastructure policy, enhancing coordination, accountability, and policy alignment with national development goals.

It reflects the evolving nature of federal governance and the importance of clear ministerial roles in managing strategic public investments.
