**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Nechako River Population Order*

### **Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29, and is specifically authorized by the **recovery strategy** for the White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*) Nechako River population.

---

### **Background and Context:**

1. **Species Status:**  
   The White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Nechako River population is officially listed as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   The **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** jointly developed a **recovery strategy** for this population. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.

3. **Inclusion in Public Registry:**  
   The recovery strategy, including the identified critical habitat, has been formally published in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to information about the species and its needs.

4. **Exclusion of Certain Areas under SARA:**  
   Under **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, certain areas designated as **migratory bird sanctuaries** are exempt from being included in the critical habitat designation.  
   Specifically, **Part IX of the Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations** designates the **Nechako River Bird Sanctuary** as a protected area for migratory birds.

   Under **subsection 58(5)** of SARA, any portion of the critical habitat that lies within such a designated migratory bird sanctuary **must be excluded** from the official critical habitat designation. This exclusion is required to avoid conflicts between wildlife protections for fish and birds.

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Designation of Critical Habitat (with Exclusion):**  
   The Order designates the **critical habitat** of the White Sturgeon Nechako River population as identified in the recovery strategy — **except** for the portion located within the **Nechako River Bird Sanctuary**.

2. **Legal Exclusion of Sanctuary Area:**  
   The portion of the critical habitat that falls within the **Nechako River Bird Sanctuary** is **excluded** from the official critical habitat designation under subsection 58(5) of SARA. This exclusion is necessary because the sanctuary is protected under federal migratory bird regulations, and overlapping designations could lead to regulatory conflicts or impractical enforcement.

3. **Application of Subsection 58(1):**  
   Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the **remaining critical habitat** (i.e., the portion outside the Nechako River Bird Sanctuary). This means that:
   - The designated critical habitat (excluding the sanctuary area) is legally protected.
   - Any development, activity, or action that would result in the destruction, degradation, or disruption of this habitat is prohibited unless authorized under a permit or exemption.

4. **Repeal of Previous Order:**  
   The prior *Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Nechako River Population Order* (SOR/2016-84) is **repealed**. This indicates a revision or update to the legal framework, reflecting updated scientific understanding, regulatory changes, or the implementation of the new exclusion based on the migratory bird sanctuary designation.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which typically occurs shortly after publication.

### **Key Dates and Signatures:**

- **Gatineau, September 26, 2023** – Initial drafting or proposal.
- **Ottawa, February 7, 2024** – Finalized and issued version of the Order.

---

### **Purpose and Significance:**

- **Conservation of the White Sturgeon Population:**  
  The regulation ensures that the essential habitat required for the survival and recovery of the endangered White Sturgeon in the Nechako River is legally protected.

- **Balancing Species Protection:**  
  The exclusion of the Nechako River Bird Sanctuary portion reflects a **cooperative approach** to environmental management, recognizing the importance of protecting both fish and bird populations in shared ecosystems.

- **Compliance with SARA and Migratory Bird Regulations:**  
  The Order demonstrates how federal environmental laws work in tandem — respecting both species-specific protections (SARA) and broader ecological protections (Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations).

---

### **Implications for Stakeholders:**

- **Government Agencies:**  
  Must ensure that any projects (e.g., infrastructure, water management, land use) in or near the designated critical habitat do not harm the sturgeon population.

- **Indigenous Communities and Local Land Users:**  
  May be required to consult or obtain permits before engaging in activities that could impact the critical habitat.

- **Environmental Groups and Scientists:**  
  Can use the designation to advocate for habitat protection, monitor conditions, and support recovery efforts.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a legally binding, science-based framework for protecting the critical habitat of the endangered White Sturgeon Nechako River population. By excluding the area within the Nechako River Bird Sanctuary, it acknowledges the importance of shared ecological values and avoids regulatory overlap. It reflects a balanced, ecologically sound approach to biodiversity conservation under the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that both fish and bird species receive appropriate protection within their shared environment.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence:**  
The regulation designates critical habitat for the endangered White Sturgeon in the Nechako River, excluding the portion within the Nechako River Bird Sanctuary to comply with migratory bird protections under SARA, and comes into force upon registration.
