### **Overview**
Rule 64 – *Prerogative Writ* is a procedural rule adopted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to govern the use of **prerogative writs** in the context of **criminal proceedings** and **imprisonment**. It enables individuals to seek judicial intervention in matters where there is a perceived violation of legal rights or procedural impropriety within the criminal justice system. The rule operates under the authority granted by **subsection 482(1) and (3) of the Criminal Code**.

Prerogative writs include:
- **Mandamus** (a command to a public official or body to perform a duty)
- **Certiorari** (a writ to quash or review an unlawful or improper decision)
- **Prohibition** (a writ to stop a lower court or official from acting beyond its jurisdiction)
- **Habeas corpus** (a writ to examine the legality of a person’s detention)

This rule establishes a clear procedural framework for when and how these remedies may be invoked in criminal matters.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### **1. Eligibility to Apply for a Prerogative Writ**
Any individual may apply for a prerogative writ in relation to:
- A **criminal proceeding**, or  
- A person’s **imprisonment or other criminal detention**

This means that individuals facing criminal charges or those already detained can seek judicial review through these writs if they believe their rights have been violated or that a decision or action is unlawful.

---

#### **2. Types of Writs Available**
The Supreme Court may grant one of the following writs:
- **Mandamus**: Requires a government body or official to perform a legal duty (e.g., to release a person from a non-compliant detention or to act on a required administrative matter).
- **Certiorari**: Allows a court to review and potentially quash a decision made by a lower tribunal or official that is unlawful, arbitrary, or procedurally flawed.
- **Prohibition**: Prevents a lower court or authority from acting beyond its jurisdiction or in a manner inconsistent with the law.
- **Habeas Corpus**: Specifically addresses the **lawfulness of detention**. A person under imprisonment may apply to have the legality of their detention reviewed directly by the court.

> These writs are not available as standalone remedies in all cases but are used when there is a clear failure of legal process, abuse of power, or unlawful detention.

---

#### **3. Procedure for Applying for Mandamus, Certiorari, or Prohibition**
To initiate proceedings for **mandamus, certiorari, or prohibition**, a person must:
- File a **notice for judicial review** in the form prescribed under **Rule 7 – Judicial Review and Appeal**.
- File this notice **within 25 days** of:
  - The date of a decision under review,  
  - Another action under review, or  
  - An alleged failure to act (e.g., a refusal to act on a legal duty).

> **Exception**: A judge may extend this deadline under **Rule 2.03(1)(c)** of Rule 2 – General, if there are valid reasons (e.g., undue delay, complexity, or hardship).

> This 25-day timeframe ensures prompt judicial review and prevents undue delays in addressing potentially unlawful actions.

---

#### **4. Application of Rule 7 – Judicial Review and Appeal**
Certain provisions of **Rule 7** apply to applications for mandamus, certiorari, or prohibition, **to the extent they are consistent with the Criminal Code and this Rule**.

Specifically:
- **Rules 7.05, 7.06, and 7.08 to 7.10** apply to these types of judicial review.
- These rules cover aspects such as:
  - The content and form of the notice
  - The standard of review
  - The burden of proof
  - The role of the court in assessing whether a decision was lawful or procedurally flawed

> The application of these rules is limited to those provisions that do not conflict with the specific nature or purpose of prerogative writs in criminal matters.

---

#### **5. Service of Notice**
Proper service of notice is required to ensure due process:
- **To the Crown**: A copy of the notice must be delivered to the **office of the Crown’s representative** in the proceeding under review.
- **To other respondents**: If the person applying is challenging an action by a non-Crown party (e.g., a police officer, a parole board, or a correctional facility), notice must be given in accordance with **Rule 31 – Notice**, which governs how legal notices are served on parties.

> This ensures that all relevant parties are informed and can respond to the application.

---

#### **6. Habeas Corpus Application**
A person who is currently **under imprisonment or criminal detention** may apply for **habeas corpus** to challenge the legality of their detention.

- The application must follow the **form prescribed in Rule 7 – Judicial Review and Appeal**.
- The court will examine whether the detention is lawful, whether it violates constitutional rights (e.g., the right to liberty under Section 7 of the Charter), or whether there is a lack of legal basis for continued detention.

> This is a critical safeguard against unlawful or arbitrary detention.

---

#### **7. Application of Rule 7 – Habeas Corpus Provisions**
Rules **7.12 to 7.17** of Rule 7 apply to habeas corpus applications in criminal proceedings or imprisonment, **to the extent they are consistent with the Criminal Code and this Rule**.

These rules typically cover:
- The timing and format of the application
- The standard of review (e.g., whether the detention is lawful)
- The burden of proof (usually on the detaining authority to justify detention)
- The potential for release or order to end detention

> These provisions ensure that the habeas process is both accessible and legally robust.

---

#### **8. Applicability of Other Rules**
All rules outside of Rule 64 that are relevant to the procedures of **mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, or habeas corpus** in the context of criminal proceedings or imprisonment **apply to the extent that they are suitable and consistent with the Criminal Code and this Rule**.

This means that general procedural rules (e.g., rules on filing, costs, timelines, or hearings) may apply where appropriate, as long as they do not conflict with the specific requirements of prerogative writs.

---

### **Purpose and Legal Significance**
Rule 64 serves as a **constitutional safeguard** within the criminal justice system by allowing individuals to challenge:
- Unlawful or arbitrary decisions by authorities
- Failures to act when a legal duty exists
- The legality of their own detention

It reflects the principle that **the judiciary has a role in reviewing administrative or judicial actions** that may infringe on fundamental rights, especially in criminal matters where liberty is at stake.

It also ensures that **prerogative writs are not used as a tool for mere appeals**, but only when there is a clear legal or procedural defect that warrants judicial intervention.

---

### **Limitations and Boundaries**
- The rule **does not allow** a person to use a prerogative writ to appeal a conviction or sentence.
- It is **not a substitute** for appeals under the criminal appeals process (e.g., under Rule 12 or the Charter).
- The court will only issue a writ if there is a **clear legal basis** for intervention — such as a violation of a constitutional right, procedural impropriety, or abuse of power.

---

### **Conclusion**
Rule 64 – Prerogative Writ provides a **clear, accessible, and legally grounded pathway** for individuals to challenge unlawful or improper actions in criminal proceedings or detention. By establishing specific procedures for mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, and habeas corpus, it strengthens the accountability of public bodies and ensures that individuals have a meaningful remedy when their rights are threatened.

This rule is essential for upholding the rule of law, protecting liberty, and ensuring that the criminal justice system operates fairly and transparently within the framework of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Criminal Code.
