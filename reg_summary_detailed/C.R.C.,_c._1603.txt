**Detailed Summary of the Dominion Water Power Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Dominion Water Power Regulations* establish a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the application, approval, construction, and operation of hydroelectric power developments in Canada. These regulations were designed to ensure that water-power projects are technically sound, economically viable, environmentally responsible, and in the public interest—particularly in the context of Canada’s vast natural resources and the need for equitable development.

The regulations apply to the **diversion, use, storage, and transmission of water for power generation**, and they govern both **interim and final licensing processes**, including requirements for planning, public consultation, financial capability, and compliance with environmental and administrative standards.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

### 1. **Actual Construction**
Refers to all necessary and authorized activities directly related to building or preparing a power development, including:
- Engineering investigations and reports
- Land clearing
- Construction of roads, railways, or access routes
- Stream improvements
- Essential works that are solely part of the power project and not independently profitable

**Exclusions:**
- Promotion activities (e.g., marketing or advertising)
- Underwriting, sale, or disposal of stocks and bonds
- General administrative functions conducted remotely from the site

> *Purpose:* To define what constitutes legitimate construction costs and exclude non-core, profit-generating expenditures.

---

### 2. **Actual Cost of Development**
Includes all legitimate and necessary expenditures incurred during construction, such as:
- Direct construction costs
- Engineering services
- Interest during construction
- Taxes and insurance
- Contractor’s profit (as a necessary component of construction)
- Equipment purchases
- Costs of roads, clearings, or railways used exclusively in construction
- Other inherent and necessary construction expenses

**Exclusions:**
- Promotion expenses
- Costs of issuing or selling securities
- Head office or general administrative costs not directly tied to construction

> *Purpose:* To ensure that only real, attributable, and necessary costs are considered when evaluating the financial viability of a project.

---

### 3. **Key Regulatory Entities**
- **Department**: The *Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development* (now part of broader federal departments), responsible for overseeing water-power matters.
- **Director**: The *Director of Water-Power*, who serves as the Chief of the Water Resources Division or a designated official. Acts as the primary decision-maker on applications and licensing.
- **Minister**: The head of the Department, who has ultimate authority over policy and decisions.

### 4. **Core Development Terms**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Power Development** | Physical structures (dams, powerhouses, conduits), machinery, lands, rights-of-way, and associated clearings used solely for power generation within the severance line. |
| **Storage Development** | A subset of power development focused specifically on reservoirs, storage works, intakes, and water conduits for storing water to generate power. |
| **System or Power System** | The complete network including power development, transmission lines, distribution works, auxiliary fuel plants, buildings, roads, and lands required to complete the undertaking. |
| **Interconnected Systems** | Power systems and related plants that are linked, interdependent, and used together in energy generation, transmission, and distribution. |
| **Works** | All physical structures, equipment, devices, and appurtenances authorized or required under the project. |

> *Note:* The **severance line** separates essential works (in the development) from non-essential or independent works (e.g., roads or mills not tied to the power system).

### 5. **Licensing Stages**

#### A. **Application for Licence**
An applicant must submit a detailed application to the Director containing:
- Name, address, and occupation of the applicant
- Source of water (river, lake, etc.), with precise location (referenced to survey monuments)
- Points of diversion and return
- Estimated maximum water diversion (in cubic feet per second)
- Estimated head (in feet) available for power generation
- Minimum and maximum energy output (in horsepower) over five years and ultimately
- Brief description of principal works (dams, reservoirs, etc.)
- For each dam: approximate length, height, type, and materials
- For storage: location, surface area, flood zone, vertical storage range, total capacity (in acre-feet)
- Aerial and land use details:
  - Public lands
  - Provincial Crown lands
  - Privately owned lands
  - Separately noted: rights-of-way and flooded areas

#### B. **Supporting Documentation Required**
- **Preliminary Sketch Plan**: A scaled drawing showing the entire project, including principal works and land use
- **Nearest Neighbouring Works**: Description and distance of existing structures above/below the proposed site (to assess impact)
- **Other Affected Works**: Bridges, railways, canals that may be affected
- **Flow Data**: Discharge at high, medium, and low water levels, with copies of existing measurements
- **Brief Outline of Undertaking**:
  - Purpose of power use (e.g., industrial, municipal)
  - Any planned sale, transfer, or delivery of power
  - Territory of sale/distribution
  - Expected demand
  - Estimated capital cost of the full undertaking

#### C. **Additional Requirements by Applicant Type**
- **Incorporated Company**:
  - Directors/officers, head office address
  - Authorized, subscribed, and paid-up capital (cash and method of payment)
  - Method of raising further funds
  - Copy of incorporation document (special act or memorandum)

- **Municipality or District**:
  - Location, area, boundaries
  - Population
  - Debt and borrowing limits
  - Certified by-law or resolution supporting the project
  - Certified enabling legislation

> *Purpose:* To ensure transparency, accountability, and financial feasibility.

---

### 6. **Public Notification and Objection Period**
- Upon request, the applicant must publish a notice in:
  - The *Canada Gazette*
  - One or more other publications designated by the Director
- The notice must:
  - Clearly state the applicant’s name and address
  - Describe the water source and diversion point
  - State the proposed horsepower capacity
  - Indicate the nature and use of the power
  - State that protests or objections may be filed
  - If applicable, describe storage plans and flooded lands
- The notice must be published in a standardized form approved by the Director
- The applicant must file an **affidavit** proving publication
- A **30-day protest period** follows publication
- If protests are filed or if the Minister deems a hearing necessary, a formal **hearing** is scheduled

> *Purpose:* To provide public input and ensure transparency and democratic accountability in resource allocation.

---

### 7. **Hearing Process**
