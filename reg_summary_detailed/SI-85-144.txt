**Detailed Summary of the Indian Remission Order (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Remission Order* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and the **Treasury Board**. The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit certain income taxes** payable by **Indians** in Canada, specifically in respect of taxation years between **1982 and 1992 inclusive** (i.e., ending before 1993).

This Order recognizes that certain income earned or received by Indigenous individuals—particularly those working or residing on reserves—should not be fully taxed, as such income is often tied to reserve-based employment, pension contributions, retiring allowances, and training allowances, which are considered to have a **distinct public or community interest**.

The Order is **cited as the "Indian Remission Order"** and remains in force until revoked or amended.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Income Tax Act* (the primary legislation governing income taxation in Canada).
- **Indian**: Defined under **subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act**. This includes individuals who are legally recognized as Indigenous peoples under Canadian law, such as members of First Nations, Métis, or Inuit (as defined by the Indian Act).
- **Reserve**: Defined in several contexts:
  - A reserve as defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act**;
  - In respect of a taxation year ending **after July 2, 1984**, **Category IA land or Category IA-N land** (as defined in the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*);
  - In respect of a taxation year ending **after October 8, 1986**, **Sechelt lands** (as defined in the *Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act*).
- All other terms used in the Order are interpreted in accordance with their meaning in the *Income Tax Act*.

### **Purpose and Scope of the Remission**

The Order provides for a **tax remission** (i.e., a reduction or full cancellation of tax liability) for **Indians** who are taxpayers under the *Income Tax Act*.

#### **Eligible Taxation Years**
- The remission applies to each **taxation year ending after 1982 and before 1993**.
- That is, taxation years from **1983 to 1992** inclusive.

#### **Amount of Remission**
The amount of tax remitted is equal to the **difference** between:
1. The **actual taxes, interest, and penalties** payable by the taxpayer for the year under the *Income Tax Act*, and  
2. The **hypothetical taxes, interest, and penalties** that would have been payable **if certain specific types of income were excluded** from the taxpayer’s taxable income for the year.

This means the remission is **not a blanket exemption**, but rather a **calculated reduction** based on the exclusion of specific income components.

### **Income Components Excluded from Taxable Income**

The following types of income are excluded from taxable income for the purpose of calculating the remitted amount:

1. **Income from office or employment on a reserve**  
   - Only the portion of income that is **reasonably attributable to duties performed on a reserve** is excluded.  
   - This is determined in accordance with **subdivision a of Division B of Part I of the Income Tax Act** (which deals with the determination of employment income).  
   - The exclusion applies only to income earned **while performing duties on a reserve**.

2. **Proportions of pension or superannuation fund contributions**  
   - A portion of payments received from a **registered pension fund or plan** is excluded **if** the payment is:
     - On account of or in lieu of, or in satisfaction of, a superannuation or pension benefit;
     - And the **aggregate of contributions made by the taxpayer or their employer** into the fund during the year (or a prior year) is **proportional** to the total contributions made in respect of:
       - Income that was **exempt from taxation**, or
       - Income for which tax was **remitted under this Order in a prior year**.
   - In other words, if the taxpayer’s employment income was exempt or remitted in a prior year, then a corresponding portion of pension contributions is excluded from taxable income.

3. **Retiring allowances**  
   - Any amount received as a **retiring allowance** (a type of severance or retirement benefit) is excluded **if**:
     - The allowance relates to income from employment that was:
       - Exempt from taxation, or
       - For which tax was remitted under this Order in a prior year.
   - This ensures that retiring allowances tied to previously exempt or remitted income are not taxed again.

4. **Training allowances**  
   - Any amount received as a **training allowance** (from a government, municipality, or public authority) **while the taxpayer was resident on a reserve** is excluded from taxable income.

### **Key Principles and Rationale**

- **Recognition of Reserve-Based Employment**: The Order acknowledges that employment on reserves is often tied to community services and cultural responsibilities, and thus the income derived from such work should not be taxed at the same rate as income from off-reserve employment.
- **Avoiding Double Taxation**: By excluding pension and retirement benefits linked to exempt or previously remitted income, the Order prevents double taxation of income that was already treated as non-taxable or remitted.
- **Fairness and Equity**: The Order promotes fairness by recognizing that certain income streams (like training allowances or reserve-based employment) are not generated in the same economic context as income from general employment and are often tied to Indigenous community structures.
- **Public Interest**: The Governor General cites the **public interest** as the basis for the Order, reflecting a broader policy of supporting Indigenous economic and social well-being.

---

### **Legal Authority and Process**

- The Order is made under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General to issue orders for financial administration, including tax remissions.
- The recommendation comes from two key departments:
  - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (responsible for Indigenous affairs),
  - The **Treasury Board** (responsible for financial policy and administration).
- This reflects a collaborative approach involving both fiscal policy and Indigenous rights.

---

### **Status and Revocation**

- The Order was **revoked by Statutory Instrument SI/91-25, Section 1**.
- This means the **Indian Remission Order is no longer in force** as of the date of the revocation (1991).
- However, the summary and historical context remain relevant for understanding past tax policy toward Indigenous peoples.

### **Conclusion**

The *Indian Remission Order* was a significant piece of tax policy designed to **provide tax relief to Indigenous individuals** by excluding specific types of income—particularly those tied to reserve employment, pension contributions, retiring allowances, and training allowances—from taxable income. It operated from **1983 to 1992**, and its structure was both **principled and practical**, aiming to reflect the unique economic and social realities of Indigenous life on reserves.

Although the Order has been **revoked**, it remains a **historical and policy benchmark** in discussions about Indigenous taxation, equity, and the recognition of reserve-based economic activities in Canada.

### **Note on Contemporary Relevance**

While the Order is no longer active, its principles have influenced later policies and legislation, including:
- The **Indian Act amendments** related to employment and income,
- The development of **Indigenous self-governance and fiscal autonomy**,
- Ongoing debates about **tax equity and the treatment of reserve-based income** in federal taxation.

Thus, the Indian Remission Order serves not only as a legal document but also as a **symbol of policy evolution** in Canada’s approach to Indigenous rights and financial inclusion.
