**Key Provisions and Explanation:**

1. **Designation of Minister:**  
   The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) formally designates the **Minister of Natural Resources** as the **Minister responsible for the purposes of the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act**.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   This designation is authorized under **Section 5 of the ESTMA**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to appoint a Minister to act as the designated Minister for the Act. This section ensures that a specific government official is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act’s transparency requirements.

3. **Role and Responsibilities of the Designated Minister:**  
   As the designated Minister, the Minister of Natural Resources is entrusted with the following key responsibilities:
   - Receiving, reviewing, and approving the **public disclosure of financial information** related to extractive sector activities (e.g., oil, gas, mining).
   - Ensuring compliance with the **transparency obligations** set out in the Act, including the requirement for companies operating in the extractive sector to disclose their payments to governments (such as royalties, taxes, and other financial flows).
   - Overseeing the **public reporting and disclosure process**, including the publication of annual reports and financial summaries.
   - Acting as the official point of contact for stakeholders, including industry, provincial governments, and the public, regarding extractive sector financial transparency.

4. **Legal Significance:**  
   This designation is not merely administrative; it confers **formal legal authority** under the ESTMA. It establishes a clear chain of responsibility for the implementation of the Act, ensuring that transparency measures are properly enforced and that government oversight is consistent and accountable.

5. **Context and Purpose of the ESTMA:**  
   The *Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act* was enacted to improve transparency in how revenues from natural resource extraction (such as oil, gas, and minerals) are generated and distributed. It requires extractive companies to disclose payments to governments and mandates that these disclosures be made publicly available. This helps prevent corruption, ensures accountability, and supports democratic oversight of natural resource revenues.

6. **Ministerial Appointment and Accountability:**  
   The designation of the Minister of Natural Resources reflects the fact that the extractive sector is primarily governed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources. This alignment ensures that the Minister with direct oversight of natural resources is the one responsible for enforcing transparency measures related to those sectors.

7. **Effective Date and Continuity:**  
   While the specific effective date is not included in the excerpt, such designations are typically effective immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and remain in force until amended or revoked by a subsequent order.
