**Detailed Summary of the Import Certificate Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Scope**
- **Title:** These Regulations may be cited as the *Import Certificate Regulations*.
- **Applicability:** The regulations apply to all import certificates issued by or on behalf of the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** in relation to goods that require such a certificate before the exporting country allows their export to Canada.

> This means that if a country requires an import certificate as a condition for exporting goods to Canada, the regulations govern the process, requirements, and enforcement of that certificate.

---

### **2. Deemed Requirement of Import Certificate**
- If an applicant specifies a particular country of export in their application, it is **deemed** (legally presumed) that that country requires an import certificate before allowing the export of the goods to Canada.
- This provision ensures that the Canadian government recognizes the export country’s regulatory requirement, thereby justifying the need for the import certificate process.

---

### **3. Eligibility to Apply**
- Only **residents of Canada** may apply for an import certificate:
  - For **natural persons**: Must be someone who **ordinarily resides in Canada**.
  - For **corporations**: Must have its **head office in Canada** or operate a **branch office in Canada**.
- No person can apply unless they **intend to import the goods into Canada**.

> This ensures that only legitimate Canadian-based importers participate in the system, preventing misuse or fraudulent applications.

---

### **4. Application Process and Form**
- Applications must be submitted using a **form provided by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce**.
- The form is available through the **Export and Import Permits Division**.
- Applicants must:
  - **Fully complete** the application form.
  - Provide **detailed descriptions** of the goods, including:
    - Specific physical, technical, or compositional details.
    - **Avoid** trade names, technical names, or vague terms that do not clearly identify the goods.
    - Ensure the description reveals the **true identity** of the goods.
  - **Truthfully certify** that:
    - They intend to import the goods into Canada.
    - They will **not cause or assist in the disposal or diversion** of the goods during transit to any third party.

> This requirement promotes transparency and accountability, reducing the risk of smuggling or illegal diversion.

---

### **5. Additional Information Requirements**
- Applicants must provide **any other information** that the **Chief of the Export and Import Permits Division** may require.
- This may include documentation related to the nature, value, quantity, or destination of the goods.

---

### **6. Submission of Application**
- The completed application form, along with all required supporting documents, must be **sent to the Export and Import Permits Division** in Ottawa, Canada.

---

### **7. Issuance of the Import Certificate**
- Once the application is signed by the **Chief of the Export and Import Permits Division** or by or on behalf of the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce**, the form becomes an **official import certificate**.
- The certificate is **final and binding** and **cannot be altered** after issuance, except by authorized government action.
- The original certificate and a **copy** are issued to the applicant.

> This establishes the legal validity and integrity of the document.

---

### **8. Legal Evidence of the Certificate**
- In any legal proceeding under the *Export and Import Permits Act*, a **certified copy** of the import certificate is **prima facie evidence** (i.e., presumed true) of:
  - The existence of the original certificate.
  - The date of issuance.
  - The signature and authentication of the issuing authority.
- This strengthens the legal standing of the certificate in court or administrative hearings.

---

### **9. Prohibited Actions (Strict Compliance Required)**
Without prior authorization from the Minister or authorized officials, **no person** may:
1. **Cause or assist in the disposal or diversion** of goods covered by an import certificate **before they are received** in Canada — except to the person to whom the certificate was issued.
2. **Use the import certificate** for any purpose other than as specified in the certificate (e.g., misrepresenting goods, using it for different goods or destinations).
3. **Fail to report or provide information** required under these regulations — especially if the certificate was issued to a Canadian entity.

> These provisions ensure that goods remain under the control of the intended importer and are not diverted for illicit or unauthorized purposes.

---

### **10. Validity and Expiry**
- An import certificate is **only valid until the expiry date** stated in the certificate.
- After expiry, the certificate becomes invalid, and further actions (such as importation) require a new application.

---

### **11. Mandatory Reporting Obligations**
Persons to whom an import certificate has been issued must submit **written reports** to the Chief of the Export and Import Permits Division whenever applicable. These include:

| Report Type | Details |
|-----------|--------|
| **Immediate Report** | Upon receiving any information that the certificate or part of the goods has been handled **in violation** of the certificate or regulations. Must include full particulars. |
| **Arrival Report** | When goods arrive in Canada. Must include a **true copy of the customs entry document** bearing the **stamp of the customs collector** at the port of entry. |
| **Export Proposal Report** | Any proposal to **export the goods from Canada** (e.g., re-exporting). |
| **Delay Report** | If the goods do **not arrive before the expiry date** of the certificate. Must include: <br> - Reasons for the delay <br> - Current whereabouts of the goods |

> These reporting obligations ensure transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.

---

### **12. Delivery Verification Certificates**
- The Minister or authorized officials may issue **delivery verification certificates** to:
  - Confirm that goods have been delivered to the intended recipient in Canada.
  - Assist the **exporter** in fulfilling the requirements of the exporting country (e.g., proving delivery for compliance with export regulations).
- However, such certificates **cannot be issued** unless:
  - A **written report of arrival** has been submitted, including:
    - A true copy of the customs entry document.
    - The customs stamp at the port of entry.

> This ensures that delivery verification is only granted after verifiable customs clearance.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives of the Regulations**
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that exporting countries’ requirements are respected before goods leave Canada.
2. **Transparency and Accountability**: Requires detailed descriptions, truthful certifications, and mandatory reporting.
3. **Prevention of Diversion**: Prohibits unauthorized handling or diversion of goods during transit.
4. **Legal Enforceability**: Establishes the import certificate as a legally binding document with evidentiary value.
5. **Supply Chain Integrity**: Maintains control over goods from export to import, reducing risks of illegal trade or smuggling.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**
These regulations establish a formal, transparent, and legally enforceable process for Canadian importers to obtain import certificates from the government. The certificate is required because the exporting country demands it. Only Canadian residents can apply, and applicants must provide full, accurate details about the goods and confirm their intent to import them. Once issued, the certificate is final and cannot be changed. Importers must report the arrival of goods, any delays, or any unauthorized handling. They must not divert goods or misuse the certificate. Delivery verification can only be granted after customs clearance is confirmed. The rules are designed to protect trade integrity, prevent illegal diversion, and ensure compliance with both Canadian and foreign regulations.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Import Certificate Regulations* serve as a critical administrative and legal framework to manage international trade flows involving goods that require pre-export certification. They balance the need for international compliance with strong internal controls to ensure that goods are properly tracked, reported on, and not misused during transit or importation into Canada.
