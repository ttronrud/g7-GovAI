## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a detailed framework for identifying **which activities ("Assessable Activities")** require environmental and socio-economic assessment under the **Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act (ESEAA)**. It also defines key terms used throughout the Act and Regulations and outlines **exceptions** to mandatory assessment, as well as the scope of **Executive Committee Projects** that may be exempt or subject to streamlined review.

The regulation is a foundational tool for ensuring that development projects in Yukon undergo proper environmental and social evaluation — particularly those that could impact natural resources, Indigenous communities, biodiversity, or public health.

## 📌 Key Objectives

1. **Define what constitutes an "assessable activity"** — i.e., activities that must undergo formal environmental and socio-economic assessment.
2. **Identify specific exceptions** where such assessments are not required (e.g., small-scale operations, community undertakings, low-risk activities).
3. **Clarify definitions** of key terms used in the ESEAA and related legislation to ensure consistency and legal precision.
4. **Establish the process and jurisdiction** for determining whether a project falls within the scope of assessment.
