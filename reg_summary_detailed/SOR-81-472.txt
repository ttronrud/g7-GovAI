**Detailed Summary of the Yellowknife Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The *Yellowknife Airport Zoning Regulations* are formally approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish strict zoning and elevation controls around Yellowknife Airport in the Northwest Territories to ensure aviation safety, particularly by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

The regulations are officially cited as the **Yellowknife Airport Zoning Regulations** and apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport that fall within the defined boundaries and surfaces.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers to Yellowknife Airport and its surrounding area in the Northwest Territories.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point used as a central reference for measuring distances and elevations.  
  - **Location**: Begins at the intersection of the centerlines of runways 08–26 and 14–32.  
    - THENCE south 03°55′30″ east for 2,000 feet;  
    - THENCE north 86°04′30″ east for 500 feet.  
  - **Elevation**: Assigned elevation is **653 feet above sea level**.

- **Strip**: A rectangular area of the landing zone designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.  
  - Runway 08–26:  
    - Width: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline)  
    - Length: 6,400 feet (200 feet beyond each end of the runway)  
  - Runway 14–32:  
    - Width: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side)  
    - Length: 8,400 feet (200 feet beyond each end)

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip (for each runway approach: 08, 26, 14, 32).  
  - **Slope**: 1 foot vertically to 50 feet horizontally (1:50 gradient).  
  - **Top of surface**: An imaginary horizontal line drawn:  
    - 1,000 feet above the elevation at the end of the strip;  
    - 50,000 feet horizontally from the end of the strip;  
    - Outer ends of these lines are 8,000 feet from the runway centerline.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until it meets the **outer surface**, an **approach surface**, or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.  
  - **Slope**: 1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally (1:7 gradient), perpendicular to the centerline of the strip.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface located at a **constant elevation** of **150 feet above the airport reference point** (i.e., 653 + 150 = 803 feet above sea level).  
  - **Exception**: If the ground surface is less than 30 feet above sea level, the outer surface is set at **30 feet above ground level** to prevent excessive height restrictions in low-lying areas.

### **3. Applicable Lands**

The regulations apply to all lands that:

1. Are **within** the defined outer limits described in **Part II of the Schedule**, or  
2. Are **directly under** the portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits.

This includes public road allowances and adjacent private lands.

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities – Elevation Restrictions**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** (including natural growths) on any land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surface**  
- The **outer surface**  
- The **transitional surface**

This means that all structures—whether man-made or natural—must remain below the height of these imaginary surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft operations.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

- This provision ensures that even trees or tall grasses do not pose a hazard during flight operations.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier may allow any land under these regulations to be used for:

  - Disposal of waste  
  - Accumulation of materials  
  - Any substance that is **edible or attractive to birds**

- This restriction is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation hazard. The regulation aims to reduce bird populations and their food sources near the airport.

---

### **7. Boundaries of the Regulated Area**

The outer limits of the regulated lands are defined by a detailed, legally descriptive boundary that begins and ends at the most southerly corner of **Lot 915, Group 964, Plan 56823 C.L.S.R.**, and proceeds through a series of directional movements:

- Begins at the **southwest corner of Lot 915**  
- Travels **northwesterly** along the southwesterly limit of the lot to intersect a **circle of 13,000 feet radius** centered at the **airport reference point**  
- Proceeds **southwesterly clockwise** along the circumference of this circle to intersect the **easterly limit of Block 501**  
- Moves **southerly** along the easterly and southeasterly limits of Blocks 501 and 502 to the **southeasterly corner of Lot 25, Block 502**  
- Proceeds **northwesterly** along the southern limits of Lots 25, 16, and 5, and across intervening streets and right-of-ways (including Plan 40399 and 64044) to intersect a second circle of 13,000 feet radius  
- Moves **southwesterly** to intersect the **westerly limit of a power line right-of-way (Plan 3981)**  
- Proceeds **southerly** along that limit and its extensions across streets to the **southern limit of Block 146 (Plan 58510)**  
- Moves **northeasterly** to the **southeasterly corner of Block 144 (Plan 56856)**  
- Proceeds **easterly** along the southern limit of Block 144  
- Finally, moves **west and southwesterly** along the south and southeasterly limits of Lot 915 back to the **point of commencement**

This boundary forms a large, irregular polygon that encloses the airport and its surrounding area, ensuring that all relevant lands are governed by the zoning rules.

### **8. Basis for Design (Zoning Plan)**

All surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) are based on the **Department of Transport Yellowknife Zoning Plan dated March 31, 1978**, which provides the official visual and technical description of the airport’s operational zones.

These surfaces are designed to:

- Provide **clear visual and physical space** for aircraft during approach and landing  
- Minimize the risk of **collision with terrain, structures, or vegetation**  
- Ensure **safety margins** in all directions and altitudes

---

### **9. Key Safety and Operational Objectives**

The regulations serve several critical aviation safety functions:

- **Prevents visual obstructions** during approach and landing  
- **Reduces risk of bird strikes** through waste and food source controls  
- **Ensures consistent elevation standards** across all land uses near the airport  
- **Provides clear legal enforcement mechanisms** (e.g., Minister’s authority to issue removal directions)  
- **Balances development with safety**, protecting the airport from encroachment

---

### **10. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth  
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions  
- Violations may result in legal action or penalties, though specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the text.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Yellowknife Airport Zoning Regulations** constitute a comprehensive and technically precise set of land-use controls designed to protect aviation safety at Yellowknife Airport. By defining clear elevation limits (approach, transitional, outer surfaces), establishing precise geographic boundaries, and restricting waste and vegetation, the regulations ensure that the airport remains free from hazards that could endanger aircraft during critical flight phases.

These rules reflect a long-standing principle in aviation regulation: **the need to maintain unobstructed flight paths and safe operational zones** around airports, especially in remote or high-altitude regions like the Northwest Territories.
