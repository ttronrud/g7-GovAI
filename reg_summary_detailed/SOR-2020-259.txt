**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Vegetable Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, known as the *British Columbia Vegetable Order*, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. It establishes a regulatory framework for the **marketing of vegetables in British Columbia**, particularly in **interprovincial and export trade**, and grants specific powers to two key bodies: the **Commodity Board** and the **Supervisory Board**.

The Order was originally enacted as **SOR/81-49** and came into force upon registration. It is now **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in effect, and has been superseded by more current legislation or regulatory arrangements.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Basis**

#### 1. **Legal Authority**
- The Order is made under **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to establish orders regulating the marketing of agricultural products.
- The authority is limited to **vegetables produced in British Columbia**, and applies specifically to **interprovincial and export trade**.

#### 2. **Applicable Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 330. This is the overarching legislation that provides the legal foundation for the marketing of natural products, including vegetables. |
| **Commodity Board** | Refers to the *British Columbia Vegetable Marketing Commission* or any successor entity established under the Act. This body is responsible for managing market operations, pricing, and financial mechanisms related to vegetable marketing. |
| **Supervisory Board** | Refers to the *British Columbia Farm Industry Review Board* or its successor entity. This body oversees compliance, reviews industry practices, and ensures fair and equitable marketing conditions. |
| **Vegetable** | Any vegetable grown in British Columbia. This includes **strawberries intended for manufacturing purposes** (e.g., juice or processed products) and **potatoes**. This broad definition ensures that both fresh and processed vegetable products are included under the scope of regulation. |

### **Powers Granted to the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board**

The Order grants both the Commodity Board and the Supervisory Board broad powers to regulate the marketing of vegetables in **interprovincial and export markets**, including the following:

#### A. **Classification of Producers and Marketing Entities**
- The Boards are authorized to **classify persons** (e.g., farmers, processors, distributors) involved in the production or marketing of whole vegetables or parts thereof into **distinct groups**.
- Classification is based on factors such as production scale, type of operation, or market role.

#### B. **Fixing, Imposing, and Collecting Levies or Charges**
- The Boards may **establish, impose, and collect levies or charges** from producers and marketers within British Columbia.
- These levies are **group-specific**, meaning different rates may apply depending on the classification of the producer or marketer.
- The levies are intended to fund operational costs, market stabilization, and equitable distribution of revenue.

#### C. **Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected may be used for:
1. **Creation of reserves** – to stabilize markets during periods of low demand or price volatility.
2. **Payment of expenses and losses** – including costs associated with marketing, transportation, or losses from the sale or disposal of vegetables.
3. **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among producers – to ensure that producers who experience lower sales during certain periods receive financial support, and those who earn more during peak times contribute fairly to shared funds.

This mechanism promotes **market stability**, **fairness among producers**, and **risk-sharing** across the vegetable supply chain.

### **Repeal Clause**

- The **British Columbia Vegetable Order (SOR/81-49)** is explicitly **repealed** by this regulation.
- This indicates that the original 1981 Order has been **replaced or superseded** by newer legislation or regulatory instruments, likely due to changes in the agricultural market, policy priorities, or the enactment of the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act* (R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 330).

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Statutes of British Columbia.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary objectives of this Order were:
- To **regulate the interprovincial and export marketing** of vegetables to ensure fair competition and stable prices.
- To **protect producers** from market volatility by creating financial mechanisms (e.g., levies, reserves, equalization).
- To **ensure equitable participation** in the marketing system, especially for smaller or less-resourced producers.
- To provide a **clear legal basis** for the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board to act in the interests of the vegetable industry.

While the Order itself is now **repealed**, its core principles—such as **market stabilization through levies**, **producer classification**, and **financial equalization**—were foundational in shaping modern agricultural marketing policies in British Columbia.

---

### **Contextual Notes**

- The transition from the *British Columbia Vegetable Order* to the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act* reflects a broader shift toward a more comprehensive, modern, and flexible regulatory system for agricultural products.
- The repeal suggests that the specific vegetable-focused regulatory structure has been integrated into a broader, more inclusive framework that covers a wider range of agricultural commodities.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant step in the governance of vegetable marketing in British Columbia. It empowered key industry oversight bodies to manage interprovincial and export trade through financial instruments designed to ensure market stability, fairness, and resilience. Although the Order is now **repealed**, its provisions laid the groundwork for current agricultural marketing practices under the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*, demonstrating the importance of adaptive, producer-focused regulation in the agricultural sector.
