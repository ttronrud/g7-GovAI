The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Below is a detailed and accurate summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the Species at Risk Act

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is made under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which empowers the Minister of the Environment (or the Minister responsible for the Environment) to acknowledge the completion of scientific assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) for designated species.

**Governing Authority:**  
The Order is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment. This reflects the constitutional framework in which federal government decisions are made through the Governor General, on the advice of the responsible minister.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Order formally recognizes that the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has completed and submitted scientific assessments for specific species listed in the annexed schedule. These assessments are required under subsection 23(1) of SARA and are critical to determining the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada.

2. **Purpose of the Assessment:**  
   COSEWIC evaluates the scientific status of wildlife species (including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) to determine whether they are at risk of extinction. The assessments include data on population trends, distribution, threats, and ecological needs.

3. **Trigger for Further Action:**  
   Upon the Governor General in Council acknowledging receipt of these assessments, the process under SARA is advanced. This acknowledgment serves as a formal step in the legal pathway that may lead to:
   - The listing of species as "Endangered," "Threatened," or "Special Concern" in Canada’s official species at risk list.
   - The triggering of legal obligations under SARA, such as the development of recovery strategies, conservation measures, and the implementation of protection measures.

4. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The Order includes a schedule listing the specific species for which COSEWIC has completed its assessments. These species are typically those identified as being at risk of extinction in the wild. The inclusion of these species in the schedule signals their formal consideration under federal conservation policy.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order becomes effective upon its making (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette). This ensures that the assessments are recognized as official and can be used in subsequent regulatory and policy decisions.

6. **Legal Significance:**  
   This Order is not a decision to list a species, nor does it impose immediate conservation measures. Instead, it marks a procedural milestone — confirming that the scientific evaluation is complete and available for review by the Minister and the federal government. This allows the Minister to proceed with making formal designations or initiating recovery planning.

**Context and Importance:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) to provide a legal framework for the protection of species at risk in Canada.
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific body that provides expert assessments on the status of wildlife species. Its recommendations are central to SARA’s decision-making process.
- This Order is a key step in the species-at-risk governance process, ensuring transparency, scientific rigor, and procedural compliance.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally acknowledges the completion of scientific assessments by COSEWIC for a list of species under the *Species at Risk Act*. It serves as a procedural milestone that enables the federal government to proceed with formal listings, recovery planning, and conservation actions. While it does not itself list species or impose protections, it is a necessary and legally binding step in the process of protecting Canada’s biodiversity under SARA.
