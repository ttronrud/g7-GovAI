**Detailed Summary of the Prescribed Province Pension Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Prescribed Province Pension Regulations*

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Prescribed Province Pension Regulations*.

---

**Core Purpose and Legal Context:**  
This regulation establishes the legal basis for the Province of Quebec being designated as a "prescribed province" under the *Canada Pension Plan (CPP)*. It grants Quebec the authority to operate a provincial old age pensions and supplementary benefits plan *in lieu of* the federal Canada Pension Plan (CPP) within its jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Legal Requirements:**

1. **Designation of Quebec as a Prescribed Province:**  
   The Province of Quebec is formally designated as a "prescribed province" under the Canada Pension Plan. This designation allows Quebec to establish and administer its own pension plan instead of being subject to the federal CPP framework.

2. **Timing of Significance:**  
   The requirement for Quebec to have signaled its intention to establish a provincial plan prior to a specific deadline is central to this regulation.  
   - The deadline is set as the **30th day after April 3, 1965**.  
   - This means that Quebec must have formally communicated its intention—before this date—to create and operate a provincial old age pensions and supplementary benefits plan.

3. **Scope of the Provincial Plan:**  
   The provincial plan must:
   - Be established and operated **in lieu of** the operation of the Canada Pension Plan within Quebec.
   - Commence with the **calendar year 1966**.
   - Provide **benefits comparable to those provided by the Canada Pension Plan**.

4. **Nature of Contributions and Benefits:**  
   - The plan must require **contributions** from eligible individuals, similar to the CPP.
   - The **benefits paid** under the provincial plan must be **substantially equivalent** in amount, timing, and eligibility criteria to those provided under the federal CPP. This ensures that residents of Quebec are not disadvantaged by the provincial alternative.

5. **Legal Authority and Implication:**  
   - The designation is not automatic; it is contingent upon Quebec having formally signaled its intent before the specified date.
   - Once designated, Quebec is legally recognized as having the right to administer its own pension system under the CPP framework, which is a key provision of the *Canada Pension Plan Act* and related regulations.

**Historical and Policy Significance:**  
- This regulation reflects a foundational moment in Canadian pension policy, where provinces were granted the option to establish their own pension plans, provided they met certain conditions.
- Quebec's early action (signaling intent before April 30, 1965) enabled it to develop a provincial plan that would later become the *Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)*, which remains a key component of the province's social security system.
- The plan was designed to ensure that Quebec residents received pension benefits on par with those under the federal CPP, thus maintaining equity across provinces.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Prescribed Province Pension Regulations* legally recognize the Province of Quebec as a prescribed province under the Canada Pension Plan because it formally signaled its intention to establish a provincial old age pensions and supplementary benefits plan before April 30, 1965. The plan, which began in 1966, must provide benefits comparable to the CPP and require contributions from participants. This regulation underscores the federal government’s policy of allowing provinces to develop their own pension systems while ensuring that the benefits remain equivalent to those under the federal plan, thereby protecting the financial security of residents across Canada.

This designation is a critical precedent in Canadian social policy, affirming both provincial autonomy and national equity in pension provision.
