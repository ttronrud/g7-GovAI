### **4. Core Provision: Remission of Charge**

The central provision of the Order is the **granting of remission** of the charge under Section 18 of the Act in the following circumstances:

> **Remission is granted to a "specified person" of the charge paid or payable by that person on the amount of a duty deposit refund and any interest paid or payable in respect of the charge**, **if**:

- The specified person **sells their rights** to the duty deposit refund **by agreement** to **Her Majesty in right of Canada** (i.e., the Canadian government);
- **Her Majesty in right of Canada** then **pays an amount to the beneficiaries** on behalf of the specified person under that agreement.

### **5. Interpretation and Implications**

#### a. **Remission of Charge**
- When a specified person sells their rights to a duty deposit refund to the government, they are **no longer required to pay** the export charge (Section 18) on that refund amount — even if the charge would otherwise apply.
- This remission applies **not only to the refund amount** but also to **any interest** that may have been accrued on the charge.

#### b. **Transfer of Rights to the Government**
- The transfer must occur via **a formal agreement** between the specified person and the Canadian government.
- This mechanism allows the government to **take ownership** of the refund rights, effectively absorbing the financial liability associated with the charge.

#### c. **Government Payment to Beneficiaries**
- Upon such a transfer, the Canadian government **pays a portion of the refund amount to the beneficiaries**.
- This ensures that the **economic benefits** of the refund (which may have been tied to trade fairness or industry improvements) are shared with stakeholders who have contributed to or benefited from the softwood lumber agreement.

#### d. **Public Interest Justification**
- The Order is justified as being in the **public interest**, suggesting that it promotes:
  - Fairness in international trade;
  - Stability in the softwood lumber sector;
  - Support for industry initiatives that improve trade outcomes;
  - A mechanism to manage financial obligations in a way that benefits both domestic producers and international partners.

### **6. Contextual Background**

This Order operates within the broader framework of the **Softwood Lumber Agreement**, a binational agreement between Canada and the United States aimed at resolving long-standing disputes over softwood lumber pricing and trade flows. The agreement includes provisions for:

- Fair pricing mechanisms;
- Trade remedies;
- Industry participation and transparency.

The remission of charges on duty deposit refunds is a tool used to **manage financial burdens** on Canadian exporters who may have made deposits in anticipation of exports that do not materialize — especially during periods of market volatility or uncertainty.
