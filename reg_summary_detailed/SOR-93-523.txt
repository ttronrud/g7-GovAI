**Detailed Summary of the Coppermine Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The *Coppermine Airport Zoning Regulations* are a formal set of rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. Specifically:

- The regulations were **proposed** and published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **April 3 and April 10, 1993**, to ensure public notice and opportunity for comment.
- Additional public notice was provided through regional media:
  - *Mackenzie Times* (April 28 and May 5, 1993)
  - *L’Aquilon* (May 7, 1993)
  - *Native Journal* (May/June 1993)
- This publication process ensured that **interested parties** (e.g., local communities, landowners, aviation stakeholders) had a reasonable opportunity to **submit representations or objections** to the Minister of Transport.

Based on this public consultation and the Minister’s recommendation, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** formally enacted the regulations on **May 1993**, pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which authorizes the establishment of zoning regulations for airports.

### **2. Official Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Coppermine Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: The regulations apply to **all land** located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Coppermine Airport**, including public road allowances.
- **Geographic Coverage**: The area is defined by a **zoning plan** (Coppermine Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2924, dated September 3, 1991), which provides precise spatial boundaries and features.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used in the zoning framework:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Coppermine Airport in the vicinity of Coppermine, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the runway centerline, 762 meters from the threshold of runway 301, located on the centerline of runway 121–301. Its elevation is **11.9 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 121–301). These planes are designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by maintaining visual and spatial clearance. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 11.9 m + 45 m = 56.9 m above sea level). However, if this plane would be less than **9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area associated with runway 121–301. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,644 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until they intersect with the outer surface. These ensure safe clearance during aircraft takeoff and landing, especially during low visibility or adverse weather. |

### **4. Spatial Boundaries**

- The **outer boundary** of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This circle encompasses all land subject to the zoning restrictions, including:
  - Land adjacent to the runway
  - Land near approach and transitional zones
  - Areas within 4 km of the airport center

---

### **5. Zoning Restrictions (Prohibited Development)**

No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**, or
- Add any **extension or modification** to an existing building, structure, or object,

**on any land within the regulated zone**, if the **highest point** of such construction would exceed the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surfaces**
2. **Outer Surface**
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no obstruction (such as trees, buildings, or towers) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

### **6. Detailed Description of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway 121 and 301)**

Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** rising at a **1:40 slope** (1 meter vertically for every 40 meters horizontally), extending from the end of the runway strip:

- **End of Runway 121 (approach)**:
  - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line **3,000 meters** from the end of the runway.
  - The outer ends of this line are **525 meters** from the runway centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **75 meters above the elevation** of the runway end.

- **End of Runway 301 (approach)**:
  - Same slope (1:40), same horizontal distance (3,000 m), same outer extension (525 m from centerline).
  - The horizontal line is **75 meters above the elevation** of the runway end.

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring unobstructed visibility and flight paths.

#### **B. Outer Surface**

- A flat, imaginary plane located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 56.9 meters above sea level).
- **Exception**: Where the outer surface would fall below **9 meters above ground level**, it is **set at 9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or impractical restrictions.

> This surface defines the upper limit of all structures in the outermost zone of the airport.

#### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically for every 7 meters horizontally).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Rise until they meet the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces provide a gradual transition between the runway area and the outer surface, ensuring safe flight paths during takeoff and landing.

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.
- To maintain **visual flight rules (VFR)** and **instrument flight rules (IFR)** compliance.
- To provide **predictable and consistent airspace and ground clearance** around the airport.
- To balance **community development** with **aviation safety requirements** by clearly defining where development is prohibited.

---

### **8. Legal and Regulatory Significance**

- These regulations are binding and enforceable under the **Aeronautics Act**.
- They represent a **formalized zoning plan** based on engineering and aviation safety standards.
- The use of **imaginary planes** (approach, transitional, outer surfaces) reflects standard practices in airport planning and design, aligning with international aviation safety guidelines.

---

### **9. Public Engagement and Process**

- The regulation was developed through a **transparent public process**:
  - Published in official and local media.
  - Provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment**.
  - Ensured stakeholder input, particularly from Indigenous communities and local residents, given the location of the airport in the Northwest Territories.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Coppermine Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to **protect aviation safety** at Coppermine Airport. By defining clear elevation limits through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, and by restricting construction within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point, the regulations ensure that aircraft can operate safely under all conditions. The rules are grounded in both legal authority and practical aviation engineering, and they reflect a balanced approach to development and safety in a remote Arctic environment.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- Applies to land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point.
- Prohibits any structure exceeding the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.
- Based on the 1991 Zoning Plan (E.2924).
- Designed to protect aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- Enacted after public notice and opportunity for comment.

These regulations remain a critical component of Canada’s aviation safety infrastructure in northern regions.
