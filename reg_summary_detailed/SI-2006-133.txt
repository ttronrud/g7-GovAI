### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation is an **order issued by the Governor in Council** of Canada, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, under **subsection 83.05(9)b of the Criminal Code of Canada**.

- The regulation reaffirms the **continuation of a list of entities designated as "listed entities"** for purposes of Canadian anti-terrorism law.
- The original list was established on **July 23, 2006**, under **subsection 83.05(1)a** of the *Criminal Code*, which empowers the Minister to create a list of entities believed to be involved in terrorist activities.
- The current regulation, issued **four years later (in 2010)**, is a **review and renewal** of that list, based on ongoing assessments of the terrorist activities of these organizations.

> **Key Legal Basis**:  
> - *Criminal Code*, **Section 83.05(1)a**: Establishes the power to create a list of entities involved in terrorism.  
> - *Section 83.05(9)b*: Authorizes the Minister to **review and extend** the list if there are "reasonable grounds to believe" that each entity has:
>   - Knownly carried out, attempted, participated in, or facilitated a terrorist activity; or
>   - Is knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with an entity that has engaged in such activities.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- **Maintain the legal status** of a list of terrorist organizations that are considered threats to national security.
- Ensure that **Canadian law continues to recognize and act against** groups that are known or suspected of engaging in terrorism.
- Provide **legal clarity and continuity** in Canada’s counter-terrorism framework by confirming that these entities remain designated as terrorist organizations, even after the initial listing period.

This is not a new designation—it is a **reaffirmation and renewal** of existing designations based on continued credible evidence of terrorist activity.
