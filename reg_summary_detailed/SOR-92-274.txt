Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Investments in Canada by Foreign Companies**  
*Effective June 1, 1992*  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1991, c. 47*  
*Repealed: SOR/2009-296, s. 2*

---

#### **1. Authority and Purpose**
This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **sections 616, 617, and 703 of the Insurance Companies Act** (*Act*).  
The primary purpose is to **set out specific investment limits** for **foreign insurance companies** operating in Canada, ensuring that such companies do not over-concentrate their assets in Canadian markets, thereby protecting the stability and integrity of the Canadian insurance sector.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Act"** refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which governs the operations, financial responsibilities, and regulatory compliance of insurance companies in Canada.

---

#### **3. Investment Limits under Section 618 of the Act**

Section 618 of the *Insurance Companies Act* establishes **maximum allowable percentages** of a foreign insurance company’s total assets that may be held in Canada, depending on the **type of insurance** and the **nature of the foreign insurer**.

##### **a) Foreign Life Companies**
- **Class 1 (Subsection 618(1))**:  
  - For life insurance companies investing in **certain classes of life insurance** (e.g., term life, endowment, or annuities), the **maximum allowable investment in Canadian assets is 15%** of the total value of the company’s assets.
  
- **Class 2 (Subsection 618(2))**:  
  - For other classes of life insurance (e.g., group life, certain long-term insurance products), the **maximum allowable investment is 10%** of the total value of the company’s assets.

> **Note**: The distinction between these two classes reflects the differing risks and financial characteristics of life insurance products.

##### **b) Foreign Property and Casualty (P&C) or Marine Companies**  
- For **foreign property and casualty companies** or **foreign marine companies**, the **maximum allowable investment in Canadian assets is 10%** of the total value of their assets.

> This lower threshold applies to P&C and marine insurers due to the higher risk exposure associated with property and casualty claims and the potential for large, unpredictable losses.

---

#### **4. Investment Limits under Section 619 of the Act**

Section 619 of the *Insurance Companies Act* sets a **higher threshold** for **total investment in Canadian assets** by foreign insurers, but only in specific circumstances.

- The **prescribed percentage** under section 619 is **25%** of the value of the assets in Canada.  
- This 25% limit likely applies to **certain types of foreign insurers** or **specific investment activities** that are considered less risky or more aligned with Canadian market integration.

> However, it is important to note that **this 25% limit is not automatically applicable** to all foreign insurers. It may be subject to additional conditions or exceptions, and it likely applies in conjunction with the more restrictive 10% or 15% limits under section 618, depending on the insurer type and product class.

---

#### **5. Key Regulatory Implications**
- These rules are **proportional to risk**:  
  - Life insurance is generally considered less volatile than property and casualty insurance, hence a higher 15% limit for certain life products.
  - P&C and marine insurers face stricter caps (10%) due to their exposure to claims, natural disasters, and market volatility.

- The rules are **asset-based**, meaning the percentage is calculated based on the **total value of the foreign insurer’s assets**, not just capital or reserves.

- The regulations **apply to foreign companies** (non-Canadian insurers) that conduct business in Canada or invest in Canadian insurance or financial assets.

---

#### **6. Status and Repeal**
- The regulation was **originally enacted on June 1, 1992**, under S.C. 1991, c. 47.
- It was **repealed on April 1, 2009**, by **SOR/2009-296, section 2**.  
  → This means the regulation **no longer has legal force** in Canada as of April 1, 2009.

> **Important Note**: The repeal indicates that **the investment caps for foreign insurers in Canada have since been replaced or superseded** by updated regulatory frameworks, likely under more modern insurance oversight mechanisms such as those introduced by the *Insurance Companies Act* amendments or the *Insurance Act* (2009 and later).

---

### **Conclusion**

This 1992 regulation established **investment thresholds** for foreign insurance companies operating in Canada, with:
- **15%** for certain life insurance investments,
- **10%** for other life and P&C/marine insurance investments,
- And a **25%** threshold under specific provisions (likely for certain circumstances or types of investment).

These limits were designed to **protect the Canadian insurance market** from excessive foreign ownership and concentration of assets. However, **the regulation is now repealed**, and its provisions are no longer in effect. Current investment rules are governed by **updated legislation and regulatory guidance** issued after 2009.

### **Recommendation for Users**
If you are reviewing historical regulatory frameworks or conducting legal or financial analysis involving foreign insurance investments in Canada, this regulation should be understood as **a defunct, historical provision**. For current compliance, refer to the **current version of the Insurance Companies Act** and **regulatory updates from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)** or the **Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC)**.
