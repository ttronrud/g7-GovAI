**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, implements a transfer of administrative control and supervision under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Purpose of the Transfer:**  
   The primary objective is to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and coordination of border inspection services in Canada. Specifically, the regulation transfers responsibility for certain public service functions previously managed by the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**.

2. **Scope of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer applies to specific portions of the **Operations Branch** of the CFIA. These portions are responsible for:
   - **Passenger inspection services**
   - **Initial import inspection services**
   - These services are conducted at **airports and other Canadian border points**  
   - **Exclusions:** The transfer does *not* include services performed at **import service centres**, which remain under CFIA jurisdiction.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. This date marks the point at which the CBSA assumes control, supervision, and operational authority over the specified functions.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign public service responsibilities between federal departments and agencies. This provision allows for reorganization based on strategic, operational, or functional considerations.

5. **Implications of the Transfer:**  
   - **Operational Integration:** The CBSA gains direct responsibility for passenger and initial import inspections at border points outside of import service centres. This aligns inspection functions with broader border security and customs enforcement objectives.  
   - **Coordination and Oversight:** The CBSA will now oversee the day-to-day operations, staffing, and performance of these services, ensuring consistency with national border security policies.  
   - **Functional Alignment:** This move reflects a broader trend of consolidating border-related functions under a single agency (CBSA) to improve coordination between customs, immigration, and border enforcement activities.  
   - **Continuity of Service:** While the administrative control shifts, the actual inspection services (e.g., screening of passengers, checking imported goods) continue uninterrupted, ensuring public safety and trade compliance.

6. **Exclusions and Jurisdictional Boundaries:**  
   The transfer is limited to services at **airports and other border points outside of import service centres**. Import service centres—specialized facilities designed for the efficient handling of food and agricultural products—remain under CFIA’s mandate, preserving CFIA’s role in food safety and agricultural inspections.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization within Canada’s public service structure. By transferring passenger and initial import inspection responsibilities from the CFIA to the CBSA, the government strengthens border security and streamlines cross-agency coordination. It reflects a strategic decision to centralize border inspection functions under the CBSA, enhancing national security, compliance, and operational efficiency while maintaining distinct roles for CFIA in food and agricultural safety.
