**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Hog Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Alberta Hog Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader framework of agricultural product marketing in Alberta.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of Alberta* (French: *Loi*). This is the primary legislative foundation upon which the Order operates. It provides the legal authority for regulating the marketing of agricultural products, including hogs.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Alberta Pork Producers Development Corporation*, established under the Act. It functions as a regulatory and financial body responsible for supporting pork producers through marketing, pricing, and financial mechanisms.

- **Council**: Refers to the *Alberta Agricultural Products Marketing Council*, also established under the Act. It plays a role in overseeing and advising on the marketing of agricultural products, including hogs, across interprovincial and export markets.

- **Hog**: Defined as a pig that is produced within the Province of Alberta and is either sold or offered for sale for slaughter. This definition ensures that only hogs originating in Alberta are subject to the Order’s provisions.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Act, as well as any regulations made to implement or support that plan. The Plan guides how hogs are marketed, priced, and distributed, both domestically and internationally.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Council and Commodity Board**  
Both the **Council** and the **Commodity Board** are granted broad regulatory powers in relation to the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial and export trade**. Crucially, they may exercise the same powers they have over **local marketing within Alberta**—including authority over persons and property located in the province—when conducting marketing activities outside the province or abroad.

This provision ensures consistency in regulatory application whether hogs are being sold within Alberta or exported. It allows for a unified approach to pricing, quality standards, and market oversight across different markets.

**4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant to Interprovincial and Export Trade)**  
Although this section was previously active (and previously revoked by SOR/80-90), the current version of the Order retains the Commodity Board’s authority to:

- **Make Orders Fixing Levies or Charges**: The Commodity Board may establish specific fees (levies or charges) that are payable by individuals or entities involved in the interprovincial or export marketing of hogs.

- **Classify Marketers into Groups**: The Board can categorize marketing participants (e.g., wholesalers, exporters, brokers) into different groups based on size, type of operation, or other relevant criteria.

- **Set Different Levies or Charges per Group**: Members of each group may be required to pay different amounts depending on their classification. This enables a more equitable and flexible fee structure based on market participation and capacity.

- **Collect Levies or Charges**: The Commodity Board has the authority to collect these fees directly from those engaged in the marketing of hogs.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through levies or charges are not restricted in their use. The Commodity Board may use these funds for several key purposes, including:

- **Creation of Reserves**: Building financial reserves to stabilize markets or manage future price fluctuations.

- **Payment of Expenses and Losses**: Covering operational costs, administrative expenses, and financial losses incurred from the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., due to market downturns or poor demand).

- **Equalization and Adjustment of Producer Revenues**: Ensuring that hog producers receive fair compensation, especially during periods of fluctuating market prices. The Board may redistribute funds to balance income among producers—particularly when some producers benefit from high sales prices while others face low prices.

This mechanism helps to stabilize the hog industry by reducing volatility and ensuring that producers are not disproportionately affected by market swings.

---

**6. Important Note on Revocation**  
The section granting the Commodity Board powers to impose levies was previously revoked by *SOR/80-90* (Statutory Order 80-90). However, the current version of the Alberta Hog Order appears to have **reinstated or re-established** these powers, indicating a potential policy shift or legislative update. This suggests that the Commodity Board's role in financial stabilization and fee collection has been restored or reactivated in the current regulatory framework.

---

**7. Purpose and Objectives**  
The overall purpose of the Alberta Hog Order is to:

- Provide a structured, transparent, and equitable system for the marketing of hogs in Alberta.
- Ensure that producers are protected from market volatility through financial mechanisms such as levies and equalization.
- Enable effective regulation of interprovincial and export trade, ensuring consistency with local marketing practices.
- Strengthen the financial sustainability of the pork sector by allowing the Commodity Board to manage risk and support producers.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Alberta Hog Order* is a critical regulatory tool that empowers the Commodity Board to manage the financial and operational aspects of hog marketing—particularly in interprovincial and export markets. By allowing the imposition of group-based levies, the Board can generate revenue to stabilize producer incomes, cover losses, and build reserves. This ensures long-term resilience and fairness in the Alberta hog industry, aligning with broader goals of agricultural market stability and producer support under the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act*. The reinstatement of levy powers after prior revocation underscores the ongoing importance of financial mechanisms in supporting Alberta’s pork sector.
