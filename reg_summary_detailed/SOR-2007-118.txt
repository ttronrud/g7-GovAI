**Detailed Summary of the *Safety of Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation Regulations* (S.C. 2004, c. 23, s. 2)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Safety of Human Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation Regulations* were made under **section 30a of the Food and Drugs Act (Act)** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. These regulations establish a comprehensive framework to ensure the **safety, efficacy, and quality** of human cells, tissues, and organs used in transplantation. The regulations apply specifically to **organs and minimally manipulated cells and tissues**, excluding certain therapeutic products regulated under other acts or in clinical trials.

## **Key Definitions and Core Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Accident** | An unexpected event not due to deviation from standard procedures or laws that could harm transplant recipients or compromise the safety/quality of cells, tissues, or organs. |
| **Error** | A deviation from standard operating procedures or applicable laws that could adversely affect safety or quality. |
| **Adverse Reaction** | Any undesirable response in a recipient to transplanted material, including disease transmission. |
| **Serious Adverse Reaction** | An adverse reaction resulting in hospitalization, disability, life-threatening condition, or death. |
| **Donor** | A living or deceased person from whom cells, tissues, or organs are retrieved. |
| **Donor Screening** | Evaluation of donor history, physical exam, diagnostics, and autopsy (if applicable). |
| **Donor Suitability Assessment** | Final determination of donor eligibility based on screening and testing results. |
| **Donor Testing** | Laboratory tests to detect infectious diseases, compatibility, and functional status. |
| **Processing** | Activities including screening, testing, retrieval (except organs/islet cells), preservation, packaging, and labelling. |
| **Banking** | Storage of processed, safe cells/tissues/organs for future distribution. |
| **Minimally Manipulated** | Processing that does not alter biological characteristics relevant to utility (e.g., tissue structure or cell function). |
| **Source Establishment** | The entity responsible for processing, determining safety, and managing donor records. |
| **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** | Documented instructions for all activities related to processing, distribution, and transplantation. |
| **Quality Assurance System (QAS)** | Includes SOPs, records of implementation, and audit processes to ensure compliance and safety. |
| **Medical Director** | Licensed physician/dentist responsible for medical procedures and SOP application. |
| **Scientific Director** | Individual responsible for technical procedures and SOP implementation. |
| **Interior/Exterior Package** | Innermost and outermost packaging units, respectively. |
| **Interior/Exterior Label** | Labels affixed to interior and exterior packages. |
| **Package Insert** | Document accompanying the product with information for recipients or clinicians. |

> The regulations reference several **National Standards of Canada (CAN/CSA-Z900 series)**, which define specific requirements for different types of transplant materials:
- **General Standard (CAN/CSA-Z900.1)** – Broad requirements for all cells, tissues, and organs.
- **Lymphohematopoietic Standard (CAN/CSA-Z900.2.5)** – For blood-forming cells (e.g., stem cells).
- **Ocular Standard (CAN/CSA-Z900.2.4)** – For eye tissues.
- **Tissue Standard (CAN/CSA-Z900.2.2)** – For non-organ tissues.
- **Organ Standard (CAN/CSA-Z900.2.3)** – For perfusable organs (e.g., kidneys, hearts).

## **Scope of Application**

### ✅ Applies to:
- **Organs** (whole or partial)
- **Minimally manipulated cells and tissues**

### ❌ Does NOT Apply to:
1. **Non-homologous use** (i.e., use not intended for the same function)
2. **Autologous use** (use of a patient’s own cells/tissues)
3. **Heart valves and dura mater**
4. **Tissues/cells with systemic metabolic functions** (e.g., islet cells are excluded from this category unless derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood)
5. **Medical devices containing cells/tissues** undergoing investigational testing under Part 3 of the Medical Devices Regulations
6. **Cells/tissues in clinical trials** under Division 5 of Part C of the Food and Drug Regulations
7. **Class IV medical devices** regulated under Medical Devices Regulations
8. **Blood components** (whole blood, blood products) — *except cord blood and peripheral blood for lymphohematopoietic cell transplantation*
9. **Cells/tissues regulated under the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHRA)**

> This ensures clear demarcation between regulated transplant products and other therapeutic areas.

## **Core Regulatory Provisions**

### 1. **Processing and Transplantation Requirements**

> **Subject to sections 40–42**, no establishment may:
- **Transplant** a cell, tissue, or organ unless it has been:
  - Processed by a **registered establishment** under these Regulations
  - Determined to be **safe for transplantation**
- **Import** tissue or cells (except lymphohematopoietic cells) unless processed and deemed safe by a registered establishment.

> **Exception**: An establishment **may import organs or lymphohematopoietic cells** from a non-registered establishment.

---

### 2. **Establishment Registration**

#### Who Must Be Registered?
- All **establishments** involved in processing, distributing, or importing cells/tissues/organs.
- **Exclusions**:
  - **Retrieval establishments** (e.g., hospitals retrieving organs)
  - **Transplant establishments** only if they **distribute** cells/tissues/organs.

> Registration is mandatory for any entity that:
- Processes, distributes, or imports (except retrieval)
- Engages in transplantation activities

#### Application Requirements:
- Must be submitted in the form established by the Minister
- Must be **dated and signed** by either the **medical director** or **scientific director**
- Must include:
  - Name, address, and contact details
  - Previous names (if applicable)
  - Types of cells/tissues/organs processed/distributed/imported
  - Description of processing, distribution, or transplantation activities
  - Period of operation
  - Statement of compliance with these regulations (signed by medical or scientific director)

#### Additional Information:
- On written request, the establishment must provide any relevant information to complete the application.

#### Registration Process:
- If information is complete, the Minister **registers** the establishment and issues a **registration number**.
- Registration is valid until **December 31 of the year following issuance**.
- The Minister may **refuse registration** if:
  - Information is false, misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete.

#### Cancellation of Registration:
The Minister may cancel a registration if:
1. False/incomplete information in the application
2. Notification under section 13 that the establishment has ceased an activity
3. Failure to respond to a request for additional information
4. Reasonable belief that the establishment is not complying with the regulations or that safety is compromised

> **Before cancellation**, the Minister must:
- Send a **written notice** stating reasons and required corrective actions and deadlines
- Provide the establishment with a **written opportunity to respond**

> If corrective action is not taken, the Minister issues a **formal notice of cancellation**, including reasons and effective date.

> Upon cancellation, the establishment must:
- Immediately cease all authorized activities
- Notify all recipients and organizations to whom it distributed cells/tissues/organs or made donor referrals, within the time specified in the notice

> **Immediate Cancellation Power**: The Minister may cancel registration **without notice** if there is an urgent threat to public health or safety.

> **Request for Reconsideration**: An establishment may request a review within 45 days of cancellation. The Minister must provide a written opportunity to respond.
