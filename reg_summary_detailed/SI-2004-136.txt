**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This action is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to reorganize the public service by transferring control and supervision of specific functions or units from one department to another, typically to improve efficiency, effectiveness, or alignment with current policy priorities.

**Transfer of Functions:**

The regulation transfers to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** the **control and supervision** of the following public service components currently housed within the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI)**:

1. **The Ports and Border Management Directorate within the Admissibility Branch**  
   - This directorate is responsible for managing border operations at ports of entry, including the processing of individuals and goods, enforcement of border security regulations, and coordination of admissibility assessments.
   - The transfer of this directorate to the CBSA reflects a strategic move to consolidate border management functions under a single, specialized agency with direct responsibility for border security and enforcement.

2. **Those portions of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration located within Canada that are responsible for carrying out port of entry functions, including marine security**  
   - This includes all functions related to the operation and management of Canada’s ports of entry—such as land, sea, and air crossings—where individuals and goods are admitted into the country.
   - Specifically, it includes responsibilities related to **marine security**, which involves safeguarding maritime borders, monitoring vessels, preventing smuggling, and ensuring compliance with national and international maritime security standards.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- **Enhanced Border Security and Efficiency**: By consolidating port of entry operations and marine security under the CBSA, the government aims to strengthen border integrity, improve inter-agency coordination, and ensure a more unified and efficient approach to border management.
- **Streamlined Oversight**: The CBSA, as the lead agency for border services, is better positioned to manage and supervise these functions due to its existing mandate, resources, and operational expertise in border enforcement and security.
- **Improved Accountability and Integration**: Transferring these responsibilities ensures that border operations are directly accountable to a single agency, reducing duplication and enhancing policy consistency.
- **Alignment with National Security and Trade Objectives**: The move supports Canada’s broader goals of protecting national security, ensuring lawful entry, and facilitating legitimate trade and travel through secure and efficient border processes.

**Effective Date and Implementation:**

While the regulation does not specify an effective date in the provided text, such transfers are typically implemented immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or through formal internal directives. The transfer will require coordination between the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and the Canada Border Services Agency to ensure a smooth transition of personnel, systems, and operational responsibilities.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the federal public service. It marks a shift in responsibility from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to the Canada Border Services Agency, consolidating key border management and marine security functions. The transfer is designed to improve the effectiveness, accountability, and security of Canada’s border operations, aligning them more closely with the CBSA’s core mandate and national security priorities.
