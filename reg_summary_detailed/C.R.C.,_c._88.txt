**Detailed Summary of the Kamloops Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Kamloops Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and height restrictions for land adjacent to Kamloops Airport in British Columbia, primarily to ensure aviation safety by controlling the elevation of structures near the airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers to Kamloops Airport, located in the vicinity of Kamloops, British Columbia. It includes all associated runways, taxiways, and operational areas.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. For regulatory purposes, this point is **deemed to be 1,129 feet above sea level**, which serves as a baseline for elevation calculations.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway (strip), designed to provide a safe zone for aircraft during landing approaches. There are two types:
  - **First Approach Surface**: Rises at a ratio of **1 vertical foot to 50 horizontal feet** from the runway end, reaching a horizontal line 10,000 feet from the end and 200 feet above the end’s elevation. Outer limits extend 2,000 feet from the runway centerline.
  - **Second Approach Surface**: Rises at a ratio of **1 vertical foot to 40 horizontal feet**, extending from the first surface to a higher horizontal line 17,500 feet from the end and 387.5 feet above the end’s elevation. This surface extends 2,000 feet from the centerline.

> These surfaces are specific to Runways **08–26** and **04–22** and are illustrated on **Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969**.

- **Horizontal Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the elevation of the Airport Reference Point (1,129 ft ASL)**. This surface defines a safe altitude zone for aircraft in flight and is also referenced on Plan V.226.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary plane that lies on either side of the horizontal surface and approach surfaces. It is defined as being:
  - **2,000 feet above sea level**, or
  - **30 feet above ground level**, whichever is **higher at any given location**.
  - This ensures that structures do not rise above a safe buffer zone beyond the approach and horizontal surfaces.

- **Strip**: A designated rectangular area of the airport used for takeoff and landing, defined by its width and length:
  - **Runway 08–26**: 6,300 feet long, 1,000 feet wide (500 feet on each side of the centerline).
  - **Runway 04–22**: 3,400 feet long, 500 feet wide (250 feet on each side).
  - These strips are clearly delineated on Plan V.226.

- **Transitional Surface**: An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 vertical foot to 7 horizontal feet**, extending from the lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces upward to intersect with the horizontal surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent runway. This ensures a smooth transition between the runway edge and the airspace above, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or structure height.

### **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kamloops Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The outer limits of these lands are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are officially incorporated into the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated airport property) are **exempt** from these regulations.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object **on land subject to these regulations** if the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at that location**:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Horizontal Surface**  
3. **Outer Surface**  
4. **Transitional Surfaces**

This means that all structures—new or additions to existing ones—must remain **below or at the same elevation** as these imaginary surfaces at every point along their footprint.

---

### **5. Geographical Coordinates and Reference Points**

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at:
  - 500 feet south of a point 3,139.2 feet east along the centerline of Runway 08–26 from the westerly intersection of that line with the westerly boundary of **Block 1, Lot A**, Kamloops Division, Yale District, Plan 3049.
  - That intersection is 1,095.25 feet south of the most westerly northwest corner of Block 1.

> This precise point is used as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements in the regulations.

#### **Runway Centerline and Outer Limits**
- Two lines are drawn **parallel to and 7,500 feet away** from the centerline of Runway 08–26:
  - The centerline extends westward through an iron pipe in concrete on the west boundary of Block 1 of Lot A (1,095.25 feet south of its northwest corner).
  - It extends eastward through an iron pipe on the west boundary of Lot 5, Block 7 (344.60 feet south of its northwest corner).
- From these centerlines, **two perpendicular lines** are drawn at 17,500 feet east and west of the runway ends, forming the outer limits of the approach and horizontal surfaces.

> These boundaries are explicitly shown on **Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969**.

### **6. Purpose and Safety Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is **aviation safety**. By defining imaginary surfaces—approach, horizontal, outer, and transitional—these rules:

- Prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff and landing.
- Ensure unimpeded visibility and flight paths.
- Maintain safe vertical clearance around runways and approach zones.
- Account for both long-range and short-range approach scenarios.

The use of specific ratios (e.g., 1:50, 1:40, 1:20, 1:7) ensures that the surfaces are gradually sloped to allow aircraft to maintain visual contact with the ground and avoid terrain or man-made structures.

---

### **7. Legal Authority and Enforcement**

- The regulations are enforceable under provincial zoning and land use laws.
- Violations involve constructing or modifying structures that exceed the defined elevation limits.
- Compliance is mandatory for all landowners and developers within the regulated area.

---

### **8. Key Visual and Reference Documents**

All described surfaces and boundaries are **graphically illustrated** on:

> **Department of Transport Plan No. V.226, dated January 15, 1969**

This plan is the **primary reference** for:
- Location of the airport reference point
- Runway centerlines
- Approach and transitional surfaces
- Outer limits
- Strip dimensions

Developers, planners, and landowners must consult this plan to verify compliance.

### **9. Repealed Provisions**

- The reference to **"Minister"** (likely a former authority figure) has been **repealed** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**, indicating that the current regulation is now administered under updated jurisdictional frameworks.

### **Conclusion**

The **Kamloops Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive set of spatial and height controls designed to protect aviation safety by limiting the vertical extent of structures near the airport. By defining precise imaginary surfaces—approach, horizontal, outer, and transitional—the regulations create a safe buffer zone around runways and approach paths. These rules
