### **Repayment Terms**
The loan is structured with several distinct repayment obligations and conditions:

#### 1. **Initial Repayment (Mandatory by July 31, 2008)**
- A repayment of **$9,300,000** is due by **July 31, 2008**.
- This amount is **reduced** by any monthly payments of **$265,000** made on or after **October 30, 2007**.
  - For example, if $265,000 is paid monthly, the net repayment obligation is reduced accordingly.

#### 2. **Supplemental Security Requirement (from Buhler Industries Inc.)**
- **Buhler Industries Inc.** must provide the Minister of Industry with **valid and enforceable security** in the amount of **$5,000,000**.
- This security must be in place by **July 31, 2008**.
- The security remains in effect until **October 21, 2017**.

> *Note: This security serves as a financial guarantee to protect the government in the event of default.*

#### 3. **Immediate Repayment Trigger (if Buhler's operations cease in Canada)**
- If **Buhler Industries Inc.** ceases operations or moves its tractor factory **outside of Canada prior to October 22, 2017**, then:
  - FNH or the Minister is entitled to an **immediate repayment of $5,000,000**.
  - If this repayment is not made, the **Minister of Industry may realize the security** (i.e., enforce the collateral) to recover the amount.

> *This clause links the financial stability of Buhler Industries to the repayment obligations of the loan, creating a risk-sharing mechanism.*

#### 4. **Loan Duration and Extension**
- The loan agreement is **extended to October 22, 2017**.
- This date marks the final maturity point of the loan and the end of the security period.

---

### **Conditional Requirement**
- The loan is **only granted** if FNH has entered into a formal **Asset Purchase Agreement** for the Winnipeg Facility.
- This ensures that the acquisition of the facility is legally binding and that the government is investing in a concrete, planned transaction.

---

### **Repeal Note**
- Section 3 of the regulation, which originally detailed the repayment structure, was **repealed** by **SOR/2000-267, section 3** (Statutory Order 2000–267).
- This indicates that the original repayment terms may have been revised or replaced by subsequent legislation or administrative decisions.

> *Important Note: The repeal suggests that the current version of the regulations may not reflect the most up-to-date terms, and the original provisions may no longer be legally binding.*

### **Critical Observations**
- The regulations reflect a **government-backed industrial investment strategy** aimed at supporting regional manufacturing, particularly in the agricultural equipment sector.
- The inclusion of **collateral from Buhler Industries** introduces a cross-company financial linkage, suggesting that the success of one industrial entity (Buhler) is tied to the financial obligations of another (FNH).
- The **repeal of a key section in 2000** raises concerns about the current legal enforceability and completeness of the regulations. It may indicate that the original repayment terms were modified, or that the loan was restructured or terminated.
- The loan structure combines **fixed repayment schedules**, **collateral**, and **performance-based triggers**, typical of public-private partnership financing in industrial development.

### **Conclusion**
The *Ford New Holland, Inc. Loan Regulations* were designed to facilitate the acquisition and modernization of a key farm equipment manufacturing facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The loan, capped at $45.5 million, is structured with a clear repayment schedule, security provisions, and performance-based triggers involving Buhler Industries Inc. However, due to the **repeal of a central section in 2000**, the current regulatory text may no longer fully reflect the actual terms of the loan. As such, while the framework is historically significant in demonstrating government support for industrial expansion, its **current legal validity and enforceability must be verified against updated legislation or administrative records**.

> **Recommendation**: For any legal or financial assessment, stakeholders should consult the most recent version of the regulation or official government archives to confirm whether the 2000 repeal has been superseded or if alternative agreements now govern the loan.
