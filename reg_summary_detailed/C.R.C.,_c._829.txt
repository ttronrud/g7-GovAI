**Detailed Summary of the *Potato Processing Plant Liquid Effluent Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Potato Processing Plant Liquid Effluent Regulations** and may be cited as such. They are designed to regulate the discharge of liquid effluents from potato processing plants into water bodies frequented by fish, in accordance with the *Fisheries Act*.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal basis for environmental protection of fish habitats. |
| **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** | A measure of the amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to decompose organic matter in wastewater. High BOD levels reduce dissolved oxygen in water, harming aquatic life. |
| **Canned Potato Products Plant** | A facility where raw potatoes are peeled, shaped, and prepared for canning and preservation. |
| **Dehydrated Potato Products Plant** | A facility that removes moisture from raw potatoes using heat, vacuum, or air drying, producing granules, flakes, or slices. |
| **Composite Sample** | A sample collected over a 24-hour period (or in equal intervals) that represents the average effluent flow during that time. |
| **Deposit** | To discharge or allow the discharge of effluent into water bodies where fish live. |
| **Effluent** | All wastewaters generated by a plant, including process water, wash water, tank drainage, storm water, and treatment facility waste. **Exclusions**: <br> - Storm water that is protected from contamination and has a BOD ≤ 50 mg/L in at least 3 samples taken every 15 minutes; <br> - Wastewater treated off-site for pH control and removal of deleterious substances, provided the final pH is between 6.0 and 9.0 and total deleterious substances (after treatment + direct deposit) do not exceed authorized limits. |
| **Existing Plant** | A plant that began commercial operations before **June 27, 1977**. |
| **Expanded Plant** | A plant where the annual raw potato processing volume exceeds **2.5 times** the volume processed in 1976. These regulations apply from the **first day of the month following** the month in which expansion occurs. |
| **Frozen Potato Products Plant** | A facility where raw potatoes are processed and distributed in frozen form. |
| **New Plant** | A plant that began operations **on or after June 27, 1977**. |
| **Owner of a Plant** | The owner, operator, or their authorized representative. |
| **Plant** | Encompasses all facilities involved in converting raw potatoes or derivatives into products such as frozen, canned, dehydrated, or starch-based products, including storage, processing, shipping, and packaging. |
| **Process Water** | Water that comes into contact with potatoes at any stage of processing (e.g., washing, cleaning). |
| **Processing Day** | A 24-hour period (or part thereof) during which the plant is operating. |
| **Raw Potatoes Processed** | Net quantity (in tonnes) of raw potatoes received at the start of the processing line after washing. |
| **Starch Plant** | A facility that processes raw potatoes into potato starch. |
| **Storm Water** | Rainwater or runoff that flows over or through the plant site. |
| **Total Suspended Matter (TSM)** | Non-filterable solid particles suspended in effluent. |

> *Note: The "Minister" reference was repealed by SOR/95-426, s.1 and is no longer active.*

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to:
  - **All new plants** (those starting operations on or after June 27, 1977).
  - **All expanded plants** (those exceeding 2.5× the 1976 production volume).
- Upon becoming an expanded plant, the plant becomes subject to these regulations on the **first day of the following month**.

---

### **4. Deleterious Substances Prescribed**

Under section 34(1) of the *Fisheries Act*, the following substances are designated as **deleterious** (harmful to fish and aquatic ecosystems):

1. **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**
2. **Total Suspended Matter (TSM)**

These are the only substances regulated under this regulation for discharge into fish habitats.

---

### **5. Authorization Limits for Discharge**

An owner of a plant may discharge the prescribed deleterious substances **only if**:

- The **actual daily deposit** of each deleterious substance (measured per day) does **not exceed** the authorized daily limit for the plant class (as specified in **Column III** of Schedule I).
- The **average daily deposit** over a month (calculated monthly) does **not exceed** the authorized monthly limit (as specified in **Column IV** of Schedule I).
- The **pH of each composite sample** of effluent is between **6.0 and 9.0**.

> These limits are based on the plant’s class (e.g., small, medium, large) and are determined in Schedule I.

---

### **6. Requirements for Monitoring and Compliance**

Owners must establish and maintain systems to monitor effluent quality and volume. This includes:

#### **(a) Sampling and Analysis**
- Install and maintain **sampling connections and flow-measuring devices**, approved in writing by the Minister.
- Take **composite samples** during each processing day, collected:
  - Continuously over 24 hours at a rate proportional to flow; or
  - In equal volumes at intervals not exceeding one hour (totaling 24 hours).
- Analyze samples using approved methods (see below).

#### **(b) Sampling Frequency**
- **Plants processing <400 tonnes of raw potatoes per week**: One composite sample per week.
- **Plants processing ≥400 tonnes per week**: Two composite samples per week.

#### **(c) Analytical Methods**
- **BOD and TSM concentrations** must be measured using:
  - The test method listed in **Column I** of Schedule II, modified as per **Column II**; or
  - Any other method approved in writing by the Minister, provided results can be verified using the standard method.
- **pH measurement** must be done using:
  - The method prescribed in **section 424** of *Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 14th Edition (1975)*; or
  - Any other method approved by the Minister, provided it can be confirmed by the standard method.

> All sampling, preservation, storage, and handling must follow procedures outlined in the *Standard Methods* publication (14th ed., 1975), jointly published by:
> - American Public Health Association (APHA)
> - American Water Works Association (AWWA)
> - Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF)

#### **(d) Flow Measurement**
- The flow rate of each type of effluent must be **measured continuously** and recorded.

#### **(e) Calculating Daily and Monthly Deposits**
- **Actual daily deposit** (per tonne of raw potatoes processed):
  - Calculated from BOD and TSM data and flow measurements.
  - Expressed in **kg per tonne of raw potatoes processed per day**.
- **Average daily deposit per month**:
  - The average of daily deposits during the month.
  - Expressed in the same units as above.

### **7. Reporting Requirements**

Owners must submit a **monthly report** within **30 days after the end of each month**, containing:

1. Actual daily deposit of deleterious substances (per day samples were taken).
2. Average daily deposit of deleterious substances (monthly average).
3. pH values of composite samples.
4. Daily production (in tonnes of raw potatoes processed) for days with samples.
5. Weekly production (in tonnes) for each week of the month.
6. Number of operating days.
7. Total daily flow (in litres) for each effluent type on days with samples.

> The report must be in a form approved in writing by the Minister.

---

### **8. Initial and Annual Declarations**

- **New Plant**:
  - Must submit a declaration **before depositing any effluent**, including:
    - Projected weekly and annual production (in tonnes of raw potatoes).
    - List of major products produced.

- **Expanded Plant**:
  - Must submit a declaration **within 30 days** of becoming subject to the regulations, containing the same information as above.

- **Annual Declaration**:
  - Must be submitted **within 30 days after the end of each calendar year**, showing actual production (in tonnes of raw potatoes) for the prior year.

---

### **9. Flexibility for Sampling, Analysis, and Reporting**

If the owner can **demonstrate to the Minister’s satisfaction** that a different (non-standard) sampling, analysis, or reporting schedule is scientifically and technically sufficient to verify compliance with authorized deposit limits, the Minister may:

- Approve a **customized sampling, measurement, or reporting schedule**.
- Allow the owner to:
  - Take and analyze samples on a specified regular basis;
  - Measure effluent volume on a specified basis;
  - Report data on a specified schedule.

> If such a scheme is fully implemented and approved, **Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 do not apply** to the plant
