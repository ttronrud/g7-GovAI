**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title and Legal Basis**

This regulation is titled:  
**"Order on the Fixing, Imposing, and Collecting of Levies on Maple Syrup Producers for Interprovincial and Export Trade"**  
Issued by the **Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec (Fédération)** under **Sections 3 and 4 of the Quebec Maple Sap and Maple Syrup Order**, made by **Order in Council P.C. 1993-606**, dated March 30, 1993.

It establishes a levy system to fund the collective management and promotion of maple syrup production in Quebec, specifically for **bulk maple syrup** traded **interprovincially or exported**.

> **Note**: This regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2018-125, section 2**, effective in 2018. Therefore, it is no longer in force and does not apply today.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several key terms:

1. **Buyer**  
   A person who purchases or receives maple syrup in bulk from a producer.

2. **Commodity Board**  
   The **Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec** — the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers’ Federation. This body is responsible for administering the levy, collecting funds, and managing the economic interests of producers in the industry.

3. **Maple Syrup**  
   Any maple syrup produced in the Province of Quebec and marketed in **bulk** (i.e., in large quantities, not for retail or consumer use).

4. **Producer**  
   A person who:
   - Owns, leases, or operates a sugar bush (a maple tree farm) in Quebec;
   - Produces maple syrup directly or through an agent or third party;
   - Markets the syrup in **bulk** for **interprovincial trade or export**.

---

### **Levy Amount and Application**

- **Levy Rate**:  
  Every producer must pay a levy of **$0.14 per pound** of maple syrup that is marketed in bulk for interprovincial or export trade.

- **Scope of Levy**:  
  Applies only to **bulk maple syrup** sold outside Quebec or to other provinces. It does not apply to syrup sold directly to consumers or in small retail quantities.

---

### **Collection and Remittance Requirements**

#### 1. **Producer Responsibility (Primary Obligation)**  
- The producer must **pay the levy directly** to the Commodity Board (Fédération) at its head office in **Longueuil, Quebec**.
- Payment must be made **within the time limit** specified in **Section 3 of the Règlement sur les contributions des producteurs acéricoles du Québec (RLRQ, c. M-35.1, r. 9.2)**.

> This time limit is typically a set number of days (e.g., 30 days) from the date of sale or shipment, as defined in the underlying regulation.

#### 2. **Buyer Responsibility (Secondary Obligation – if Producer Fails to Pay)**  
- If a producer fails to remit the levy by the deadline, the **buyer** (who is located in Quebec) must:
  - **Deduct the levy of $0.14 per pound** from the payment they make to the producer;
  - **Remit the full amount of the levy directly** to the Commodity Board at its Longueuil office;
  - Do so **within the same time limit** as required under the Règlement.

> This mechanism ensures that the levy is collected even if the producer defaults, protecting the financial interests of the Commodity Board.

### **Purpose of the Levy**

The levy was designed to:
- Generate revenue for the **Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec** to support:
  - Quality control;
  - Promotion and marketing of Quebec maple syrup;
  - Research and development;
  - Protection of the brand and market value of Quebec maple syrup in national and international markets;
- Ensure fair and sustainable economic participation in interprovincial and export trade.

---

### **Geographic and Trade Scope**

- Applies **only to bulk maple syrup**.
- Applies to **interprovincial trade** (sales to other Canadian provinces) and **export trade** (sales to foreign countries).
- Does **not apply** to:
  - Retail sales;
  - Sales to consumers;
  - Small-scale or individual production.

---

### **Repeal Status**

- This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2018-125, Section 2**, which came into force in 2018.
- As a result, **the $0.14 per pound levy no longer exists** under this legal instrument.
- The repeal reflects a broader shift in how maple syrup production and trade are regulated in Quebec, with newer frameworks likely replacing this system.

---

### **Conclusion**

This 1993 regulation established a **mandatory levy of $0.14 per pound** on producers of bulk maple syrup traded outside Quebec. It created a clear mechanism for both producers and buyers to contribute to the collective economic and promotional interests of Quebec’s maple syrup industry. However, due to its **repeal in 2018**, the levy is **no longer in effect**.

> **Important Note**: While this regulation was historically significant in shaping Quebec’s maple syrup trade policy, it is now obsolete. Current regulations may involve different funding mechanisms, such as producer fees, marketing programs, or participation in the Quebec Maple Syrup Commission (CSC), which may now manage such responsibilities.
