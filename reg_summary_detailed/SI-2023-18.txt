## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Republic of Austria**

### 🔹 **Overview**
This regulation is a formal **proclamation** issued by the Government of Canada under the authority of the *Old Age Security Act* (OASA), confirming that the **Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Republic of Austria** (the "Agreement") officially **entered into force on July 1, 2023**. The Agreement was originally signed in 1987 and supplemented in 1995, and this 2023 proclamation finalizes its implementation after meeting all legal and procedural requirements.

---

## 📌 Key Background and Legal Framework

### 1. **Entry into Force**
- The Agreement enters into force **on the first day of the fourth month following the month in which the second diplomatic note is received**, as per **Article 32** of the Agreement.
- The **second diplomatic note** confirming completion of internal legal procedures was exchanged in **March 2023**.
- Therefore, the Agreement entered into force on **July 1, 2023**.

### 2. **Legal Process in Canada**
- The Order in Council (P.C. 2022-658) declaring the Agreement’s entry into force was laid before both Houses of Parliament on:
  - June 14, 2022 (House of Commons)
  - June 15, 2022 (Senate)
- No motion to revoke the Order was filed before the 20th sitting day.
- Under **subsection 42(2) of the Old Age Security Act**, the Order came into force on the **30th sitting day after being laid before Parliament**, which was **October 27, 2022** — a date prior to the actual entry into force.
- However, the **actual date of entry into force** was determined by the diplomatic exchange and the clause in Article 32, not the parliamentary timeline.

> ✅ Thus, **July 1, 2023**, is the legally binding date when the Agreement becomes effective.
