### **Detailed Summary of the Goose Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Goose Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1)** to ensure the safe operation of Goose Bay Airport in Newfoundland and Labrador. These regulations were developed to prevent any development or land use that could interfere with aviation safety, particularly in relation to aircraft approach, takeoff, and navigation.

---

## **I. Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulations were made pursuant to **subsection 5.5(1)a of the Aeronautics Act**, which requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly advertised in local and national newspapers to allow for public comment.

- **Public Notice and Opportunity for Comment**:  
  A copy of the proposed regulations was published:
  - In **The Labradorian** (local newspaper) on **March 19 and 26, 2001**.
  - In **Canada Gazette, Part I** on **March 24 and 31, 2001**.
  
  This ensured a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, developers, local communities) to submit representations to the **Minister of National Defence**.

- **Justification for Regulation**:  
  The proposed regulations were intended to **prevent land use or development** near the airport that might be **incompatible with safe airport operations**, such as interference with aircraft visibility, communication, or flight paths.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  Based on the Minister’s recommendation, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** formally enacted the regulations under **paragraph 5.4(2)(b)a of the Aeronautics Act**.

## **II. Scope and Application**

### **Applicable Lands**
- The regulations apply to **all lands** (excluding airport lands and public road allowances) that are:
  - **Adjacent to or in the vicinity of Goose Bay Airport**.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part 7 of the Schedule**.
- The regulations do **not apply** to:
  - Airport lands themselves.
  - Public road allowances.

> This ensures that only lands surrounding the airport are subject to height and land-use restrictions, protecting the operational integrity of the airport without restricting development on official airport or public infrastructure.

## **III. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Goose Bay Airport, located in the Electoral District of Lake Melville, Newfoundland. |
| **Airport Zoning Reference Point (AZRP)** | A fixed point at **44.6 metres above mean sea level**, located at the intersection of the centerline of runway 08–26 and the easterly end of the strip associated with runway 26. Coordinates: **North 5,910,381.35 m, East 377,749.17 m**. This point serves as a reference for all elevation calculations. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area (300 m wide) on either side of a runway, prepared for takeoff and landing. Includes runways 08–26 and 16–34. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip, designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility during approach. It slopes at a **1:60 ratio** (1 m vertical per 60 m horizontal) until it meets the outer surface. Then it slopes at a **1:50 ratio** to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end of the strip. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at **45 metres above the AZRP**, except where terrain is lower than 9 metres above ground — in those areas, the outer surface is set at **9 metres above ground**. This defines the maximum elevation allowed for any structure or natural growth. |

> All geometric descriptions use **MTM grid coordinates**, referenced to **Zone 4, NAD 83**, with longitude 61°30′W as the central meridian.

## **IV. Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

### **1. Building and Structure Height Restrictions**
- **No building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures) may be placed or constructed on regulated land such that:
  - The **highest point** of the structure exceeds:
    - The **approach surface**,
    - The **outer surface**, or
    - The **transitional surface**.

> This ensures that no obstruction (e.g., towers, trees, buildings) will interfere with aircraft during approach or takeoff.

### **2. Natural Growth Restrictions**
- No owner or lessee may allow **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to exceed:
  - The elevation of any of the above-mentioned surfaces **at the point directly beneath** the object.
- This includes **tree height**, **cliffs**, or **vegetation growth** that could create visual or radar interference.

### **3. Use Restrictions to Prevent Aeronautical Interference**
- No use of land may interfere with:
  - **Aeronautical communications** (e.g., radio signals, radar, navigation).
- This includes avoiding activities that cause signal blockage or noise.

### **4. Bird Hazard Prohibitions**
To reduce bird-related aviation risks, the following sites are **prohibited**:
- **Sanitary landfills**
- **Food garbage disposal sites**
- **Sewage lagoons**
- **Open water storage reservoirs**

> These are high-risk areas for attracting birds, which can pose a serious threat to aircraft safety.

## **V. Geometric Descriptions (Key Features)**

### **Runway Strips**
| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **08–26** | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 3,488.33 m |
| **16–34** | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 3,041.15 m |

> Both strips are described in **Public Works and Government Services Canada Goose Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. S-4006**, dated **February 11, 2000**.

---

### **Approach Surfaces**
Each approach surface:
- Begins with a **1:60 slope** from the end of the strip to meet the outer surface.
- Then continues with a **1:50 slope** to a horizontal line **15,000 m** from the runway end.
- The outer ends of this line are **2,400 m** from the runway centerline.
- The height of this horizontal line is:
  - **291.7 m** above the elevation at the end of runway 08.
  - **291.0 m** above the elevation at runways 26, 16, and 34.

> These surfaces are designed to provide a clear zone for aircraft to approach safely, especially during low visibility or adverse weather.

---

### **Outer Surface**
- A **common plane** at **45 metres above the AZRP**.
- If terrain is **less than 9 metres above ground**, the outer surface is **set at 9 metres above ground**.
- This ensures that even in hilly or low-lying areas, structures do not exceed safe limits.

> The outer surface forms a protective boundary for all developments around the airport.

---

### **Outer Limits of Regulated Lands**
The outer boundaries are defined by a complex series of arcs and straight lines, based on circles of **4,000 m** and **8,000 m** radii centered at the midpoints of each runway end.

#### Example: Outer Limits (for 4,000 m radius)
- Starts at intersection of northerly limit of runway 16’s approach surface and a 4,000 m arc.
- Follows arcs and straight-line segments in a closed loop, returning to the start.
- Covers areas around all four runways (08–26, 16–34, 26–08, 34–16).

#### Example: Outer Limits (for 8,000 m radius)
- Larger, more expansive boundary using **8,000 m radius circles**.
- Designed to provide additional protection for long-range aircraft approaches.

> These boundaries are shown on the **Goose Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. S-4006**, and define the **maximum extent** of land subject to the zoning rules.

## **VI. Enforcement and Effective Date**

- **Effective Date**:  
  The regulations come into force on the **day of registration** (not specified in the text but typically within days of publication).

- **Enforcement Authority**:  
  The **Minister of National Defence** is responsible for enforcing these regulations, as they are directly related to national aeronautical safety.

- **Compliance Mechanism**:  
  Landowners and developers must ensure that all structures, vegetation, and land uses comply with the defined elevation and use restrictions.
