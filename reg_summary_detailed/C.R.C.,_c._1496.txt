  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It is no longer needed or relevant to current laws or policy.
- The repeal of the regulation under **SOR/2007-128, s. 406** means that any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in that regulation are now **void** and **not applicable**.
