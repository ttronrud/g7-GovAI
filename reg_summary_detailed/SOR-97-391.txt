---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
- The repeated phrase "[Repealed, SOR/2007-115, s. 402]" is a standard notation used in Canadian regulatory documents to indicate that a particular provision (in this case, section 402) has been formally removed or canceled.
- The term "SOR" stands for **Statutory Instrument**, which is a type of regulatory document issued under the authority of a federal or provincial government to implement or amend legislation.
- SOR/2007-115 refers to the **Statutory Instrument of 2007, number 115**, which was published by the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context — typically federal in such references).

#### 2. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**
- "Repealed" means the provision is **no longer in force**.
- It has been officially **cancelled or replaced**, either by a new law, amendment, or by its own provisions.
- In this case, **section 402 of SOR/2007-115** is the one that repeals itself — that is, it is the section that **cancels or removes** a prior provision (likely another section of the same regulation or a different regulation).

#### 3. **Context of SOR/2007-115**
- SOR/2007-115 is known as the **"Regulation respecting the operation of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1988"**, or possibly another environmental or administrative regulation depending on the jurisdiction.
- However, without the full text of the regulation, the exact subject matter of section 402 cannot be confirmed.
- The fact that it is repeated 115 times (likely a formatting or duplication error) suggests that the original document may have had multiple references to this repeal, or it is a copy-paste error in the input.

#### 4. **Legal Implications**
- Once a regulation is repealed, **it is no longer enforceable**.
- Any legal actions, compliance requirements, or administrative procedures based on that section are **invalid or obsolete**.
- Legal practitioners, compliance officers, or government officials must refer to **current, active regulations** to ensure adherence to the law.

#### 5. **Why Was It Repealed?**
- Common reasons for repeal include:
  - The provision was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It was redundant or conflicting with newer legislation.
  - It was replaced by a more effective or comprehensive regulation.
  - It was found to be unjust or overly restrictive.
- Since the repeal is carried out by **section 402 of the same instrument**, it suggests that the regulation was **self-correcting** — a provision was included to remove itself upon publication.

### Conclusion:

> The regulation referenced in the input — **section 402 of Statutory Instrument SOR/2007-115** — has been **officially repealed**. This means the provision is **no longer in effect** and must not be applied in any legal, administrative, or compliance context. The repeal is explicitly stated within the same instrument (SOR/2007-115), indicating that the regulation itself included a mechanism to remove or cancel its own section. 

> **Note**: The repetition of the same line 115 times appears to be a formatting or data entry error and does not add substantive content. The legal significance lies solely in the single, repeated statement of repeal.
