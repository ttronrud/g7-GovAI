Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled *Port Hardy Airport Zoning Regulations*, enacted under the *Aeronautics Act* (R.S. 1985, c. 33 (1st supp.)):

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Port Hardy Airport Zoning Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**
- These regulations were adopted pursuant to **Section 5.4** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which allows the Minister of Transport to make zoning regulations for airports.
- A **proposed version** of the regulations was published in two successive issues of:
  - *Canada Gazette Part I* (August 26 and September 2, 1989)
  - *North Island Gazette* (September 27 and October 4, 1989)
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity for public comment** and representation to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on that public input, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally enacted the regulations.

> ✅ **Key Principle**: The regulation follows a transparent, public consultation process before final adoption.

### **2. Title and Citation**
- **Official Title**: *Port Hardy Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Citation**: R.S. 1985, c. 33 (1st supp.)

### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to *Port Hardy Airport*, located in the District of Port Hardy, Province of British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as a datum for elevation and spatial measurements. Located 154.0 m southwesterly from a point on runway approach 11. |
| **Approach Surface** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of a runway strip, designed to ensure aircraft have clear visual and spatial access during landing. Each has a specific slope, horizontal distance, and elevation. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP**, but capped at **9 meters above ground level** if the ground elevation is lower than 9 m. |
| **Strip** | The main runway and its associated landing area (rectangular zone), defined by width, length, and position relative to runways. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary surface connecting the approach and strip boundaries to the outer surface, ensuring a smooth transition in elevation and space. |

> ⚠️ **Elevation Reference**:  
> The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point is 9.805 meters above sea level**.

---

### **4. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to all lands that meet **either of the following criteria**:

1. **Within the outer limits** of the lands described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.
2. **Directly beneath any portion of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limits.

> 📍 This includes public road allowances and adjacent private lands within the designated zone.

---

### **5. Restrictions on Construction and Development**

#### ❌ **Prohibited Activities**
No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones) on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

#### 🌿 **Natural Growth Exceptions**
- If a **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds any of the above surfaces, the **Minister may require** the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive portion**.

> 💡 This ensures that natural features do not create hazards or visual obstructions for aircraft.

#### 🚫 **Prohibition on Waste Disposal**
- No owner or occupier may allow land under these regulations to be used for:
  - The **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> 🐦 **Rationale**: Prevents bird attraction, which could lead to bird strikes and flight safety risks.

### **6. Detailed Descriptions of Key Zones**

#### ✅ **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **154.0 m southwesterly** at right angles from a point 825.0 m southeasterly along the centerline of runway approach 11.
- **UTM Coordinates**: N5,615,390.269; E615,541.334
- Serves as the **origin point** for all elevations and spatial measurements.

---

#### ✅ **Approach Surfaces (6 surfaces total)**  
Each surface is an inclined plane rising from the end of a runway strip to a defined horizontal line. Key parameters:

| Runway Approach | Slope Ratio | Horizontal Distance | Height of Imaginary Line | Distance from Strip End |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 07 (Runway 07) | 1:25 (1m up : 25m out) | 2,530 m | 101.2 m above strip end | 283 m from centerline |
| 25 (Runway 25) | 1:25 | 2,530 m | 101.2 m above strip end | 283 m from centerline |
| 11 (Runway 11) | 1:50 | 15,000 m | 300 m above strip end | 2,400 m from centerline |
| 29 (Runway 29) | 1:40 | 3,000 m | 75 m above strip end | 450 m from centerline |
| 16 (Runway 16) | 1:25 | 2,080 m | 83.2 m above strip end | 283 m from centerline |
| 34 (Runway 34) | 1:25 | 2,080 m | 83.2 m above strip end | 283 m from centerline |

> 📌 These surfaces are designed to provide a safe buffer zone for aircraft during approach and landing, minimizing visual and physical obstructions.

---

#### ✅ **Outer Surface**
- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 9.805 + 45 = **54.805 meters above sea level**).
- **Exception**: If the ground is below 9 meters, the surface is **capped at 9 meters above ground**.
- Acts as the **upper boundary** of the entire protected zone.

> 🚨 This ensures that no structure or object can rise above this level — even at the edge of the airport.

---

#### ✅ **Strips (3 main runway zones)**  
Each strip defines the active area for takeoff and landing:

| Runway | Width | Length | Side Distance |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 07–25 | 60 m (30 m each side) | 1,339.2 m | Centered on runway |
| 11–29 | 300 m (150 m each side) | 1,644 m | Widest strip, for major operations |
| 16–34 | 150 m (75 m each side) | 2,239.2 m | Longest runway, critical for operations |

> 🛫 The wider and longer strips reflect the airport’s operational importance and aircraft traffic patterns.

---

#### ✅ **Transitional Surfaces**
These connect the strip and approach surfaces to the outer surface, ensuring a smooth and safe gradient.

| Runway | Surface Type | Slope Ratio | Elevation Cap |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| 07–25 | Inclined planes | 1:5 (1m up : 5m out) | 54.805 m above sea level |
| 11–29 | Inclined planes | 1:7 (1m up : 7m out) | 54.805 m above sea level |
| 16–34 | Vertical planes | No slope (vertical) | 54.805 m above sea level |

> ⚙️ **Note**: The 16–34 transitional surface is **vertical**, meaning it rises straight up from the lateral edges of the strip — a design choice to manage terrain and ensure safe visual separation.

---

### **7. Boundary Description of Outer Limits**
The boundary of the regulated land is defined by a detailed **polygonal traverse** using UTM coordinates and azimuths. Key points include:

- Begins at the **Airport Reference Point**.
- Traverses through:
  - Centerline of runway 11–29
  - Southwesterly and southeasterly limits of strips and approach surfaces
  - Intersections with transitional surfaces
  - Corners of approach surfaces (e.g., 07, 34)
- Ends at the **southwest corner of Approach Surface 11**, which is at **N5,623,616.771,
