**Detailed Summary of the Groupe CSL Inc. Acquisition Exemption Order**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**
The Order is issued under the authority of **subsection 253(6)** of the *National Transportation Act, 1987* (S.C. 1987, c. 34). This provision empowers the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the **National Transportation Agency (NTA)**—to exempt specific transactions from the regulatory requirements of **Part VII** of the Act. Part VII of the National Transportation Act governs the **prohibition of certain acquisitions or mergers** that could substantially affect competition in the transportation sector, particularly those involving control of transportation services or assets that are considered critical to national transportation infrastructure.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **exempt a specific share acquisition** by **Groupe CSL Inc.** from the mandatory scrutiny and potential restrictions imposed under Part VII of the National Transportation Act. This exemption is granted to facilitate business restructuring or ownership changes without triggering antitrust or competition-related regulatory review.

**3. Scope of the Exemption:**
The exemption specifically applies to the **acquisition by Groupe CSL Inc. of all shares of Groupe CSL Inc. currently held by Fednav Limited**. This is a **shareholding transaction** involving the internal transfer of ownership within the same corporate entity—Groupe CSL Inc.—from one shareholder (Fednav Limited) to the company itself.

**4. Key Legal and Regulatory Implications:**
- **No Market Power or Competitive Concerns:** The exemption is justified because the transaction does not result in a change of control of a transportation service provider or the acquisition of a transportation asset that could affect competition in the sector. It is a purely internal reorganization of ownership.
- **No New Service or Market Entry:** Since the acquisition does not involve the expansion of transportation services, entry into a new market, or consolidation of competing transportation operators, it does not pose a threat to market competition.
- **Exemption from Scrutiny:** As a result, the transaction is **not subject to the review, approval, or conditions** typically required under Part VII, such as:
  - Notification to the National Transportation Agency
  - Assessment of competitive effects
  - Public interest considerations
  - Conditions for market access or service obligations

**5. Citation and Legal Status:**
The Order is formally titled the **Groupe CSL Inc. Acquisition Exemption Order** and may be cited as such. It is legally binding and enforceable under the *National Transportation Act, 1987*, and serves as an official regulatory instrument issued by the federal government to clarify and apply the Act’s provisions in a specific context.

**6. Significance:**
This exemption reflects the NTA’s recognition that **internal share transfers among shareholders of a single company**, especially where no change in control or service provision occurs, do not constitute a threat to competition and therefore do not require regulatory intervention. It streamlines corporate governance and allows for flexibility in ownership structures without triggering complex regulatory processes.

**7. Limitations:**
- The exemption is **limited in scope** to the specific transaction described (the transfer of shares from Fednav Limited to Groupe CSL Inc.).
- It does **not apply** to any other acquisitions, mergers, or share transfers involving Groupe CSL Inc. or other transportation entities.
- If a future acquisition by Groupe CSL Inc. involves transportation services, assets, or a change of control that could affect competition, it would still be subject to Part VII of the Act.

---

**Conclusion:**
This Order is a targeted, legally grounded exemption that allows Groupe CSL Inc. to complete an internal share transfer from Fednav Limited to itself without undergoing the formal regulatory review required under Part VII of the *National Transportation Act, 1987*. It underscores the principle that internal corporate transactions that do not impact market competition are exempt from antitrust scrutiny under the Act. The decision is consistent with the regulatory framework designed to protect competition while allowing legitimate corporate activity.
