**Detailed Summary of the "Prospectus (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations"**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.  
This authority is derived from **subsection 268(2)a of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*** (CCA Act), which empowers the federal government to make regulations governing the disclosure of information in connection with the distribution of securities by cooperative credit associations.

This provision allows for the establishment of specific rules governing prospectus requirements for such associations, ensuring transparency and investor protection in their financial operations.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary objective of these regulations is to **establish clear, enforceable requirements for the preparation, content, and disclosure of prospectuses** when cooperative credit associations issue or distribute securities (such as shares or debentures).

These rules ensure that all material information necessary for investors to make informed decisions is disclosed in a timely, accurate, and standardized manner.

### **3. Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Requirement to Disclose Information in a Prospectus**
- Before any securities are distributed (e.g., issued or offered to the public), the **information to be disclosed must be set out in a prospectus**.
- The content of the prospectus must include all information required under **any applicable legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule** to the regulations.

> *Note: The Schedule identifies specific provincial or federal securities laws that govern prospectus requirements. For example, it may include the *Securities Act* of a particular province or federal legislation like the *Canadian Securities Act*.*

#### **(b) Procedure for Disclosure**
- The **procedure** for disclosing information must follow the **prospectus disclosure procedure** required under any of the listed legislations in Column 2 of the Schedule.
- This ensures consistency with established regulatory frameworks, including timelines, filing requirements, review processes, and compliance obligations.

#### **(c) Form and Format of Disclosure**
- The **form and structure** of the disclosure must conform to the **prospectus form requirements** established under any legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule.
- This includes formatting standards, sections to be included (e.g., risk factors, financial statements, management details), and presentation standards to ensure clarity and completeness.

#### **(d) Compliance with Applicable Legislation**
- Any prospectus filed under the provisions of any legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule must **fully comply with the requirements** of that specific legislation.
- This includes adherence to disclosure rules, accuracy standards, and reporting obligations as prescribed by the relevant statute.

#### **(e) Exemptions from Prospectus Requirements**
- A person (such as a cooperative credit association) that is **exempt from prospectus requirements** under any of the listed legislation (e.g., due to small size, private placement, or regulatory exemption) is **also exempt from those requirements under these Regulations**.
- Additionally, if a person is subject to an **order issued by a relevant provincial securities regulator**, they are exempt from the prospectus requirements under these Regulations.
- This provision ensures that exemptions granted under other regulatory regimes are recognized and respected within the scope of these cooperative credit associations regulations.

### **4. Repeal Clause**
- The text includes two "[Repeal]" entries, which likely indicate that **prior or obsolete versions of these regulations have been formally repealed**.
