### 6. **Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

This section governs how periods of contribution or residence are **counted across borders** to determine eligibility.

#### A. OAS Act – Creditable Periods in Slovenia
- If a person is contributing to **Canada’s CPP or provincial pension plans** while residing in Slovenia:
  - That period counts as **residence in Canada** for the person and their **spouse/dependants** (if not employed/self-employed in Slovenia).
- If a person is contributing to **Slovenia’s system** while in Canada:
  - That period **does not count** as residence in Canada for spouse/dependants (unless covered by CPP or provincial plan).

#### B. CPP – Creditable Periods in Slovenia
- A **calendar year with at least 3 months** of creditable periods in Slovenia counts as a **full year** of CPP contributions.

#### C. Slovenia – Creditable Periods from Canada
- A **calendar year** of CPP contributions counts as **12 months** of creditable periods in Slovenia.
- A **month** of OAS eligibility (not part of a CPP period) counts as **1 month** of Slovenian creditable periods.

#### D. Disability & Survivor Pensions
- Same rule as above: **1 CPP year = 12 Slovenian months**.

#### E. Totalization of Periods
- If a person has **insufficient creditable periods** under either country, eligibility is determined by **totalizing all creditable periods** from both countries and any third country with reciprocal agreements.

> ✅ **Note**: Periods cannot overlap when calculating totalization.

---

### 7. **Benefit Calculation Rules**

#### A. For Canada (OAS and Spouse’s Allowance)
- If eligibility comes **only from totalization**:
  - **Earnings-related portion** is calculated based on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
  - **Flat-rate portion** is calculated as:
    > (Flat-rate amount under CPP) × (Ratio of actual CPP contributions to minimum qualifying period)
    > ⚠️ Ratio cannot exceed 1 (i.e., no more than full benefit).

#### B. For Slovenia
- If eligibility comes **only from totalization**:
  1. Calculate the **theoretical benefit** if all periods were completed under Slovenian law.
  2. Then apply a **proportional reduction** based on:
     > (Actual Slovenian creditable periods) ÷ (Total creditable periods)
  3. If total creditable periods exceed Slovenia’s **maximum allowable period**, the benefit is reduced proportionally.

> ✅ **Example**: If someone has 5 years of CPP contributions and 3 years of Slovenian contributions, the Slovenian pension is calculated based on 3/8 of the full benefit.

#### C. For Full Benefits (No Totalization)
- If eligibility is based solely on **Slovenian legislation**, the amount is determined **only on Slovenian creditable periods**.
