Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its background, legal basis, key provisions, scope, limitations, and implications.

## **Detailed Summary of the General Import Permit for Chickens and Chicken Products (Canada)**

### **1. Background and Context**

- **Import Control List Inclusion**:  
  Chickens and chicken products have been formally included on Canada’s *Import Control List*. This means that their importation is subject to specific regulatory oversight and permit requirements under Canadian trade and customs law.

- **Historical Permit**:  
  A prior *Import of Chickens Permit* was issued on **January 5, 1979** (SOR/79-72), which allowed the importation of chickens and chicken products under specific conditions. This permit was issued under the *Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)*.

- **Legal Basis for Cancellation and Replacement**:  
  The current regulation cancels the expired 1979 permit and replaces it with a new, general import permit under updated legal provisions, reflecting changes in international trade policy, particularly following the implementation of the **World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement**.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The permit is issued under the following statutes and sections:

- **Section 10 of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**:  
  Grants the Secretary of State for External Affairs the authority to **cancel** existing import permits and issue new ones.

- **Subsection 8.3(3) of the EIPA**:  
  Authorizes the issuance of a **General Import Permit** for specific goods when the Secretary determines that such imports are necessary and consistent with public interest and trade policy.

- **Section 106 of the EIPA (S.C. 1994, c. 47)**:  
  Provides for the establishment of an *import access quantity* for certain goods, including chickens and chicken products, ensuring that imports remain within sustainable and regulated limits.

- **Section 109 and Section 111 of the EIPA (S.C. 1994, c. 47)**:  
  These sections relate to the implementation of WTO obligations and the effective date of new permits. The permit becomes effective on the **latest date** when Sections 74, 106, 109, and 111 of the *WTO Implementation Act* (Chapter 47 of the Statutes of Canada, 1994) come into force.

> **Effective Date**: The permit becomes effective on the **latest of the dates** when these sections of the WTO Implementation Act came into force — which is generally interpreted as **December 1, 1994**, though the exact date may be confirmed by official records.

### **3. Purpose of the Permit**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- **Allow residents of Canada** to import chickens and chicken products for **personal use** and **family consumption**.
- Provide a **simplified, general import pathway** that replaces outdated, restrictive, or obsolete permits.
- Ensure compliance with **international trade obligations** under the WTO framework.
- Facilitate access to poultry products without requiring individual import permits, as long as the quantity and type of goods are within defined limits.

### **5. Import Limitations and Conditions**

#### **Quantity Limit**
- Each individual importation is limited to **a maximum of 10 kilograms (kg) in net weight**.
- This limit applies to **all chicken and chicken products** combined in a single shipment.
- The 10 kg limit is intended to prevent large-scale commercial importation and ensure the permit remains for **personal and household use only**.

#### **Eligibility**
- The permit is available to **any resident of Canada**.
- Imports must be for the **personal use of the importer and their household**.
- No resale, commercial distribution, or use for food service is permitted.

#### **Reporting Requirement**
- If the imported goods are subject to reporting under the *Customs Act*, the importer must include the following statement on the declaration form:
  > “Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 2 — Chickens and Chicken Products for Personal Use”  
  or in French:  
  > “Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 2 — Volaille et produits de volaille pour usage personnel”

This ensures transparency and compliance with customs tracking requirements.

### **6. Legal Status and Repeal**

- **Original Permit**: The specific import permit issued on **January 5, 1979** (SOR/79-72) has been **cancelled**.
- **New Permit**: A new, general permit is issued under **General Import Permit No. 2**.
- **Repeal**: This permit was **repealed by SOR/97-41, section 2**, indicating that it is no longer in force as of **1997** — but this appears to be a **conflicting or outdated reference** in the text.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The reference to *“Repealed, SOR/97-41, s. 2”* suggests a potential inconsistency. If this permit was officially repealed in 1997, then the current regulation may be **a reissue or correction** of a prior permit. However, the **effective date (December 1994)** and the **WTO alignment** suggest this is a **renewal or modernization** of the original 1979 permit, not a true repeal.

Thus, the regulation likely intends to **reinstate or reissue** the permit in a revised form, aligning it with updated WTO obligations and trade practices.
