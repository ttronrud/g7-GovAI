The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2007-163, s. 1]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instrument (SOR) /2007-163**, which was published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on May 29, 2007.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been officially repealed.
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2007-163, section 1**. SOR stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Province of Ontario" (though in some contexts, it may refer to federal instruments—context matters).

- **Date of Repeal**: May 29, 2007 (the publication date of SOR/2007-163).
- **Legal Effect**: The repeal means that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework. Any provisions, duties, or requirements previously set out in the regulation are no longer enforceable or applicable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed to:
  - Eliminate outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Simplify the regulatory framework.
  - Align with updated laws or policies.
  - Avoid legal inconsistencies or conflicts with newer legislation.

### Important Notes:
- The exact name or subject matter of the original regulation is **not provided** in the text. To fully understand the scope of the repeal, one would need to refer to the original regulation that was repealed (which is now inaccessible or archived).
- Without the original regulation's title or content, the summary remains general.
- The repetition of the same line three times may be a formatting or typographical error in the source document and does not imply multiple distinct regulations.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **formally repealed** by **SOR/2007-163, section 1**, meaning it is no longer valid or enforceable. The repeal took effect on or after May 29, 2007. The specific content or purpose of the original regulation cannot be determined from this information alone and would require access to the original text or related legislative records.

For accurate context, further research into the original regulation or the full text of SOR/2007-163 is recommended.
