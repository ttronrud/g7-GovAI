**Detailed Summary of the Rimouski Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Rimouski Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in two successive issues of local newspapers (Le Rimouski and Progrès-Echo) to ensure public notice and opportunity for comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt and implement the proposed regulations after a reasonable period for public input.

These regulations were:
- First published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **October 1st and 8th, 1988**,
- Then in **Le Rimouski** on **February 7th and 14th, 1989**,
- And in **Progrès-Echo** on **February 8th and 15th, 1989**.

This public notice period allowed interested parties (e.g., landowners, environmental groups, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport. After considering such feedback, the regulations were formally adopted.

### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Rimouski Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S. 1985, c. 33 (1st Supp.)  
- These regulations are binding on all landowners and developers within the designated area.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the **Rimouski Airport** located in the **Village of Rimouski-Est, Quebec**. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point at the center of runway 07–25, with coordinates: <br> **Northing (N): 5,371,265.968 m**<br> **Easting (E): 231,094.041 m**<br> Using the **S.CO.P.Q. system (Quebec State Coordinate System), Zone 6, Central Meridian 67°30′**. <br> **Elevation**: 22.2 meters above sea level. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 07–25), designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches. It rises at a **1:40 slope** (1 meter vertically for every 40 meters horizontally). <br> - For **runway 07 approach**: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Rises to a horizontal line 1,778.4 m from the end, 341.76 m from the centerline; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• This line is 44.46 m above the elevation at the end of the strip. <br> - For **runway 25 approach**: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Rises to a horizontal line 1,822 m from the end, 348.3 m from the centerline; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• This line is 45.55 m above the elevation at the end of the strip. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) that extends from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces** up to where they intersect with the **outer surface**. Ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer boundary zone. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface located at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the airport reference point (22.2 m)**, i.e., **67.2 meters above sea level**. <br> However, **if the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level**, the outer surface is instead defined as **9 meters above ground level**. This ensures safety even in low-lying areas. |

### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands within the boundary limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

This boundary is defined by a precise geometric description based on the **Rimouski Airport Zoning Plan No. MM-87-6620**, dated **February 2, 1987**.

#### **Boundary Description (in S.CO.P.Q. system, Zone 6)**:
1. **Starting Point**:  
   - Coordinates: **N 5,367,380.712 m**, **E 230,142.835 m**  
   - Located at the intersection of:
     - A line **2,300 meters parallel to the centerline of runway 07–25**;
     - A circle of **4,000 meters radius**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

2. **Arc Segment**:  
   - Follow a circular arc of **4,000 meters radius**, centered at the ARP, for a distance of **17,467.20 meters**.  
   - Ends at point: **N 5,371,687.131 m**, **E 235,071.806 m**.

3. **Final Leg**:  
   - Proceed in a straight line with an **azimuth of 228°51′23″** for **6,545.23 meters** back to the starting point.

> All measurements and coordinates are in the **International System of Units (SI)** and referenced to the **S.CO.P.Q. system**.

#### **Jurisdictional Coverage**:
The regulated lands fall within the **Cadastre (land registry)** of:
- The **Parish of Saint-Germain-de-Rimouski**  
- The **Town of Saint-Germain-de-Rimouski**  
- The **Parish of Saint-Anaclet**  
- All within the **Registry Division of Rimouski, Quebec**

### **5. Prohibited Activities (Building and Development Restrictions)**

No person may:
- **Erect, construct, or expand** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures)  
- **Where the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no structure or object (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) interferes with aircraft approach and landing operations by creating visual obstructions or turbulence hazards.

---

### **6. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land **exceeds** the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the **owner or occupier** to:
  - Remove or trim the excessive growth to bring it within acceptable limits.

> This provision helps prevent uncontrolled vegetation from becoming a hazard during flight operations.

---

### **7. Waste Disposal Restrictions**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - **Dispose of waste** on any regulated land that is:
    - **Edible** by birds, or
    - **Attractive to birds**

> This rule is critical for **bird hazard mitigation**, as bird strikes pose a serious risk to aircraft safety.

---

### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these zoning regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by minimizing visual and physical obstructions near the airport.
- To **protect aircraft during takeoff and landing**, particularly during approach phases, by defining clear elevation limits.
- To **prevent environmental hazards**, such as bird attractants, which could lead to dangerous bird strikes.
- To provide **clear, measurable, and enforceable boundaries** for land use near the airport through precise geographic coordinates and defined surfaces.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** retains authority to:
  - Issue directives requiring removal of overgrown vegetation.
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste disposal rules.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative and legal mechanisms under the Aeronautics Act.
