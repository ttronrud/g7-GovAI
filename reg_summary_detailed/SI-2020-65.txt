**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat**

**Legal Basis and Authority:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), specifically pursuant to **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of certain portions of the federal public administration from one ministerial office to another.

**Subject of the Transfer:**

The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of a specific component of the federal public administration known as the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)**.

**From:**  
The **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs**.

**To:**  
The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.

**Key Details of the Transfer:**

- The transfer is not a reorganization of personnel or a change in staffing, but a **change in administrative oversight and responsibility**.
- The **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat** is a dedicated office responsible for supporting and managing the operations of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference (CIC), which is the formal mechanism through which federal, provincial, and territorial governments coordinate on policy, legislation, and joint initiatives.
- The Secretariat provides strategic, administrative, and operational support to the federal government in its intergovernmental relations, including facilitating dialogue, managing agendas, preparing reports, and coordinating intergovernmental agreements.
- By transferring control to the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, the office of the President gains formal responsibility for the Secretariat’s management and oversight.

**Rationale and Implications:**

- The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** is a senior, non-partisan figure in the Canadian government, traditionally serving as a key coordinator of intergovernmental and policy-level affairs.
- This transfer reflects a strategic shift to **centralize and formalize the oversight of intergovernmental coordination** under a neutral, high-level office, enhancing the legitimacy and continuity of intergovernmental relations.
- It strengthens the role of the President of the Privy Council as a central figure in Canada’s constitutional and administrative framework, particularly in matters involving federal-provincial-territorial cooperation.
- The transfer does not alter the Secretariat’s mandate or functions; rather, it changes the **chain of accountability and supervisory authority**.

**Legal Citation:**

- Primary source: *Statutes of Canada, 2003, c. 22, section 207*  
- Reference to the relevant statutory framework: *Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter P-34* (Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)

**Effective Date and Implementation:**

While not explicitly stated in the excerpt, such transfers typically take effect immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* or upon formal notification in the official government record. The regulation is effective as of the date of publication and comes into force upon the Governor General’s formal issuance.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reconfiguration aimed at improving the structure and governance of intergovernmental affairs in Canada. By transferring the control of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, the government ensures that intergovernmental coordination is managed under a more neutral, constitutional, and stable framework—enhancing the integrity and effectiveness of federal-provincial-territorial relations.
