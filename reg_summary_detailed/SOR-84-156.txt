**Detailed Summary of the Contractor and Homeowner Course Registration Fees Order (SI/84-35, 1984)**

---

### **Regulatory Background**

This regulation, officially titled the *Contractor and Homeowner Course Registration Fees Order*, was issued on **February 6, 1984**, by the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** of Canada. It is grounded in two key legal authorities:

1. **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act** – This grants the Minister the authority to make orders setting fees for administrative or regulatory programs.
2. **Order in Council P.C. 1984-324**, dated February 2, 1984 – This provides the enabling framework under which the Minister can establish fee structures for programs established under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*.

The Order is part of a broader regulatory framework aimed at ensuring safety and consumer protection by managing the use of urea-formaldehyde insulation (UFI), a material known to emit formaldehyde, a potentially harmful chemical.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish specific fees** for participation in a **Contractor and Homeowner Course** that is offered as part of a government-led program under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. The course is designed to:

- Educate **contractors** and **homeowners** about the risks associated with urea-formaldehyde insulation.
- Provide guidance on safe handling, installation, and removal of UFI materials.
- Promote informed decision-making and safer practices in the construction and renovation industry.

By setting clear and transparent fees, the Order ensures financial accountability and supports the program’s sustainability.

### **Fees Prescribed Under the Order**

The Order specifies the following fees that must be paid by individuals applying for registration in the course:

| Fee Type | Amount | Recipient/Group | Notes |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Contractor’s Enrolment Fee** | $20.00 | Contractors | A one-time fee to register for the course. Covers administrative processing of the application. |
| **Training Package (Homeowners and Contractors)** | $25.00 | Both Homeowners and Contractors | A shared resource package that includes educational materials, safety guidelines, and information on UFI risks. |
| **Course Fee (Contractors Only)** | $100.00 | Contractors | Covers the cost of instruction, training sessions, and course delivery specifically for contractors. Homeowners are not charged this fee. |
| **Re-examination Fee (Contractors Only)** | $15.00 | Contractors | Charged if a contractor needs to retake a portion of the course or exam after an initial failure. |
| **Contractor’s Registration Fee** | $195.00 | Contractors | The total fee for full participation in the course. This is the sum of all the above fees: <br> $20 (Enrolment) + $25 (Training Package) + $100 (Course) + $15 (Re-examination) = **$160** — *Note: There appears to be a discrepancy here.* |

> ⚠️ **Important Note on Discrepancy**:  
> The total of the individual fees listed (excluding the final "Contractor’s registration fee") amounts to **$160**. However, the final fee listed is **$195.00**, which exceeds the sum of the component fees. This suggests either:
> - A typographical or administrative error in the original Order,
> - An additional administrative or processing charge not explicitly listed,
> - Or the "Contractor’s registration fee" includes non-transparent or non-itemized costs (e.g., administrative, licensing, or program maintenance fees).

**Conclusion**: The $195.00 "Contractor’s registration fee" likely represents a **total package fee**, possibly including all components and a margin for administrative costs. However, the breakdown does not fully add up, raising a potential inconsistency that should be clarified in official records or subsequent amendments.

### **Significance and Impact**

This Order plays a critical role in:
- Ensuring that only trained and informed professionals (especially contractors) are involved in handling urea-formaldehyde insulation.

### **Potential Areas for Review or Clarification**

1. **Fee Inconsistency**: The discrepancy between the sum of individual fees ($160) and the total registration fee ($195) should be addressed. This could be due to an error or the inclusion of additional costs (e.g., administrative, printing, or compliance).
2. **Homeowner Coverage**: While homeowners are charged only for enrolment and training package, it is unclear whether they receive equivalent access to certification or documentation.
3. **Re-examination Policy**: The re-examination fee applies only to contractors and may need to be reviewed for fairness or accessibility.

### **Conclusion**

The *Contractor and Homeowner Course Registration Fees Order* establishes a clear, itemized fee structure for participants in a government-mandated safety training program under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. It ensures that contractors and homeowners receive appropriate education on the risks of urea-formaldehyde insulation. While the fee structure is generally transparent and well-organized, the **discrepancy in the total contractor registration fee** requires further clarification or amendment to ensure accuracy and public trust.

This Order remains a foundational regulatory tool in Canada’s efforts to balance industry needs with public health and environmental protection.
