This regulation is issued under **subsection 83.05(1)d** and **subsection 83.05(8.1)a** of **Section 83.05 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., c. C-46)**, as amended by **S.C. 2019, c. 13, s. 141** and referenced in **SOR/2002-284**.

- **Purpose**: The regulation serves to **maintain and confirm the status of certain foreign and domestic entities as "listed entities"** under Canadian law.
- **Legal Authority**: The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness has the authority to review and determine whether there are **reasonable grounds** to believe that a particular entity has:
  - Known participation in, facilitation of, or attempted involvement in **terrorist activities**;
  - Acted **on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** such activities.

The **Administrator in Council** (representing the Government of Canada) accepts the Minister’s recommendation to **continue listing** these entities, based on the findings that there remain **reasonable grounds** for their inclusion on the list.

#### **Key Legal Principles Underlying the Decision**

1. **Definition of a "Listed Entity"**:
   - An entity is listed if there are **reasonable grounds** to believe it:
     - Has **knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated** a terrorist activity;
     - Or has **knowingly acted on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** such an entity.
   - This standard is **not based on conclusive proof**, but on **reasonable belief** supported by evidence.

2. **Review Process**:
   - The Minister conducts a **comprehensive review** of each entity listed in the annexed schedule.
   - The review is required under **subsection 83.05(8.1)a**, which mandates periodic reassessment of listed entities to ensure continued relevance and legal justification for their listing.

3. **Continuation of Listing**:
   - The decision to **retain** an entity on the list is not automatic.
   - It requires **substantive justification**, including credible intelligence, documented actions, or patterns of behavior consistent with terrorism.
   - The fact that the Minister has concluded that **reasonable grounds still exist** means that the entity remains under Canadian counter-terrorism surveillance and restrictions.
