**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Purpose of the Designation:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** as the designated authority responsible for the purposes set out in **Section 110** of the *Public Service Employment Act*.  

   Section 110 of the PSEA typically provides for the appointment of a Minister or a designated official to oversee or manage certain aspects of public service employment, such as the implementation of employment policies, the administration of employment standards, or the handling of public service personnel matters. This designation ensures that a specific minister has the legal authority to act in accordance with the provisions of that section.

2. **Effective Date:**  
   The designation becomes effective as of **December 31, 2005**. This means that from that date onward, the Minister of Canadian Heritage assumes the responsibilities and powers assigned under Section 110 of the Act.

3. **Legal Basis and Procedural Framework:**  
   - The Governor General in Council (the formal head of the Canadian government) acts on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which reflects the standard parliamentary process for such administrative appointments.  
   - The regulation is drawn from **S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13**, which are provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* that authorize such designations. These sections likely establish the framework for appointing a minister to carry out specific functions under the Act, including the authority to issue directions, make decisions, or manage employment-related processes in the public service.

4. **Scope and Implications:**  
   - The designation grants the Minister of Canadian Heritage specific powers and responsibilities related to public service employment as defined in Section 110.  
   - This may include, for example, the authority to:
     - Approve or implement employment policies;
     - Resolve disputes involving public service personnel;
     - Ensure compliance with employment standards;
     - Oversee or intervene in matters of public service management or personnel decisions.  
   - The designation ensures continuity and accountability in the administration of public service employment matters, particularly in areas under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Canadian Heritage (such as cultural institutions, federal programs, and public broadcasting).

5. **Administrative Significance:**  
   This type of designation is a common mechanism in Canadian public administration to assign responsibility for specific functions to a minister, particularly when those functions are not directly within the minister’s core portfolio but require formal authority under statute. It allows for more efficient and structured governance of public service employment issues.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally appoints the Minister of Canadian Heritage as the designated authority under Section 110 of the *Public Service Employment Act*, effective December 31, 2005. It operates under the legal framework established in S.C. 2003, c. 22, and serves to ensure that employment-related responsibilities within the public service are properly managed and overseen by a designated minister. The designation enhances administrative clarity, accountability, and compliance with employment standards within the federal public service.

**Note:**  
This regulation is a non-substantive administrative instrument and does not create new rights or obligations for employees. It primarily serves a procedural and structural function in the governance of public service employment. The actual implementation of Section 110 would depend on the specific provisions of the Act and the context in which the Minister is acting.
