## 🚨 Exception: Late Election Due to Misinformation

**Even after the one-year deadline, a former MP may still make an election if they can prove they received:**

- **Erroneous or misleading information** from a person employed in the Public Service (as defined in subsection 3(1) of the *Public Service Superannuation Act*), whose duties included advising on elections, **regarding:**
  - The **time period** during which they could make an election (paragraph 1(a))
  - The **amount** of their joint and survivor benefit or the amount the spouse would receive (paragraph 1(b))

### ✅ What Happens After Proof of Misinformation?
- The Minister must send the former MP a **written notice** containing the **correct information**.
- The former MP may then make the election **not later than three months after receipt of this notice**.

> This provision protects former MPs from being unfairly denied benefits due to errors in public service guidance.

## 📄 Required Documentation for Election

Within **one year** of making the election, the former MP (or their representative) must submit to the Minister:

1. **Evidence of the spouse’s date of birth**  
   → E.g., a birth certificate issued by a civil authority

2. **Evidence of the marriage**  
   → E.g., a marriage certificate issued by a civil authority

3. **If names differ** between documents (birth cert vs. marriage cert), provide:
   - Additional documentation confirming the spouse identity, OR
   - A **statutory declaration** from the spouse stating the documents refer to them

> ❗ Failure to submit any required document within one year results in the **election being considered not made**.

---

## 📚 Proof of Spouse’s Age

If a birth certificate cannot be obtained:

- A **statutory declaration** by the spouse stating:
  - Their date of birth
  - Reasons why the certificate is unavailable
- **Plus one of the following:**
  - A document created **within 5 years of the spouse’s birth** stating name and date of birth/age
  - A document created **at least 20 years before the election date** stating date of birth, accompanied by a statutory declaration from a third party (not the former MP or spouse) confirming the date is correct

> If the document cannot be obtained, the statutory declaration must explain why.

---

## 📚 Proof of Marriage

If a marriage certificate cannot be obtained:

- A **statutory declaration** by the former MP or spouse stating:
  - Date of marriage
  - Reasons why the certificate is missing
- **Plus one of the following:**
  - A document similar to a marriage certificate issued at the ceremony
  - A statutory declaration by a third party (not the former MP or spouse) who attended the ceremony, attesting to their knowledge of the marriage

> This ensures legitimacy of the marital relationship even without official records.

---

## 🚫 Consequences of Missing Documentation

- If any required document (birth, marriage, or identity confirmation) is **not submitted within one year** of the election, the election is **deemed not made** and the benefit is not activated.

## 💰 Calculation of the Joint and Survivor Benefit

The monthly payment of the joint and survivor benefit is calculated using a precise actuarial formula.

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Actuarial Present Value (APV)
- Determine the APV of:
  - The former MP’s **monthly allowances under Parts I and II** of the Act **immediately before the election**
  - Any **supplementary benefits under Part IV** of the Act
- **Exclude** the death benefit **if** the MP would have received it had they died on the election date (this is a key exception)

#### Step 2: Convert the APV into Two Components

The total APV is converted into two components with **equal actuarial present value**:

1. **Immediate Single Life Annuity (for the former MP)**  
   - Paid monthly starting on the **first day of the month after the election month**
   - Based on the same assumptions as the original allowances
   - Includes supplementary benefits under Part IV

2. **Joint and Survivor Benefit Package (for MP and spouse)**  
   Composed of:
   - **Immediate annuity for the former MP** (during their lifetime), where a **percentage (40%, 50%, or 60%)** of the total benefit is allocated to the spouse
   - **Surviving spouse’s annuity**:
     - Begins on the **day after the former MP dies**
     - Equal to the **same percentage (40%, 50%, or 60%)** of the MP’s annuity
     - Also includes supplementary benefits under Part IV

> The percentage (40%, 50%, or 60%) is chosen by the former MP at election time.

#### Step 3: Adjust the First Payment

- Subtract the **first monthly installment** of the spouse’s annuity (from component 2)
- From the first monthly installment of the MP’s annuity (component 1)
- This adjustment accounts for:
  - The **shortest of three periods**:
    - Duration of the MP’s life
    - Duration of the spouse’s life
    - Duration of the marriage
  - The benefit begins on the **month specified in Section 15** of the Act (typically the second month after election)

> This ensures the benefit is not overpaid and is aligned with the expected lifespan of both parties.

## 🔁 Adjustments When Disability or Benefit Changes Occur

### Case 1: MP Becomes Disabled and Receives Retiring/Compensation Allowances
- The joint and survivor benefit amount is **adjusted** to reflect the **new period** during which the benefit will be paid (e.g., during the MP’s lifetime or until death)
- Adjustment takes effect on the **first day of the month after the new allowance becomes payable**

### Case 2: MP Ceases to Receive Disability Allowances
- The benefit amount is **adjusted** to reflect the **new payment period**
- Adjustment takes effect on the **first day of the month after the cessation** of the allowance

> These adjustments ensure the benefit remains fair and accurate in light of changing financial circumstances.

## 📊 Actuarial Assumptions

The calculations are based on **specific demographic and financial assumptions**:

| Assumption | Source |
|----------|--------|
| **Mortality rates** | From the most recent valuation report laid before Parliament under Sections 65 and 66 of the MPRA, including mortality projection factors |
| **Divorce rates** | Based on official statistics from Statistics Canada, as established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions |

> These are **fixed assumptions** and not subject to change unless a new valuation report is introduced.

---

## 📅 Interest Rates for Valuation

The interest rates used in actuarial calculations are based on:

- **Canadian Institute of Actuaries' Recommendations for the Computation of Transfer Values from Registered Pension Plans**, effective September 1, 1993

Applied to:
- **Fully indexed pensions** (subject to the above recommendation)
- **Unindexed pensions** (for periods where no Part IV supplementary benefits apply), **only if the MP has not yet reached age 60**

> This ensures consistency with pension transfer valuations.

## 🔁 Revocation of an Election

An election may be **revoked** under the following conditions:
