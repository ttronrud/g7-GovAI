**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulation Title and Background**

This regulation, officially titled **"The Export and Import Permits and Certificates Fees Order, 1995"** (SOR/95-66), was issued on **May 19, 1995**, by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** under **Order in Council P.C. 1995-783**, dated May 16, 1995.

It **repeals** the previous **Export and Import Permits and Certificates Fees Order, 1994** (SOR/94-321), which had established fees for import and export permits and certificates under the *Export and Import Permits Act* (Act). The 1995 Order replaces it with a new, updated fee structure that reflects changes in administrative procedures, cost considerations, and policy priorities.

This regulation remains in force until it is further amended or repealed — it was **repealed in full by SOR/96-316, section 2**, on June 25, 1996. Therefore, it is **no longer currently active** in Canadian law.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

- **Department**: The *Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade* (now known as Global Affairs Canada).

   The fees do **not apply** to export permits issued under subsection 7(1) of the Act for softwood lumber products listed in **item 5104 of Group 5** of the *Export Control List*. This exclusion recognizes special treatment for a major Canadian export commodity.

2. **Certain Goods Exempt from Fees**:

### **Fee Structure**

#### **1. Import Permits**

The fee depends on **who delivers the permit** and the **total value of the goods**.

| Delivery Method | Fee Determination |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Delivered by a private individual or entity (not in public service)** and authorized by the Minister | Fee is set in **Column II** of the schedule, based on the total value of the goods (as per Column I). |
| **Delivered by the Export and Import Controls Bureau (EICB) of the Department** | Fee is set in **Column III** of the schedule, based on the total value of the goods. |

> The schedule (not included here) contains a table of value brackets and corresponding fees. For example:
> - If goods are valued at $10,000, the fee might be $50 (Column II) or $75 (Column III), depending on the delivery method.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The fee in Column II does **not include** incidental services (e.g., courier, documentation, or processing) provided by the authorized person.

#### **2. Export Permits and Certificates**

| Delivery Method | Fee |
|----------------|-----|
| **Delivered by a private individual or entity (not in public service)** | **$9** |
| **Delivered by the Export and Import Controls Bureau (EICB)** | **$14** |

> These fixed fees apply regardless of the value of the goods, as long as the goods fall under sections 7, 8.1, or 8.2 (for permits) or 9.01 or 9.2 (for certificates).

> ⚠️ The $9 and $14 fees **do not include** any additional charges for services provided during delivery.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

- **Fee-Based Structure**:  
  The import permit fees are **value-dependent**, meaning higher-value shipments incur higher fees. This aligns with the principle of cost recovery based on transaction size. In contrast, export permit fees are **flat**, simplifying administrative burden for small and medium-sized businesses.

- **Public Service Exception**:  
  The exemption for public servants ensures that government employees are not charged fees when acting in their official capacity — a common administrative practice.

- **Incidental Services Not Included**:  
  Fees are strictly for the permit/certificate itself. Any additional services (e.g., processing, shipping, consultation) are **not covered** and must be paid separately if required.

- **Exemptions Reflect Strategic Priorities**:  
  The exemptions for certain goods (e.g., softwood lumber, specific technology groups) demonstrate that the government prioritizes key economic sectors and national security interests over general fee collection.

---

### **Policy Implications**

- **Administrative Efficiency**:  
  The flat export fee simplifies compliance for exporters, especially small businesses, while the value-based import fee ensures that larger imports contribute proportionally more to administrative costs.

- **Economic Considerations**:  
  The structure supports both fairness and cost recovery, ensuring the Department can maintain operational capacity without overburdening small exporters.

- **National Security & Trade Policy**:  
  Exemptions for specific goods (e.g., softwood lumber, certain technologies) reflect Canada’s strategic trade policies and the need to protect vital industries or sensitive technologies.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation established a modernized, transparent, and tiered fee system for import and export permits and certificates under the *Export and Import Permits Act*. It replaced an older fee structure with clearer rules, exemptions for key goods, and a distinction between private and government delivery methods.

However, **this regulation is no longer in force**, having been **repealed by SOR/96-316, section 2**, on June 25, 1996. As such, it is **historical** in nature and **not applicable today**. Current fees are governed by more recent Orders in Council, which may reflect updated economic, security, or administrative priorities.
