### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **Regulatory Instrument:**
**Order of the Governor in Council (SOR/2002-284)**  
**Statutory Basis:**

- *S.C. 2005, c. 10, subpar. 34(1)(f)(iii)* and *s. 18(3)*

This regulation is an **order under the authority of the Criminal Code of Canada** that **reaffirms and extends the listing of terrorist entities** previously established in 2002.

### **Background and Purpose**

1. **Establishment of the List (Original Date):**  
   - The list of designated terrorist entities was first established on **July 23, 2002**, under the *Regulations Establishing a List of Entities* (SOR/2002-284).  
   - This initial list was created pursuant to **subsection 83.05(1)b** of the *Criminal Code*, which empowers the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to designate entities that are known or believed to be involved in terrorist activities.

2. **Review and Renewal Requirement:**  
   - Under **subsection 83.05(9)d**, the Minister is required to **review the list periodically** to determine whether there are still **reasonable grounds to believe** that each listed entity:
     - Has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated a terrorist activity, or  
     - Is knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with such an entity.

3. **Timing of This Regulation:**  
   - This particular order was issued **eight years after the original listing**, on **July 23, 2010** (i.e., 2010 – 2002 = 8 years).  
   - The review confirms that **all entities on the list remain subject to designation** due to ongoing or persistent terrorist links.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   - The Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government acting on the advice of the Minister) **accepts the Minister’s recommendation** under section 83.05(9)d.  
   - This reaffirms the legal status of the listed entities as **designated terrorist organizations** under Canadian law.

  The designation of each entity is **not time-limited** and remains in force unless formally revoked or updated by a future review.

  Each entity listed remains a **"listed entity"** under the *Criminal Code*, meaning:
  - Any person who supports, funds, trains, or provides material assistance to such an entity may be subject to criminal penalties.
  - The designation supports enforcement actions, including asset freezes, travel restrictions, and prohibitions on financial transactions.

- **Scope of Application:**  
  The regulation applies to **all activities** that may be linked to terrorism, including:
