**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Designation of the Minister of Supply and Services as the Appropriate Minister under the Financial Administration Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The designation is made pursuant to two specific provisions of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA):

1. **Paragraph (d) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision authorizes the Governor General in Council to designate a Minister as the "appropriate Minister" for a specific entity or purpose, where that Minister is responsible for the financial administration or oversight of the entity in question.

2. **Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in subsection 83(1) of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision further specifies that an appropriate Minister may be designated for the purpose of managing or overseeing financial matters related to a corporation or entity that is engaged in activities connected to national defense or government infrastructure, particularly when the Minister has relevant jurisdiction or responsibility.

**Subject of Designation:**  
The entity in question is **Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.** (commonly referred to as "Defence Construction Ltd."), a Canadian corporation established in 1951 with a historical role in providing construction services to the Canadian Armed Forces and defense-related projects.

**Designated Minister:**  
The **Minister of Supply and Services** is officially designated as the "appropriate Minister" with respect to Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.

**Purpose of the Designation:**  
This designation enables the Minister of Supply and Services—through the authority granted under the Financial Administration Act—to:

- Exercise oversight and authority over the financial administration of Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.;
- Ensure compliance with financial management standards and accountability requirements set out in the Act;
- Approve financial transactions, budgets, and expenditures related to the company;
- Serve as the designated point of contact for financial reporting and governance matters involving the corporation.

**Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
- The designation establishes a formal link between the federal government and the corporation, ensuring that financial governance is aligned with public accountability principles.
- It reflects the Minister’s role in managing government supply and services, including infrastructure and construction projects involving defense-related activities.
- The designation is not a grant of operational control over the company, but rather a formal assignment of financial authority and oversight responsibilities under the Financial Administration Act.

**Context and Background:**  
Defence Construction (1951) Ltd. was established during a period of post-World War II military expansion and has historically provided construction, maintenance, and engineering services to the Canadian Department of National Defence. As such, its financial activities are subject to government oversight to ensure transparency, efficiency, and accountability.

This designation ensures that the Minister of Supply and Services, as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, has the statutory authority to act in financial matters involving the company under the Financial Administration Act.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulation is effective upon issuance and takes immediate effect, as such designations are typically effective upon formal publication in the Canada Gazette or through official government notification.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally assigns the Minister of Supply and Services as the appropriate Minister for financial oversight of Defence Construction (1951) Ltd. under the Financial Administration Act. It ensures that the corporation’s financial operations are subject to proper government scrutiny and accountability, consistent with public sector financial governance standards. The designation is grounded in statutory authority and reflects the Minister’s established role in managing government supply and infrastructure services, particularly those with defense-related components.
