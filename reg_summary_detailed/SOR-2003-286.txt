## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Department of Health Divestiture Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Purpose**
These regulations were issued by the **Treasury Board**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, pursuant to:
- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a** and **subsection 42.1(2)a** of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA)
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA)

**Purpose**:  
To govern the treatment of public servants who transition from employment within the **Department of Health** to a **new employer** (i.e., a private or public entity) as a result of a government agreement to divest certain functions or operations of the Department of Health.

This regulation ensures that the **superannuation rights, benefits, and service periods** of such public servants are properly recognized and protected during and after the transition, while maintaining consistency with federal public service pension legislation.

### 📚 **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), the primary legislation governing public service pension rights.
- **New Employer**: A person or organization that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, takes over the functions previously carried out by a portion of the Department of Health. This includes entities such as private companies, provincial governments, or other federal departments.

### 🚧 **Scope and Application**

#### ✅ Applies to:
- A person who:
  - Ceases to be employed in the public service due to a transfer or divestiture agreement with a **new employer**.
  - Becomes employed by that **new employer** as a result of the agreement.

> **Note**: The regulations **do not apply** if the individual later becomes re-employed by the same new employer.

#### ❌ Does Not Apply To:
- Individuals who **subsequently re-employ** with the new employer.
- Individuals who have already **received a return of contributions** under subsection 3(3) of the PSSA, or who have **exercised an option** under subsection 3(4) (related to transfer value).

---

### 📖 **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### 1. **Sections 4 to 9 – Exclusion for Return of Contributions or Transfer Option**
- These sections (which typically deal with pension rights and service credit) **do not apply** to individuals who:
  - Have received a **return of contributions** (i.e., a refund of pension fund contributions), or
  - Have exercised an option for a **transfer value** (i.e., a payment in lieu of pension rights).

> This means that if a public servant chooses to take a refund of their pension contributions or opts for a lump-sum transfer value, they are **exempt** from the standard pension entitlements under these sections.

#### 2. **Sections 12 to 13.01 – Application Date**
- These sections (covering death benefits, survivor benefits, and pension entitlements) **only apply** to individuals on and **after the date they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This ensures that pension rights are only triggered *after* the transition to the new employer, not retroactively.

#### 3. **Deemed Employment by a New Employer**
- A person who **does not exercise** the option for transfer value under section 13.01 of the PSSA is **deemed to be employed by a new employer** for the purposes of **subsection 83(1)** of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations*.

> This is critical because it allows the new employer to be treated as a "public service employer" for superannuation purposes, even if the individual is not formally classified as a public servant.

#### 4. **Right to Request Return of Contributions (Post-September 1, 2002)**
- If, **on or after September 1, 2002**, the individual would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
  - Subsection 12(3) of the PSSA (for certain qualifying circumstances), or
  - Subsection 12.1(4) (for specific service conditions),  
  then they may:
  - **Request a return of contributions** in writing **within one year** of ceasing public service and becoming employed by the new employer.

- Similarly, if they would have been entitled to **exercise an option for transfer value** under section 13.01, they may do so **within the same one-year period**.

> This provision gives individuals a clear and timely window to choose between a refund of contributions or a transfer of pension value.

> ⚠️ *Note: This provision has been repealed by SOR/2016-203, section 79.*

#### 5. **Survivor and Children Benefits (Repealed)**
- The regulation previously provided that:
  - Survivors and children of a person who dies while employed by the new employer are entitled to:
    - The **death benefit** under subsections 12(8) or 12.1(8) of the PSSA, **or**
    - The **allowances** under subsections 13(3) or 13.001(3) of the PSSA.

> ⚠️ This provision has also been **repealed** by SOR/2016-203, section 80.

> **Implication**: As of the repeal, **survivor benefits are no longer automatically extended** to dependents of individuals who die while employed by a new employer under this framework.

#### 6. **Child Allowance Entitlement (Under Subsection 26(2))**
- A child born to, adopted by, or who becomes a stepchild of the individual **during the period** between:
  - The date the person ceases public service
  - The date they cease employment with the new employer  
  is entitled to an allowance under **Part I** of the PSSA.

> This ensures that children born during the transition period are not excluded from pension-related allowances.

#### 7. **One-Year Period for Section 10(5) (Repealed)**
- The one-year period referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the PSSA (which typically relates to claims for benefits or refunds) begins on the **date the person ceases employment with the new employer**.

> This sets a clear deadline for benefit claims or actions related to employment termination.

#### 8. **Pensionable Service and Age Determination**
- For the purposes of sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA:
  - **Pensionable service** includes the period of employment with the new employer that:
    - Begins on the date the person ceases public service
    - Ends on the date they cease employment with the new employer
  - The **age of the person** for pension purposes is their age on the **day they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This ensures that service time with the new employer is counted toward pension eligibility and that the individual’s age at transition is used for pension calculations.

---

### 📅 **Effective Date**
- These regulations are **deemed to have come into force on September 1, 2002**.

> This date marks the start of the transitional framework for public servants moving from the Department of Health to new employers.

---

### 🔁 **Important Notes on Repeals**
- The following provisions have been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-203, section 79**:
  - The right to request a return of contributions (Section 4–5)
  - The entitlement of survivors and children to death benefits or allowances (Section 6)
- These repeals indicate that the **current framework for pension rights in divestiture scenarios has been updated or replaced** by newer legislation or policy.

> Therefore, **this regulation is now largely historical** and may not be actively applied in current practice. Its provisions are likely superseded by more recent rules or reforms.
