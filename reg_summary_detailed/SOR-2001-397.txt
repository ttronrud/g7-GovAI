### **Detailed Summary of the Investment Limits (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), are designed to establish **investment limits and valuation rules for interests of insurance holding companies in real property**, ensuring financial stability, risk containment, and regulatory oversight. They apply specifically to **insurance holding companies** and govern how such entities can invest in, or hold interests in, real estate and related financial instruments — particularly those involving debt, equity, or guarantees tied to real property.

The regulations were enacted on **October 24, 2001**, and came into force upon the enactment of **section 465 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act, S.C. 2001, c. 9**, which activated sections 970 and 984 of the *Insurance Companies Act*.

## **3. Valuation of Interests in Real Property**

The regulations define and value various types of interests that an insurance holding company may have in real property, both directly and indirectly.

### **A. Direct Ownership of Real Property**
- **Includes**: Real property beneficially owned by the insurance holding company or a designated entity under its control.
- **Value**: The **book value** of the real property (gross value minus accumulated depreciation).

### **B. Debt Obligations for Real Property Acquisition/Improvement**
- **Includes**: Debt issued to finance or improve real property.
- **Value**: The amount by which the **book value of the debt exceeds** the book value of the real property.

### **C. Interests in Related Real Property Entities (Joint Ventures or Investments)**
- **Includes**:
  - Real property beneficially owned by a **related real property entity** that is a **joint venture** or an entity where a designated entity has a substantial investment.
  - Shares/ownership interests in such entities (excluding those in joint ventures).
- **Value**:
  - Real property: Book value.
  - Shares/interests: Book value of the shares or ownership interests.

### **D. Loans and Debt Obligations to Related Real Property Entities**
- **Includes**:
  - Loans made by the holding company or a designated entity to a related real property entity.
  - Loans to entities where a financial institution controlled by the holding company has a substantial investment.
  - Debt issued by such entities and beneficially owned by the holding company or a designated entity.
- **Value**:
  - Book value of the loan or debt obligation.

### **E. Guaranteed Debt Obligations**
- **Includes**:
  - A debt obligation issued by a related real property entity and **guaranteed** by the holding company or a designated entity.
  - A loan made to a related real property entity and **guaranteed** by the holding company or a designated entity.
- **Value**:
  - If the guaranteed entity owns real property that is an interest of the holding company:  
    → **Amount by which the face value of the guarantee exceeds** the value of the real property.
  - In all other cases: **Face value of the guarantee**.

### **F. Secured Loans or Debt Obligations**
When a loan or debt is secured by:
- **Real property owned by a third party** (in conjunction with the holding company, designated entity, or related real property entity), or
- **Shares/ownership interests** in a third-party entity that owns real property,

Then the loan or debt becomes an **interest in real property**.

#### **Value Calculation**:
- **For real property security**:
  - The **lesser of**:
    1. The **net realizable value** of the third party’s interest in the real property at the time of the security interest.
    2. A formula based on:
      - Book value of the loan or debt (if held by or made by the holding company or designated entity), or
      - Face value of the guarantee (if guaranteed by the holding company).
      - Minus the **total net realizable value of other security interests** given for the same loan/debt.

- **For equity-based security**:
  - The **lesser of**:
    1. Net realizable value of the third party’s interest in the shares/ownership.
    2. A formula involving:
      - Book value of the loan or debt.
      - Face value of the guarantee (if applicable).
      - Net realizable value of the entity’s interest in real property.
      - Value of the shares given as security.
      - Total outstanding shares/interests in the entity.

- **For related real property entity security**:
  - Same formula as above, with adjustments for the structure of the related entity.

> These valuation rules ensure that the **risk associated with real estate exposure is accurately reflected** in capital adequacy assessments.

### **G. Guarantees and Agreements to Support Real Property Development or Operations**
- **Guarantees**:
  - Given to complete development of real property owned by the holding company, a designated entity, or a related real property entity.
  - Value = **Estimated cost of completing development**.
- **Agreements to support operating or financing costs**:
  - Value = **Amount of funds advanced** under the agreement.

> These provisions recognize that even without direct ownership, financial commitments to real estate projects constitute significant exposures.

## **4. Capital Adequacy and Investment Limits**

### **Exemption from Sections 981–983**

  - An **eligible financial institution** (as defined in section 370 of the *Bank Act*), excluding foreign banks,
  - A **widely held foreign bank** (as defined in section 2 of the *Bank Act*).

> This creates a **threshold exemption** for large, well-capitalized, or systemically important holding companies.

- A **prescribed subsidiary** is a subsidiary of the insurance holding company **excluding**:
  - Insurance companies,
  - Securities dealers,
  - Subsidiaries of insurance companies or securities dealers.

---

### **Capital Amount Determination (Sections 981–983)**

#### **Section 981 & 982**:
The amount used to determine capital adequacy is **70% of** the following formula:

> **Amount = (Regulatory Capital of the Holding Company) +**
> - Sum of:
>   - Shareholders’ equity or subordinated debt of **controlled insurance companies or securities dealers** (or their controlled entities) included in the holding company’s regulatory capital.
>   - Minority interests in such companies or
