**Detailed Summary of the Baie Comeau Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled:  
**"Baie Comeau Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and apply to land and water areas surrounding Baie Comeau Airport in the Township of Manicouagan, County of Saguenay, Province of Quebec.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several technical terms critical to understanding the spatial constraints:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *Baie Comeau Airport*, located in the Township of Manicouagan, County of Saguenay, Quebec.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation and orientation.  
  - It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule**.  
  - For regulatory purposes, it is **deemed to be 67 feet above sea level**, regardless of its actual elevation.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the end of a runway strip, perpendicular to its centerline.  
  - Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.  
  - Designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by providing clear airspace above the runway end.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An imaginary surface extending above and around the airport, forming a buffer zone.  
  - Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.  
  - It is a **horizontal plane at 150 feet above the ARP elevation**.  
  - If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, a **30-foot ground-level surface** replaces it for safety and visibility reasons.

- **Strip**:  
  A rectangular area of the airport’s landing zone designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.  
  - For runways 10-28 and 16-34:  
    - **Width**: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline)  
    - **Length**: 8,400 feet  
  - The strips are aligned with runway designations (e.g., 10-28 and 16-34).

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surface, rising at a **1:7 vertical-to-horizontal ratio** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal).  
  - Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.  
  - Connects the strip’s lateral boundaries to the outer surface or to adjacent strips’ transitional surfaces.  
  - Ensures a smooth, gradual transition in airspace between runway zones and surrounding areas.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all land and underwater areas** adjacent to or near the airport.  
- Specifically includes:
  - Public road allowances
  - Adjacent private or public lands
- The **outer limits** of the regulated area are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are officially incorporated into the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, terminal zones) are not subject to these restrictions.

---

### **4. Core Prohibition**

No person may:
- Construct, erect, or modify any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures),  
- **On any land or underwater area covered by these regulations**,  
- Whose **highest point exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means all structures must remain **below or at the level** of these imaginary surfaces at every point on their highest point.

---

### **5. Reference Bearings and Orientation**

All directional references in the regulation are based on **astronomical bearings**, referenced to the **centerline of strip 10-28** at Baie Comeau Airport.  
- The primary reference direction is:  
  **North 79°48′20″ East (N. 79°48′20″ E)**

This orientation is used throughout the boundary descriptions to ensure precision in defining the regulated zones.

---

### **6. Description of Regulated Land Parcel (Boundary Details)**

The boundaries of the regulated area are described in a detailed, step-by-step geometric description starting from a defined point and following lines of specific bearings and distances. The parcel is composed of:

#### **Starting Point**:
- Intersection of:
  - The centerline of **strip 10-28**
  - The centerline of the **proposed strip 16-34**

#### **Path Description (Sequentially)**:
The boundary follows a series of lines with specific bearings and distances, forming a closed loop around the airport. Key segments include:

1. **From strip 10-28 centerline**:
   - North 79°48′20″ East for **281.1 feet**
   - Then a **right angle (perpendicular)** to travel **500 feet** to reach the **airport reference point (ARP)**

2. **From ARP to the southerly boundary of lot 51, Range IV**:
   - Following the southerly boundary of lot 51, Range IV, in an easterly direction to a line at **N. 50°02′09″ W**, which is a limit of the **approach surface** for strip 16-34.

3. **Continuing along lines**:
   - To a line at **10,000 feet** along the **northwesterly production** of strip 16-34’s centerline
   - To a line at **4,000 feet** along **S. 32°58′29″ E** (limit of approach surface)
   - To **S. 40°55′56″ E** (limit of transitional surface)
   - To the **waters’ edge of the Manicouagan River**

4. **Following river edges**:
   - To the **northwesterly corner of lot 16-1**, then to **range line between Ranges I and II**
   - To the **northwesterly corner of lot 10, Range I**

5. **Back to strip 10-28 boundaries**:
   - Follows lines defining approach and transitional surfaces for strip 10-28
   - Includes points at **10,000 feet** along the **northeasterly, southwesterly, and southeasterly productions** of the runway centerlines
   - Ends at a **4,000-foot extension** along S. 80°22′43″ W and S. 48°29′41″ W

6. **Final return to start**:
   - Returns via river edges and lot lines to the **starting point** at the intersection of lot lines between lots 11 and 12, Range IV.

> This boundary forms a **complex polygon** that wraps around the airport, encompassing both land and riverfront areas.

### **7. Land Designation and Cadastral Reference**

The regulated land is composed of a combination of:
- **Lots and blocks** in the Township of Manicouagan
- **Parts of lands without cadastral numbers**
- **Numerical designations** such as:
  - 1 to 6, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2A-1 to 2A-3, etc.
  - 51, 51-59 to 51-64
  - 24A-1 to 24A-10, 24A-13-1, etc.
  - 22A-1 to 22A-23, 23A-1 to 23A-16, etc.

These designations are used to identify and legally define the parcels within the zone.

---

### **8. Visual and Regulatory Reference**

All surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) are illustrated on:
- **Department of Transport Plan No. M-3908**, dated **March 15, 1973**

This plan is the **primary visual reference** for:
- The location of runways
- The exact shape and elevation of approach, transitional, and outer surfaces
- The boundaries of the regulated land parcels

---

### **9. Purpose and Function**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by establishing clear, legally enforceable limits on construction near runways and airport operations.
- Prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
- Maintain a **controlled, predictable airspace environment** around the airport.
- Protect **critical flight corridors** and **approach paths** by limiting vertical and horizontal encroachments.
