**Detailed Summary of the Associate Judges (Federal Court) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Associate Judges (Federal Court) Regulations are made under the authority of the *Federal Courts Act* (R.S., c. F-7), specifically subsections 12(2)a and 12(5)a. These provisions empower the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice) to establish rules governing the appointment, roles, and workloads of associate judges in the Federal Court of Canada. The regulations are formally published in the *Statutes of Canada, 2022, c. 10, subpara. 371(a)(ii)*, and are effective upon registration.

**Key Provisions of the Regulations**

1. **Maximum Number of Associate Judges**  
   - Under subsection 12(2) of the *Federal Courts Act*, the total number of associate judges that may be appointed is strictly limited to **nine**.  
   - This cap ensures that the Federal Court maintains a balanced and manageable structure, with a defined capacity for judicial appointments that supports judicial efficiency, workload distribution, and oversight.

2. **Workload Definition for Supernumerary Associate Judges**  
   - Subsection 12(5) of the *Federal Courts Act* introduces the concept of a "supernumerary associate judge," which refers to an associate judge who is appointed for a limited or temporary purpose, often to support judicial operations without being part of the core active bench.  
   - The regulations specify that the **workload of a supernumerary associate judge must be at least 50% of the workload of a standard associate judge**.  
   - This threshold ensures that supernumerary appointments are not merely nominal or symbolic. It establishes a minimum level of judicial engagement, preserving the integrity and accountability of the judicial function, even in temporary or supplemental roles.

3. **Purpose and Scope**  
   - These regulations clarify and operationalize the provisions of subsections 12(2) and 12(5) of the *Federal Courts Act*, providing concrete guidelines for the appointment and functioning of associate judges.  
   - The rules apply specifically to the **Federal Court of Canada**, which is one of Canada’s principal federal courts responsible for hearing civil and criminal cases involving federal laws, including matters related to taxation, immigration, and constitutional issues.

4. **Effective Date**  
   - The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
   - This ensures immediate applicability once formally published, allowing the Federal Court system to implement the new rules without delay.
