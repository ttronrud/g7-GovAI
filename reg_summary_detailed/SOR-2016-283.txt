### **Detailed Summary of Canadian Payments Association By-law No. 2 — Finance**  
*Approved by the Minister of Finance on October 25, 2016, and came into force on January 1, 2017*

---

## **Overview**

This by-law establishes the financial framework governing the **Canadian Payments Association (CPA)**, specifically how **common services dues**, **transaction fees**, and **service fees** are calculated, determined, and collected from members and participants. It operates under the authority of the *Canadian Payments Act* and is designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and operational sustainability in the association’s financial management.

The by-law applies to the CPA’s operations, including its systems such as the **Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS)** and **Lynx**, and governs the financial obligations of both members and participants in those systems.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Amalgamated Member** | A member formed by the merger or amalgamation of existing members or members and non-members. |
| **Common Services Costs** | Costs incurred by the Association to provide services beneficial to all members (e.g., HR, accounting, policy development, research). |
| **Common Services Dues** | Annual dues paid by members to cover common services costs, determined annually based on budget estimates. |
| **Direct Operating Costs** | Costs directly tied to operating a specific payment system (e.g., system maintenance, technology infrastructure). |
| **Participant** | Includes direct clearers, group clearers (as defined in By-law No. 3), or any party involved in a payment system. |
| **Service Fees** | Fees charged for specific services provided by the Association to members or participants (e.g., access to systems, reporting). |
| **System** | Refers to payment systems operated by the CPA, including ACSS, Lynx, or any other clearing/settlement system established by the Association. |
| **Transaction Fees** | Fees charged per transaction in a system, based on volume or value of transactions. |

> ⚠️ *Note: "Participant" definitions have been updated; Lynx and ACSS are now explicitly referenced. The older definition of "participant" was repealed in SOR/2021-182, s. 55.*

## **Core Financial Principles and Procedures**

### **1. Budget-Based Fee Determination**

- The **Board of Directors** must prepare an **annual operating budget** and **capital expenditures budget** under subsection 22(1) of the *Canadian Payments Act*.
- These budgets must:
  - Specify **common services costs** and **direct operating costs**.
  - Include provisions for **reserves** (e.g., for future needs or unexpected expenses).
- The **common services dues** and **transaction fees** for each fiscal year are calculated based on these budgets.

> 📌 *Purpose:* To ensure fees reflect actual and projected costs of providing services.

---

### **2. Adjustments to Fees**

#### **(a) Significant Budget Amendments**
- If the Board makes a **significant amendment** to the operating or capital budget for a fiscal year, it must:
  - Adjust the common services dues and transaction fees accordingly.
  - Provide **at least 60 days’ notice** to all members and participants before implementing the change.

#### **(b) New Members**
- A **new member** (not an amalgamated member or a "bridge institution" under the CDIC Act):
  - Must pay the **full amount** of common services dues for the fiscal year in which it joins.
- An **amalgamated member** formed during a fiscal year must pay:
  - The **sum of all unpaid common services dues, transaction fees, and service fees** of the members and non-members that were merged.

> ✅ *Clarification:* A member changing its name (without merging) is **not considered a new member**.

---

### **3. Common Services Dues Formula**

For each fiscal year, the common services dues are calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Common Services Dues} = \frac{\text{Estimated Common Services Costs}}{\text{Estimated Number of Members on First Day of Fiscal Year}}
\]

- **Estimated Common Services Costs**: Based on the Board’s previous fiscal year’s cost estimates.
- **Estimated Number of Members**: Determined by the Board at the start of the fiscal year.

#### **Timing of Determination**
- The Board must determine and **notify members no later than 8 months before the start of the fiscal year**.
- Notification must include:
  - The amount of dues.
  - The rationale for the calculation.

> 🔍 *Purpose:* Ensures members receive timely and transparent information about their financial obligations.

---

### **4. Surplus Allocation**

- If the total **common services dues collected** exceed the actual costs of providing services:
  - The **surplus** may be allocated to a **Research and Development (R&D) Reserve Fund**.
  - This fund supports innovation in payment systems.
  - The **maximum amount** for the fund is set annually by the Board.

> 💡 *Benefit:* Encourages investment in future technologies and system improvements.

---

### **5. Transaction Fees**

#### **(a) Basis for Determination**
- For each system, transaction fees are determined based on:
  - The **estimated operating costs** of the system.
  - One or both of:
    - The **estimated number of transactions** by all participants.
    - The **estimated value of those transactions**.
- The Board must consider:
  - Nature of the system.
  - Number of participants.
  - Transaction volume and value distribution across participants.

#### **(b) Cost Components Included**
The Board’s cost estimate must account for:
- Direct operating costs.
- A portion of common services costs not already covered by common dues or other fees.
- **Capital investment recovery** (e.g., costs of building or upgrading systems).
- A **fee-stabilizing charge** (a reserve to absorb minor variations between estimates and actuals).

> 📌 *Fee-stabilizing charge*: A buffer to protect against small discrepancies between projected and actual transaction volume/value.

#### **(c) Timing and Notification**
- The Board must determine and **notify participants no later than 8 months before the start of the fiscal year**.
- Notification must explain:
  - The amount of transaction fees.
  - The methodology used to calculate them.

#### **(d) Adjustments for Withdrawals**
- If a participant **withdraws from a system** during a fiscal year:
  - And the system’s reserves or surplus are **insufficient** to cover the resulting loss in transaction fees:
    - The **President** must adjust the transaction fees for that fiscal year.
- Such adjustments require **at least 15 days’ notice** to participants.

> ⚖️ *Purpose:* Maintains financial stability and ensures the system remains viable even when participant numbers fluctuate.

---

### **6. Fees for Services Provided**

- All fees (except transaction fees) for services provided by the Association to members or participants must be:
  - **Cost-based** — equal to the actual cost of providing the service.
- These fees are not subject to profit margins or arbitrary pricing.

---

### **7. Liability Upon Withdrawal or Cessation of Membership**

- A member or participant that:
  - Ceases to be a member, or
  - Withdraws from a system,
- Is **not entitled to a refund** of any previously paid common services dues, transaction fees, or service fees.
- Remains **liable for any unpaid amounts**.

> ❌ *No refunds or prorated charges* — all fees are final and non-refundable upon exit.

---

### **8. Payment Deadlines**

- **Common Services Dues**:
  - Due on or before the **first day of each fiscal year**.
  - Alternatively, the Board may set a different due date (under subsection 3).
- **Transaction Fees**:
  - Due within **15 days after an invoice is issued**.
  - Or, if a different date is set by the Board, by that date.

> ⚙️ *Operational Efficiency Note:* The Board may establish alternative due dates for administrative or operational reasons.

---

### **9. Interest on Late Payments**

- If a member, participant, or other person fails to pay dues, fees, or service fees by the due date:
  - Interest accrues at a rate of **not more than 0.125% per day**.
  - Interest is calculated using a method established by a Board resolution.
- The interest **accrues to the general revenue** of the Association.

> 💡 *Purpose:* Encourages timely payments and provides a financial incentive to comply with obligations.

---

### **10. Exemptions and Repeals**

- **Subsections 2(2), 5(2), and 6(6)** of the by-law **do not apply** to the fiscal year beginning **January 1, 2017**.
- This by-law was **repealed** in part (specifically, the earlier definitions of "participant" and "system") by **SOR/2021-182, s. 55**, which updated the definitions to reflect current systems (e.g., Lynx and ACSS).

> 📅 *Effective Date:* January 1, 2017 — the first fiscal year after the by-law came into force.
