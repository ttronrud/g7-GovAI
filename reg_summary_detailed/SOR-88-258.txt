**Detailed Summary of the Fish Toxicant Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Fish Toxicant Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada**, under **subsection 33(13) of the Fisheries Act**. These regulations establish the legal framework governing the **deposit of fish toxicants**—specifically, pest control products used to eliminate undesirable fish species—in certain waters across **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta**.

These regulations are designed to ensure that the use of fish toxicants is both **authorized and environmentally responsible**, balancing the need to manage pest fish populations with the protection of non-target fish species and aquatic ecosystems.

### **Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Fish Toxicant Regulations*  
- **Citation**: May be cited as the *Fish Toxicant Regulations*

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal basis for regulating the use of toxic substances in aquatic environments.

2. **"Fish toxicant"**  
   - Defined as a **pest control product** that:
     - Complies with the requirements of the *Pest Control Products Act* and the *Pest Control Products Regulations*; and  
     - Is used **specifically to destroy fish that are classified as pests** under **Section 2 of the Fisheries Act**.  
   - This definition ensures that only legally approved and regulated products may be used, minimizing risks associated with uncontrolled or unregulated toxic substances.

---

### **Authorization under the Fisheries Act**

Under **paragraph 36(4)(b)** of the *Fisheries Act*, fish toxicants are classified as **authorized deleterious substances** that may be deposited in specified waters. This means that their use is not prohibited but is strictly regulated and requires formal authorization.

#### **Authorized Waters for Deposit**

Fish toxicants may be deposited in the following waters:
- The **entire waters** of:
  - **Saskatchewan**
  - **Alberta**
- The **non-tidal waters** of:
  - **Ontario**
  - **Quebec**
  - **Manitoba**

> **Note**: Tidal waters are excluded from this authorization, emphasizing a focus on inland and non-tidal aquatic systems where pest fish control is most applicable and where environmental risks may be more manageable.

### **Authorized Persons to Grant Authorization**

In the absence of any other legal authority, the following provincial officials are designated as the **authorized persons** to grant written authorization for the deposit of fish toxicants:

| Province | Authorized Authority |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Ontario** | The Minister of Natural Resources |
| **Quebec** | The Minister responsible for the application of *An Act respecting the conservation and development of wildlife*, R.S.Q., c. C-61.1 |
| **Manitoba** | The Minister of Natural Resources |
| **Saskatchewan** | The Minister of Parks, Recreation and Culture |
| **Alberta** | The **Chief Fishery Officer**, as defined in the *Alberta Fishery Regulations* |

> These designations ensure that provincial governments with responsibility for natural resources and wildlife management have oversight and accountability over the use of toxic substances.

---

### **Conditions for Authorization (Section 5)**

Authorization to deposit fish toxicants is subject to **two key conditions**:

1. **Eradication Must Enhance Fishing**  
   The Minister or Chief Fishery Officer must be **satisfied that**:
   - The use of fish toxicants to eliminate pest fish species in the designated waters will result in **improved fishing conditions**; and  
   - This improvement is achieved through **subsequent restocking** of the waters after the toxicant application.

   > This condition ensures that the use of toxicants is not arbitrary or for non-fishing-related purposes. It ties the use of toxicants directly to **economic and recreational benefits** to the fishing industry.

2. **Written Authorization Required**  
   All authorizations must be issued in **writing**. This provides a clear, documented record of when, where, and why a fish toxicant was authorized for use, enhancing transparency and accountability.

---

### **Environmental Protection Condition**

A critical condition governing the **actual deposit** of fish toxicants is:

> The deposit **must not adversely affect fish in adjacent waters**.

This means that:
- The use of fish toxicants must be carefully planned to avoid **cross-waters contamination**.
- Proximity to other water bodies (e.g., rivers flowing into lakes, or connected waterways) must be considered.
- Environmental assessments or mitigation measures may be required to prevent unintended harm to non-target fish populations or aquatic ecosystems.

This condition reflects a commitment to **environmental stewardship** and prevents the spread of toxicants beyond the intended area.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Context**

The primary goals of these regulations are:
- To **control pest fish populations** that degrade fishery productivity (e.g., invasive species like northern pike, smallmouth bass, or certain trout species that outcompete native or commercially valuable fish).
- To **protect and enhance fishing opportunities** in key inland waters.
- To **ensure that toxicant use is lawful, transparent, and environmentally sound** through clear regulatory oversight and procedural safeguards.

---

### **Key Regulatory Principles**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal Compliance** | All fish toxicants must meet national standards under the Pest Control Products Act. |
| **Provincial Oversight** | Provincial ministers or officers are responsible for authorizing use, ensuring local relevance and accountability. |
| **Environmental Safeguards** | Use must not harm adjacent waters or non-target fish. |
| **Purpose-Driven Use** | Toxicants are only permitted when they directly contribute to improved fishing conditions. |
| **Transparency and Documentation** | All authorizations must be in writing and traceable. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Fish Toxicant Regulations* provide a **structured, balanced, and legally grounded approach** to the use of fish toxicants in Canada’s major inland and non-tidal waters. By clearly defining:
- Who can authorize use,
- Where it can occur,
- What conditions must be met,
- And how environmental risks are mitigated,

these regulations ensure that fish toxicant applications serve legitimate ecological and economic objectives—without compromising aquatic biodiversity or public safety.

This regulatory framework exemplifies the Canadian government’s effort to **balance effective pest management with environmental protection**, in accordance with the principles of the *Fisheries Act* and broader environmental legislation.
