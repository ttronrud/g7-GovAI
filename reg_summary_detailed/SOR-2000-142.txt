**Detailed Summary of the Expropriation Fees Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Expropriation Fees Regulations* were issued by the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** on **April 6, 2000**, under several statutory provisions from federal legislation. These regulations establish a framework for determining and collecting fees associated with expropriation activities conducted by the Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS).

The Minister exercised authority under the following specific sections of federal acts:

1. **Section 4.1(4)a of the Expropriation Act**  
   – Authorizes the setting of fees for employees involved in expropriation work.

2. **Section 6(4)b of the Dry Docks Subsidies Act**  
   – Provides a basis for fee determination in relation to dry docks expropriation projects.

3. **Section 31(3.1)c of the Northwest Territories Waters Act**  
   – Enables fee establishment for expropriation activities involving water resources in the Northwest Territories.

4. **Section 7(1.3)e of the Dominion Water Power Act**  
   – Authorizes fee structures for expropriation activities related to water power development.

5. **Section 31(3.1)f of the Yukon Waters Act**  
   – Grants authority to set fees for expropriation involving water resources in the Yukon Territory.

These provisions collectively provide the legal foundation for the Minister to prescribe fees for labor involved in expropriation projects.

### **Core Provisions of the Regulations**

#### **1. Fee Calculation for Expropriation Work**

For every **billable hour** an employee of the Department of Public Works and Government Services spends on an expropriation project, the following fee is charged:

> **Twice the hourly rate of the employee**, prorated from the employee’s **salary per diem**, based on a **productivity rate of 220 days per year**, **plus employee benefits**.

##### Breakdown of the Fee Structure:

- **Base Hourly Rate**:  
  The employee’s hourly rate is derived from their **salary per diem** (daily wage), adjusted to reflect a standard work year of **220 productive days**.  
  This means:
  > Hourly rate = (Annual salary per diem) ÷ 220 days

- **Fee Multiplier**:  
  The fee is **twice** this calculated hourly rate.  
  This double rate accounts for the cost of expropriation work, which is typically more complex and time-intensive than regular operations.

- **Employee Benefits**:  
  An additional **20% of the total chargeable salaries** (i.e., the total fees charged for labor) is included in the fee.  
  This covers benefits such as health insurance, pension contributions, and other statutory or contractual benefits.

> **Example Calculation**:  
> Suppose an employee earns a daily rate of $300.  
> - Annual salary per diem = $300 × 220 = $66,000  
> - Hourly rate = $66,000 ÷ 220 = $300 per day → $300 ÷ 220 = $1.36 per hour  
> - Fee for one billable hour = 2 × $1.36 = $2.72  
> - Employee benefits = 20% of ($2.72 × 1 hour) = $0.54  
> - Total fee = $2.72 + $0.54 = **$3.26 per billable hour**

> *Note: The actual hourly rate is derived from the employee’s daily salary, not their actual hourly wage, and the 220-day productivity rate is used to standardize the calculation across different work years.*

#### **2. Interest on Overdue Fees**

- If fees are not paid within the prescribed timeframe, interest will be applied to the outstanding amount.  
- The rate of interest is determined in accordance with **Section 5 of the Interest and Administrative Charges Regulations**.  
- This ensures that the government can recover unpaid fees with a financial incentive to prompt timely payment.

---

#### **3. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada.  
- The registration date is not explicitly stated in the text, but the issuance date (April 6, 2000) is referenced. In practice, the regulations would become effective upon formal registration in the Canada Gazette.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **establish a transparent, consistent, and legally grounded fee structure** for labor used in expropriation projects.
- To **recover the full cost of labor**, including both direct compensation and employee benefits, in a manner that reflects the complexity and time commitment of expropriation work.
- To ensure **fair and equitable compensation** for public employees engaged in land or water rights acquisition.
- To provide a **clear mechanism for financial accountability** in expropriation activities, particularly in relation to federal water and infrastructure projects.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies to **all expropriation projects** involving:
  - Land acquisition (under the Expropriation Act)
  - Water rights (under the Northwest Territories Waters Act, Yukon Waters Act, and Dominion Water Power Act)
  - Dry dock and water-related infrastructure (Dry Docks Subsidies Act)

- Applies to **all employees of the Department of Public Works and Government Services** assigned to expropriation work.

- Fees are calculated on a **per billable hour basis**, meaning only time directly spent on expropriation is charged.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Productivity Standard** | 220 days per year is used as a baseline for converting daily salaries to hourly rates. This is a standard in federal public service accounting. |
| **Double Hourly Rate** | Reflects the higher cost and complexity of expropriation work compared to routine operations. |
| **Benefits Inclusion** | 20% of total labor charges is allocated to employee benefits, ensuring full compensation. |
| **Legal Basis** | Rooted in specific sections of key federal acts, ensuring regulatory legitimacy. |
| **Enforceability** | Interest on overdue fees provides a financial mechanism to ensure compliance. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Expropriation Fees Regulations* provide a clear, legally enforceable, and equitable framework for calculating and collecting fees for labor involved in expropriation activities across Canada. By linking fees to employee salaries, productivity standards, and benefits, the regulations ensure that the government is fairly compensated for the time and resources invested in acquiring land or water rights. The inclusion of interest on overdue payments strengthens financial accountability and supports the sustainability of public infrastructure projects involving land and water rights.

These regulations are a critical component of the federal government’s administrative and financial oversight of expropriation activities, particularly in the context of infrastructure development, water management, and regional economic policy.
