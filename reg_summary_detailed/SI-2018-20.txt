**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
Application for Citizenship — Minors Remission Order  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, pursuant to subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act*.

**Regulatory Reference:**  
- S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
- R.S., c. F-11 (Citizenship Regulations)

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
This regulation establishes a **remission (refund)** of a portion of the fee paid by a parent or guardian for a minor child applying for Canadian citizenship. The remission is designed to address concerns that the original fee structure for minors was **unreasonable**, particularly during a specific time period.

---

### **Key Definitions**
- **"Minor"** is defined as having the same meaning as in subsection 2(1) of the *Citizenship Act*.  
  This typically refers to a person under the age of 18 years.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**
The remission applies to:
- Any individual (parent, guardian, or legal custodian) who **paid the full fee** for a minor’s application for citizenship under **subsection 5(1) of the Citizenship Act**.
- The fee paid must have been during a specific **time window**:
  - **Beginning on June 19, 2017**
  - **Ending on the day before** the Regulations Amending the Citizenship Regulations (Fees for Minor Applicants) come into force.

> The fee in question was originally $530, as set out in subsection 31(1) of the Citizenship Regulations.

---

### **Amount of Remission**
- A refund of **$430** is granted to each qualifying applicant.
- This represents a **portion** of the original $530 fee, effectively reducing the financial burden on families.

> The $430 remission is not a full refund but a partial reimbursement intended to correct what was deemed an unreasonable fee structure.

---

### **Conditions for the Remission**
1. The minor must be the subject of an application for citizenship under subsection 5(1) of the *Citizenship Act*.
2. The fee must have been paid during the specified period (June 19, 2017 – one day before the new fee regulations take effect).
3. The remission applies only to fees paid **before** the new regulations came into force.

---

### **Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day the Regulations Amending the Citizenship Regulations (Fees for Minor Applicants)** come into force.
- **If the Order is issued after** the new regulations come into force, then it will take effect on the **day it is made**.

> This ensures that the remission is only available to those who paid fees before the new, potentially revised fee structure was implemented.

---

### **Background and Rationale**
The regulation responds to a determination by the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration that the **original fee of $530 for a minor’s citizenship application was unreasonable**. This assessment likely considered factors such as:
- The financial burden on low-income families
- The complexity of the application process
- The lack of proportionality between the fee and the actual administrative cost
- Public interest in ensuring equitable access to citizenship

By offering a refund of $430, the government aims to:
- Improve fairness in the fee structure
- Provide financial relief to families
- Align with broader principles of equity and accessibility in citizenship processes

---

### **Note on Enforcement and Status**
- The Order is **in force as of February 12, 2018**.
- It is a temporary measure designed to address a perceived issue in the fee structure prior to the implementation of revised regulations.

---

### **Conclusion**
This Order serves as a **corrective and equitable measure** to refund a significant portion of the fee paid by individuals for their minor children’s citizenship applications during a specific period. It reflects a government commitment to reviewing and adjusting fees to ensure they are reasonable and accessible, particularly for vulnerable or low-income families. The remission is limited in scope and time, applying only to those who paid fees before the new fee regulations were introduced.

---

**In essence:**  
*Families who paid $530 for a minor’s citizenship application between June 19, 2017, and just before the new fee rules took effect are entitled to a $430 refund, provided the minor was part of a valid citizenship application under the Citizenship Act. The refund is effective when the new fee regulations come into force, or on the day the Order is made if issued later.*
