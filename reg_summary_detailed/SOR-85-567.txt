**Detailed Summary of the Deficient Postage Regulations (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Deficient Postage Regulations*, officially titled the **Deficient Postage Regulations**, were approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on **September 1, 1985**, based on a recommendation from the Minister of National Revenue under **subsection 17(1) of the Canada Post Corporation Act**. These regulations were developed to address the handling of **mailable matter that lacks sufficient postage or bears no postage at all**—commonly referred to as "deficient postage items."

The regulations came into effect on **September 1, 1985**, following a public notice published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **April 10, 1985**, which provided interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments or representations to the Minister before final approval.

### **Regulatory Citation and Scope**

- **Citation**: *Deficient Postage Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all **mailable matter posted in Canada** for transmission by post—whether for delivery **within Canada or outside Canada**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Deficient Postage**  
   - Defined as *the amount by which the postage payable on a mailable item has not been paid*.  
   - Example: If a letter requires $1.00 in postage and only $0.50 is paid, the deficient postage is $0.50.

2. **Deficient Postage Item**  
   - Any item of mailable matter that has insufficient or no postage.  
   - This includes letters, packages, or other postal items that fail to meet the required postage standards.

---

### **General Rule: Return to Sender**

- **Subsection 5(1)**:  
  Subject to certain exceptions, **a deficient postage item shall be returned to the sender**.  
  - This ensures that items without proper postage are not delivered to unintended recipients and helps prevent financial loss to Canada Post.

---

### **Exceptions to Return: Forwarding to Addressee**

A deficient postage item may be **forwarded to the addressee** under **three specific conditions**:

1. **If a charge is payable under the Undeliverable and Redirected Mail Regulations**  
   - When the item is redirected due to undeliverable reasons (e.g., incorrect address), and the redirection incurs a fee, the item may be forwarded.  
   - In such cases, the addressee is responsible for paying both the **deficient postage** and the **deficient postage rate** as specified in **Section 6**.

2. **If the item bears no return address**  
   - Items without a return address cannot be returned to the sender.  
   - Canada Post may forward them to the addressee, with the addressee liable for the **deficient postage plus the rate set in Section 6**.

3. **If the addressee has entered into a written service agreement**  
   - The addressee must have **agreed in writing** to accept deficient postage items.  
   - In return, the addressee agrees to pay:
     - The **amount specified in the written agreement**, and  
     - The **deficient postage rate** as set out in Section 6.

> These three exceptions allow for flexibility in cases where the sender cannot be identified or where the recipient voluntarily accepts responsibility for the postage shortfall.

---

### **Payment Obligations Upon Forwarding**

Regardless of the reason for forwarding, **the addressee is responsible for paying**:

- The **deficient postage amount**, and  
- The **deficient postage rate** established by Canada Post (as defined in Section 6).

This ensures that the financial burden of insufficient postage is borne by the recipient, not the postal service, and promotes accountability.

---

### **Special Provision for International Deliveries**

- **Notwithstanding the above**, if a deficient postage item is posted in Canada and is destined for **delivery outside Canada**, the **deficient postage rate does not apply**.  
- This means that:
  - The item will be returned to the sender (or redirected as per applicable rules),  
  - And **no additional charge** is imposed on the addressee for the deficiency in postage.  
- This exception recognizes the complexity of international mail and the need for different handling procedures.

---

### **Rate Determination**

- The **rate for a deficient postage item** (when forwarded to the addressee) is **established by Canada Post** and is specified in **Section 6** of the regulations.  
- This rate is fixed and applied uniformly across all cases where forwarding occurs, ensuring consistency and transparency in billing.
