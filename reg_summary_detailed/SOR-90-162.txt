**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Nordion Europe S.A. Incorporation Authorization Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically:

- **Subsection 91(6)** of the FAA: This provision allows the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to determine whether a corporation is capable of undertaking a particular transaction. In this case, the Governor in Council has concluded that **Nordion International Inc.** is legally and financially capable of carrying out the proposed incorporation of a new entity in Belgium.

- **Paragraph 91(1)(a)** of the FAA: This grants the Governor in Council the authority to make orders authorizing certain corporate actions, such as the incorporation of a foreign subsidiary, when such actions are in the public interest and approved by the relevant ministerial and administrative bodies.

The Order is therefore issued pursuant to a formal delegation of authority from the federal government, following recommendations from two key bodies:

- The **Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs)**  
- The **Treasury Board of Canada**

These bodies have reviewed and recommended the authorization, indicating that the proposed transaction aligns with government policy, regulatory standards, and strategic objectives.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **authorize Nordion International Inc. to incorporate a new company in Belgium**, namely **Nordion Europe S.A.**, under the laws of Belgium.

This step is part of a broader strategy to expand Nordion International Inc.’s international operations, particularly in the area of **nuclear science and radiation technologies**, where European markets—especially Belgium—offer significant opportunities.

**3. Key Provisions of the Order:**

- **Authorization to Incorporate:**  
  Nordion International Inc. is formally authorized to proceed with the legal incorporation of **Nordion Europe S.A.** in Belgium. This includes all necessary steps to establish the company under Belgian corporate law.

- **Ownership Structure:**  
  Upon incorporation, **some of the shares** of Nordion Europe S.A. will be:

  - **Held by**,  
  - **On behalf of**, or  
  - **In trust for**  
  Nordion International Inc.

  This indicates that while Nordion Europe S.A. will be a separate legal entity under Belgian law, it will be **owned or controlled by its parent company**, Nordion International Inc. The use of “on behalf of” or “in trust for” suggests a formal arrangement to ensure governance and financial accountability, possibly to meet regulatory, tax, or legal requirements in Belgium or under Canadian corporate policy.

- **Legal Jurisdiction:**  
  The incorporation will occur under the **Belgian corporate laws**, which govern the formation, governance, and operations of the new entity.

**4. Legal Citation and Title:**

The Order is formally titled:  
**“The Nordion Europe S.A. Incorporation Authorization Order”**  
It may be cited in official documents and legal references as such.

**5. Implications and Strategic Context:**

- **International Expansion:** This move enables Nordion International Inc. to better serve European customers, comply with regional regulatory frameworks, and access European markets for its products and services in nuclear medicine, radiation safety, and environmental monitoring.

- **Corporate Structure:** Establishing a separate subsidiary in Belgium allows for local compliance with European regulations, tax optimization, and operational independence while maintaining ownership and control with the Canadian parent.

- **Regulatory Oversight:** The fact that the order was approved by the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) and the Treasury Board underscores the importance of ensuring that such international corporate actions align with broader government policy goals, including privatization, regulatory efficiency, and economic development.

**6. Duration and Enforcement:**

While the regulation does not specify an expiration date, such orders under the Financial Administration Act are typically **perpetual or long-term**, unless revoked by a subsequent order. The Order is enforceable as a legal instrument and may be relied upon by Nordion International Inc. and relevant authorities in Belgium to carry out the incorporation process.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally authorizes **Nordion International Inc.** to establish a new subsidiary, **Nordion Europe S.A.**, in Belgium. It reflects a strategic corporate decision to strengthen international presence, ensure regulatory compliance, and leverage local expertise in Europe. The Order is grounded in federal statutory authority, subject to ministerial and Treasury Board review, and establishes a clear ownership structure that maintains control with the Canadian parent company.

**Key Takeaway:**  
This is not merely a procedural step—it is a foundational act in Nordion International Inc.’s international business strategy, enabling it to operate more effectively in Europe under a legally compliant and strategically sound corporate structure.
