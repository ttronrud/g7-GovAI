### **Significance and Implications**

- **Tax Treaty Implementation:**  
  The Convention provides a framework for resolving tax disputes, reducing double taxation, and ensuring fair treatment of cross-border income. It allows Canadian residents earning income in Brazil (or Brazilian residents earning income in Canada) to claim tax credits or exemptions under Canadian tax law.

- **Strengthening Bilateral Relations:**  
  The treaty reflects Canada’s commitment to international tax cooperation and supports economic ties with Brazil.

- **Practical Impact:**  
  - Taxpayers with income from Brazil may now claim a foreign tax credit in Canada to avoid paying Canadian income tax on income already taxed in Brazil.  
  - Conversely, Brazilian residents with income in Canada may benefit from tax treatment under the treaty to avoid double taxation.

- **Legal Clarity and Compliance:**  
  The proclamation ensures that all parties are legally aware of the treaty’s effective date, enabling tax authorities and individuals to comply with the new rules.

### **Conclusion**

The document underscores Canada’s role in international tax cooperation and ensures that stakeholders are legally and practically prepared to operate under the agreed framework.

**Note:**  
This is not a standalone tax regulation but a **notifying proclamation** under Canadian statutory procedure. It does not contain new tax rules or penalties—it simply announces the effective date of an existing international tax treaty. The actual tax rules are found in the Canada-Brazil Income Tax Convention itself and in the implementing legislation, such as the *Canada-Brazil Income Tax Convention Act, 1984*.
