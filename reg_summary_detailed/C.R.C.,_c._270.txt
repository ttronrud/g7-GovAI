**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Egg Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is formally titled: **The Saskatchewan Egg Marketing Levies Order**.
- It may be cited as such and serves as a legal instrument governing the collection of marketing levies on egg production in the Province of Saskatchewan.

---

### **2. Key Definitions (Key Terms Used in the Order)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Saskatchewan* (Loi), which provides the legal framework under which the Commodity Board operates and implements marketing policies. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Saskatchewan Commercial Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act. This body is responsible for managing the marketing of eggs, setting quotas, and collecting levies. |
| **Eggs** | Any shell eggs laid by domestic hens and offered for human consumption, produced within the Province of Saskatchewan. |
| **Layer** | A female chicken (pondeuse) that is six months of age or older and capable of laying eggs. |
| **Period** | A three-month calendar period that begins on January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st each year. These periods are used to calculate levies and manage production quotas. |
| **Plan** | The *Saskatchewan Commercial Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. This plan sets out rules for marketing, pricing, quotas, and levies. |
| **Producer** | Any individual or entity operating facilities for egg production in Saskatchewan who markets the production of **300 or more layers** at any point during the calendar year. This threshold defines eligibility to be subject to the levy. |
| **Quota** | The maximum number of layers a producer may market during a given period, as officially assigned by the Commodity Board. Quotas are designed to manage supply and ensure fair market access. |

### **3. Levy Structure and Payment Rules**

#### **(a) Levy Rate and Conditions**
- Every eligible producer must pay a levy to the Commodity Board **in addition to service charges** outlined in the Marketing Plan.
- **Rate**: $0.0125 per period per layer.
- **Eligibility Criteria**:
  - The layer must be **available for production** during the period.
  - The producer must **not exceed the quota** allocated to them for that period.
- **No levy is due** for a layer that **replaces another layer** during the same period. This provision prevents double-counting and ensures that replacement layers do not incur additional levies.

> *Example*: If a producer replaces a layer in mid-period, only the original layer (if active) is subject to the levy. The replacement layer is not charged because it is considered a substitution.

#### **(b) Timing of Payment**
- Producers must pay the levies **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the period begins**.
- For instance:
  - For the January–March period, payment must be made by **April 15th**.
  - For the April–June period, payment is due by **July 15th**.
  - And so on for each of the four annual periods.

> This creates a predictable and timely payment schedule aligned with the fiscal cycle of egg production.

### **4. Purpose and Objectives of the Levy System**

The levy system serves several key regulatory and economic functions:

1. **Revenue Generation**:
   - Funds collected from levies support the operation of the Commodity Board, including market research, price stabilization, and marketing initiatives.

2. **Supply Management**:
   - By linking levies to production levels (specifically layers available for laying), the system encourages producers to manage their flock sizes in line with market demand and quota limits.

3. **Quota Compliance**:
   - The levy only applies when producers are **below their quota**, thereby incentivizing efficient use of production capacity and preventing overproduction.

4. **Fair Market Access**:
   - The system helps maintain a balanced market by preventing oversupply, which could depress prices and harm producers.

5. **Cost Recovery and Sustainability**:
   - The levy ensures that producers contribute to the cost of managing the marketing system, promoting long-term sustainability of the egg industry.

---

### **5. Exclusions and Special Provisions**

- **No levy applies** to layers that are **replacing another layer** during the same period. This recognizes that a replacement does not represent a new layer in terms of production capacity and avoids penalizing producers for managing flock turnover.

- **Only producers meeting the 300-layer threshold** are subject to the levy. This ensures that the system targets larger, more significant producers who have a greater impact on market supply.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Producers are required to accurately report the number of layers available for production during each period.
- Failure to pay levies on time may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Commodity Board.
- The Commodity Board has the authority to verify production data and assess compliance with the levy requirements.

---

### **7. Legal Authority and Context**

- The Order operates under the authority of *The Natural Products Marketing Act*, which empowers the Commodity Board to establish marketing plans and levy systems to ensure fair and stable markets for agricultural products like eggs.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Saskatchewan Egg Marketing Levies Order** establishes a structured, transparent, and equitable system for collecting marketing levies from egg producers in the province. By charging $0.0125 per layer per three-month period (only when within quota and not replacing a layer), the regulation ensures that producers contribute fairly to the marketing infrastructure while promoting responsible production and market stability. The timely payment requirement ensures financial accountability and supports the operational efficiency of the Commodity Board.

This system balances economic incentives with regulatory oversight, helping to maintain a sustainable and competitive egg market in Saskatchewan.
