**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Forensic Laboratory Services Fees Regulations**

**Regulation Citation:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6  
Title: *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Forensic Laboratory Services Fees Regulations*

**Enactment Authority:**  
The regulations were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Treasury Board. This authority is derived from **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the government to establish fees for the use of certain public services, including those provided by federal agencies such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a clear, transparent, and standardized fee structure for the use of forensic laboratory services provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). These services include scientific analysis and testing (e.g., DNA analysis, toxicology, ballistics, fingerprinting, and other forensic examinations) conducted at RCMP forensic laboratories.

The regulation ensures that the RCMP can recover reasonable costs associated with providing these services, while maintaining accountability and consistency in fee collection for non-law enforcement users.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Fee for Non-Law Enforcement Users**  
The fee to be paid by any individual or entity **not belonging to a law enforcement agency** is composed of two components:

- **Hourly Service Fee:**  
  A fee of **$110 per hour** of forensic laboratory service provided, or any **portion of an hour**.  
  - This means that even if a request is processed for less than a full hour (e.g., 30 minutes), the user must pay $110.  
  - This applies to all types of forensic services (e.g., DNA testing, toxicology screening, trace evidence analysis), regardless of the specific nature of the test.

- **Travel Cost Reimbursement:**  
  In addition to the hourly fee, a user must pay an amount equal to the **travel costs** of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) employee who travels to provide the forensic laboratory service.  
  - The travel costs are determined in accordance with the **Travel Directive, Chapter VI.1**, of the *Administration Manual of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police*.  
  - This directive outlines the official policy and rates for employee travel, including transportation, accommodation, meals, and per diem allowances, based on factors such as distance, duration, and location.  
  - The travel cost is not a flat fee but is calculated based on the actual or reasonable expenses incurred by an RCMP employee during travel to the site of service provision.

> **Note:** The travel cost component applies only when a service is delivered off-site (e.g., a sample is sent to a remote location, or a technician must travel to a client’s premises to perform analysis).

### **Who Is Covered by the Regulation?**

- **Excluded:** Members of law enforcement agencies (e.g., police services, provincial or municipal law enforcement, federal agencies like the Crown Attorney’s Office or other public safety bodies) are **not subject** to these fees.  
  - These users may access forensic services under existing inter-agency agreements or through shared resources, typically without charge.

- **Applicable to:** All other individuals, organizations, or entities (e.g., private investigators, legal counsel, private forensic service providers, or government departments outside law enforcement) that request and receive forensic laboratory services from the RCMP.

---

### **Application and Enforcement**

- The fees are to be applied **proportionally** to the actual time and travel required to deliver the service.  
- The regulation is designed to ensure that the RCMP is fairly compensated for its operational costs, including labor, equipment, and administrative overhead.

- The fee structure is intended to be **transparent and predictable**, allowing users to budget for forensic testing in advance.

- The RCMP is responsible for billing and collecting these fees, with appropriate documentation and justification required for any claim.

---

### **Legal and Financial Basis**

- The regulation is grounded in **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which authorizes the government to set fees for services provided by federal departments and agencies.  
- This provision supports the principle of **cost recovery** for public services, ensuring that agencies are not left financially exposed when providing services to the public or private sector.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Transparency:** Provides clear, standardized pricing for users, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes.  
- **Cost Accountability:** Ensures that the RCMP recovers direct and indirect costs associated with forensic services.  
- **Equity:** Applies the same fee structure to all non-law enforcement users, promoting fairness.  
- **Operational Sustainability:** Helps maintain the financial viability of the RCMP’s forensic laboratory operations, which are critical to supporting investigations and justice outcomes.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Forensic Laboratory Services Fees Regulations* establish a fair, transparent, and legally grounded fee structure for non-law enforcement users seeking forensic laboratory services from the RCMP. By charging $110 per hour (or portion thereof) plus reimbursable travel costs, the regulation ensures that the RCMP can sustain its forensic capabilities while maintaining accountability and cost recovery. The regulation reflects a balance between public service delivery and financial responsibility, consistent with federal administrative and financial policy.
