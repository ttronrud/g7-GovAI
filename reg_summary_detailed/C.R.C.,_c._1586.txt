**Detailed Summary of the Special Force Superannuation Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulations are formally titled the **Special Force Superannuation Regulations** and may be cited as such.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (Loi), which establishes the framework for superannuation (pension) entitlements for public servants in Canada. This Act governs pensionable service and pension rights for contributors in the public service.

- **"Contributor"**: A person who is recognized as a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act. This includes individuals employed in the public service who are eligible for pension benefits under the Act.

- **"Special Force"**: Defined by **Section 2 of the Veterans Benefit Act**. This term refers to specific military or paramilitary units (such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Special Operations, or other designated forces) that were involved in operations during or after World War II. The term is used to identify personnel who served in non-traditional or specialized military roles, which may qualify for special pension treatment under these regulations.

### **3. Core Provision: Election to Count Special Force Service as Pensionable Service**

- **General Rule (Subsection 1)**:  
  A contributor may, under the Public Service Superannuation Act, **elect to count any period of service in a "special force" as pensionable service**, **as if that service had been active service in the armed forces during World War II**.  
  - This means that even though the service was in a "special force" (not a traditional military branch), it can be treated for pension purposes as though it were active wartime service — a status that historically entitles individuals to enhanced pension benefits.

- **Limitation on Application (Subsection 1, subject to subsection 4(1))**:  
  This right to count service is **not available to all contributors**. It applies only under specific conditions, and is subject to the following exception:

### **4. Exception: Contributors Who Were on Leave of Absence to Enlist**

- **Subsection 4(1)**:  
  The right to count special force service as pensionable service **does not apply** to a contributor who:
  - Was **absent from the Public Service**;
  - And had been granted a **leave of absence to enlist in the special force**.

- **Alternative Treatment for Such Contributors**:  
  Instead of being treated as a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act, such a person is **deemed to have been a contributor under Part I of the Civil Service Superannuation Act**.  
  - More specifically, they are treated as having been **absent from the Public Service on active service in the forces during World War II**, having been granted leave of absence to enlist.  
  - This means their service in the special force is treated under the **Civil Service Superannuation Act**, which may have different rules or benefits than the Public Service Superannuation Act — particularly in how pensionable service is calculated or recognized.

> **Purpose of this exception**: To prevent double-counting or misclassification of service. If a public servant left their position to join a special force during wartime, their absence is treated as active military service, which may fall under a different legal or pension framework (the Civil Service Superannuation Act), rather than being counted under the Public Service Act.

### **5. Requirements for Making an Election**

Any election to count special force service as pensionable service must meet the following **three conditions**:

1. **Timing of Election**:  
   The election must be made **while the contributor is still employed in the Public Service**.  
   - It cannot be made after leaving public service or during a period of retirement.

2. **Form of Election**:  
   The election must be **evidenced in writing** and submitted in the **form prescribed by the President of the Treasury Board**.  
   - This ensures standardization, clarity, and official record-keeping.

3. **Deadline for Election**:  
   The election must be made **within one year of the contributor becoming a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act**.  
   - This creates a strict time limit to ensure timely and transparent processing of claims.

> **Consequence of non-compliance**: If the election is not made within the one-year window or is not properly documented, it will not be recognized under the regulations.

### **6. Special Provisions for Contributors Under the Defence Services Pension Act**

- If a contributor was previously covered by the **Defence Services Pension Act** (a separate act that provided pension benefits to members of the Canadian Armed Forces), and was entitled under that Act to count special force service as pensionable, then:
  - That entitlement **must be exercised under Section 27 of the Public Service Superannuation Act**.
  - This means the individual **cannot independently elect** under these Special Force Regulations to count the service — they must follow the procedure in Section 27 of the Public Service Act.

> **Purpose**: To prevent overlapping or conflicting pension claims and to ensure consistency in how service is recognized across different pension legislation.

### **7. Summary of Key Principles**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Recognition of Special Force Service** | Service in a "special force" (as defined by the Veterans Benefit Act) can be counted as pensionable service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, **as if it were active wartime service**. |
| **Limited Availability** | This right is **only available to contributors who were not absent due to leave of absence to enlist**. |
| **Leave of Absence Exception** | Those who left public service to join a special force are **deemed to have been on active wartime service** under the Civil Service Superannuation Act, not the Public Service Act. |
| **Formal and Timely Requirements** | Elections must be in writing, submitted in the prescribed form, and made within one year of becoming a contributor. |
| **No Double Claiming** | If previously covered by the Defence Services Pension Act, the election must be made under Section 27 of the Public Service Act. |

### **8. Policy Objectives**

- To **recognize the contributions** of public servants who served in specialized or non-traditional military roles during wartime.
- To ensure **fair and consistent pension treatment** for those who served in special forces, aligning their service with the historical recognition of wartime service.
- To **avoid administrative overlap** or duplication of benefits by clearly defining who can and cannot claim such service under which act.
- To **maintain legal clarity and accountability** through strict procedural requirements.

### **Conclusion**

The *Special Force Superannuation Regulations* provide a structured, legally grounded pathway for public servants who served in special forces during or after World War II to have their service recognized as pensionable. However, this recognition is conditional — it only applies to those who were not absent due to a leave of absence to enlist, and even then, the treatment differs depending on the legal framework under which they were originally covered. The regulations emphasize **timeliness, formality, and legal precision** in processing such claims, ensuring both fairness and consistency in pension entitlements.

These rules reflect a broader effort to honor the service of veterans and special force personnel while maintaining integrity in the public service pension system.
