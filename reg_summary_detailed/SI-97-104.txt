The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-75" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 75 of 2018 has been officially repealed.

However, without further details (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the repealed regulation itself. Statutory instruments like SI/2018-75 are typically issued under the authority of an Act of Parliament and may cover areas such as health, safety, environmental standards, taxation, transport, or administrative procedures.

In this case, the designation "Repealed" means that the instrument is no longer in force. It was likely repealed by a subsequent statutory instrument or by an amendment to the original enabling legislation. The repeal may have occurred to:

- Remove outdated or obsolete provisions;
- Align with updated policy or legislation;
- Avoid legal inconsistencies;
- Streamline regulatory frameworks.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

- Full title of the statutory instrument (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2018");
- The parent Act under which it was made;
- The subject matter (e.g., workplace safety, licensing, emissions standards);
- The key provisions that were previously in force;
- The reason for repeal (as stated in the repealing instrument or government announcement).
