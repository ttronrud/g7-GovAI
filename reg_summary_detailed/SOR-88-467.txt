**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Ginn and Company (Canada) and GLC Publishers Limited Acquisition of Shares Order**

---

### **1. Legal Context and Authority**

This regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, a key piece of Canadian federal legislation that governs the financial administration of the Crown and its corporations. Specifically, it draws upon:

- **Paragraph 101(1)(b)** of the Financial Administration Act: This grants the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) the power to make Orders in Council to authorize certain transactions involving Crown corporations, particularly when such transactions are in the public interest or serve national economic objectives.
  
- **Subsection 101(7)** of the FAA: This provides the authority to revoke or amend prior Orders in Council, allowing for adjustments in policy or circumstances that may have changed since the original order was issued.

- **Subsection 101(6)** of the FAA: This confirms that the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC) is a *parent Crown corporation* within the meaning of the Act and is therefore eligible to engage in specific corporate transactions under the authority of the Governor in Council.

Additionally, the regulation acknowledges that CDIC is already authorized under the **Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)** to carry out the proposed transaction, meaning that the legal structure and corporate capacity for the acquisition are already in place.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **revise and replace** an earlier acquisition decision — the *Ginn and Company (Canada) Acquisition of Shares Order* made on March 10, 1988 (P.C. 1988-459) — by authorizing a new, more comprehensive acquisition.

Rather than acquiring the assets directly, the government authorizes the **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)** to acquire **51% of a newly formed corporation** that will own the **businesses of two key entities**:

- **Ginn and Company (Canada)**: A former division of Xerox Canada Inc., which had been engaged in publishing and educational materials.
- **GLC Publishers Limited**: A publisher specializing in educational content and materials.

This structure allows for a **separate corporate entity** to be created, which will hold and operate these businesses, while CDIC acquires a controlling stake (51%) in that entity.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### a. **Revocation of Previous Order**
- The Order formally **revokes** the earlier Order in Council P.C. 1988-459, which had originally authorized the acquisition of Ginn and Company (Canada) shares.
- This revocation is necessary to reflect a change in the scope or structure of the transaction — likely due to evolving strategic, economic, or policy considerations.

#### b. **Authorization of New Transaction**
- CDIC is authorized to **acquire shares** representing **51%** of a newly incorporated corporation.
- The new corporation will be **specifically created** to own and operate the businesses of:
  - Ginn and Company (Canada)
  - GLC Publishers Limited
- The acquisition will be from **Gulf + Western Industries, Inc.** or any of its subsidiaries, which previously held ownership interests in these businesses.

#### c. **Legal Basis and Governance**
- The transaction is authorized under the **Canada Business Corporations Act**, confirming that CDIC has the legal standing to undertake such a corporate acquisition.
- The Governor in Council acts on the **recommendation of the President of the Privy Council and the Treasury Board**, reflecting the usual policy and administrative review process for Crown corporation transactions.

#### d. **Citation and Publication**
- The Order is formally titled:  
  **"Ginn and Company (Canada) and GLC Publishers Limited Acquisition of Shares Order"**  
  and is cited as **SOR/88-177**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 1662* on March 19, 1988.

### **4. Strategic and Economic Rationale (Implied)**

Although not explicitly stated in the text, the broader context suggests that this acquisition was part of a government strategy to:

- **Stabilize or preserve** key educational publishing operations that had been divested or at risk.
- **Ensure continuity of educational content** provided by Ginn and GLC, which were important in Canadian schools and institutions.
- **Promote public interest** through state ownership of critical infrastructure in the education sector.
- **Protect intellectual property and long-standing business operations** from potential sale or closure by private interests.

By creating a new corporate entity and granting CDIC a majority stake, the government ensures that these businesses remain under public stewardship and are less vulnerable to private market pressures.

---

### **5. Implications**

- **For CDIC**: Gains a significant asset in the education publishing sector, aligning with its mandate to support Canadian economic development and public interest investments.
- **For Ginn and GLC**: Their businesses are transferred into a new corporate structure, with a majority owner (CDIC) ensuring long-term stability and public accountability.
- **For Gulf + Western Industries**: The transaction represents a divestiture of its stake in these Canadian educational publishing assets.
- **For the Public**: Ensures continued access to educational materials and supports the Canadian education system through state-backed publishing.

### **6. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **corrective and strategic revision** of a prior government decision to acquire educational publishing assets. By revoking an earlier order and authorizing a new, more structured acquisition through a newly formed corporation, the federal government ensures that the businesses of Ginn and Company (Canada) and GLC Publishers Limited are preserved and managed under public ownership through the Canada Development Investment Corporation. The move reflects a commitment to national interest, public service, and long-term stability in key sectors of the Canadian economy.
