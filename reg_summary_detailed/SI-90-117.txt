**Detailed Summary of the Telesat Canada Financing Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Telesat Canada Financing Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**. The Order is made in the public interest to address a specific tax consequence arising from a financing arrangement involving Telesat Canada and French financial institutions.

This Order provides for a **remission (forgiveness or offset)** of income tax liabilities for certain lenders and financing entities that received payments from Telesat Canada under a credit agreement. The remission is designed to correct a tax outcome that would have been inconsistent with the tax treaty between Canada and France, particularly due to a timing issue in when the treaty came into force.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The primary purpose of the Order is to **prevent tax double taxation or unfair tax burdens** on foreign lenders and financing entities involved in financing the launch of satellites by Telesat Canada. 

Specifically, the tax treatment of payments made by Telesat Canada to these entities under the credit agreement was affected because the **tax treaty between Canada and France (the Protocol)** only came into force on **October 1, 1988**. However, the financing agreement was in place and payments were made **after October 30, 1987**, before the treaty took effect.

Under Canadian income tax rules, interest and other amounts paid by a Canadian company to a foreign entity may be subject to Canadian income tax. Without a treaty, such payments could be taxed in Canada. The treaty, however, would have provided for a more favorable tax treatment—specifically, it would have allowed for a **non-taxable status** or **tax exemption** on such payments, had the treaty been in force at the time.

Because the treaty did not apply at the time the payments were made, the lenders and financing entities were subject to Canadian income tax on the interest and other amounts. This Order remedies that imbalance by **remitting (offsetting)** the excess tax liability that arose due to the treaty’s delayed entry into force.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **Credit Agreement**  
   - The loan agreement between **Telesat Canada** and the lenders (French banks) to finance the launch of certain satellites.  
   - Signed on **July 24, 1987**, and amended on **October 30, 1988**.  
   - This agreement formed the basis for the payments that triggered the tax issue.

2. **Financing Entities**

     - **Banque française pour le commerce extérieur (BFCE)** – a government financing agency of France.
     - **Compagnie française d’assurance des crédits à l’exportation (CFACE)** – an export credit and financing agency of France.  
   - These entities acted as intermediaries or co-lenders in the financing structure.

3. **Lenders**  
   - Three French banking institutions operating under French law:
     - **Banque nationale de Paris (BNP)**
     - **Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (International) S.A. (CIBC International)**

### **Core Provision: The Remission of Tax Liability**

The Order grants a **remission of income tax** to each **lender** and **financing entity** under the following condition:

> The remission is equal to the **excess** of:
> - The **aggregate amount of taxes, interest, and penalties** actually payable under the *Income Tax Act* in respect of amounts paid or credited by Telesat Canada to the lender or financing entity **after October 30, 1987**, under the credit agreement,  
> **over**  
> - The **aggregate amount of taxes, interest, and penalties** that would have been payable **if the Protocol had entered into force on October 30, 1987**.

#### In simpler terms:
- If the treaty had been in force from **October 30, 1987**, the payments made by Telesat Canada to the lenders or financing entities would have been **tax-exempt** or subject to significantly reduced tax.
- Because the treaty only entered into force on **October 1, 1988**, the lenders and financing entities were taxed on those payments **in full**.
- The remission **offsets** the difference between the tax they actually paid and the tax they would have paid under the treaty rules.

This creates a **tax relief** for the foreign lenders and financing entities, effectively correcting a tax overburden caused by the treaty's delayed implementation.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies only to **payments made or credited after October 30, 1987**, under the credit agreement.
- Applies to **each individual lender and financing entity** involved in the agreement.
- The remission is **not a refund**, but a **tax credit or offset** in the form of a reduction in the tax liability under the Income Tax Act.
- The remission is **limited to the excess**—only the difference between actual and hypothetical tax liability is forgiven.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is authorized under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to make orders for the purpose of:
- Promoting public interest,
- Correcting tax consequences in financial transactions involving the government or public entities,
- Ensuring fairness and consistency in tax treatment, especially in international financial arrangements.

This provision allows the government to intervene in tax outcomes when there is a clear public interest justification—such as preventing unjustified tax burdens on foreign lenders supporting Canadian infrastructure.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **International Tax Treaty Compliance**  
   The Order ensures that the tax treatment of payments under the Canada-France tax treaty is respected, even when the treaty’s effective date is delayed.

2. **Fairness to Foreign Lenders**  
   It prevents foreign financial institutions from bearing an unfair tax burden simply because of a delay in treaty implementation.

3. **Support for Canadian Infrastructure**  
   Telesat Canada’s satellite launches were critical to Canada’s telecommunications infrastructure. This Order recognizes the public benefit of such investments by ensuring that foreign financing partners are not penalized by tax rules.

4. **Precedent for Future Transactions**  
   This Order may serve as a precedent for similar tax remissions in future international financing arrangements where tax treaties are delayed in coming into force.

### **Conclusion**

The *Telesat Canada Financing Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable, and legally grounded intervention that corrects an unintended tax consequence arising from the delayed entry into force of the Canada-France tax treaty. By remitting income tax liabilities to lenders and financing entities involved in a major Canadian infrastructure project, the Order ensures that foreign partners are not unfairly taxed due to administrative timing issues. It reflects a balance between national tax policy, international obligations, and the public interest in supporting strategic Canadian investments in space and telecommunications.
