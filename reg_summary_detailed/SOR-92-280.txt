**Detailed Summary of the *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Insurance Companies) Regulations* (S.C. 1991, c. 47)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Insurance Companies) Regulations*, made under **section 468 of the Insurance Companies Act**, were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations came into effect on **June 1, 1992**, and are designed to **restrict insurance companies from engaging in certain types of securities trading activities in Canada**.

The primary objective is to **protect the integrity of the insurance sector** by preventing insurance companies from becoming active participants in financial markets—particularly those involving risk-taking or speculative activities—that could compromise their stability, solvency, or fiduciary duties to policyholders.

These regulations are formally known as the **Securities Dealing Restrictions (Insurance Companies) Regulations** and apply specifically to **insurance companies** operating in Canada.

---

### **Core Prohibited Activities**

A company (i.e., an insurance company) is **prohibited from dealing in securities** in the following circumstances:

1. **Primary Distribution of Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**
   - The initial offering or sale of shares, ownership interests, or warrants related to a company.

2. **Secondary Market Trading in Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**
   - Buying or selling shares or ownership interests (including warrants) in the secondary market (i.e., after initial issuance).

3. **Primary Distribution of Debt Obligations of a Body Corporate or Warrants Thereof**
   - The first-time issuance of bonds or other debt instruments by a corporation, or warrants linked to such debt.

4. **Acting as a Selling Agent in Connection with the Distribution of Mutual Funds**
   - Serving as a sales agent to promote or distribute mutual fund products to investors.

> ⚠️ This restriction applies broadly, meaning insurance companies cannot engage in these activities even if they are acting on behalf of clients or in a marketing capacity.

### **Exemptions and Permitted Activities**

Despite the broad restrictions, the regulations include **specific exemptions** that allow insurance companies to engage in certain securities-related activities **without violating the rules**.

#### 1. **Dealing for Own Account or for Client Accounts Administered by the Company**
- Insurance companies **may trade securities for their own account** or for accounts they manage (e.g., investment portfolios).
- This includes investment decisions made in the context of asset management or portfolio optimization.

#### 2. **Investment Counselling and Portfolio Management Services**
- Insurance companies are **permitted to provide investment advice and portfolio management services** to clients.
- This includes recommending securities, assessing risk, and managing investment strategies—provided it does not involve direct trading in securities under the prohibited categories.

---

### **Permitted Activities (Specific Exceptions)**

The following types of securities dealings are **explicitly allowed**, even though they fall under the general prohibitions:

#### a) **Government-Backed or Publicly Owned Debt and Equity**
Insurance companies may engage in primary distributions of:
- Debt obligations or warrants related to:
  - The **Government of Canada**, a **province or municipality**, or an **agency thereof**;
  - A **public utility corporation** directly or indirectly owned by a government (as referenced in the above);
  - The **government of a foreign country** or a political subdivision thereof (e.g., a state or city);
  - An **international agency** to which Canada is a member, including:
    - World Bank Group
    - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
    - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
    - Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
    - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
    - Any other international regional development bank

> ✅ These are considered low-risk, government-backed instruments and are generally viewed as safe and stable.

#### b) **Money Market Securities**
- Primary distribution of **money market securities** (e.g., commercial paper, certificates of deposit, short-term debt instruments) is permitted.

#### c) **Debt Obligations of the Company or an Affiliated Entity (Guaranteed by the Company)**
- Insurance companies may distribute debt instruments issued by:
  - The company itself, or
  - An affiliated entity (e.g., a subsidiary or joint venture)
  - **Only if** the debt is guaranteed by the company.

> This allows internal financing or group-level debt issuance under safe, guaranteed conditions.

#### d) **Primary Distribution of Shares or Warrants of the Company**
- The company may issue its own shares or warrants for internal purposes (e.g., capital raising, mergers, restructurings).

#### e) **Unsolicited Secondary Market Trading via Registered Brokers**
- Insurance companies may participate in **unsolicited secondary market trading** (i.e., not initiated by the company) **only if**:
  - The trade is executed through a **registered securities broker** under:
    - A **provincial securities Act**, or
    - The securities laws of another jurisdiction

> This exemption ensures that trades are conducted through regulated, transparent channels and not through unregulated or direct market activity.

#### f) **Selling Agent Role for Mutual Funds in Corporate-Sponsored Pension Plans**
- Insurance companies may act as **selling agents** for mutual funds **only when**:
  - The funds are being sold to **pension plans**, **deferred profit-sharing plans**, **retirement plans**, or similar capital accumulation plans.
  - The sales are **corporate-sponsored** (i.e., tied to employer-sponsored retirement programs).

> This allows insurance companies to serve a legitimate role in retirement plan administration without engaging in general fund distribution.

#### g) **Participation in Selling Groups (Underwriting) for Non-Company Issuers**
- Insurance companies may be part of a **selling group** (i.e., underwriting syndicate) in connection with the issuance of securities by a **body corporate other than the company itself**.

> This enables participation in structured financing or capital-raising efforts by non-affiliated companies, provided it is part of a formal underwriting process.

#### h) **Private Placement of Securities (on a Similar Basis to Underwriting)**
- Insurance companies may engage in **private placements** of securities (e.g., direct sales to a small group of investors) on the same basis as a member of a selling group.

> This allows limited, non-public market access to capital raising activities, particularly for niche or specialized instruments.

#### i) **Primary Distribution of Debt in Syndicated or Consortium Loans**
- Insurance companies may participate in the primary distribution of debt instruments issued in connection with:
  - **Syndicated loans** (where multiple lenders pool funds);
  - **Consortium loans** (joint financing by multiple institutions);
  - **Securitized debt instruments** (e.g., asset-backed securities, loan-backed notes)

> This permits involvement in structured credit markets, which are often used in large-scale corporate or infrastructure financing.

### **Key Principles and Rationale**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | The regulations aim to prevent insurance companies from engaging in speculative or volatile financial activities that could erode capital reserves. |
| **Fiduciary Duty** | Insurance companies have a duty to protect policyholders’ funds. Avoiding direct securities trading reduces exposure to market risk. |
| **Market Distinction** | The rules distinguish between **high-risk speculative trading** and **low-risk, regulated, or government-backed activities**. |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Exempted activities are either directly supervised (e.g., via registered brokers) or involve stable, predictable instruments. |

### **Application and Scope**

- Applies to **all insurance companies** operating in Canada.
- The restrictions apply to **dealing in Canada**—i.e., activities conducted within the Canadian financial system.
- The rules do **not apply** to foreign jurisdictions or cross-border transactions unless they involve Canadian securities.

### **Regulatory Context**

These regulations are part of a broader framework under the **Insurance Companies Act** to ensure that insurance companies remain focused on their core function—providing insurance and risk management services—rather than becoming active participants in financial markets.

They align with international best practices and regulatory standards that emphasize **financial stability**, **consumer protection**, and **prudential oversight** of insurance institutions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Insurance Companies) Regulations* effectively **limit insurance companies from participating in most securities trading activities**, especially those involving equity or debt issuance and secondary market trading. However, they provide **clear, reasonable exemptions** for:
- Government and public utility securities,
- Money market instruments,
- Internal debt and equity issuances,
- Retirement plan-related mutual fund sales,
- Underwriting and private placements,
- Syndicated or securitized debt.

These exemptions balance **prudential risk control** with **operational flexibility**, allowing insurance companies to maintain a role in investment activities while protecting policyholder interests and financial stability.
