### **Detailed Summary of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Republic of Poland (2008)**

This agreement, formalized under **Section 1828 of the Jobs and Economic Growth Act, S.C. 2010, c. 12**, which came into force on **July 12, 2010**, establishes a framework for **cooperative social security arrangements** between **Canada** and the **Republic of Poland**. The agreement ensures that individuals who work, reside, or derive benefits from either country’s social security systems are treated fairly and consistently, particularly when they cross borders or are subject to both systems.

The core objective of the agreement is to **eliminate double taxation, reduce administrative barriers, and ensure reciprocal recognition of benefits**—especially pensions, disability benefits, and work-related compensation—by harmonizing eligibility rules, creditable periods, and benefit calculations across the two jurisdictions.

---

## **III. Reciprocal Rights and Obligations**

### **1. Eligibility and Benefit Rights**
- A person who is or has been subject to the legislation of either country is **eligible for benefits under the other country’s system** under the **same conditions as a citizen of that country**.
- **No reduction, suspension, or cancellation** of benefits solely due to residence in the other country.

> *Exception:* Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to benefits granted under **special procedures or exceptional circumstances** in Poland.

### **2. Residency and Benefit Payment**

### **3. Detached Work (Same Employer)**
- An employed person working in the territory of the other country for the **same or related employer** is treated as if working in their own country’s territory.
- This **"period of detachment" may not exceed 60 months** without **prior consent** from both competent authorities.

> *This provision prevents abuse of temporary assignments to avoid social security obligations.*

### **4. Government Employees**

---

## **V. Creditable Periods and Eligibility Calculations**

### **1. CPP and OASA Creditable Periods (Article 11)**

#### **For OASA (Old Age Security Act)**
- A **creditable period in Poland** is treated as a **period of residence in Canada**.
- This applies to the person and their **spouse or common-law partner and dependants** who live with them and are not subject to Polish legislation due to employment.

#### **For CPP (Canada Pension Plan)**
- A **calendar year with at least 3 months of creditable periods in Poland** is considered a **full creditable year** under CPP.

> *Note:* The 3-month threshold ensures that short stays in Poland do not automatically count toward CPP eligibility.

---

### **2. Creditable Periods in Poland (Based on CPP)**
- A **calendar year** of CPP contributions is considered **12 months of creditable periods** in Poland.
- A **month of CPP contribution** (not part of a CPP creditable year) is considered **one month of creditable time** in Poland.

> *This allows for credit accumulation in Poland to count toward eligibility for Polish pensions.*

---

### **3. Totalization of Creditable Periods**
- If a person does **not meet the minimum requirement** for a benefit due to insufficient creditable periods, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods from both countries
  - Creditable periods from a **third country** with which both parties have social security agreements (totalizing provisions)

> *This enables individuals to build up credit across borders.*

---

### **4. Minimum Threshold for Benefits**
- If total creditable periods under a party’s legislation are **less than one year**, and no right to a benefit exists under that system, the competent institution **is not required to pay** a benefit under this agreement.

> *However*, these periods **are still considered** when assessing eligibility for benefits from the **other party**.

---

### **5. Special Rules for Partial Pensions (Outside Canada)**
- If a person is eligible for a **full pension in Canada** but has not resided in Canada for the minimum required period, they may still qualify under **totalization rules**.

> *The pension is calculated based on the periods of residence in Canada, with adjustments to the flat-rate portion.*

---

## **VI. Benefit Calculation Rules**

### **1. Old Age, Disability, or Survivor’s Pension (Canada to Poland)**
- If entitlement exists under Polish law, the **Polish pension is calculated solely under Polish law**.
- **Exception**: If the **amount calculated under Canadian law is more favorable**, that amount shall be paid instead.

> *This ensures that individuals receive the **higher** benefit possible under either system.*

---

### **2. Totalization for Polish Pension Calculation**
- If entitlement arises only through **totalization**, the Polish institution:
  1. Calculates the **theoretical benefit** as if all creditable periods (from Canada and Poland) were accumulated under Polish law alone.
  2. Then applies a **ratio**:
     - (Creditable periods under Poland) / (Total creditable periods from both countries)
     - This ratio is used to determine the **actual benefit amount**.

> *Only earnings and contributions under Polish law are used to calculate the base amount.*

---

### **3. Insurance Requirement at Time of Contingency (Poland)**
- For a person to qualify for a pension in Poland, they must be **insured at the time of the event** (e.g., retirement, disability).
- This requirement is deemed satisfied if:
  - The person has **at least one year of CPP contributions** during the two calendar years ending with the year of the contingency, **or**
  - The person is receiving a **disability or retirement pension under CPP** in the month the contingency occurs.

> *This allows for recognition of Canadian contributions as valid insurance coverage in Poland.*

---

### **4. Work Accidents and Occupational Diseases**
- Eligibility is determined by the **applicable legislation at the time of the incident**.
- If the disease is first diagnosed in **Canada**, it satisfies the requirement that the disease be diagnosed in Poland.

> *This prevents denial of benefits due to geographic location of diagnosis.*

---

### **5. Recurrence or Worsening of Occupational Disease**
- If a disease **re
