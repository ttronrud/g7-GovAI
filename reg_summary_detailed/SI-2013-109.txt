Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to the Minister of Health**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
- The transfer is authorized by:
  - **Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207).
  - This Act provides the legal framework for the reallocation of government duties and responsibilities between ministers.
- The decision is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.

#### **2. Effective Date**
- The transfer becomes effective on **October 7, 2013**.
- An additional transfer of certain food safety responsibilities occurs **on the day the Safe Food for Canadians Act comes into force** under **section 111** of that Act (S.C. 2012, c. 24).  
  - This date is **not specified in the regulation**, but typically occurs upon Royal Assent and publication in the Canada Gazette, which in this case was **April 26, 2012**, with the Act coming into force on **April 26, 2012**.  
  - However, the regulation refers to the Act's coming into force under s. 111, which is **April 26, 2012** — so the second transfer occurs on that date, not later.

> ⚠️ *Note: There is a potential inconsistency in the text — the regulation states the transfer is effective on October 7, 2013, and then again on the day the Safe Food for Canadians Act comes into force. However, since that Act came into force in April 2012, this may indicate a typographical or interpretive error. The intended meaning is likely that the transfer of food safety powers under the Safe Food for Canadians Act takes effect upon the Act’s coming into force (April 26, 2012), and the broader transfer of duties to Health occurs on October 7, 2013.*

#### **3. Scope of Transfer**

##### **A. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIA Act)**
- All powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** under the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 6) are transferred to the **Minister of Health**, **effective October 7, 2013**.
- **Exception**:  
  - The transfer **excludes** any powers, duties, or functions conferred on the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food under **subsection 4(2)** of the CFIA Act that **do not relate to food safety**.  
  - This means that certain non-food-safety responsibilities (e.g., animal health, plant health, or agricultural standards not tied to food safety) remain with the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

##### **B. Transfer of Food Safety Responsibilities under Other Federal Acts**
- All powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food **relating to food safety** under **any other Act of Parliament** are transferred to the Minister of Health, effective **October 7, 2013**.

##### **C. Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)**
- The **control and supervision** of the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** is transferred to the Minister of Health, effective **October 7, 2013**.

##### **D. Transfer of Powers under the Safe Food for Canadians Act (SFCA)**
- On the day the **Safe Food for Canadians Act** (S.C. 2012, c. 24) comes into force (April 26, 2012), all powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food relating to **food safety** under that Act are transferred to the Minister of Health.

> ✅ This transfer under the SFCA Act is **not contingent on the October 7, 2013 date** and occurs **earlier**, reflecting a legislative shift to strengthen food safety oversight under a dedicated statute.

---

#### **4. Key Implications and Rationale**

- **Centralization of Food Safety Oversight**:  
  The transfer consolidates food safety responsibilities under the **Minister of Health**, aligning with the broader goal of placing food safety under a public health-focused ministry.

- **Enhanced Public Health Protection**:  
  By moving food safety functions to Health Canada, the government aims to improve coordination between food safety and public health responses (e.g., outbreak investigations, foodborne illness prevention, and consumer protection).

- **Streamlined Regulatory Framework**:  
  The transfer removes duplication and potential jurisdictional overlap between agriculture and health sectors in food safety matters.

- **Retention of Non-Food Safety Functions**:  
  The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food retains responsibility for non-food-safety functions such as animal and plant health, which are critical to agricultural production and biodiversity.

- **Legal and Institutional Continuity**:  
  The CFIA continues to operate as the regulatory body, but now under the **Minister of Health’s oversight**, ensuring operational continuity while shifting policy and strategic direction.
