**Detailed Summary of the Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1988**

**Regulatory Source:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (as amended or in force at the time).  
It is formally published as **S.C. 1987, c. 49**, and is known as the **Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1988**.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., exempt from payment) customs duties** on specific goods related to the **development, testing, and manufacturing of satellites and satellite subsystems**. This measure aims to support Canada’s space industry by reducing the financial burden associated with importing critical components and equipment needed for space technology.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies to the following two categories of goods:

1. **Satellites and satellite subsystems for testing**  
   – Includes any satellite or component used solely for testing purposes (e.g., prototype systems, test beds, experimental modules).

2. **Goods for use in the manufacture of satellites and satellite subsystems**  
   – Encompasses components, materials, machinery, tools, software, and other inputs directly used in the production of satellites or their subsystems (such as power systems, communication arrays, guidance systems, etc.).

> Importantly, the remission applies only to goods imported **on or after January 1, 1988**.

### **Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following key conditions:

- A **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue** (the Canadian revenue authority responsible for customs duties) **within three years of the date of importation**.  
- Failure to file a timely claim will result in the **duty being assessed and payable** as if the remission did not apply.

---

### **Legal Basis**  
The Order is grounded in **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff**, which empowers the Minister of Finance to make orders for the remission of duties in the public interest—particularly in cases involving national development, technological advancement, or strategic industries.

This provision allows the government to promote innovation and competitiveness in high-tech sectors such as aerospace and telecommunications by providing fiscal incentives.

---

### **Key Implications and Rationale**  
- **Supports Canada’s space sector**: By reducing import costs, the Order helps Canadian companies and research institutions access essential equipment and components needed for satellite development and testing.
- **Encourages innovation and R&D**: The remission lowers barriers to entry for private and public sector entities engaged in space-related research and development.
- **Fiscal responsibility with targeted relief**: The three-year deadline for claiming ensures that the government does not bear long-term administrative or financial risks, while still providing meaningful support to qualifying imports.

---

### **Important Notes**  
- The Order is **not retroactive**—it only applies to imports made on or after **January 1, 1988**.
- The remission applies only to **customs duties**, not taxes such as GST/HST or other levies (unless otherwise specified).
- The term "satellite subsystems" is interpreted broadly to include all parts that support satellite functions (e.g., thermal control, attitude control, data processing).
- The Order may be subject to future amendments or review based on technological changes or evolving national space policy.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Satellites and Satellite Subsystems Remission Order, 1988* is a targeted, time-limited fiscal policy designed to stimulate Canada’s space technology sector by exempting eligible imports from customs duties. It reflects a strategic government intervention to foster innovation, reduce costs for domestic manufacturers and researchers, and strengthen Canada’s capabilities in space-based technologies—particularly during a period of growing global competition in space exploration and communication.

This Order remains a foundational piece of Canadian regulatory policy in the aerospace and high-tech manufacturing sectors.
