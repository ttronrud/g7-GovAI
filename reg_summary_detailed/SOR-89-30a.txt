### **Detailed Summary of the Employment Equity Programs Exclusion Approval Order (SOR/87-22)**

This regulation, officially titled the **Employment Equity Programs Exclusion Approval Order**, was issued by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and came into effect during the period from **January 1, 1989, to March 31, 1993**. It is a key piece of administrative legislation designed to support and implement **employment equity programs** in the Canadian Public Service by modifying certain provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)* to facilitate the appointment of members of designated "target groups."

---

## **I. Purpose and Background**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **remove barriers** to the appointment of members of underrepresented groups — including women, persons with disabilities, visible minorities, and Aboriginal peoples — into public service positions through targeted employment equity programs. These programs aim to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the federal public service.

The PSC concluded that:
- Applying strict provisions of the PSEA (such as section 10 and subsection 12(3)) to appointments under employment equity programs would be **unrealistic or contrary to the best interests** of the Public Service.
- Special accommodations are needed to ensure that qualified individuals from outside the public service can be hired into training or regular positions under these programs.

Thus, the Order provides **specific exclusions** from certain employment rules during a defined period to allow for more flexible and equitable appointment practices.

---

## **II. Key Provisions and Exclusions Approved**

The Order approves five major exclusions from the *Public Service Employment Act*, each tailored to different aspects of appointment and appeal processes under employment equity programs.

---

### **1. Exclusion of Section 10 and Subsection 12(3) for Positions Identified Under Employment Equity Programs**

> **What it means:**  
The PSC is authorized to **exclude** the application of **section 10** (which governs eligibility for appointment based on qualifications) and **subsection 12(3)** (which requires that appointments be made based on merit and qualifications) to **positions identified under employment equity programs** to which **target group members coming from outside the Public Service** are to be appointed.

> **Scope:**  
- Applies to appointments of **target group members** (disabled persons, visible minorities, Aboriginal peoples, or women) who are **not already in the Public Service**.
- Applies only to positions **identified under specific employment equity programs** (e.g., Northern Careers, Visible Minority, etc.).
- Applies from **January 1, 1989, to March 31, 1993**.

> **Why it matters:**  
This allows the Public Service to hire individuals from outside the service without requiring them to meet the same strict merit-based standards (such as full qualifications or experience) that would normally apply. This supports broader access to the public service for historically marginalized groups.

---

### **2. Exclusion of Subsection 12(1) in Relation to Selection Standards (Except Language Skills) for Training Positions**

> **What it means:**  
For **training positions** identified under employment equity programs, the PSC can **exclude** the application of **subsection 12(1)** — which normally requires that selection be based solely on merit and qualifications — **except for language skills**.

> **Scope:**  
- Applies to **training positions** (e.g., entry-level or developmental roles) where target group members from outside the Public Service are being appointed.
- Excludes selection standards **other than language skills** (e.g., educational background, work experience, performance).
- Does not remove merit entirely — language proficiency remains a required standard.

> **Why it matters:**  
This enables more inclusive hiring in training roles by allowing consideration of factors like personal suitability, potential, or life experience, which may not be fully captured by traditional merit criteria. It recognizes that training positions are developmental and may require a different evaluation framework.

---

### **3. Exclusion of Section 10 and Subsection 12(3) for Appointments to Non-Equity Program Positions**

> **What it means:**  
The PSC may **exclude** section 10 and subsection 12(3) from applying to **positions not identified under employment equity programs**, when appointments are made to **target group members who were previously appointed to the Public Service for a specified period in a training position** under an equity program.

> **Scope:**  
- Applies to individuals who:
  - Were hired into a **training position** under an employment equity program.
  - Completed that training.
  - Were then appointed to a **regular position** outside the scope of the original equity program.
- The exclusion allows these individuals to be appointed to **non-equity positions** without being subject to the same merit and qualification standards.

> **Why it matters:**  
This ensures that individuals who successfully complete training programs and demonstrate capability are not blocked from advancing into regular roles due to rigid merit rules. It supports career progression and retention of talent from equity programs.

---

### **4. Exclusion of Subsection 21(1) – Appeal Rights for Target Group Members**

> **What it means:**  
Persons who would otherwise have had the right to appeal under **subsection 21(1)** of the PSEA (which allows appeals against appointments) **do not have that right** when a target group member is appointed to a position **outside** of an employment equity program after completing a training role under such a program.

> **Scope:**  
- Applies to appointments of **target group members** who:
  - Were appointed to a **training position** under an equity program.
  - Were then appointed to a **non-equity position**.
- The appeal right is **removed** for these individuals.
- The exclusion is limited to appointments to **non-equity positions**.

> **Why it matters:**  
This prevents appeals that could undermine the success of equity initiatives. It promotes stability and confidence in appointments made as part of equity-driven hiring, especially when individuals have already undergone training and demonstrated commitment.

> **Note:** This exclusion is **only for appeals against appointments** to non-equity positions — not for other types of decisions or grievances.

## **III. Revocation of Outdated or Inconsistent Regulations**

The Order includes the **revocation** of several previous regulations that were seen as outdated or inconsistent with current equity goals:

| Regulation Revoked | Reason |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Northern Careers Exclusion of Native Persons Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 1347)** | Removed exclusionary policy that limited hiring of Indigenous persons in Northern careers programs. |
| **Northern Careers Appointments Regulations (C.R.C., c. 1346)** | Revoked as obsolete; the new framework supersedes it. |
| **Exclusion of Certain Provisions of the PSEA for the Visible Minority Employment Program (P.C. 1986-2859)** | The exclusion was no longer justified; it was revoked to align with current equity standards. |
| **Visible Minority Employment Program Regulations (P.C. 1986-2859)** | Fully revoked to eliminate outdated, restrictive policies. |

These revocations reflect a shift toward **inclusive, non-discriminatory hiring practices** and ensure that equity programs are not constrained by outdated or exclusionary rules.

---

## **IV. New Substitution Order – Exclusion of Certain Persons and Positions**

> **What it means:**  
A new **substituting Order** is introduced under subsection 41(1) of the PSEA to formally approve the **exclusion of certain persons and positions** from the operation of specific PSEA provisions during the 1989–1993 period.

> **Scope:**  
- Applies to **target group members** in specific equity programs.
- Covers appointments to both **training and regular positions**.
- Defines who qualifies as a "target group member" and which programs are covered.

> **Purpose:**  
To provide a formal, legally binding mechanism for the exclusion of merit-based rules in specific cases, ensuring clarity and consistency in implementation.

The Order defines the following key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Aboriginal Peoples** | Includes Canadian Status Indians, non-Status Indians, Inuit, and Métis (autochtones) |
| **Disabled Persons** | Individuals who believe or consider themselves disadvantaged due to physical, mental, psychiatric, learning, or sensory impairments |

---

## **VI. Timeline and Duration**

- **Effective Period:** January 1, 1989 – March 31, 1993  
- This was a **limited time frame**, indicating that the policy was a transitional measure to support equity goals during a specific era of reform.

> Note: The Order does **not extend beyond March 31, 1993**, and subsequent equity initiatives would require new legislation or policy updates.
