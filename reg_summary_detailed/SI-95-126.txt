**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister), revokes and replaces a previous Order in Council (P.C. 1992-2436) and establishes new criteria for qualifying service as "special service" under the **Special Service Medal Regulations**. The purpose is to clarify and expand the eligibility for the award of the **Special Service Medal (SSM)** in specific contexts related to service with the **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**.

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

- The regulation is grounded in **sections 2, 4, and 5** of the *Special Service Medal Regulations*.
- Section 2 defines "special service" as service performed by a member of the Canadian Forces that is determined by the Governor in Council to be of a special nature.
- Section 4(4) allows the award of a **Bar** to the Special Service Medal to denote a particular type of special service.
- The Governor General in Council has the authority to determine what constitutes special service and to define the conditions under which such service qualifies.

---

### **2. Revocation of Previous Order**

- The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1992-2436**, dated 26 November 1992, which previously set out the criteria for special service related to NATO operations.
- This revocation is necessary to update and clarify the definition of special service in light of evolving operational realities and service patterns since 1992.

### **3. New Definition of Special Service (Paragraph b)**

The regulation establishes that the following constitutes **special service within the meaning of the Regulations**:

> An aggregate of **180 days of honourable service** performed:
> - Within the **NATO area of responsibility**, defined as:
>   - The territory of any NATO Party in **Europe or North America**;
>   - On the **Algerian Departments of France**;
>   - On the **territory of Turkey**;
>   - On **islands under the jurisdiction of any NATO Party** north of the **Tropic of Cancer**;
>   - Or on **vessels or aircraft** of any NATO Party when:
>     - In or over the above territories;
>     - Or in or over **any other area in Europe** where occupation forces of any NATO Party were stationed;
>     - Or in or over the **Mediterranean Sea** or the **North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer**.

- This period of service must have occurred **from January 1, 1951, to October 19, 2004**.

---

### **4. Key Provision: Inclusion of Uncompleted Service (Despite Paragraph b)**

- A significant and important amendment: **even if a service member has not completed the full 180 days by October 19, 2004**, the **remaining period of service** (i.e., days not yet completed) **can be included** in the calculation of the 180-day aggregate.
- This ensures that service members who began their service before October 19, 2004, but were still serving at that date, are not unfairly excluded due to incomplete service duration.
- This provision promotes fairness and recognition of sustained, ongoing service in NATO operations.

---

### **5. New Definition of Special Service (Paragraph d): Post-October 2004 Service**

- The regulation also determines that:
> An aggregate of **180 days of honourable service**, beginning **on October 20, 2004**, and continuing **as part of, or in direct support of, a NATO operation or mission**, constitutes special service — **provided that**:
> - The service has **not already been acknowledged** by any other honour within the **Canadian Honours System**.

- This provision extends eligibility for the Special Service Medal to service rendered **after October 19, 2004**, as long as:
  - The service is directly connected to a NATO operation or mission;
  - It has not already been recognized through another honour (e.g., a campaign medal, service medal, or other award).

> **Note**: This creates a clear distinction between service before and after 2004, with the post-2004 eligibility being conditional on non-acknowledgment by other honours.

---

### **6. Specification of the Bar Design**

- A **Bar** will be awarded with the Special Service Medal to represent service under the above-mentioned conditions (specifically paragraphs b or d).
- The design of the Bar shall:
  - Feature the **NATO Star**;
  - Be **flanked** (on either side) by the words **“NATO–OTAN”** (the French and Italian names for NATO are both used, with “OTAN” being the French term).

> This visual identifier ensures clear recognition of the nature of the service and distinguishes it from other types of special service bars.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Modernization of Policy**: The regulation modernizes the definition of special service to reflect actual historical and operational service in NATO, especially in Europe and the Mediterranean.
- **Recognition of Long-Term Service**: By allowing partial service to be counted, it ensures that service members who served in the early to mid-2000s are not denied recognition due to incomplete service periods.
- **Continuity of Recognition**: It maintains the Canadian Forces’ commitment to recognizing contributions to international peacekeeping and defense operations, especially within NATO.
- **Avoiding Duplication**: The exclusion of service already recognized by other honours prevents overlap and ensures that the Special Service Medal is used appropriately for unique or exceptional service not covered by other awards.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively:

- Revokes outdated criteria;
- Broadens and clarifies the definition of "special service" in the context of NATO operations;
- Provides a fair mechanism for including incomplete service (pre-2004);
- Extends eligibility to post-2004 NATO service, with safeguards against duplication;
- Introduces a distinctive visual identifier (the NATO Star with “NATO–OTAN”) to represent this type of service.

It reflects a balanced, practical, and equitable approach to recognizing the contributions of Canadian Forces personnel in international operations, particularly within the NATO framework, over a long historical span.
