**Detailed Summary of the NAV CANADA Divestiture Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22)**

---

### **Overview**

The **NAV CANADA Divestiture Regulations**, made under the authority of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA) and the *Financial Administration Act*, implement the transfer of civil air navigation services from the Canadian public service to **NAV CANADA**, a newly incorporated corporation established in 1995. These regulations establish the rules governing how public service employees affected by this transfer are treated under the Public Service Superannuation system, particularly concerning pension rights, service periods, eligibility for benefits, and options to participate in the new employer’s pension plan.

The key event triggering these regulations is the **transfer of civil air navigation services** from the federal government to NAV CANADA, formalized under the **Agreement to Transfer dated April 1, 1996**.

## **Scope and Application**

### **1. Who Are the Regulations Applicable To?**
- **Applicable to individuals** who:
  - Ceased to be employed in the public service **on the transfer date (April 1, 1996)**, and
  - Became employed by **NAV CANADA** as a result of the divestiture.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions**:
> - Individuals who **subsequently re-employ** with NAV CANADA are **not covered** by these regulations.
> - The regulations **do not apply** to those who exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the Act (a provision allowing certain individuals to opt out of the transfer).

---

## **Specific Provisions and Their Implications**

---

### **2. Exemptions and Special Rules for Option Holders**

- **Sections 4 to 13** of the PSSA do **not apply** to individuals who have exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the Act.
- **Sections 12, 13, 13.01, and 16**, and subsections **17(1) and (3)** of the PSSA apply **only to persons on and after the date they cease employment with NAV CANADA**.

---

### **3. Extended Option Periods (Critical Provision)**

Despite the general rule that pension options expire, these regulations **extend eligibility** for certain pension options for individuals who would have otherwise been eligible but for the transfer:

- For **paragraphs 13(7)(a) and (b)** of the PSSA (death benefits or survivor benefits):
  - Option must be exercised **by June 20, 1998**.

- For **subsection 12(3)** and **section 13.01** (pension and survivor benefits):
  - Option must be exercised **by April 1, 1999**.

> 💡 This extension ensures that employees who were affected by the transfer do not lose access to important pension benefits due to timing issues.

---

### **4. Service and Age Calculations for Option Exercise**

When an individual exercises an option under the extended period (subsection 2):

- **Pensionable Service Period** = The pensionable service the person had **on the date they ceased public service employment**.
- **Age of the Person** = Their age on **April 1, 1998** (not the date of transfer or resignation).

> This means that for benefit calculations under sections 12(3), 13(7), and 13.01, the age used is fixed at April 1, 1998, regardless of when the individual actually stopped working.

---

### **5. Valuation Day for Pension Benefit Calculations**

- For purposes of **section 13.01** and sections **83–99 of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**, the **valuation day** is the **date on which the option is exercised**.

> This determines the value of the pension or benefit being calculated.

---

### **6. No Dual Option Rights**

- Once a person exercises an option under subsection (2) (the extended option), they **cannot** also exercise an option under subsection (1) (the original option) when they leave NAV CANADA.

> This prevents overlapping or double benefits.

---

### **7. Death Benefits for Employees Who Die While Employed by NAV CANADA**

- **Surviving spouse and children** are entitled to a **return of contributions** under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA.
- They are also entitled to a **survivor allowance** under subsection 13(3), based on:
  - Paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b) of the Act,
  - Subject to limitations in subsections 12(4) and (5).

> This ensures that dependents receive financial support in the event of the employee's death during employment with NAV CANADA.

---

### **8. Allowance for Children Born or Adopted During Employment Transition**

- A child born to, adopted by, or who becomes a stepchild of the employee **during the period** from the date the employee **ceased public service employment** to the date they **ceased employment with NAV CANADA** is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA**.

> This provides protection for children formed during the transition phase.

---

### **9. One-Year Period for Re-employment or Re-entry**

- The **one-year period** referred to in paragraph 10(5)(a) of the PSSA (e.g., for re-employment or re-entry into service) **begins on the date the person ceases employment with NAV CANADA**, not when they left the public service.

> This aligns the timeline with the employee’s actual transition to NAV CANADA.

---

### **10. Pensionable Service with NAV CANADA**

- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with NAV CANADA that begins on the **transfer date** and ends on the date the person **ceases employment with NAV CANADA**.

> This ensures that time spent working for NAV CANADA is counted toward pension eligibility.

---

### **11. Age at Cessation of Employment**

- For purposes of sections 12 and 13 of the PSSA:
  - The **age of the person** when they cease to be employed in the public service is the **age on the day they cease employment with NAV CANADA**.

> This is distinct from the age on the transfer date and ensures accurate age-based benefit calculations.

---

### **12. Operational Service and Voluntary Cessation**

- For **section 17** of the PSSA (which deals with ceasing to be employed in operational service):
  - "Ceasing otherwise than voluntarily to be employed in operational service" has the **same meaning as in the NAV CANADA pension plan**.
  - However, **ceasing to be employed in the public service due to the divestiture is excluded** from this definition.

> This means that leaving the public service due to the transfer is **not treated as a voluntary or non-voluntary cessation** under the operational service rules — it's a structural change, not a personal resignation.

---

### **13. Pensionable Operational Service Period**

- A period of **operational service that is pensionable** includes:
  - The period from the date a person **ceases to be employed in the public service** to the date they **cease employment with NAV CANADA**.
- This period has the **same meaning as in the NAV CANADA pension plan**.

> This allows employees to count time between leaving the public service and joining NAV CANADA as pensionable service.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:
> - This provision **does not apply** to the determination of operational service for calculating benefits under:
>   - Section 16 (death benefits)
>   - Subsections 17(1) and (2) (pension and retirement benefits)

> So, while the period is counted for some purposes, it is **excluded** from certain benefit calculations.

---

### **14. Election to Join the Supplementary Death Benefit Plan**

- A person who:
  - Is covered by these regulations,
  - Was subject to subsection 51(2) of the PSSA on **November 1, 1996**, and
  - Has **not made an election** to participate in the Supplementary Death Benefit Plan (as defined in
