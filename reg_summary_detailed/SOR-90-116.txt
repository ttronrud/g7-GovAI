**Title of the Order:**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Police Information Retrieval System Fees Order* and may be cited as SI/89-215.

**Effective Date:**

**Core Provision:**  
The Order establishes a **fee structure** that provinces and municipalities must pay to the Receiver General of Canada for the use of the **Police Information Retrieval System (PIRS)** by police forces under their jurisdiction.

**Fee Structure:**  
- A fee of **$450 per year** is payable for **each sworn police officer** in a police force.
- The fee is charged **per sworn officer**, not per police force or per year in a general sense — meaning if a force has 100 sworn officers, the province or municipality must pay $450 × 100 = $45,000 annually.

**Applicable Entities:**  
- The fee applies to **provinces** and **municipalities** that are responsible for a police force.
- Responsibility is determined based on the jurisdictional oversight of the police force — for example, a provincial government that employs and oversees a provincial police force (such as the Ontario Provincial Police) would be liable.

**Use of the System:**  
- The **Police Information Retrieval System (PIRS)** is a federal system owned and maintained by the RCMP.
- It enables police forces to access and retrieve information from a centralized database, including criminal records, warrants, and other law enforcement data.
- The fee is for the **use** of this system by a police force, not for the development or maintenance of the system itself.

**Payment Recipient:**  
- The fee is paid to the **Receiver General for Canada**.  
- The Receiver General acts as the official government account holder and collects fees on behalf of the federal government (specifically, the RCMP, which owns the system).

**Purpose of the Fee:**  
- The fee serves as a **revenue mechanism** to cover the costs associated with operating, maintaining, and providing access to the PIRS.
- It ensures that the federal government (via the RCMP) is fairly compensated for the use of its infrastructure by provincial and municipal police forces.

**Scope and Limitations:**  
- The fee applies only to **sworn police officers** — not to civilian staff, administrative personnel, or non-sworn personnel.
- The fee is **annual**, meaning it must be renewed each year.
- The fee is **not a one-time charge**; it is an ongoing obligation tied to the presence and number of sworn officers in a force.

**Key Implications:**  
1. **Financial Responsibility:** Provinces and municipalities must budget for this fee as part of their law enforcement operational costs.  
2. **Equity and Proportionality:** The fee is structured to be proportional to the size of the police force, ensuring that larger forces pay more in line with their usage.  
3. **Federal-Local Collaboration:** The regulation reflects a shared model of law enforcement infrastructure, where federal agencies provide essential tools, and provincial/municipal governments contribute financially to access and use.  
4. **Administrative Efficiency:** By centralizing access to a national database, the PIRS improves inter-jurisdictional policing and information sharing, and this fee supports that capability.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a clear, transparent, and proportionate fee structure for provincial and municipal police forces to access the RCMP’s Police Information Retrieval System. It ensures sustainable funding for the operation of a critical national law enforcement information system while maintaining accountability and equitable access across jurisdictions. The $450 annual fee per sworn officer remains a foundational element of federal policing infrastructure funding in Canada.
