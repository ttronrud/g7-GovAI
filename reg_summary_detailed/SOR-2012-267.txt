**Detailed Summary of the *Disclosure on Continuance Regulations (Federal Credit Unions)***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Disclosure on Continuance Regulations (Federal Credit Unions)* are a set of rules established under the **Bank Act** of Canada, specifically pursuant to **subsection 35.1(3)a**. These regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, and came into force on **December 19, 2012** (as noted in SI/2012-99), or later, if the regulations were registered after that date.

The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that **members of a local cooperative credit society** (a type of credit union operating under provincial jurisdiction) are fully and transparently informed **before they vote** on a proposal to continue the society as a **federal credit union** under the Bank Act.

This process is critical because transitioning from a provincial to a federal credit union involves significant changes—particularly in **deposit insurance coverage**, which directly affects members’ financial security.

### **Key Provisions and Requirements**

#### **1. Timing and Notice to Members**
- A local cooperative credit society that intends to apply to the Minister for **letters patent** (official approval) to continue as a **federal credit union** must:
  - Send a **pre-vote notice** to **every member** of the society.
  - The notice must be **approved by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions**, in consultation with the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**.
  - The notice must be sent at least **four weeks before** the members vote on a **special resolution** authorizing the application for continuance.

> This ensures members have sufficient time to review the implications of the transition.

#### **2. Notice to New Applicants**
- If a person applies to become a member **after** the notice has been sent to existing members but **before** either:
  - The members vote against the special resolution, or  
  - The Minister issues the letters patent continuing the society as a federal credit union,
  
  then the local cooperative credit society **must provide that new applicant with the same notice** at the time of membership application.

> This ensures that even new members are informed of the key changes in deposit insurance, protecting their rights and financial interests.

#### **3. Mandatory Content of the Notice**
The notice must include **three essential pieces of information**:

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Day on which provincial deposit insurance coverage ends** | Clearly states the date when the current provincial deposit insurance (e.g., provided by a provincial insurer) will terminate. This is a key point of transition. |
| **CDIC coverage during the transitional period** | Describes the deposit insurance protection that will apply **during the transition period** (i.e., between the end of provincial coverage and the full implementation of federal coverage). |
| **CDIC coverage after the transitional period** | Describes the **post-transition CDIC coverage** for deposits and explains **how it differs** from the previous provincial coverage. This includes differences in: <br> • Coverage limits <br> • Insurance terms <br> • Eligibility or types of deposits covered |

> These details are vital for members to understand whether their deposits will be protected, and under what conditions.

---

#### **4. Availability of the Notice Online**
- The notice must be **available via hyperlink** on:
  - The society’s **main website page**
  - Any other website pages that reference **deposit products**

> This ensures digital access for members who use online banking or deposit services.

- The notice must remain available **from four weeks before the vote until**:
  - The day of a **negative vote** (i.e., the members reject the application), or  
  - The **date of continuance** (when the Minister issues letters patent)

> This maintains transparency throughout the decision-making process.

---

#### **5. Physical Display in Branches and Offices**
- The society must **prominently display a sign** in each branch or office where customers are served, containing:
  - A clear reference to the notice
  - Instructions on **how customers can obtain a copy** of the notice

> This ensures that in-person customers are also properly informed, especially those who may not regularly access digital resources.

---

#### **6. Public Publication in Media**
- The notice must be published **once per week** in two media outlets during the four weeks prior to the members’ vote:
  1. The **Canada Gazette** (the official government publication)
  2. A **newspaper with general circulation** in the province or territory where the society conducts business

> This ensures broad public awareness and accountability, particularly among members who may not be active in the society’s operations.

---

#### **7. Availability to Customers in Branches**
- A **physical copy** of the notice must be made available to any customer who is conducting deposit-taking business at a branch during the following period:
  - From **four weeks before the vote** until:
    - The day of a **negative vote**, or  
    - The **date of continuance**

> This ensures direct access for customers during face-to-face interactions.

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** and are designed to ensure **transparency, fairness, and informed consent** in the transition process.
- Non-compliance may result in penalties or administrative action, although specific enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the regulation itself.

### **Effective Date and Legal Status**

- The regulations come into force on:
  - The date that **Section 1911 of the Jobs and Economic Growth Act, Chapter 12 of the Statutes of Canada, 2010**, comes into force, **or**
  - If later, on the day the regulations are **registered** in the Canada Gazette.
