**Detailed Summary of the Pacific Hake Exemption Notice (July 3, 1986)**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Notice is issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada, pursuant to **Section 29 of the Fisheries Act**. Section 29 of the Fisheries Act generally prohibits the taking, possession, or transport of fish without a valid license or permit. However, this Notice serves to **exempt certain Pacific hake** from the restrictions imposed by that section under specific conditions.

**Title and Citation:**  
The Notice is officially titled the **Pacific Hake Exemption Notice** and may be cited as such. It is a formal regulatory instrument designed to provide legal relief or flexibility in the management of Pacific hake fisheries.

**Scope of Exemption:**  
The exemption applies specifically to **Pacific hake** (a species of fish commonly known as *Hake*, scientifically *Merluccius productus* or related species) caught in designated waters within the **Pacific Fishery Management Area (PFMA)**. These waters are defined in the **Pacific Fishery Management Area Regulations** and include the following designated areas:

- Area 121  
- Area 123  
- Area 124  
- Area 125  
- Area 126  

These areas are part of a broader regional fishery management framework established to ensure sustainable fisheries and coordinated management across Canada’s Pacific coast.

**Key Provision:**  
The Minister hereby **exempts Pacific hake caught in the above-mentioned areas** from the operation of **Section 29 of the Fisheries Act**. This means that:

- Individuals or entities engaged in the fishing, harvesting, or possession of Pacific hake in these specific areas are **not subject to the licensing or permit requirements** typically imposed under Section 29.
- The exemption allows for **unrestricted access** to Pacific hake in these waters, provided other applicable regulations (such as catch limits, gear restrictions, or conservation measures) are still observed.

**Purpose and Rationale (Implied):**  
While not explicitly stated in the text, the issuance of such an exemption likely reflects a policy decision to:

- Support the **economic and commercial viability** of Pacific hake fisheries in specific regions.
- Facilitate **cooperative management** between federal, provincial, and Indigenous stakeholders.
- Allow for **flexible, region-specific management** that accounts for local fishing practices, ecosystem conditions, or existing fishery agreements.

**Limitations and Conditions:**  
Although not detailed in the notice itself, such exemptions are typically subject to:

- Compliance with other provisions of the Fisheries Act and associated regulations (e.g., minimum size limits, seasonal closures, or bycatch restrictions).
- Ongoing monitoring and review to ensure sustainability.
- Potential review or revocation if fishery conditions or conservation goals change.

**Effective Date and Jurisdiction:**  
The Notice is effective as of **July 3, 1986**, and applies to all persons, vessels, and activities occurring within the specified Pacific Fishery Management Area zones. It is binding under Canadian federal fisheries law and is enforceable by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

**Conclusion:**  
This Notice represents a targeted regulatory exception that allows for the **free take and possession of Pacific hake** in Areas 121, 123, 124, 125, and 126 of the Pacific Fishery Management Area, without requiring a license under Section 29 of the Fisheries Act. It reflects a balance between promoting fishery access and maintaining the integrity of broader fishery management objectives, though it remains subject to the overarching principles of sustainability and conservation established under Canadian fisheries policy.

**Note:** This exemption is not a blanket removal of all restrictions and is intended to operate within the framework of other applicable regulations. Its long-term validity and continued application would depend on ongoing assessments of fish stocks and management outcomes.
