**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2012-1352 and Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as the Appropriate Minister for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority

**Effective Date:**  
November 4, 2015

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to specific provisions of the *Financial Administration Act*.

---

### **1. Legal Basis**

The regulation is grounded in two key provisions of the *Financial Administration Act* (R.S., c. F-11):

- **Section 2, paragraph (d):** Defines the "appropriate Minister" as the Minister responsible for the administration of a specific federal institution or authority.  
- **Subsection 83(1), subparagraph (a)(ii):** Specifies that the appropriate Minister for a particular federal authority (in this case, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority) is the Minister who has responsibility for the subject matter of the authority’s operations.

This legal framework allows the Governor General in Council to designate or reassign responsibility for a federal institution, ensuring that financial and administrative oversight is properly delegated.

### **2. Key Actions Taken**

#### **A. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2012-1352 (October 9, 2012)**  
- The regulation formally **repeals** (cancels and removes) the prior Order in Council P.C. 2012-1352, which had previously established the appropriate Minister for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority.
- This repeal signifies a change in administrative responsibility, effectively ending the previous designation and making way for a new, updated one.

#### **B. Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as the Appropriate Minister**  
- The **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** is officially designated as the **appropriate Minister** for the **Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority**.
- This designation means that the Minister is now the principal federal official responsible for:
  - Oversight of the Authority’s operations,
  - Financial management,
  - Policy direction,
  - And ensuring compliance with federal financial and administrative rules.

This appointment is formalized through a new designation under the *Financial Administration Act*, which ensures that the Authority’s governance and funding are aligned with the priorities of the Minister responsible for infrastructure and communities.

### **3. Significance and Implications**

- **Administrative Clarity:** The repeal and designation provide a clear, up-to-date structure for accountability and oversight of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, which is a critical international crossing between Canada and the United States.
- **Policy Alignment:** By assigning responsibility to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, the federal government aligns bridge operations with broader infrastructure development and community connectivity goals.
- **Continuity and Stability:** Despite the change in designation, the Authority continues to operate under existing legal and operational frameworks. The change is administrative, not operational.
- **Intergovernmental Cooperation:** The Windsor-Detroit Bridge is a key point of transboundary cooperation. Assigning responsibility to a minister with a focus on intergovernmental affairs supports coordination with U.S. authorities and regional stakeholders.

---

### **4. Context**

- The Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and management of the **Windsor–Detroit International Bridge**, one of the most important international crossings in North America.
- The change in ministerial designation reflects a shift in government priorities, possibly due to reorganization of federal departments or a growing emphasis on infrastructure and regional connectivity.
- The 2012 order had likely been in place during a period of administrative transition. Its repeal and replacement in 2015 indicates a deliberate update to governance arrangements.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively modernizes and clarifies the federal oversight of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority by:

1. **Revoking** an outdated designation,
2. **Establishing** a new, current ministerial responsibility under the *Financial Administration Act*,  
3. **Ensuring** that the Authority is managed by a minister with relevant expertise in infrastructure and intergovernmental relations.

The change enhances accountability, supports strategic planning, and strengthens the federal government’s role in managing key international infrastructure.
