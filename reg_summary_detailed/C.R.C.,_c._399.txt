**Detailed Summary of the *Children of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **Children of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Regulations**.
- It is cited as such and serves to implement the **Children of Deceased Veterans Education Assistance Act (the "Act")**.

---

### **2. Purpose and Scope**
These regulations establish the rules governing how financial assistance is provided to children of deceased veterans under the Act. The assistance covers eligible educational costs and is administered on a monthly basis during the academic year in which the student is enrolled.

---

### **3. Monthly Allowance and Payment Schedule**
- An allowance is **computed and paid monthly** during the academic year in which the student is enrolled.
- Payments continue **until the end of the week** in which the student’s final examination for that academic year is held.
- This ensures that financial support aligns with the academic calendar and ends when the student completes their course of study.

---

### **4. Adjustment of Allowance Amounts**
When the monthly allowance under the Act is adjusted annually (as mandated by **Section 9 of the Act**):

#### **(a) Adjustment of the Product**
- The new monthly allowance amount is calculated by multiplying:
  - The base amount (as specified in paragraph 4(1)(a) of the Act),  
  - By a specified ratio (as in paragraph 4(1)(b) of the Act).
- The resulting product must be:
  - **Rounded to the nearest cent** (i.e., two decimal places).
  - Rounded according to the following rule:
    - If the **third digit** (hundredths place) of the fractional part is **less than 5**, drop all digits after the second decimal place.
    - If the **third digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **second digit** (the cent amount) by 1, then drop all digits after the second decimal place.

> *Example*:  
> If the product is $419.876 → third digit is 7 (≥5), so round up: $419.88  
> If the product is $419.842 → third digit is 4 (<5), so round down: $419.84

#### **(b) Expression of the Quotient (Ratio)**
- The ratio (from Section 9(1)(b)) must be expressed as a **decimal fraction**.
- If the ratio results in a fraction **less than one**, it must be:
  - Expressed to **four decimal places**.
  - Rounded using the following rule:
    - If the **fourth digit** after the decimal is **less than 5**, leave the third digit unchanged and drop the fourth digit.
    - If the **fourth digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **third digit** by 1 and drop the fourth digit.

> *Example*:  
> Ratio = 0.99942 → fourth digit is 4 (<5), so result = 0.9994  
> Ratio = 0.99957 → fourth digit is 5 (≥5), so increase third digit: 0.999 → becomes 0.9996

### **5. Eligible Educational Costs Covered**

### **6. Maximum Annual Limit on Costs**
- The total amount of education or instruction costs that may be paid under the Act **in any 12-month period** is capped at **$4,198.18**.

  - At **times and under conditions** set by the **Minister**, in consultation with the educational institution.

An allowance may be **terminated** under the following circumstances:
- The student **fails to comply** with the rules and regulations of the educational institution.
- The **head of the institution** and the **Minister** determine that the student’s **progress or standard of achievement is unsatisfactory**.

> *Implication*: The allowance is not a blanket entitlement; it is subject to academic and behavioral standards.

---

### **9. Special Provision: Maximum Cap Before Amending Regulation (Historical Context)**
> **Important Exception for Periodic Limitation**  
For any academic year that falls **in whole or in part** within the period from **September 1, 2003, to the date the amending regulation comes into force**, the maximum amount of education or instruction costs payable under the Act is **$4,000**, **even if the regular cap of $4,198.18 applies**.

> *Note*: This provision is **not a permanent cap**. It is a temporary measure that applies only during the transition period before the full $4,198.18 cap is implemented.

- This clause ensures **financial stability and predictability** during the transition from the older $4,000 limit to the updated $4,198.18 cap.
- It **takes precedence over** paragraph 5(3)(a) during this specific timeframe.

---

### **10. Definition of "Amending Regulation"**
- "Amending regulation" refers to the **first regulation** that amends **paragraph 5(3)(a)** of these regulations after the Act is officially assented to (i.e., comes into force).
- This definition is used to define the **effective date** of the transition from $4,000 to $4,198.18.
