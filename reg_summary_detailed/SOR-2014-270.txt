**Categories of Goods Covered**:
| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goods for Display** | Including display apparatus (e.g., banners, signage, exhibits). Must be used exclusively in connection with the Games. |
| **Equipment** | Equipment needed for the Games (e.g., sports gear, medical supplies). Must be used exclusively for Games-related activities. |

> *Example*: If goods are imported valued at $10,000 and stay in Canada for 3 months, the tax remitted is calculated as:
> - Total tax owed – (1/60 × $10,000 × 3 months) = $10,000 × (1 – 0.5) = $5,000 (hypothetical)
