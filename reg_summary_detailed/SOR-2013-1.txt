## **1. Purpose of the Permit**
This permit authorizes **residents of Canada** to export or transfer specific **cryptography-related goods and technologies** to certain consignees under defined conditions.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Controlled** | Means actual control—whether direct (e.g., ownership of securities) or indirect (e.g., through trusts, agreements, or ownership of corporations). Control is determined by "control in fact," not just legal ownership. |
| **Designated Country** | A list of 30 countries including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. |
| **Entity** | Includes corporations, trusts, partnerships, funds, or unincorporated associations or organizations. |
| **Export Controls Division (ECD)** | The division within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade responsible for administering export controls. |
| **Government of a Foreign Country** | Includes: (1) any political subdivision of a foreign government; (2) any agency or agent of such a government; (3) any entity controlled by such a government or its subdivisions. |
| **Guide** | Refers to the *Export Control List* under section 1, which categorizes goods and technologies subject to export controls. |
| **Ineligible Destination** | Countries banned from receiving such exports due to human rights, proliferation, or security concerns. These include: Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, DPRK, Eritrea, Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe. |

> **Note:** Terms like *development, information security, production, software, and use* are defined consistently with the *Guide* under "Definitions of Terms Used in Groups 1 and 2."

## **3. Who Can Export Under This Permit?**

Any **resident of Canada** may export or transfer eligible goods or technologies **if** the recipient (consignee) meets one of the following two conditions:

### **Condition A: Consignee is Controlled by a Canadian Resident**
- The consignee is directly or indirectly controlled by a Canadian resident (individual or entity).

### **Condition B: Consignee is Controlled by an Entity Based in a Designated Country**
- The consignee is controlled by an entity that:
  - Has its **head office in a designated country**, and  
  - Controls the **Canadian resident** making the export.

> This means that even if the recipient is outside Canada, it may still qualify if it is under the control of a Canadian entity and is headquartered in a designated country.
