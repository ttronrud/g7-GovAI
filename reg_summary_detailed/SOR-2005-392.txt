**Detailed Summary of the Stainless Steel Round Wire Products Anti-Dumping Duty Remission Order**  
*Issued under S.C. 1997, c. 36*  
*Pursuant to Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance*

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **remission (i.e., reduction or waiver) of anti-dumping duties** for certain **stainless steel round wire products** imported into Canada, specifically for those duties paid or payable under the *Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)* after **April 2, 2004**. The remission applies only to the portion of anti-dumping duties that exceed **35% of the export price** of the products, as defined under subsection 2(1) of the SIMA.

The Order is designed to provide relief to importers who have paid anti-dumping duties on these products, but where the duty amount exceeds a specified threshold—35% of the export price—by offering a partial refund or remission of that excess.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Agency**  
   Refers to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**, which is responsible for administering and enforcing customs regulations, including the implementation and oversight of this remission order.

2. **Stainless Steel Round Wire Products**  
   This category includes two specific types of products:
   - **Stainless steel belting wire** used in the production of **conveyor belts**.
   - **Stainless steel wire line** used in the **oil and gas industry** for:
     - Running specialized tools into and out of oil and gas wells,
     - Opening up oil/gas zones or wells,
     - Conducting logging operations,
     - Performing regular pressure- and temperature-type work.

These products are subject to anti-dumping duties due to concerns about unfair pricing from foreign producers.

---

### **Core Provision: Remission of Excess Anti-Dumping Duties**

- **Remission is granted** for any portion of anti-dumping duties **paid or payable** under the *Special Import Measures Act* **on or after April 2, 2004**, **in excess of 35% of the export price** of the stainless steel round wire products.

> ⚠️ *Important Note*: The remission applies only to the **excess** above 35%. If the duty paid is equal to or below 35% of the export price, no remission is granted.

---

### **Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission, importers must meet the following conditions:

#### **(a) Timely Claim Submission**
- An importer must **submit a claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP)** within **two years** of the date when the stainless steel round wire products were "accounted for" under **Section 32 of the Customs Act**.

> *Note*: "Accounted for" means the products are officially recorded in the customs system as having entered Canada.

#### **(b) Submission of Required Evidence**
- Upon **request by the CBSA**, the importer must **file with the Agency** the evidence necessary for the CBSA to determine whether the importer is eligible for remission.

> This ensures transparency and verification of the claim.

#### **(c) Agreement to Audit**
- The importer **agrees to be subject to audit** by the CBSA at any time—**including after remission has been granted**—to verify:
  - Whether the information provided under (a) or (b) is **accurate and complete**, and
  - Whether the **facts relied upon** in determining eligibility have **remained unchanged in all material respects**.

> This condition ensures accountability and integrity in the remission process.

#### **(d) CBSA’s Audit Conclusion**
- At the time the CBSA conducts an audit under (c), it must be able to **conclude** that:
  - The information supplied by the importer is accurate and complete, and
  - The underlying facts remain unchanged in all material respects.

> This requirement ensures that remission is only granted when the eligibility criteria are fully substantiated.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (typically the Governor in Council or through official publication in the Canada Gazette).

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

- The remission is intended to:
  - Provide **economic relief** to Canadian importers who have overpaid anti-dumping duties on stainless steel round wire products.
  - Recognize that **35% of the export price** is a reasonable threshold, and any duty above this may be considered excessive or unjustified.
  - Balance **protection of domestic industries** with **fairness to importers** who may have paid more than the legally justified amount.
- It reflects a **targeted policy** to correct over-duties without eliminating the anti-dumping framework entirely.

---

### **Key Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No remission applies** to duties equal to or below 35% of the export price.
- Applies **only to imports on or after April 2, 2004**.
- The remission is **not automatic**; it requires a formal claim and verification.
- The **two-year deadline** for filing a claim is strict and cannot be extended.
- Importers are **not immune from audit** even after remission is granted.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** has primary responsibility for:
  - Receiving claims,
  - Requesting supporting documentation,
  - Conducting audits,
  - Verifying eligibility,
  - Ensuring compliance.

- The audit process serves as a **safeguard** against fraudulent or inaccurate claims.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, conditional remission** mechanism designed to correct overpayment of anti-dumping duties on specific stainless steel round wire products. It provides relief only when duties exceed 35% of the export price, and only if the importer meets strict procedural and evidentiary requirements, including timely claims, submission of documentation, and agreement to future audits.

It reflects a balanced approach to trade policy—protecting domestic industries while ensuring fairness and accountability in the application of anti-dumping measures.
