### **Detailed Summary of the Pas Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**
These regulations are formally adopted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:
- **Section 5.5**: Requires publication of proposed regulations in official gazettes and local newspapers to allow public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt the proposed regulations.

The proposed regulations were published in:
- Two successive issues of the **Canada Gazette, Part I**, on **March 20 and 27, 1993**.
- Two successive issues of the **Opasqula Times** (local newspaper) on **March 24 and 26, 1993**.

This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, landowners, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

---

#### **2. Regulation Title and Scope**
- **Title**: *The Pas Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all land — including public road allowances — that is **adjacent to or in the vicinity of The Pas Airport**, as precisely defined in **Part VI of the schedule**.

The regulations establish **zoning restrictions** to ensure safe aviation operations by limiting structures and natural growth near the airport.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to The Pas Airport, located near The Pas, Manitoba. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport's centerline used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Located on the centerline of Runway 12–30, 964 meters northwesterly from the threshold of Runway 30. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | **266.9 meters above sea level** — serves as the baseline for all elevation-based restrictions. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip. Designed to ensure aircraft have a clear visual and physical path during landing and takeoff. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground — in which case, it is set at **9 meters above ground level**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing surface associated with Runway 12–30, including the runway itself. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), until they intersect with the outer surface. |

#### **4. Core Prohibitions and Restrictions**

##### **(a) Height Restrictions on Buildings, Structures, and Objects**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or build any new structure, building, or object;
- Add any extension or modification to an existing structure;

**on any land subject to these regulations**, if the **highest point** of such structure or object **exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
- The **approach surfaces**;
- The **outer surface**;
- The **transitional surfaces**.

> This ensures that no obstruction — whether man-made or natural — interferes with aircraft visibility during takeoff, landing, or approach.

##### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses) on regulated land grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the:
- Owner or lessee of the land to **remove** the excessive growth.

> This provision protects against bird attraction and visual obstruction caused by overgrown plants.

##### **(c) Prohibition on Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**
No owner or lessee may:
- Allow any part of the regulated land to be used for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** by birds; or
  - **Attractive** to birds.

> This is a key measure to reduce bird strikes, which pose a serious safety risk to aircraft.

#### **5. Spatial Descriptions (Based on The Pas Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2865, dated September 19, 1990)**

##### **(a) Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located on the centerline of Runway 12–30.
- 964 meters **northwesterly** from the threshold of Runway 30.
- Elevation: **266.9 m above sea level**.

##### **(b) Approach Surfaces (Runway 12 and 30)**
Each approach surface is an inclined plane:
- **Slope**: 1 meter vertically to 40 meters horizontally (1:40 slope).
- **Rises to an imaginary horizontal line**:
  - 3,000 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.
  - 600 meters from the runway centerline on either side.
  - At an elevation of **75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**.
- Applies to both Runway 12 and Runway 30.

> These surfaces define the maximum allowable height for any object during aircraft approach and departure.

##### **(c) Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 266.9 + 45 = 311.9 m).
- **Exception**: If this would place the outer surface below **9 meters above ground**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground**.
- This surface defines the outer boundary of the regulated zone in terms of height.

##### **(d) Strip (Runway 12–30)**
- **Length**: 2,048 meters.
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline).
- Includes the runway and its associated landing area.

##### **(e) Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of the strip and its approach surfaces.
- Rise until they meet the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces provide a gradual transition from the runway edge to the outer boundary of the regulated zone.

#### **6. Boundary of Regulated Land (Outer Boundary)**

The outer boundary of all land subject to the regulations is defined by a detailed, geometric description based on **section boundaries, road allowances, and a circular boundary**:

1. **Starts at**: Northeast corner of Section 36, Township 57, Range 25, West of the Principal Meridian.
2. Proceeds:
   - South along easterly limits of Sections 36 and 25 to southeast corner of SE Quarter of Section 25.
   - West along southerly limit of SE Quarter of Section 25 to SW corner.
   - South across road allowance to easterly limit of NW Quarter of Section 24.
   - West to SE corner of NW Quarter of Section 24.
   - South to SE corner of SE Quarter of Section 23.
   - West along southerly limits of Sections 23, 22, 21 and across road allowances to SW corner of SW Quarter of Section 21.
   - North along westerly limit of SW Quarter of Section 21 to NW corner.
   - West across road allowance to southerly limit of NE Quarter of Section 20.
   - North to SE corner of SW Quarter of Section 29.
   - West along southerly limit of SW Quarter of Section 29 to SW corner.
   - North along westerly limits of Section 29 and Fractional Section 32 to intersection with **ordinary high water mark of Clearwater Lake**.
   - West along the **ordinary high water mark of Clearwater Lake** to intersection with a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered on the ARP.
   - Then follows the **circumference of the circle clockwise** until it intersects the high water mark again on the **northerly limit of Fractional Section 1, Township 58, Range 25**.
   - East along the high water mark to intersection with easterly limit of Fractional Section 1.
   - South along easterly limit of Fractional Section 1 and across road allowance back to the **point of commencement**.

> This boundary creates a **large, irregular zone** that includes surrounding rural and agricultural land, with a **circular buffer (4,000 meters radius)** centered on the ARP to ensure safety in all directions.

#### **7. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing visual and physical obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To **minimize bird strike risks** by prohibiting the disposal of food or attractive waste near the airport.
- To **provide clear, enforceable spatial boundaries** for land use near the airport, based on technical aviation standards.
- To **balance development needs** with safety requirements, particularly in a rural area like The Pas, Manitoba.
