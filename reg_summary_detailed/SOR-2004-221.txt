**Detailed Summary of the United Nations Iraq Regulations**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The *United Nations Iraq Regulations* are a Canadian legislative instrument enacted under **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**, pursuant to a recommendation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and approved by the Governor in Council. These regulations implement and operationalize key United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions—specifically **Resolutions 1483 (2003), 1511 (2003), 1518 (2003), and 1546 (2004)**—which were adopted in response to the post-invasion political and economic situation in Iraq following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **enable Canada to enforce UN-imposed measures** related to:
- The freezing of assets belonging to the former Iraqi government and its affiliated entities,
- Restrictions on trade and financial dealings with certain individuals and entities,
- Prohibitions on the export of arms to Iraq,
- The protection of humanitarian assistance and the management of the Development Fund for Iraq.

These regulations are not merely symbolic; they establish enforceable legal obligations within Canadian law that align with international obligations under the UN Charter, particularly **Article 41**, which empowers the Security Council to take action in cases of threats to international peace and security.

### **Core Provisions and Legal Effects**

#### **1. Protection of Iraqi Petroleum and Development Fund Assets**

> *No legal proceeding, attachment, garnishment, or execution shall lie against:*
> - Petroleum, petroleum products, or natural gas originating in Iraq **until title passes to an initial purchaser**;
> - The **proceeds or obligations** from the initial sale of such resources; or
> - The **Development Fund for Iraq (DFI)**, including its property wherever located.

**Purpose**: This provision ensures that the assets of Iraq (especially oil revenues) are not subject to Canadian legal claims or enforcement actions until they are properly transferred to legitimate buyers. It prevents Canadian courts from seizing or enforcing judgments against Iraq’s hydrocarbon revenues, which are critical to the country’s post-war recovery.

**Exceptions**:
- **Contractual obligations after June 28, 2004**: The exemption does **not apply** to enforcement of final judgments arising from contracts entered into *after* June 28, 2004, by the Iraqi government or its subdivisions.
- **Ecological damage claims**: Recourse to proceeds from petroleum sales may be allowed if needed to satisfy liability for ecological harm (e.g., oil spills) occurring *after May 22, 2003*.

> **Effect**: This creates a strong legal shield around Iraq’s energy revenues and ensures compliance with international financial accountability standards.

#### **2. Prohibition on Export of Arms and Related Material**

> *No person in Canada or a Canadian outside Canada shall knowingly export, sell, supply, or send arms and related material to Iraq unless required by:*
> - The Government of Iraq, or  
> - A multinational force operating under unified command,  
> *to serve the purposes of Resolution 1546 (2004).*

**Purpose**: This restricts the flow of weapons into Iraq to only those strictly necessary for international peacekeeping or security operations authorized by the UN. It prevents the proliferation of military equipment that could destabilize the region.

**Key Notes**:
- The restriction applies to **all Canadians**, regardless of location.
- Only **authorized military needs** under Resolution 1546 (which supports the stabilization of Iraq through international forces) justify arms exports.
- This aligns with the broader UN goal of preventing Iraq from rearming or re-establishing a military capable of regional aggression.

#### **3. Prohibition on Financial Transactions with Former Iraqi Entities**

> *No person in Canada or Canadian outside Canada shall knowingly:*
> - Deal directly or indirectly in property in Canada that was:
>   - Owned on May 22, 2003, by the **previous Government of Iraq** or any **public entity identified by the Committee**, or  
>   - Owned or controlled by or held on behalf of any **individual or entity identified by the Committee**;
> - Enter into or facilitate any financial transaction related to such property; or
> - Provide financial or other services in respect of such property.

**Scope**:
- Covers **all property** (real, personal, financial) owned or controlled by the former Iraqi government or entities listed by the Committee.
- Applies to both **direct transactions** and **indirect facilitation** (e.g., through intermediaries or shell companies).

**Exceptions**:
- **Government actions**: The prohibition does **not apply** if the transaction is carried out by:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada, in compliance with Resolutions 1483, 1511, or 1518; or
  - A person complying with subsection 7(3) (a specific exemption).
- **Diplomatic missions**: The property of **Iraqi diplomatic missions and consular posts** in Canada is **exempt** from this prohibition.

> **Effect**: This effectively freezes the financial assets of the former Iraqi regime and its key affiliated entities, preventing them from engaging in commerce or financial activity in Canada.

#### **4. Humanitarian Exceptions**

> Section 5 allows for **exemptions** for humanitarian activities, including:
> - The United Nations (including its programs, funds, agencies, and specialized bodies);
> - International organizations;
> - Humanitarian organizations with UN observer status;
> - Bilaterally or multilaterally funded NGOs participating in UN humanitarian response plans or refugee appeals;
> - Any other person authorized by a Security Council committee acting within its mandate.

**Purpose**: To ensure that humanitarian aid—such as food, medical supplies, shelter, and emergency relief—can flow freely to Iraq without being blocked by the financial restrictions.

**Key elements**:
- Funds, financial assets, goods, and services required for humanitarian delivery are **not prohibited**.
- Includes employees, grantees, subsidiaries, and implementing partners of these organizations.
- Provides a clear pathway for international humanitarian actors to operate without legal risk.

> **Effect**: Balances strict financial controls with essential humanitarian needs.

#### **5. Prohibition on Facilitation of Prohibited Activities**

> *It is prohibited for any person in Canada or any Canadian outside Canada to knowingly:*
> - Cause, facilitate, assist in, or intend to cause or assist in any activity prohibited under Sections 4 or 5.

**Purpose**: Prevents **indirect or passive involvement** in prohibited transactions (e.g., providing banking services, advice, or financial infrastructure) that could enable illicit financial flows.

> **Effect**: Broadens the scope of liability to include not just direct actors but those who enable or support prohibited activities.
