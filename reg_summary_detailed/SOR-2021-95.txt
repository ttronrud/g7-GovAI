**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Critical Habitat of the Copper Redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, which provides a legal framework for the protection and recovery of wildlife species at risk. The regulation specifically addresses the **critical habitat** of the **Copper Redhorse (*Moxostoma hubbsi*)**, a fish species listed as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA**.

---

### **2. Key Legal Provisions Involved**

- **Section 58(1) of SARA**:  
  Requires that the critical habitat of a listed species be identified and protected. This provision applies to the critical habitat of the Copper Redhorse, as determined by the recovery strategy.

- **Section 58(2)(b)** of SARA:  
  Excludes certain areas from being designated as critical habitat if they are located within a **designated wildlife area** under the *Wildlife Areas Regulations* (specifically, a national wildlife area). This exclusion is based on the principle that such areas are already protected and managed by federal agencies.

- **Section 58(5) of SARA**:  
  Mandates that any portion of critical habitat located within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) must be **excluded** from the official designation of critical habitat in a regulatory order.

- **Section 58(4) of SARA**:  
  Grants the Ministers of the Environment and Fisheries and Oceans the authority to **issue orders** defining the critical habitat of a species, subject to the exclusions required by law.

### **3. Purpose of the Order**

The purpose of this **Critical Habitat of the Copper Redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) Order** is to:

- Officially designate the **critical habitat** of the endangered Copper Redhorse species, as identified in its recovery strategy.
- **Exclude** a specific portion of that critical habitat — located within the **îles de Contrecœur National Wildlife Area** — from the formal designation, in accordance with legal requirements.

This exclusion ensures that the designation of critical habitat does not conflict with existing federal land management and protection obligations under the *Wildlife Areas Regulations*.

---

### **4. Scope of the Designation**

- The critical habitat of the Copper Redhorse is **defined in the recovery strategy** for the species, which is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**.
- The Order applies to **all parts of the critical habitat** of the species **except** the portion located within the **îles de Contrecœur National Wildlife Area**.
- The excluded area is specifically identified in **item 2 of Part III of Schedule I to the Wildlife Areas Regulations**.

This exclusion is legally required under **section 58(5)** of SARA and ensures compliance with the Act’s provisions on land use and management.

---

### **5. Legal Authority and Issuance**

The Order is issued by:

- The **Minister of the Environment** (responsible for Parks Canada Agency)
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**

Together, they exercise their statutory authority under **sections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA to define and modify the critical habitat designation for the Copper Redhorse.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette or official registration).
- The effective date is not specified in the text, but it is implied to be the date of registration, which occurred in **April 30, 2021 (Gatineau)** and **May 5, 2021 (Ottawa)** — likely indicating the dates of issuance and official approval.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- **Conservation Protection**: The designation of critical habitat ensures that the areas essential for the survival and recovery of the Copper Redhorse are recognized and protected from harmful activities.
- **Compliance with SARA**: The exclusion of the îles de Contrecœur area ensures that the Order respects existing federal land management frameworks and avoids duplication or conflict with the protection provided by the national wildlife area.
- **Ecological Management**: This regulation supports the broader recovery strategy for the Copper Redhorse by identifying key ecological areas that must be conserved, while also acknowledging the administrative and management realities of protected areas.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding instrument under the Species at Risk Act that:

- Confirms the critical habitat of the endangered Copper Redhorse;
- Excludes a specific portion (in the îles de Contrecœur National Wildlife Area) from the designation due to its status as a federally protected wildlife area;
- Ensures compliance with SARA’s requirements for critical habitat designation and exclusion;
- Supports the long-term recovery and conservation of the species through targeted habitat protection.

It reflects a balanced approach to conservation — protecting essential ecological areas while respecting existing land-use and management designations.

**Final Note**: This Order is part of a broader effort to implement SARA’s recovery framework for endangered species, emphasizing both scientific rigor and administrative feasibility in the protection of biodiversity.
