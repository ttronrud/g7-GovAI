**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

On the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, His Excellency the Governor General in Council has formally **renamed the Canadian Armed Forces' Naval Jack to the Canadian Naval Ensign**. This change reflects a formalization and modernization of the naval symbol used by the Canadian Forces, aligning it with the broader naming conventions of Canadian military insignia.

### Description of the Canadian Naval Ensign:

The Canadian Naval Ensign is described in heraldic terms as follows:

- **Field**: Argent (silver or white)  
- **Central Emblem**: A fouled anchor (an anchor that is partially submerged or "fouled," symbolizing the maritime nature and the readiness of the navy to respond)  
- **Above the Anchor**: An eagle volant (flying eagle), positioned head to the sinister (i.e., to the left when viewed from the viewer's perspective)  
- **Surrounding Elements**: The entire emblem is encircled by a **naval coronet**, which is Azure (blue) in color.  
- **Canton**: The upper left corner (canton) of the ensign features the **National Flag of Canada**, which serves as a symbolic connection to the nation and its sovereignty.

This design is rooted in traditional naval heraldry and incorporates key national and maritime symbols:

- The **fouled anchor** signifies the naval branch’s role in maritime operations and readiness.
- The **flying eagle** represents strength, vigilance, and the power of the Canadian navy.
- The **naval coronet** is a traditional symbol of naval authority and rank, distinguishing naval insignia from other branches.
- The **canton of the Canadian flag** affirms the naval force’s allegiance to the nation and its identity within the Canadian Armed Forces.

### Official Approval and Implementation:

The Governor General in Council has **formally approved** the Canadian Naval Ensign for official use by the Canadian Armed Forces. This approval is contingent upon the direction of the **Minister of National Defence** or a delegate authorized by the Minister.

This means that:

- The new name and design are now legally recognized within the Canadian military structure.
- The use of the Canadian Naval Ensign is governed by the discretion of the Minister of National Defence or their designated representative.
- The ensign may be displayed in official naval contexts, such as on ships, in military installations, and during ceremonial events.

### Significance of the Change:

- **Symbolic Evolution**: The renaming from "Naval Jack" to "Naval Ensign" reflects a shift in terminology that aligns with standard military nomenclature. The term "ensign" is more commonly used in formal military and diplomatic contexts and denotes a national or branch-specific flag.
- **National Identity and Unity**: The inclusion of the Canadian national flag in the canton reinforces the unity between the navy and the nation, emphasizing that the Canadian Navy operates as a vital component of Canada’s national defense.
- **Professionalism and Tradition**: The updated design honors both maritime heritage and modern military standards, enhancing the professionalism and visual identity of the Canadian Navy.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes the official designation and design of the Canadian Naval Ensign, replacing the previous term "Naval Jack." It is a formal and symbolic step in recognizing the Canadian Navy’s distinct identity while maintaining its connection to the broader Canadian Armed Forces and national pride. The ensign is now to be used in accordance with the directives of the Minister of National Defence, ensuring consistency, authority, and national cohesion in the display of Canadian naval emblems.
