**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Rules of Practice Respecting Reduction in the Number of Years of Imprisonment Without Eligibility for Parole**

---

### **Overview**

These rules, established by the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta under **subsection 672(5) of the Criminal Code**, govern the procedural framework for applications seeking a **reduction in the number of years of imprisonment** for individuals who are serving a sentence **without eligibility for parole**. The rules were enacted on **November 28, 1988**, and are formally cited as:

> *The Alberta Rules of Practice Respecting Reduction in the Number of Years of Imprisonment Without Eligibility for Parole.*

They provide a structured, fair, and transparent process for individuals in custody to apply for a reduction in their sentence — a mechanism that allows for judicial review of the fairness, appropriateness, or proportionality of a sentence, particularly in cases where the offender has served time without the possibility of parole.

### **Key Definitions**

The rules define several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Applicant** | A person making the application; includes counsel acting on their behalf. |
| **Application** | A formal request made under **section 672(1)** of the Criminal Code. |
| **Attorney General** | Refers to the Attorney General of Alberta, including counsel acting for the AG. |
| **Chief Justice** | The head of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta. |
| **Clerk** | The clerk of the Court of Queen’s Bench for the judicial district where the original sentence was imposed. |
| **Judge** | The judge designated by the Chief Justice to empanel a jury and conduct the hearing. |

> *Note: The rules reflect a jury-based process, which is a significant feature — distinguishing this from standard sentencing reviews.*

---

### **Filing and Service of the Application**

- The application must be **filed with the clerk** of the Court of Queen’s Bench in the relevant judicial district.
- The applicant is responsible for **serving the application** on three parties:
  1. The **Attorney General of Alberta**
  2. The **Solicitor General of Canada**
  3. The **officer in charge** of the institution where the applicant is detained.

> **Service Method**:  
> - Must be by **registered mail**.  
> - Service is deemed complete on the **tenth day after mailing**.

> **Proof of Service**:  
> - Can be established by filing an **affidavit** of service with the clerk.  
> - Alternatively, any other method acceptable to the clerk may be accepted.

> **Note**: The Solicitor General of Canada and the institution officer are **not parties** to the application and do not have standing to participate in the proceedings.

---

### **Clerk’s Role and Forwarding to the Judge**

- Upon receiving proof of service, the **clerk** delivers both the application and proof of service to the **Chief Justice**.
- The Chief Justice then forwards the materials to the **judge** designated to conduct the hearing.

---

### **Dismissal of an Application**

- The **judge** may dismiss the application **on their own initiative or upon request by the Attorney General** if they determine that **section 672(1) of the Criminal Code does not apply** to the applicant.
- This is a critical safeguard to ensure only eligible individuals proceed to the hearing.

---

### **Hearing Procedures and Judicial Directions**

The judge has broad authority to manage the hearing and may make various orders, including:

#### 1. **Order Requiring the Attorney General to Provide Evidence Outline**
- The judge may require the Attorney General to file a **general outline of the evidence** they intend to present.
- This promotes transparency and helps the applicant prepare an effective response.

#### 2. **Permitting Proof by Affidavit**
- The judge may allow **affidavits** as evidence.
- If such an affidavit is admitted, the judge may, **on further application**, require the **deponent (affidavit author)** to attend the hearing for **cross-examination**.

#### 3. **Requiring the Applicant to Be Brought Before Court**
- The judge may order that the applicant be **brought before the court** — typically for appearance or to ensure compliance with procedural requirements.
- In this case, **section 460 of the Criminal Code** applies, with necessary modifications based on context.

> *Section 460 allows for the attendance of a person before a court in certain circumstances, such as when required for the hearing of a criminal matter.*

---

### **Jury Empanelment**

- A **jury** is empanelled in accordance with **Part XVII of the Criminal Code**, which governs jury procedures.
- The jury is empanelled **with such modifications as the circumstances require** — allowing flexibility to accommodate the unique nature of a sentence reduction hearing.

> This is a key procedural innovation: unlike typical parole or sentence reviews, this process involves a **jury trial**, emphasizing public accountability and judicial fairness.

---

### **Evidence Rules at the Hearing**

- Only two parties may present evidence:
  1. The **applicant**
  2. The **Attorney General**

> No other individuals, witnesses, or organizations may present evidence.

- **Order of Presentation**:
  - The **applicant presents evidence first**.
  - If permitted by the judge, the applicant may then present **rebuttal evidence** after the Attorney General has presented their case.

- **Admissibility of Evidence**:
  - A **duly certified transcript** of the original trial and sentencing is **admissible** in evidence.
  - The judge has the **authority to rule on the admissibility** of any other evidence presented.

---

### **Jury Address and Judicial Address**

- After the evidence is presented:
  - The **applicant** speaks to the jury.
  - The **Attorney General** then addresses the jury (if applicable).
- The **judge addresses the jury last**, after both parties have finished their addresses.

> This structure ensures that the jury hears the full narrative from both sides before receiving the judge’s final remarks.

---

### **Judicial Discretion and Directions**

The judge may issue any orders or directions deemed necessary for a fair and effective hearing, including:

- **Extending or shortening time periods** (e.g., for adjournments or evidence gathering).
- Determining the **sufficiency** of the application or any affidavits.
- Directing on **service and proof of service** of documents.
- Ordering the **adjournment** of the hearing if needed.

> This discretion ensures procedural flexibility while maintaining the integrity of the process.

---

### **Final Disposition**

- If, at any point during the hearing (before or after commencement), the judge determines that **section 672(1)** of the Criminal Code **does not apply**, the application is **dismissed**, and the **jury is discharged**.

> This ensures that only individuals who meet the statutory criteria for such a reduction proceed to a full hearing.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Judicial Oversight with Jury Involvement**  
   The use of a jury ensures public accountability and reinforces the principle that sentence reductions are not purely administrative but are subject to public scrutiny.

2. **Fairness and Procedural Integrity**  
   The rules ensure that both the applicant and the Crown have equal opportunities to present evidence and arguments.

3. **Transparency and Precedent**  
   The requirement for detailed applications, service records, and evidence outlines promotes transparency and allows for consistent judicial review.

4. **Statutory Compliance**  
   The rules are grounded in and interpret **section 672 of the Criminal Code**, which permits sentence reductions in certain circumstances — particularly where the sentence is deemed excessive or unjust.

5. **Limited Scope**  
   The process applies only to individuals serving sentences **without eligibility for parole**, which typically applies to serious or life-threatening offences.

### **Limitations and Important Notes**

- **No Parole Eligibility**: This process does not grant parole eligibility — it only seeks a **reduction in the length of imprisonment**.
- **Not a Sentencing Review**: It is not a mechanism to re-sentence the individual, but rather to adjust the duration of the existing sentence.
- **No Third-Party Participation**: Only the applicant and the Attorney General may present evidence.
- **No Automatic Reduction**: A reduction is not guaranteed — it depends on the jury’s verdict and
