**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Fees for Making or Certifying Copies of Documents under the Customs Act**

---

### **Regulatory Background**

This regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **subsection 108(4) of the Customs Act** (*Customs Act*, S.C. 1986, c. 1). It establishes the **fees payable** when individuals or entities request the **making or certification of copies of records** under section 108 of the Customs Act.

> **Note**: This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2009-113, section 2**, meaning it is no longer in force as of the date of repeal. Therefore, it does not apply currently.

### **Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Customs Act*.
- The fees apply to:
  - Persons **from whom a record is obtained** for purposes of the Act, or
  - Persons **on whose behalf a record is provided** to a customs officer.
- These fees are only charged when an **official under section 107** provides a service such as making or certifying a copy of a record.

---

### **Fees for Making a Copy of a Record**

A person requesting a copy of a record must pay two types of fees:

#### 1. **Application Fee**
- A fixed **application fee of $5.00** is due at the time the request is made.
- This fee is **non-refundable** and applies to every request for a copy or certification.

> *Exception*: If the applicant has already paid the $5.00 application fee under a prior request, they do **not** need to pay it again for a subsequent request (as noted in section 4(2)).

#### 2. **Reproduction Fees (based on format and method)**

These fees are charged **only if a physical or digital copy is produced**, and vary depending on the **type of duplication**:

| Format | Fee Structure |
|-------|---------------|
| **Photocopying a page** | $0.20 per page |
| **Microfiche duplication (non-silver)** | $0.40 per fiche |
| **16 mm microfilm duplication (non-silver)** | $12.00 per 30.5-meter roll |
| **35 mm microfilm duplication (non-silver)** | $14.00 per 30.5-meter roll |
| **Microform to paper duplication** | $0.25 per page |
| **Magnetic tape-to-tape duplication** | $25.00 per 731.5-meter reel |

> *Note*: The terms "non-silver" indicate that the technology used is not based on silver-based photographic processes (e.g., standard black-and-white film), which may imply lower cost or standardization.

### **Additional Fees for Non-Computerized Records**

When the requested record is **non-computerized** (e.g., paper-based), and the person is required to **search for the record and prepare it**, the officer may charge an **additional fee**:

- **$2.50 per person per quarter hour** in excess of **five hours** spent on:
  - Searching for the record
  - Preparing the record for copying

> Example: If a person spends 6 hours searching and preparing, the extra time is 1 hour (15 minutes = 1 quarter hour).  
> → Additional fee = $2.50 × 1 = **$2.50**

> This fee is **not charged** if the total search and preparation time is **five hours or less**.

### **Additional Fees for Machine-Readable Records**

When a copy is produced from a **machine-readable record** (e.g., data stored electronically), the officer may charge:

#### 1. **Cost of Production and Programming**
- **$16.50 per minute** for the cost of:
  - Central processor
  - All locally attached devices
- This covers the computational effort required to extract and reproduce the data.

#### 2. **Programming Fee**
- **$5.00 per person per quarter hour** spent on programming the computer to process the data.

> Example: If a person spends 2 hours (8 quarter hours) programming, the fee is:  
> $5.00 × 8 = **$40.00**

> These fees are **in addition to** any other applicable fees (e.g., application fee, reproduction fee).

---

### **Fees for Certification of a Record**

A person who requests a **certification** of a record (i.e., an official verification that the copy is accurate and made from the original) must pay:

- An **application fee of $5.00**, **unless** they have already paid this fee in connection with a prior request for a copy or certification.

> This implies a **one-time application fee** per individual, regardless of how many copies or certifications are requested — but only if the request is new.

---

### **Key Principles and Intent**

1. **Cost Recovery**: The regulation ensures that the cost of labor, equipment, and processing is fairly recovered by customs officials when records are copied or certified.
2. **Proportionality**: Fees are structured to reflect the **actual effort and cost** involved in producing different types of copies (e.g., microfilm vs. photocopy).
3. **Transparency**: Clear fee schedules are provided so that applicants can anticipate costs.
4. **Administrative Efficiency**: The rules distinguish between simple requests (e.g., photocopying) and complex ones (e.g., programming or searching large paper files), ensuring appropriate fee structures.

---

### **Important Caveats**

- The regulation is **no longer in effect** due to its **repeal in SOR/2009-113, section 2**.
- Current fees for copying or certifying records under the Customs Act are governed by **updated regulations** that may differ in structure, amount, or scope.
- The original regulation reflects a **1986 framework** that may not align with modern digital record-keeping practices or current administrative costs.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation outlines a **detailed, tiered fee structure** for copying and certifying records under the *Customs Act*, with fees based on:

- Type of copy (photocopy, microfilm, tape, etc.)
- Search and preparation time (for non-digital records)
- Processing time and programming effort (for digital records)
- A fixed application fee for each request

While historically significant, **the regulation has been repealed**, and its provisions are **no longer applicable** under current Canadian customs law. Any current fees for record copying or certification should be consulted in official, up-to-date regulatory sources.
