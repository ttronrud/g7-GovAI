**Detailed Summary of the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 20; SOR/91-563)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations* (commonly referred to as the **Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations**) are a comprehensive set of rules issued by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada, pursuant to **sections 96 and 156 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (C.C.R.A.)**.

These regulations **repeal and replace** three prior sets of rules:
- The *Penitentiary Service Regulations*, C.R.C., c. 1251 (Order in Council P.C. 1978-1528)
- The *Parole Regulations*, made by Order in Council P.C. 1978-1528
- The *Penitentiary Inmates Accident Compensation Regulations*, made by Order in Council P.C. 1982-1026

They are **effective upon the coming into force of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act**, and may be cited as the **Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations**.

This document establishes a modern, transparent, and rights-based framework for the management of offenders within the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), emphasizing **rehabilitation, accountability, due process, and community reintegration**.

## **Core Principles and Responsibilities**

### **1. Staff Member Obligations**
All staff members must:
- Be familiar with the Act, these Regulations, and relevant policy directives.
- Perform duties **impartially, diligently, and in accordance with the principles** of the Act and the *Mission of the Correctional Service of Canada* (which emphasizes rehabilitation, dignity, and reintegration).
- **Encourage and assist offenders** in becoming law-abiding citizens.

> This reflects a shift from a purely punitive model to a rehabilitative, human-centered approach.

---

### **2. Institutional Head Responsibilities**
The institutional head (e.g., warden or facility director) is responsible for:
- The **care, custody, and control** of all inmates
- The **management, organization, and security** of the facility
- The **work environment and supervision** of staff

This role is central to ensuring both safety and rehabilitation.

---

### **3. Authority of Staff Members**
Staff members may exercise specific powers based on designation:

#### **By Commissioner’s Directives:**
Can act on behalf of the Commissioner under:
- Subsection 27(3)
- Section 29 (transfers)
- Section 37.4 (disciplinary actions)
- Subsection 81(3) (special powers)

#### **By Role in Victim Liaison:**
Staff designated for victim liaison may exercise powers under **Section 26** of the Act.

#### **By Institutional Standing Orders:**
Staff designated by the institutional head (and whose designation is accessible to inmates) may exercise powers under:
- Subsections 17(3), 18(4), 37.3(5), 41(2), 61(2), and 94(1)

> These provisions ensure a clear chain of accountability and delegation while maintaining transparency for inmates.

---

### **4. Citizen Advisory Committees (CACs)**

- May be established by institutional heads or parole office managers to promote **community involvement**.
- Must be **representative of the local community**.
- **No staff or inmate may be appointed** to a CAC.
- Functions:
  - Advise on matters within the institutional or parole office’s jurisdiction
  - Engage in public consultations with offenders, staff, and the public
- Must have **reasonable access** to:
  - All parts of the facility
  - All staff
  - All inmates
  - Any hearings related to an inmate (if the inmate consents)

> This strengthens community trust and accountability in correctional institutions.

---

## **Inmate Rights and Due Process**

### **1. Right to Attend Court Hearings**
Where an inmate is applying for a **reduction in sentence without parole eligibility** (under section 745 of the *Criminal Code*), the **Commissioner must ensure** the inmate is present at court hearings **if**:
- The court requires it, or
- The inmate requests it

> This protects the inmate’s right to participate in judicial processes affecting their sentence.

---

### **2. Transfer of Inmates**
Transfers are governed by strict procedural safeguards:

#### **Before Transfer (Non-Immediate):**
- Written notice of proposed transfer must include **reasons and destination**
- Inmate must have a **reasonable opportunity to prepare representations**
- A **personal or written meeting** must occur to explain the transfer and allow for representation
- Representations are forwarded to the Commissioner or a designated staff member
- Final decision must be communicated:
  - **At least two days before transfer** (unless inmate consents to less)
  - **Within five working days** if transfer is denied

> This ensures transparency and due process.

#### **Immediate Transfers (Security or Safety Reasons):**
If a transfer is required **immediately** for security or safety reasons:
- The institutional head of the receiving facility must meet with the inmate **within two working days**
- The inmate may make representations in person or in writing
- Representations are forwarded to the Commissioner
- Final decision and reasons are communicated **within five working days**

> This balances urgent needs with procedural fairness.

#### **Transfers for Assessment:**
If an inmate is transferred for assessment and the recommendation is to **remain in the original facility**, the institutional head must:
- Notify the inmate of the recommendation and reasons
- Allow time to prepare representations
- Meet with the inmate to discuss the recommendation
- Forward representations to the Commissioner
- Provide written notice of final decision within **two working days**

> Ensures that assessment outcomes are subject to meaningful input.

#### **Requests for Transfer:**
Inmates may request a transfer. The Commissioner or designated staff must:
- Consider the request
- Provide **written notice of decision within 60 days**
- Include reasons for the decision if denied

> This gives inmates a clear, time-bound process to seek transfer.

---

### **3. Warrants for Transfers**
Transfers are authorized by **warrant** signed by:
- The **Commissioner or a designated staff member** (for transfers under paragraphs 29(a) or (c))
- A **staff member** (for transfers to a structured intervention unit outside the current facility under subsection 29.01(1))

> This ensures formal authorization and accountability.

## **Security Classification System**

The Service assigns inmates to one of three security levels based on a detailed assessment:

| Security Level | Criteria |
|---------------|---------|
| **Maximum Security** | High risk of escape; high risk to public safety; requires high supervision |
| **Medium Security** | Low to moderate risk of escape; moderate risk to public; moderate supervision needed |
| **Minimum Security** | Low risk of escape; low risk to public; low supervision needed |

**Factors considered** in classification:
- Seriousness of the offence
- Outstanding charges
- Performance and behaviour while in custody
- Criminal and social history (including young-offender history or dangerous offender designation)
- Physical or mental illness/disorder
- Potential for violent behaviour
- Continued involvement in criminal activity

> This system supports risk-based management and ensures appropriate placement for safety and rehabilitation.

## **Escorted Temporary Absences**

Inmates may be granted temporary absences (with staff escort) for specific, legitimate reasons:

| Reason | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Medical** | For medical treatment not available in the facility |
| **Administrative** | For personal, legal, or sentence-related matters |
| **Community Service** | Voluntary work with non-profit organizations |
| **Family Contact** | To strengthen family ties as a support system |
| **Parental Responsibility** | To maintain care, schooling, or medical needs of a child |
| **Personal Development** | For rehabilitative activities, including cultural/spiritual ceremonies (especially Indigenous traditions) |
| **Compassionate Reasons** | For urgent family matters |

> These absences are designed to support rehabilitation and reintegration, with a focus on **personal development and family connection**.

### **Regional Authority for Certain Absences**
- The **head of a region** may approve non-medical temporary absences **exceeding 5 days but not exceeding 15 days**
-
