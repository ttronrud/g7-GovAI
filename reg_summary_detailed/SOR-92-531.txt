## 📚 Key Definitions in the Regulations

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act* (the primary legislation governing banks in Canada). |
| **Designated Entity** | An entity that is *not* an insurance company, a securities dealer, or an entity controlled by either of those. This category includes most non-financial institutions (e.g., holding companies, subsidiaries, or other financial entities not directly regulated under insurance or securities laws). |
| **Insurance Company** | Any insurance company incorporated under Canadian federal or provincial law. |
| **Minority Interest** | An equity interest in an entity controlled by a bank, held by someone *other than* the bank or an entity controlled by the bank. This is distinct from the bank’s own equity. |
| **Securities Dealer** | An entity described in paragraph (g) of the definition of *financial institution* in Section 2 of the Bank Act. This includes firms engaged in buying and selling securities. |

## 📊 **Core Definition of Regulatory Capital (Section 3)**

> **At any given time**, the **regulatory capital of a bank** is calculated as the **aggregate of the following**, less **goodwill**:

### ✅ Components Included:
1. **Shareholders’ Equity**  
   - The equity held by shareholders (common shares, preferred shares, etc.).

2. **Members’ Equity** *(only for federal credit unions)*  
   - Applies specifically to federal credit unions; reflects the equity of members.

3. **Minority Interests**  
   - Equity interests in subsidiaries or controlled entities held by third parties (not the bank itself).

4. **Subordinated Indebtedness**  
   - Debt instruments that rank *below* other debts in terms of repayment priority (e.g., subordinated loans or bonds).

> ⚖️ **Subtraction**:  
> The amount of **goodwill** recognized in the bank’s financial statements is **deducted** from this total.

> 📝 *Goodwill* is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. It is not considered capital because it is not a source of future economic benefit in the event of loss.

## 📏 **Conditions for Including a Security or Membership Share in Regulatory Capital**

A security or membership share can only be counted as part of regulatory capital **if all of the following conditions are met**:

| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Subordination in Payment Rights** | The security or share must be **subordinate to all deposit liabilities and other liabilities** of the issuing entity — except for those that rank equally or are subordinate to it. |
| **Fully Paid-Up** | The share or security must be fully paid; no unpaid or outstanding amounts. |
| **Minimum Term or No Term** | For **subordinated indebtedness or preferred shares**, the security must have:<br> - An **initial term of at least 5 years**, or<br> - **No fixed term** (i.e., perpetual). |
| **Non-Redeemable in First 5 Years** | The security **cannot be redeemed or purchased for cancellation** during the first five years after issuance. |

> 🔍 *This ensures that only long-term, low-risk, and well-structured instruments are counted as capital, reducing the risk of banks using short-term or easily redeemable instruments to inflate capital.*

## 🚨 Special Adjustments Under Sections 476–478 of the Bank Act

These adjustments are made **specifically for purposes of sections 476 to 478 of the Bank Act**, which relate to **risk-based capital requirements** and **capital adequacy standards**.

> The **regulatory capital of a bank** is reduced by the following amounts:

### 1. **Insurance Company or Securities Dealer Controlled by the Bank**
- **Subtract** the amount of:
  - **Shareholders’ equity** and **subordinated indebtedness** of the insurance company or securities dealer (or of an entity controlled by it), that would otherwise be included in the bank’s regulatory capital.

> ⚠️ *Rationale:* A bank should not count capital that is already part of the capital base of a related entity (e.g., a bank owning a subsidiary insurance company) — this would lead to double-counting and overstatement of capital.

---

### 2. **Investments in Insurance Companies or Securities Dealers**
- **Subtract** the amount of **investments** (not equity or subordinated debt) made by:
  - The bank, or
  - A **designated entity** controlled by the bank,
  in an insurance company or securities dealer **controlled by the bank**, or in an entity controlled by such a company.

> 🔍 *Only if the investment is part of the capital of the insurance company or securities dealer.*  
> Example: If a bank invests in a life insurance company and that investment is treated as capital (e.g., a capital reserve), it is excluded from the bank’s regulatory capital.

---

### 3. **Loans to Insurance Companies or Securities Dealers**
- **Subtract** the amount of **loans** (not subordinated debt) made by:
  - The bank, or
  - A **designated entity** controlled by the bank,
  to an insurance company or securities dealer **controlled by the bank**, or to an entity controlled by such a company.

> 🔍 *Only if the loan is part of the capital of the recipient entity.*  
> Example: If a bank lends money to an insurance company and that loan is used to strengthen the insurer’s capital base, it is excluded from the bank’s regulatory capital.

---

### 4. **Minority Interests in Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- **Subtract** the amount of **minority interest** in:
  - An insurance company or securities dealer controlled by the bank, or
  - An entity controlled by such an insurer or dealer,
  that is included in the bank’s regulatory capital.

> ⚠️ *Again, to prevent double-counting* — if a bank owns a minority stake in a regulated entity, that stake is not counted as part of the bank’s own capital for regulatory purposes.

## 📐 Definition of "Capital" for Insurance Companies and Securities Dealers

For the purposes of the above adjustments, the term **"capital"** is defined differently depending on the type of entity:

| Entity Type | Definition of Capital |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Insurance Company** (subject to *Insurance Companies Act*) | The amount of **regulatory capital** as defined in the *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations*. |
| **All other insurance companies or securities dealers** | The amount that would be treated as **capital** by the **regulatory body** that oversees that entity (e.g., the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or provincial regulators). |

> 🔍 This ensures that capital is assessed using the **appropriate regulatory framework** for each type of financial institution.

---

## 📝 Key Principles and Objectives

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency and Consistency** | Regulatory capital is based on financial statements prepared under the **accounting principles and specifications** set out in subsection 308(4) of the Bank Act (i.e., the Superintendent’s standards). |
| **Risk-Based Approach** | Only instruments with strong subordination and long maturities are included — enhancing the resilience of the bank’s capital base. |
| **Avoiding Double Counting** | The regulations prevent the inclusion of capital already held by subsidiaries or related entities, ensuring accurate capital measurement. |
| **Focus on Financial Stability** | By excluding non-core, non-capital investments and loans, the rules ensure that only true capital buffers are used to support bank stability. |

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The *Regulatory Capital (Banks) Regulations* provide a **clear, standardized, and risk-sensitive framework** for determining the regulatory capital of banks in Canada. It ensures that:

- Only **true, long-term, and subordinate** instruments are counted as capital;
- **Double-counting** of capital between parent banks and subsidiaries is avoided;
