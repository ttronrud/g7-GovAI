**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Employee Qualification Standards Regulations* (1987)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Railway Employee Qualification Standards Regulations*, adopted on March 12, 1987, by the **Canadian Transport Commission (Commission)** under sections 46 of the *National Transportation Act* and section 227 of the *Railway Act*, establish comprehensive minimum qualification standards for key railway occupational roles. These regulations ensure that employees—specifically **locomotive engineers, transfer hostlers, conductors, and yard foremen**—are properly trained, assessed, and certified before being allowed to perform their duties safely and effectively.

The regulations are formally known as the **Railway Employee Qualification Standards Regulations** and came into force on **July 1, 1990**, with certain provisions applying immediately upon adoption.

## **Scope and Applicability**

- **Applicability**: Applies to all railway companies operating in Canada under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transport Commission.
- **Exemption**: Does **not apply** to U.S.-originating rail crews that enter Canada within **24 km (15 miles)** of the Canada–U.S. border, provided they only travel to a terminal or turnaround point within that distance.

> This exemption recognizes the short-distance nature of such cross-border operations and avoids unnecessary regulatory burden.

---

## **Core Requirements for Employee Qualification**

### 1. **Mandatory Qualification Process**
No employee may work as a **locomotive engineer, transfer hostler, conductor, or yard foreman** unless:
- They have **qualified** in accordance with **section 14** (i.e., passed required subjects and on-job training), and  
- In the case of **locomotive engineers or transfer hostlers**, they have received a **passing mark** in on-job training.

> This ensures that only trained and competent personnel operate critical rail equipment.

---

### 2. **On-Job Training Requirements**

#### a) **Training Provision**
Railway companies must provide **sufficient on-job training** to candidates in the required subjects so they can demonstrate competence to instructors and examiners.

#### b) **Examiner Criteria for Passing OJT**
An examiner may only issue a **passing mark** if:
- The candidate has been evaluated by a **supervised mentor** (the experienced engineer or hostler with whom they trained), confirming their competence in performing duties.
- The examiner assesses the candidate’s **actual performance** in locomotive or train operations (or both), depending on the role.
- The examiner completes and files a **formal document** indicating the candidate has passed the on-job training.

> This dual evaluation (peer assessment + operational performance) ensures real-world readiness.

#### c) **Duration of Training**
Candidates may perform duties of the occupational category **under the supervision** of an on-job training instructor during their training period.

---

### 3. **Re-Examination Requirements**

- Employees in any occupational category must be **re-examined every three years** on the required subjects.
- The **overall pass mark for re-examination is 80%**.
- This ensures ongoing competency and knowledge retention over time.

---

### 4. **Transfers Between Occupational Categories**

An employee transferring from one category to another must:
- Be **qualified** in the new category under section 14, and  
- In the case of a transfer to **locomotive engineer or transfer hostler**, have received a **passing on-job training mark within the last three years**.

> This prevents unqualified personnel from moving into higher-risk or more complex roles.

---

## **Training Program and Documentation Requirements**

### 1. **Initial Reporting Obligations (within 90 days of regulation coming into force)**

Railway companies must submit to the **Committee**:
- Two copies of **each type of classroom examination** used.
- Two copies of a **detailed description** of each method used to assess on-job competence.

### 2. **Change Notification**

Any change to:
- Classroom examination format, or  
- Method of assessing on-job competence  

must be reported to the Committee **within 90 days** of implementation.

### 3. **Training Program Development and Review**

- Companies must **establish and modify** training programs in consultation with **trade unions** representing employees in each occupational category.
- Within 90 days of regulation implementation, file a **description of all training programs**.
- After any change to a training program, file a **description of the change**.
- Submit a **comprehensive annual report** by **March 31** of the following year, including:
  - Total number of employees in each category.
  - Number of employees who received training.
  - Number who met vs. failed training requirements.
  - Any new or improved techniques or devices adopted.

> This promotes transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in training practices.

---

## **Certificate Requirements**

- Every qualified employee receives a **wallet-sized certificate** issued by the railway company.
- The certificate must be:
  - Carried **on duty**.
  - Produced upon request by a railway company officer or a Commission officer.

> This serves as a formal, portable proof of qualification and compliance with safety standards.

---

## **Subject Requirements and Minimum Marks**

### 1. **Required Subjects**
- Determined by the schedule marked with “X” under the relevant occupational category heading.
- **Exclusions**: Any subjects or equipment portions not used by the railway company are excluded.

> This ensures training is relevant and practical to the specific operations of each company.

### 2. **Minimum Passing Marks**
- To qualify for any occupational category, a person must achieve an **overall mark of at least 80%** in the required subjects.

> This establishes a baseline of knowledge and competence.

## **Instructor Qualification Standards**

### 1. **On-Job Training Instructors**

| Role | Qualification Requirements |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Locomotive Engineer Instructor** | - Must have qualified as a locomotive engineer with **≥90%** in required subjects<br>- Must have **≥2 years of service**, including **≥3 months in the training area** |
| **Transfer Hostler Instructor** | - Must have qualified as a transfer hostler with **≥90%** in required subjects<br>- Must have **≥1 year of service**, including **≥3 months in the training area** |

> These requirements ensure instructors have both deep knowledge and hands-on experience.

---

### 2. **Classroom Training Instructors**

- Must achieve **at least 90%** in a **written examination** on the subject they are teaching.

> This ensures instructors are highly knowledgeable and capable of delivering accurate, high-quality instruction.

---

## **Examiner Authority**

- Any employee or officer who is qualified to teach as a **classroom or on-job instructor** is **automatically authorized** to act as an **examiner** for the subjects they teach.

> This streamlines the examination process and ensures consistency in assessment.

---

## **Key Objectives and Principles**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Prevents unqualified personnel from operating trains or handling critical equipment. |
| **Consistency** | Standardizes training and qualification across all Canadian railways. |
| **Accountability** | Requires detailed records, reporting, and transparency. |
| **Competency-Based Training** | Emphasizes both theoretical knowledge (classroom) and practical performance (on-the-job). |
| **Industry Collaboration** | Involves trade unions in designing training programs to ensure fairness and relevance. |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Annual reporting encourages innovation and refinement of training methods. |

## **Significance and Impact**

These regulations represent a foundational framework for ensuring **professionalism, safety, and operational reliability** in Canada’s rail industry. By setting clear, enforceable standards for:
- Knowledge (written exams),
- Practical skills (on-the-job training),
- Instructor qualifications,
- Re-evaluation, and
- Transparent reporting,

the regulations help maintain public and worker safety while supporting industry best practices.

They also reflect a shift toward **competency-based, performance-driven training**, rather than merely procedural compliance.
