**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Context**  
The Prince Edward Island Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations were enacted by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on **December 7, 2004**, under **subsection 18(1) of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA)**, which grants the Lieutenant Governor the authority to make regulations to implement and administer the Act. These regulations are part of **S.C. 2004, c. 10**, and came into force on the date the Act itself came into effect.

### **1. Scope and Applicability**  
These regulations establish the procedural and operational framework for the registration, reporting, and collection of information related to sex offenders within Prince Edward Island (PEI). They apply specifically to individuals who are sex offenders and whose **main residence is located in PEI**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**  
- **Act**: Refers to the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (SOIRA), which provides the legal basis for registering and managing information about individuals convicted of sex offences.  
- **RCMP**: Stands for the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police*, the federal law enforcement agency responsible for policing and information management under the Act.

---

### **3. Reporting Requirements – Method of Submission**  
A sex offender whose **primary residence is in Prince Edward Island** may fulfill certain reporting obligations through **telephone communication**, specifically under:  
- **Paragraph 4.1(1)(a) or (b)** of the Act (initial or periodic reports), and  
- **Section 4.3** of the Act (additional reporting requirements).  

Additionally, the offender may provide **notifications required under Section 6** of the Act (e.g., changes in address, employment, or release from custody) via telephone.

> **Important Clarification**:  
> While telephone reporting is permitted for paragraphs (a) and (b) and Section 6, **subsection (1) of these regulations does not eliminate the requirement to report in person** under **paragraph 4.1(1)(c)** of the Act. This means that any reporting required under that specific clause — such as certain changes in personal circumstances or specific types of offences — must still be completed in person. This ensures compliance with mandatory in-person reporting for specific circumstances.

### **4. Authorized Personnel to Collect Information**  
The following individuals are authorized in Prince Edward Island to **collect information** from sex offenders for the purposes of the Act:  
- A **member of the RCMP**;  
- A **member of a police department** as defined in **paragraph 1(n) of the Police Act (R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c P-11.1)**, as amended from time to time.  

This includes local police officers and other authorized personnel operating under the provincial police framework.

> **Note**: This authorization ensures that both federal (RCMP) and provincial law enforcement agencies can legally collect data from sex offenders in accordance with the Act.

### **5. Authorized Personnel to Register Information**  
The following individuals are authorized to **register information** collected under the Act:  
- A **member of the RCMP**;  
- A **person employed by the RCMP whose duties include the registration of information** collected under the Act.  

This provision ensures that only trained and designated RCMP personnel (or those with specific registration responsibilities) are responsible for entering and maintaining records in official databases, enhancing data accuracy and accountability.

---

### **6. Designated Registration Centre**  
The **RCMP “L” Division headquarters**, located at:  
**450 University Avenue, Charlottetown, Queens County**,  
is officially designated as the **sole registration centre** for Prince Edward Island.  

- Its **area of service covers the entire province**, meaning that all sex offender registration information collected in PEI must be submitted to this location for official processing and record-keeping.  
- This centralization streamlines administrative processes and ensures consistent handling of sex offender data across the province.

---

### **7. Effective Date**  
These regulations come into force on the **date the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (S.C. 2004, c. 10) comes into force**.  
The Act itself was enacted on **December 15, 2004**, and thus the Regulations also came into effect on that date.  

> *Note*: A supplementary notice (SI/2004-157) confirms that these regulations were in force as of December 15, 2004.
