The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the *Species at Risk Act*

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is made under **subsection 28(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which empowers the Minister of the Environment (or the Minister responsible for the Environment) to acknowledge the completion of scientific assessments of species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority and Issuance:**  
   The Order is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of the Environment**. This reflects the constitutional structure of Canadian governance, where the Governor General acts on the advice of the federal Cabinet (in this case, the Minister of the Environment).

2. **Purpose:**  
   The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally acknowledge receipt** of scientific assessments conducted by COSEWIC for specific species listed in the **annexed schedule**. These assessments are critical components of the SARA process, as they provide the scientific basis for determining whether a species is at risk of extinction.

3. **COSEWIC Role:**  
   The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is the independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species in Canada. Its assessments evaluate factors such as:
   - Population size and trends
   - Geographic distribution
   - Threats (e.g., habitat loss, climate change, predation)
   - Conservation status (e.g., Extinct, Endangered, Threatened, Special Concern)

4. **Trigger for the Order:**  
   The Order is activated **upon the making of the regulation** (i.e., when it is officially issued and comes into force). This means that the government formally recognizes that the COSEWIC assessments for the species listed in the schedule have been completed and are now available for use in the decision-making process under SARA.

5. **Species Covered:**  
   The regulation refers to a **schedule** (not included in your text) that lists the specific species for which COSEWIC has completed its assessments. These species are typically those under review for designation as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA.

6. **Next Steps in the SARA Process:**  
   After the Minister acknowledges receipt of these assessments:
   - The Minister may proceed to **designate** species as at risk based on COSEWIC’s findings.
   - The designation triggers **legal obligations** under SARA, including the development of recovery strategies, monitoring programs, and potential protection measures.
   - The public and stakeholders are informed of the status of species and the rationale behind any proposed actions.

7. **Legal Significance:**  
   This Order is a formal step in the regulatory process under SARA. It establishes the scientific foundation upon which conservation decisions are made. It also ensures transparency and accountability by documenting that assessments have been completed and reviewed by an independent scientific body.

**Context and Importance:**

- This type of Order is common in SARA implementation and is typically issued periodically as new assessments are completed.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to science-based conservation policy and environmental protection.
- The Order helps ensure that conservation decisions are grounded in up-to-date, peer-reviewed scientific data.

**Reference:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 – This refers to the *Species at Risk Act*, which was enacted in 2002 and remains a key piece of federal legislation for protecting wildlife in Canada.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and administrative step that formalizes the government’s acceptance of COSEWIC’s scientific evaluations for specific species. It serves as a critical milestone in the process of identifying and protecting species at risk under Canadian law, ensuring that conservation actions are informed by rigorous, independent science.
