---

## 💰 **How Child Support Amounts Are Determined**

### 1. **Children Under Majority (Age < 18)**
- The amount is **primarily determined by the applicable table** in Schedule I, based on:
  - Number of children under majority
  - Income of the spouse against whom the order is sought
- **Plus**, if applicable, any amount determined under **section 7** (for special expenses).

> ✅ Default rule: Use the table amount unless overridden by other factors.

---

### 2. **Children at or Over Majority (Age ≥ 18)**
- The court may apply the **same table-based method** as if the child were under majority.
- **Alternatively**, the court may set a different amount if it determines that the table approach is **inappropriate**, based on:
  - The child’s condition, means, needs, and circumstances
  - The financial ability of each spouse to contribute

> This allows flexibility for adult children with unique needs (e.g., university students, disabled individuals).

---

## 🌍 **Selection of the Applicable Table**

The table used depends on the **residence of the spouse against whom the order is sought**:

| Scenario | Applicable Table |
|--------|------------------|
| Spouse resides in Canada | Table for province where they **habitually reside** at time of application or variation |
| Residency changes during determination | Table for province where spouse **resides at the time of support determination** |
| Residency change in the near future | Table for province where spouse will **habitually reside after** determination |
| Spouse resides outside Canada or residence is unknown | Table for province where the **other spouse habitually resides** at time of application or calculation |

> Applies equally to **calculations or recalculations** under subsections 25.01(1) or 25.1(1).

---

## 💸 **High-Income Adjustment (Income > $150,000)**

When a spouse earns **over $150,000 annually**, the amount is calculated as follows:

1. **First $150,000 of income**:  
   - Use the **table amount** based on number of children under majority.

2. **Balance of income (above $150,000)**:  
   - Court determines a **custom amount** based on:
     - Needs and circumstances of the children
     - Financial ability of both spouses
     - Condition and means of each spouse

3. **Plus any amount under section 7** (special expenses)

> This ensures that high-income parents do not face disproportionate financial burdens while still contributing fairly to child support.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Support for a Spouse Acting as a Parent**

If a spouse is **standing in the place of a parent** (e.g., a non-biological parent with legal responsibility), the court sets the amount based on:
- The **Guidelines**
- The **legal duty** of the other parent to support the child

> This ensures that all children are supported regardless of biological or legal parentage.

---

## 🏥 **Medical and Dental Insurance Coverage**

- If either spouse has **employer-provided or otherwise affordable medical/dental insurance** for the child, the court may:
  - Order that coverage be **acquired or continued**

> This protects children from financial strain due to lack of health coverage.

---

## 📚 **Additional Expenses That May Be Ordered**

Courts may include **specific expenses** in child support orders, including:

| Expense Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Child Care Expenses** | Incurred due to employment, illness, disability, or education/training of the spouse with majority parenting time |
| **Medical/Dental Insurance Premiums** | Portion attributable to the child |
| **Health-Related Expenses** | Exceeding insurance reimbursement by at least $100/year; includes orthodontics, therapy, prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses, contact lenses |
| **Educational Expenses** | For primary/secondary school or special programs meeting child’s needs |
| **Post-Secondary Education** | Tuition, fees, books, etc. |
| **Extracurricular Activities** | Sports, arts, music, etc. |

> These are considered **extraordinary** if they:
> - Exceed what the requesting spouse can reasonably cover (based on income and table amount)
> - Or, if the court deems them extraordinary based on:
>   - Nature and number of programs
>   - Child’s special needs or talents
>   - Overall cost
>   - Family spending patterns

> ⚖️ **Guiding Principle**:  
> Expenses are **shared proportionally** to each spouse’s income **after deducting** any contribution from the child.

> 🚫 **Excluded from consideration**:  
> Any **Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB)** or eligibility for such benefit.

> ✅ **Tax-related deductions or credits** are considered in determining expense amounts, **except** for UCCB.

---

## 🔄 **Shared Parenting Time (Each Spouse Has ≥40% Parenting Time)**

When **both spouses have at least 40% parenting time** with a child:

- The amount of child support is determined by:
  1. Applying the **table amounts** for each spouse
  2. Accounting for **increased costs** of shared parenting
  3. Considering the **conditions, means, needs, and circumstances** of each spouse and the child

> This reflects the reality of shared parenting and avoids underpaying or overpaying either parent.

---

## ⚠️ **Undue Hardship Exception**

A court may award a **different amount** from the table-based amount if it finds that a spouse or child would otherwise suffer **undue hardship**.

### ✅ Circumstances that May Cause Undue Hardship:

1. The spouse has **unusually high
