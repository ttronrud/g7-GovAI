[Repealed by SOR/2002-277, s. 5]

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Legal Authority**  
   The regulation was enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act*.  
   - This means the regulation was authorized by statute and applied to matters related to excise tax exemptions or allowances.

2. **Purpose**  
   The regulation was designed to **establish equivalencies** between **music lessons** and **formal music courses** that are part of a curriculum designated by a school authority (e.g., public or private schools, or recognized educational institutions).  
   - In essence, it allowed certain music lessons (such as private instruction) to be considered equivalent to those formally taught within a school’s curriculum, for the purposes of excise tax relief.

3. **Application Under Section 9 of Part III of Schedule V**  
   The regulation specifically applied to **Section 9 of Part III of Schedule V** of the *Excise Tax Act*.  
   - This section typically deals with **exemptions or allowances** for certain educational expenses, such as those related to school-related programs or student activities.
   - By prescribing music lessons as equivalents of music courses, the regulation enabled individuals (e.g., parents or students) to claim excise tax exemptions on expenses for music instruction, provided those lessons met the defined criteria.

4. **Prescribed Equivalency**  
   The regulation explicitly stated that:  
   > *"Music lessons are prescribed equivalents of music courses that follow a curriculum designated by a school authority."*  
   - This meant that if a student received music instruction outside of a formal school setting (e.g., private lessons with a music teacher), such lessons could be treated as **equivalent to school-based music courses** for tax purposes—specifically, for claiming exemptions under the Excise Tax Act.

### **Context and Intent**

- The intent behind this regulation was to **ensure fairness and accessibility** in tax relief for students involved in music education.  
- It allowed families to claim tax exemptions on private music lessons, even if those lessons were not part of a school curriculum, as long as they were comparable in content, duration, and educational value to those offered in a formally designated curriculum.

- This provision supported the broader goal of the Excise Tax Act to **promote education and cultural development** by providing tax relief for qualifying educational expenditures.

### **Status: Repealed**

- The regulation was **repealed** on **April 1, 2002**, by **SOR/2002-277, section 5** (Statutory Order 2002-277, section 5).  
- This repeal indicates that the government no longer considers private music lessons to be equivalent to school-based music courses for excise tax purposes.  
- The repeal likely reflects changes in tax policy, administrative simplification, or a shift in how educational expenses are assessed under the Excise Tax Act.

### **Implications of the Repeal**

- **No longer valid**: The provision that music lessons are equivalent to school music courses under the Excise Tax Act is **no longer in effect**.
- **Tax consequences**: Individuals who previously claimed excise tax exemptions for private music lessons based on this regulation **cannot do so anymore** under the current rules.
- **Policy shift**: The repeal suggests a move toward stricter alignment of tax-exempt activities with formal, school-based curricula, or a broader review of what constitutes a legitimate educational expense.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation, though short-lived, was a specific legislative tool to allow **private music lessons to qualify as equivalent to formal music courses** for excise tax exemption purposes. It operated under the authority of the *Excise Tax Act* and was intended to support music education outside of formal school settings. However, it has been **officially repealed** since 2002 and is **no longer applicable** in Canadian tax law.
