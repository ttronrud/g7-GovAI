**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Potato Order**

---

**1. Citation and Purpose**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Prince Edward Island Potato Order* and serves as a statutory instrument under the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Act). Its primary purpose is to establish the regulatory framework governing the marketing of potatoes in Prince Edward Island (PEI), particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the Commodity Board’s authority to regulate the marketing of natural products, including potatoes.
  
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Potato Board*, a government body established under the Act. It is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and distribution of potatoes in PEI.

- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan for potatoes developed and amended over time in accordance with the Act. The Plan outlines strategies for managing supply, pricing, and market access, including mechanisms for price stabilization and equity among producers.

- **Potatoes**: Defined broadly as *any potatoes produced in the Province of Prince Edward Island*. This includes all varieties of potatoes grown within the province, regardless of type or size.

---

**3. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**  
The Commodity Board is explicitly authorized to regulate the marketing of potatoes in two key markets:
- **Interprovincial trade** (sales to other Canadian provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales to international buyers)

This authority extends to all aspects of marketing, including pricing, distribution, and financial arrangements.

---

**4. Extension of Powers from Local to Interprovincial/Export Markets**  
Importantly, the Board is granted the same powers it holds in regulating the *local marketing* of potatoes within PEI. This includes the authority to:
- Set rules and conditions for marketing
- Enforce compliance
- Collect fees or charges

These powers are applied to persons and properties located within PEI, ensuring consistency in regulatory enforcement across all markets.

---

**5. Authority to Impose Levies or Charges (Revoked Provision)**  
A section of the Order previously authorized the Commodity Board to:
- Make orders setting **levies or charges** on persons involved in the marketing of potatoes in interprovincial and export markets.
- Classify these persons into **different groups** (e.g., by size of operation, volume of sales, or type of marketing activity).
- Fix **different levies or charges** for each group.

> **Note**: This provision has been **revoked** by *SOR/80-90* (Statutory Order 80-90). As such, the power to impose levies or charges on interprovincial and export marketing is no longer active under this Order.

---

**6. Use of Levies or Charges (if in force)**  
Had the levy provisions remained in effect, the Commodity Board could have used the collected funds for several purposes, including:
- Establishing **reserves** (financial buffers to stabilize market conditions)
- Covering **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of potatoes
- Conducting **equalization or adjustment** of income among potato producers
  - For example, if some producers sold potatoes at lower prices due to market fluctuations, the Board could use the levies to redistribute funds to ensure fairer returns across the industry

This mechanism aims to promote **equity** among producers and stabilize income, especially during periods of market volatility.

---

**7. Key Implications and Context**  
Although the levy provisions have been revoked, the Order remains significant because:
- It establishes the foundational authority of the Commodity Board in regulating potato marketing beyond local markets.
- It confirms that the Board has the legal power to intervene in interprovincial and export markets to ensure fair practices, price stability, and producer support.
- The revocation of the levy power suggests a shift in policy—possibly toward market-based pricing or reduced government intervention—though the Board still retains oversight and regulatory functions.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Prince Edward Island Potato Order* provides a structured legal basis for the Commodity Board to manage the marketing of PEI-grown potatoes in both domestic and international markets. While the specific power to impose levies or charges has been revoked, the Order retains critical regulatory authority to ensure fair and equitable marketing practices, protect producers, and maintain market stability. The Board continues to play a central role in shaping the economic and commercial framework for potato production and distribution in Prince Edward Island.  

> **Status Note**: The regulation is currently active in terms of regulatory authority and oversight, though the levy mechanism is no longer in force.
