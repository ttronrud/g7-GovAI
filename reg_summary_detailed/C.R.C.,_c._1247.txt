**Detailed Summary of the Parliamentary Secretaries Expenses Regulations**

The *Parliamentary Secretaries Expenses Regulations* establish the framework for the reimbursement of reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by Parliamentary Secretaries in the performance of their official duties. These regulations are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in the financial management of Parliamentary Secretaries' official activities.

### 1. **Eligibility for Expense Reimbursement**
A Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to be paid **reasonable travelling and other expenses** under the following circumstances:
- While **away from Ottawa** during a session of Parliament; or  
- While **away from their ordinary place of residence** during a period when Parliament is **not in session**.

This provision allows for reimbursement of legitimate costs incurred in the performance of official duties, whether during active parliamentary sessions or outside of them, as long as the absence is directly related to official responsibilities.

> **Key Point**: The expenses must be reasonable and directly connected to the discharge of duties under the *Parliamentary Secretaries Act*.

### 2. **Accountable Advances and Monthly Accounting Requirement**
- **Accountable advances** may be granted to a Parliamentary Secretary to cover expenses related to their duties under the *Parliamentary Secretaries Act*.
- These advances are **not unconditional**—they are subject to strict accountability.
- The Parliamentary Secretary must **submit a monthly accounting** of all expenditures made from such advances during the **preceding month**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that funds are used appropriately and that expenses are justified and traceable to official duties.

### 3. **Accounting Upon Leaving Office**
- If a person **ceases to serve as a Parliamentary Secretary**, they are required to submit a **final accounting** within **30 days** of ceasing to hold the office.
- This accounting must cover any **outstanding advances** that have not been repaid or reimbursed.

> **Purpose**: To prevent financial impropriety and ensure that all financial obligations are settled promptly and transparently.

### 4. **Content and Format of Expense Accounts**
Any expense account submitted by a Parliamentary Secretary must include the following information:

- **Itinerary**: A detailed record of the trip, including dates, locations, and schedule of activities.

  - **Transportation costs** (e.g., airfare, train, bus, car rental), **including any accommodation not included in the transportation fare**;
  - **Lodging costs** (hotel or rental accommodation);
  - **Meals** (including meal allowances or actual receipts);
  - **Taxis and telephones** (including phone calls and telegrams);
  - **Other related expenses** (to be described in general terms).

### Key Principles Underlying the Regulations:
- **Reasonableness**: All expenses must be reasonable and justified by official duties.
- **Accountability**: The Parliamentary Secretary is personally responsible for all expenditures and must provide full documentation.
- **Transparency**: Detailed records of trips and expenses are required to ensure public trust and proper oversight.
- **Timeliness**: Monthly and final accounts must be submitted promptly to maintain financial integrity.

- Internal financial review processes within Parliament.

Failure to comply with the requirements (e.g., submitting timely accounts, providing false or incomplete information) may result in:
