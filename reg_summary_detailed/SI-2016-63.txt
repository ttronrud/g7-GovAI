Certainly. Below is a **detailed and accurate summary** of the regulation you provided, interpreted in the context of Canadian legislative and administrative procedures:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **Regulatory Text:**
> *"Whereas it appears to the Governor in Council that the document set out in the annexed schedule, required by an Act of Parliament to be laid before one or both Houses of Parliament, contains the same information as or less information than is contained in the Public Accounts or in any estimates of expenditures submitted to Parliament;  
> Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board, pursuant to section 157a of the Financial Administration Act, directs that the document set out in the annexed schedule be discontinued, and hereafter it need not be prepared or laid before either House of Parliament."*  
> — S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47; R.S., c. F-11; Canada Revenue Agency Annual Report to Parliament [Canada Revenue Agency Act, S.C. 1999, c. 17, s. 88(1)]

### **1. Purpose and Context**

This regulation serves to **discontinue a specific government report or document** that was previously required to be submitted to Parliament under the authority of an Act of Parliament. The document in question—identified in an annexed schedule—was originally mandated to be laid before one or both Houses of Parliament as a form of financial transparency and accountability.

However, after a review by the Governor in Council (the formal title for the federal executive, acting on advice), it was determined that:

- The document **does not provide new or additional information** beyond what is already available in:
  - The **Public Accounts** (which detail government spending and financial performance), or
  - The **estimates of expenditures** submitted to Parliament during budgetary processes.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The directive is issued under **section 157a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47)**, which grants the Governor in Council the power to:

- Discontinue or modify certain reports or documents that are required to be laid before Parliament,  
- If such documents are found to be redundant, duplicative, or containing no additional value over existing financial disclosures.

This power is exercised **on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board**, which is the senior financial and administrative officer of the federal government. This ensures that the decision is grounded in financial governance and policy consistency.

---

### **3. Key Findings and Justification**

The rationale for discontinuation is based on two key observations:

1. **Redundancy**: The document contains **no new or distinct information** beyond what is already included in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates.  
2. **Inefficiency**: Requiring the preparation and submission of this report adds administrative burden without enhancing transparency or accountability.

By discontinuing the document, the government streamlines its reporting obligations, reduces duplication, and ensures that Parliament receives only the most relevant and comprehensive financial information.

---

### **4. Scope and Effect**

- The directive is **retroactive in effect** only as applied to future submissions.  
- **From the date of enactment**, the document in the annexed schedule:
  - Is **no longer required** to be prepared,
  - Is **no longer required** to be laid before either House of Parliament.

This means that no future version of the document will be produced or submitted as a standalone report.

---

### **5. Legislative References**

- **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47**: The original enabling provision under the Financial Administration Act.
- **R.S., c. F-11**: The current version of the Financial Administration Act in the Revised Statutes of Canada.
- **Canada Revenue Agency Act, S.C. 1999, c. 17, s. 88(1)**: This reference indicates that the regulation applies specifically to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Annual Report. The CRA Annual Report was previously required to be submitted to Parliament, but this regulation effectively removes that requirement due to redundancy.

---

### **6. Implications and Significance**

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary administrative work for government departments and Parliament’s staff.
- **Improved Transparency**: Ensures that Parliament receives only the most relevant financial information, avoiding information overload.
- **Accountability Alignment**: Aligns government reporting with established financial accountability mechanisms (Public Accounts, Budget Estimates).
- **Precedent Setting**: This regulation sets a precedent for future reviews of redundant reports, reinforcing the principle that financial disclosures must add value.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **practical and legally sound decision** to eliminate a redundant financial report. It reflects a commitment to efficient governance, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. By determining that the document in question offers no additional value over existing financial disclosures, the federal government has taken a step toward simplifying its reporting obligations to Parliament while maintaining full accountability.

---

> **Note**: The regulation is not a repeal of the original Act that mandated the report, but rather a **discontinuation of the requirement** under the authority of section 157a of the Financial Administration Act. The underlying Act may still exist, but the specific reporting obligation is now obsolete.

--- 

This summary is consistent with standard Canadian administrative and legislative practices, particularly in the context of financial transparency and the role of Parliament in overseeing public spending.
