### **3. Definition of "Widely Distributed" Debt Obligations**

This section defines when a debt obligation qualifies as "widely distributed," which is a key factor in determining whether a loan is considered a commercial loan and thus subject to certain regulatory treatment.

#### **Applicable Criteria (for debt obligations):**

The debt obligations must meet **at least one** of the following conditions:

1. **Distribution Threshold (90% Rule)**  
   - At least **90% of the maximum authorized principal** of the debt obligations is held by **persons other than the company and its subsidiaries**.  
   - **AND**  
   - The debt was issued to **at least 25 persons other than the company and its subsidiaries** within **six months** of the first issuance.  
   *(Note: Applies only if issued in a single issuance)*

2. **Continuous Issuance (Average Holder Threshold)**  
   - If issued continuously, there must be, **on average**, **at least 25 holders** (excluding the company and its subsidiaries).

3. **Initial Distribution Criteria (Three of Four)**  
   At the time of initial distribution, the debt obligations must meet **at least three** of the following:
   - Initial term **less than one year**  
   - Rated by a **rating agency**  
   - Distributed through a person **authorized to trade in securities**  
   - Distributed in accordance with an **offering circular, memorandum, or similar document**

#### **Applicable Criteria (for other securities)**

For non-debt securities (e.g., equity or other instruments), the following applies:

- The securities must be **listed and posted for trading** on a **recognized stock exchange**, **OR**  
- A **prospectus** relating to the issuance of the securities was filed under the laws of **Canada, a province, or a jurisdiction outside Canada**.

👉 **Purpose**: To distinguish between loans that are broadly distributed (and thus more likely to be commercial in nature) and those that are concentrated or issued to a small group of investors, which may fall outside the scope of commercial loan rules.

---

### **4. Definition of "Maximum Authorized Principal"**

- In relation to any debt obligation, **maximum authorized principal** means the **maximum amount of debt** that may be issued under the terms of the debt obligation or any related agreement.

👉 **Purpose**: Provides a clear benchmark for determining the size and scope of debt instruments when assessing whether they qualify as widely distributed or commercial loans.

---

- A **bank holding company** or an **insurance holding company**  
- A subsidiary of a financial institution (unless the subsidiary is only a financial institution due to its parentage)  
- A subsidiary of a bank holding company or insurance holding company

#### **Prescribed Percentage (Section 505)**  
- The **prescribed percentage** is **5%** — meaning that only subsidiaries holding **5% or more** of a company’s total assets are considered for regulatory scrutiny.

👉 **Note**: This threshold applies to both P&C and marine companies.

---

### **7. Total Assets – Definition (Life Companies, P&C, Marine)**

#### **For Life Companies (Section 503)**  
- **Total assets** = sum of assets that would appear on the company’s balance sheet at a given time, prepared **in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications** set by the **Superintendent of Insurance** under subsection 331(4) of the Act.

#### **For P&C and Marine Companies (Section 505)**

#### **Prescribed Percentage (Section 562)**  
- **If society has ≤ $25 million capital**: 5%  
- **If society has > $25 million capital**: 100%  

👉 **Purpose**: As capital increases, the threshold for triggering regulatory scrutiny increases — from 5% to full ownership (100%) for larger societies.

---

  - **A**: Total assets on the society’s balance sheet (per accounting standards)

- If the **value of its assets in Canada** (for specified classes of insurance) exceeds the sum of its **liabilities in Canada** plus the **margin of assets over liabilities** (as per subsection 608(1)) by **25 million dollars or less**, the **prescribed percentage** of asset value is **5%**.  
- If the excess exceeds **25 million dollars**, the prescribed percentage is **100%**.

👉 **Purpose**: Adjusts regulatory thresholds based on the scale of foreign life companies’ exposure in Canada. Larger exposures trigger stricter ownership and reporting requirements.

#### **Section 617**  
For **foreign property and casualty or marine companies**, the prescribed percentage of asset value in Canada
