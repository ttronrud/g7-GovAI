### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation (as indicated by the text):**

> **Status:** **Repealed**  
> **Legal Citation:** *Statutory Instrument of Canada, SOR/2010-277, Section 79*  
> **Date of Repeal:** 2010 (as part of the official publication of SOR/2010-277)

---

### **Explanation:**

- The repeated line "[Repealed, SOR/2010-277, s. 79]" indicates that **Section 79 of Statutory Instrument 2010-277** was formally **repealed** (i.e., canceled or abolished) by the same instrument.
  
- **SOR/2010-277** is a *Statutory Instrument* issued by the Government of Canada in 2010. Statutory Instruments are secondary legislation that implement or amend primary legislation (such as Acts of Parliament).

- **Section 79** of this instrument was **specifically repealed** — meaning the content of that section no longer exists in force. It was not replaced by a new provision in this instrument or otherwise active in law.

- The **repeal** typically occurs for one of the following reasons:
  - The provision was outdated or redundant.
  - It conflicted with newer legislation.
  - It was superseded by a more current or comprehensive rule.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with constitutional or policy principles.

- Since the text lists the repeal multiple times, it may reflect a **database or system error** or a **repetition in a legal document index**, as no actual content of the section is provided. The repetition does not indicate that the section had multiple provisions or subparts — rather, it likely reflects a formatting or technical issue in the source.

### **Key Takeaway:**

✅ The regulation (Section 79 of SOR/2010-277) has been **officially repealed**.  
❌ No substantive text, purpose, scope, or rules are included in the provided input.  
🔍 The repeated entries are **indicative of repeal status**, not of the regulation's content.
