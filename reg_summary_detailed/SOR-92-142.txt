### **Detailed Summary of the Hall Beach Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Hall Beach Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically in accordance with **Section 5.4** (regulatory implementation) and **Section 5.5** (public consultation). These regulations define spatial restrictions on construction and development around Hall Beach Airport in the Northwest Territories to ensure aviation safety by limiting obstructions to aircraft approaches, take-offs, and flight paths.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

- **Legal Authority**: The regulations were adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the **Canada Gazette, Part I** on **March 9 and 16, 1991**.
  - Two successive issues of the **Nunatsiaq News** on **July 5 and 12, 1991**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., local communities, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Following review of public feedback, the final regulations were approved and formally enacted.

> **Regulation Citation**: The regulations are officially titled the **Hall Beach Airport Zoning Regulations**.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical technical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Hall Beach Airport, located in the vicinity of Hall Beach, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point on the airport used as a reference for measuring elevation and distances. Located on the centerline of runway 124T–304T, 792.5 meters from the threshold of runway 304T. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures that aircraft approaching the runway have a clear path without obstructions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the airport reference point (ARP), unless the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, in which case it is set at 9 meters above ground level. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing zone, including the runway, designated for take-off and landing. For runway 124T–304T, it is 1,705 meters long and 150 meters wide (75 meters on each side of the centerline). |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface. Designed to provide a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: The airport reference point is established at **5.3 meters above sea level**.

---

## **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Hall Beach Airport**, including public road allowances.
- The exact boundaries and areas covered are **specifically described in Part VI of the schedule**.
- The zone of application extends from the airport reference point outward in all directions, forming a defined area of restricted development.

---

## **4. Prohibited Development Activities**

**No person may:**
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures),  
- **Where the highest point of such structure exceeds**:
  1. The **approach surface**,
  2. The **outer surface**, or
  3. The **transitional surface**.

> This restriction ensures that no object (such as trees, towers, buildings, or antennas) will interfere with aircraft during approach, departure, or flight operations.

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **A. Approach Surfaces**

Two approach surfaces are defined—one for each runway end (124T and 304T):

- **Runway 124T Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined plane with a **1:40 slope** (1 meter rise per 40 meters horizontal).
  - Rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
    - 3,000 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.
    - 525 meters from the centerline of the strip on either side.
    - 75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway.

- **Runway 304T Approach Surface**:
  - Same slope (1:40) and geometric configuration as above.
  - Same horizontal distance (3,000 m), lateral offset (525 m), and elevation (75 m above end of runway).

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring sufficient clearance from obstacles.

---

### **B. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the airport reference point (ARP)**.
- **Exception**: If the ground surface is lower than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is defined as **9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface defines the outer boundary of the protected zone and ensures that all structures remain below this elevation to prevent interference with aircraft flying at higher altitudes.

---

### **C. Strip**

- **Length**: 1,705 meters
- **Width**: 150 meters (75 meters on each side of the runway centerline)
- This is the primary operational area for take-offs and landings at runway 124T–304T.

---

### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Rise upward and outward until they intersect with the **outer surface**.
- These surfaces provide a smooth, gradual transition between the runway zone and the outer surface, ensuring continuous clearance.

---

## **6. Boundary of the Protected Area**

- The outer boundary of the regulated land area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **airport reference point (ARP)**.
- This circular boundary encompasses all land within 4 km of the airport, forming a comprehensive safety zone.

## **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: To prevent obstructions to aircraft during take-off, landing, and approach phases by establishing clear elevation and spatial boundaries.
2. **Compliance with Aviation Standards**: To align with international aviation safety standards (such as those from ICAO and Canadian aviation authorities).
3. **Public and Environmental Protection**: To safeguard both the airport infrastructure and surrounding communities from potential hazards due to uncontrolled development.
4. **Consistency with Existing Planning**: The regulations are based on the **Hall Beach Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2740**, dated August 3, 1989, ensuring continuity and alignment with prior planning decisions.

---

## **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Any construction or development that violates these limits may be subject to:
  - Fines,
  - Orders to remove or modify structures,
  - Legal action,
  - Rejection of development permits.

---

## **Conclusion**

The **Hall Beach Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use around Hall Beach Airport. By defining precise **elevation limits**, **geometric surfaces**, and **spatial boundaries**, the regulations ensure that aircraft operations remain safe and unimpeded. The rules are grounded in technical aviation principles and are designed to protect both the integrity of airport operations and the safety of the surrounding environment and population.

These regulations represent a critical step in the regulatory oversight of remote Arctic airports, where space, terrain, and environmental factors require careful planning and strict adherence to aviation safety standards.
