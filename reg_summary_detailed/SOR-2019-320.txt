**Detailed Summary of the Major Works Order (S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 61(4))**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the **Canadian Navigable Waters Act (CNWA)**, specifically **paragraph 28(2)(b)(a)**, which empowers the **Minister of Transport** to designate certain works as "major works" if they are likely to **substantially interfere with navigation** on navigable waters in Canada.

The purpose of this Order is to **identify and classify specific types of infrastructure and structures** that are considered major works under the CNWA. By doing so, it ensures that such projects undergo appropriate regulatory review—particularly through the **Impact Assessment Act (IAA)**—to assess their potential effects on water navigation, environmental conditions, and public safety.

The Order was issued on **August 9, 2019**, and came into force on **August 28, 2019** (as noted in the SI/2019-86), coinciding with the coming into force of subsection 61(4) of the *Impact Assessment Act* and related amendments to the *Navigation Protection Act*.

### **Key Designated Major Works**

The following categories of structures and activities are officially designated as **major works** under this Order:

---

#### **1. Dams**
A dam is considered a major work if it meets **both** of the following criteria:
- It is capable of **impounding at least 30,000 cubic meters (m³)** of water; and  
- It is **at least 2.5 meters high**, measured from the **bed of the navigable water**.

> *Rationale:* Dams significantly alter water levels, flow patterns, and sediment transport, which can disrupt navigation, affect aquatic ecosystems, and impact downstream water availability.

---

#### **2. Water Diversion Structures**
Any structure that:
- Is **placed across a navigable water**,  
- **Diverts water** from one navigable water into another, and  
- **Changes the water level or flow** of at least one of those navigable waters  

is designated as a major work.

> *Example:* A canal or channel that redirects river flow to a reservoir or another river system.

> *Rationale:* Such diversions can alter flow regimes, reduce navigable depths, or cause flooding or drying in other areas, thereby posing risks to navigation.

---

#### **3. Ferry Cables**
Any **cable, rod, chain, or other device** placed across, over, under, or within a navigable water to operate a ferry is considered a major work.

> *Definition clarification:* The term includes all types of ferry support systems, even if not permanently fixed.

> *Rationale:* Ferry cables can obstruct navigation, especially in narrow or high-traffic waterways, and may require careful planning to avoid collisions or disruptions during operation.

---

#### **4. Bridges**
The following types of bridges are designated as major works:
- **Movable span bridges** (e.g., bascules, elevating bridges);  
- **Floating span bridges** (bridges built on floating, anchored foundations);  
- **Fixed span bridges with one or more piers below the ordinary high water mark.**

> *Rationale:*  
> - Movable bridges may require frequent opening/closing, affecting traffic and navigation.  
> - Floating bridges may shift or impact water flow and stability.  
> - Piers below the ordinary high water mark are particularly intrusive because they extend into active navigation zones, potentially obstructing vessels.

---

#### **5. Temporary Works**
Temporary structures or installations that:
- Are used for **construction, placement, alteration, rebuilding, removal, decommissioning, repair, or maintenance** of a bridge;  
- Are installed for a **period of at least 30 consecutive days**  

are designated as major works — **unless** they are installed during a period when **navigation is not possible** (e.g., during seasonal dry periods or in remote areas with no vessel traffic).

> *Rationale:* Even temporary works can disrupt navigation if they are present for an extended period and obstruct waterways. The exception allows for flexibility in remote or low-traffic zones where no navigational risk exists.

---

#### **6. Causeways**
Any **causeway placed across a navigable water** is designated as a major work.

> *Rationale:* Causeways can block navigation, reduce water flow, and create barriers for aquatic species and vessel passage.

---

#### **7. Aquaculture Facilities**
Any **aquaculture facility** located in or across a navigable water is designated as a major work.

> *Rationale:* While aquaculture supports food production, these facilities can alter water quality, sediment dynamics, and flow patterns, and may pose physical obstructions or environmental risks to navigation.

---

### **Regulatory Timeline and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force** on the day that **subsection 61(4) of the Impact Assessment Act** comes into force.  
- If the Order is **registered later** than that day, it will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the designation of major works aligns with the broader regulatory framework requiring environmental and navigational impact assessments.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

This Major Works Order serves several key functions:

1. **Navigation Protection**: It identifies projects that are likely to interfere with the safe and efficient movement of vessels on Canadian navigable waters.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: By classifying certain works as "major," the Order triggers mandatory **impact assessments** under the *Impact Assessment Act*, ensuring that environmental, social, and navigational consequences are thoroughly evaluated before proceeding.
3. **Legal Clarity**: It provides clear, actionable definitions for what constitutes a major work, reducing ambiguity in project planning and permitting decisions.
4. **Consistency with National Policy**: The Order supports Canada’s commitment to sustainable development and the protection of navigable waters, in line with broader environmental and transportation policies.

---

### **Key Exceptions**

- Temporary works are **exempt** from being classified as major works **only if** they are installed during a period when **navigation is not possible** (e.g., dry seasons, closed waterways).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a comprehensive and legally binding framework for identifying infrastructure projects that could significantly affect navigation on Canada’s waterways. By clearly defining what constitutes a "major work," it ensures that high-impact projects are subject to rigorous environmental and navigational assessments. This enhances public safety, protects aquatic ecosystems, and supports responsible development in Canada’s water-based transportation network.
