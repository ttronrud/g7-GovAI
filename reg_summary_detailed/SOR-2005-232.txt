**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation, made under **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act (S.C. 1996, c. 10)**, authorizes the **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Industry, responsible for the Competition Bureau) to intervene in a **critical transportation dispute** affecting the national transportation system in British Columbia.

The core issue is an **extraordinary disruption** to the effective operation of the national transportation system—specifically, the **disruption of container movements into and out of key ports in British Columbia**—caused by a dispute between **truckers, shippers, brokers, and port authorities**. This disruption is not due to labor strikes but rather stems from a commercial or contractual conflict involving the movement of containers by truck.

The government determines that **failure to act immediately would harm users and operators** of the transportation system and that **no other existing legal provisions are sufficient** to resolve the crisis. Therefore, this Order is a temporary, emergency measure to stabilize the system by enabling negotiations and agreements that restore normal operations.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**: The Order is issued pursuant to **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**, which grants the Governor in Council the power to take any step deemed essential to stabilize the national transportation system when an extraordinary disruption occurs.
  
- **Emergency Nature**: The disruption is declared "extraordinary" and non-labor-related. The government asserts that without intervention, significant economic and logistical damage would result.

- **Exemption from Competition Act Constraints**:  
  The persons authorized under this Order—such as truckers, shippers, brokers, port authorities, and facilitators—are **exempt from the usual anti-competitive provisions of the Competition Act** during the designated period. This allows them to negotiate freely without fear of being challenged for price-fixing, market allocation, or other anti-competitive conduct.

### **Key Requirements for Port Authorities (Vancouver and Fraser River)**

#### **Vancouver Port Authority (VPA)**

- Must establish a **licensing system** for trucks and road equipment accessing the **Port of Vancouver**.
- Two **mandatory conditions** for any license application:
  1. The applicant must be a **signatory to the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA)** dated **July 29, 2005**, between Trucking Companies (Owners/Brokers) and the Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association.
  2. The applicant must be in **full compliance** with that agreement.
  3. The applicant must **accept the arbitration process** outlined in **Section 10 of the MoA** for resolving disputes related to license interpretation or application.
- **Prohibition**: No truck or equipment may be granted access to the Port of Vancouver unless it meets these conditions.
- The VPA is **exempt from Competition Act constraints** when implementing these directives.

> **Note**: This provision does *not* affect any existing **collective labour agreements**.

#### **Fraser River Port Authority (FRPA)**

- Must establish a **similar licensing system** for access to the **Port of Fraser River**.
- Same two mandatory conditions as for the VPA:
  1. Signatory to the July 29, 2005 MoA and in full compliance.
  2. Acceptance of the arbitration process under Section 10 of the MoA.
- Access to the port is **prohibited** for any equipment that fails to meet these requirements.
- Also **exempt from Competition Act restrictions** during this period.

> **Additional Provision**:  
> The FRPA is **not prohibited** from recognizing a license issued by the Vancouver Port Authority as valid for access to the Fraser River port. This promotes coordination and consistency between the two ports.

### **Compliance and Enforcement**

- Any party involved in the movement of containers into or out of a port who is a party to an agreement must **comply with the rates, charges, and terms** established through the negotiated agreement under this Order.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Emergency Intervention**:  
   This is a rare and powerful use of Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act, allowing the federal government to bypass normal market rules to address a systemic crisis.

2. **Stabilization of Critical Infrastructure**:  
   By enabling negotiations and establishing licensing requirements tied to compliance with a pre-existing agreement, the Order aims to restore reliability in container transport—a vital component of supply chains and economic activity.

3. **Balancing Competition and Stability**:  
   The exemption from the Competition Act ensures that negotiations can proceed without fear of being challenged as anti-competitive, while still preserving the integrity of market-based agreements.

4. **Precedent for Future Disputes**:  
   This Order sets a precedent for how the federal government may respond to extraordinary disruptions in transportation systems, particularly when commercial disputes threaten national economic stability.

5. **Labor Agreements Remain Separate**:  
   The Order explicitly states that it **does not affect collective labor agreements**, preserving the role of labor relations in the sector.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, time-limited emergency measure designed to **stabilize the national transportation system** by authorizing negotiations between key stakeholders involved in container transport into and out of major British Columbia ports. It enables the establishment of a licensing regime based on compliance with a 2005 agreement, promotes dispute resolution through arbitration, and provides a temporary exemption from competition law to facilitate swift and effective action. While it addresses a critical transportation crisis, it remains focused on restoring operational continuity without altering broader labor or market frameworks.

**Final Note**: This Order is not a long-term solution but a **temporary intervention** to manage an acute disruption. Its success will depend on the outcomes of negotiations and the ability of the facilitator to reach a binding agreement among all parties within the 90-day window.
