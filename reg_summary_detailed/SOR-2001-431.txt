## 🚫 **Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

### 1. **Prohibited Entities for Investment or Control**
A company **shall not**, through specialized financing activities:
- Acquire control of, or hold, acquire, or increase a substantial investment in:
  - Any entity listed in **paragraphs 453(1)(a) to (j)** of the TLC Act (e.g., entities involved in certain high-risk or non-financial activities).
  - An entity **primarily engaged in leasing motor vehicles in Canada** for the purpose of extending credit or financing customer acquisition.
  - An entity **primarily engaged in providing temporary possession** of personal property (including motor vehicles) for purposes other than financing acquisition.
  - An entity that **acts as an insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

> These restrictions aim to prevent companies from engaging in activities that could lead to systemic risk, fraud, or misalignment with core financial stability objectives.

---

### 2. **Maximum Holding Period: 13 Consecutive Years**
- A company **shall not** hold control of, or maintain a substantial investment in, an entity via specialized financing activities for **more than 13 consecutive years**.

> This rule prevents long-term, passive ownership in potentially risky or opaque entities and promotes diversification and market responsiveness.

> **Exception**: The period before an entity becomes a specialized financing entity is **not counted** under this rule (see below).

---

### 3. **Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Threshold: $250 Million**
- A company **shall not** acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in, an entity if the **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held (or to be held) by:
  - The company,
  - Any subsidiary of the company,
  - Any specialized financing entity of the company,
  > **exceeds $250 million**.

> This cap limits the scale of concentrated exposure to any single entity, reducing concentration risk.

---

### 4. **Regulatory Capital Thresholds (10% and 25%)**

#### ✅ **10% Threshold (for control or investment in entities)**
The sum of the following **must not exceed 10% of the company’s regulatory capital**:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests the company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the target entity.
2. The aggregate value of outstanding loans made by the company and its subsidiaries to the specialized financing entities of the company.
3. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests held by the company and its subsidiaries in:
   - Specialized financing entities of the company,
   - Entities controlled by the company via specialized financing,
   - Entities in which the company holds a substantial investment via specialized financing.

> This ensures that financing activities do not overburden a company’s capital base.

#### ✅ **25% Threshold (for control or investment in entities controlled by SFEs)**
The sum of the following **must not exceed 25% of the company’s regulatory capital**:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests held by the company and its subsidiaries in:
   - The specialized financing entity,
   - Entities controlled by that SFE,
   - Entities in which that SFE holds a substantial investment.
2. The aggregate value of outstanding loans made by the company and its subsidiaries to:
   - The specialized financing entity,
   - Entities controlled by that SFE,
   - Entities in which that SFE holds a substantial investment.

> This rule applies when the company’s investment is routed through a specialized financing entity and helps prevent excessive risk concentration in downstream entities.

#### ✅ **25% Threshold (for direct investment in non-SFE entities)**
A company **shall not** acquire control or make a substantial investment in an entity (other than through a specialized financing entity it controls) if the sum of the following exceeds **25% of the company’s regulatory capital**:
1. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests the company and subsidiaries would acquire in the entity.
2. The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests held in entities controlled by the company via specialized financing (excluding those acquired through SFEs).
3. The aggregate value of outstanding loans made to such entities (excluding those made through SFEs).

> This prevents companies from using indirect structures to circumvent capital limits.

## ⚖️ **Additional Restrictions on Specialized Financing Entities (SFEs)**

A company **shall not** acquire control of, or hold a substantial investment in, a specialized financing entity **if any of the following conditions are met**:

### 1. **Debt-to-Asset Ratio Limit**
- The **value of outstanding debt obligations** (excluding those owed to the company or entities controlled by it) of the SFE and any SFEs it controls, as reported on **unconsolidated balance sheets**, must **not exceed twice** the value of:
  - The excess of assets over liabilities of the SFE (on unconsolidated basis),
  - The value of **non-controlling interests** in the SFE (on a consolidated basis).

> This ensures that SFEs remain financially sound and do not carry excessive leverage.

### 2. **Prohibition on Holding in Prohibited Entities**
- The SFE must **not** control or hold ownership in any of the entities listed in paragraphs 3(a) to (d) of the regulations (e.g., leasing, temporary possession, insurance brokerage).

> Prevents SFEs from engaging in high-risk or non-financial activities.

### 3. **$250 Million Threshold for Ownership in Downstream Entities**
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/ownership interests (excluding those held by the SFE in another SFE it controls) that the company, the SFE, its subsidiaries, and other SFEs hold or would hold in an entity controlled by or invested in by the SFE, **must not exceed $250 million**.

> Limits exposure in nested financing structures.

### 4. **10% Regulatory Capital Threshold for SFEs**
- The sum of the values under paragraphs (6)(a) to (c) must **not exceed 10% of the company’s regulatory capital**.

> Reinforces capital adequacy for SFEs.

### 5. **25% Regulatory Capital Threshold for SFEs**
- The sum of values under paragraphs (7)(1)(a) and (b) must **not exceed 25% of the company’s regulatory capital**.

> Prevents overexposure to SFEs and their downstream holdings.

## ⏳ **Consecutive Holding Period Rule (13 Years)**

- A company **shall not** hold control of or a substantial investment in a specialized financing entity **for more than 13 consecutive years**, unless:
  - The entity was previously controlled by the company or another SFE of the company, and
  - The period prior to becoming a specialized financing entity is **not counted**.

> This prevents long-term, static ownership in entities that may become outdated or risky.

> **Exception**: If a specialized financing entity previously held control of or had a
