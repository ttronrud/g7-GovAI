## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (1986)**

### 📌 **Background and Legal Basis**
- **Issued by**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour.
- **Legal Authority**: Sections 82*, 83*, and subsection 106(1)* of the *Canada Labour Code*.
- **Purpose**: To replace a suite of outdated and fragmented safety regulations with a **unified, modern, and comprehensive occupational safety and health framework**.
- **Effective Date**: March 31, 1986.
- **Status**: Repealed in part by SOR/2002-208 (s. 2), and further amendments or repeals have occurred since (e.g., SOR/2019-243, SOR/2021-118).

> This regulation consolidates and replaces **18 previous regulations** (including boiler, electrical, fire, confined spaces, first aid, noise, and more), creating a single, coherent set of rules governing workplace safety and health across Canada.

## 🏗️ **Core Principles and Scope**

### 1. **Applicability**
- Applies to **all employers and employees** in workplaces where safety and health risks exist.
- **Exception**: Does **not apply** to:
  - Employees on **trains in operation**.
  - Employees on **aircraft in flight**.
  - Employees on **ships**.
  - Employees working in oil/gas exploration or production in frontier lands (covered by the *Oil and Gas Occupational Safety and Health Regulations*).
  - Workplaces excluded by an order under section 123.1 of the Canada Labour Code.

> This ensures that the regulation does not overreach into areas governed by other specialized laws.

---

### 2. **Application to Trainees and Contractors**
- Applies to **non-employees** (e.g., trainees, apprentices, contractors) who perform work **to gain knowledge or experience**, as if they were actual employees.
- All provisions must be interpreted and applied **as if the person were an employee**.

> This ensures that even temporary or learning-based workers are protected under the same safety standards.

---

### 3. **Recordkeeping Requirements**
- Employers must **maintain and keep accessible** records of workplace safety incidents, hazards, and compliance activities.
- Records must be **readily available** for inspection by:
  - The **Head of Compliance and Enforcement**
  - The **Workplace Committee**
  - The **Health and Safety Representative** (if one exists)

> Ensures transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in safety practices.

---

### 4. **Conflict Resolution: Precedence of Provisions**
- If there is a **conflict between a standard incorporated by reference** (e.g., CSA, ANSI) and a direct provision in the regulation, **the direct provision in the regulation prevails**.

> This prevents ambiguity and ensures that the core safety objectives of the regulation are not undermined by conflicting standards.

---

## 🎯 **Accessibility and Inclusivity: Special Needs and Alternate Media**

A significant innovation in this regulation is its **commitment to accessibility**.

### Key Provisions:
- **Special Need**: A condition that impairs an employee’s ability to receive safety information, instruction, or training (e.g., visual, hearing, mobility impairments).
- **Alternate Media**: Any method to deliver safety information, including:
  - Braille
  - Large print
  - Audio tapes
  - Computer discs
  - Sign language
  - Verbal communication

> Employers must provide safety information in **accessible formats** when employees have special needs.

### Specific Requirements:
- **Signs or markings** must be **visible or audible** to employees with special needs.
- **Warnings** (not just signs) must be delivered in a way that **effectively communicates danger**.
- **Labels, defect tags, or lockout tags** do **not** need alternate media — only the **information delivery** must be accessible.

> This reflects a shift toward **inclusive workplace safety** and compliance with human rights principles.

## 🏢 **Building and Structural Safety Standards**

This section establishes **minimum safety standards for buildings and structures**, with a strong emphasis on **fall prevention, clearances, and structural integrity**.

### Key Provisions:

#### 1. **Compliance with National Building Codes**
- All **new buildings** (construction beginning on or after March 31, 1986) must meet the **National Building Code of Canada (1995)**.
- Existing buildings must **if feasible**, meet these requirements.
- **Renovations** must also meet the code if feasible.
- If not feasible, the employer must **notify** the workplace committee or health and safety representative **before starting work**.

> Ensures that all physical workspaces are designed with safety in mind from the outset.

#### 2. **Door and Passageway Safety**
- **Double-action swinging doors** in high-traffic areas (e.g., wheelchair access) must allow users to **see people on both sides**.
- The **area of hazard** created by an open door must be clearly marked.
- If an open door **reduces passageway width below code requirements**, either:
  - A **warning sign** must be posted, or
  - A **highly visible barricade** must be placed to block access.

> Prevents accidents due to unexpected movement or blocked pathways.

#### 3. **Clearances and Projections**
- Any **awning, canopy, or overhang** projecting over an exterior passageway must allow a **minimum clearance of 2.2 meters** between the surface and the lowest projection.

> Prevents falls from overhanging structures.

#### 4. **Guardrails and Fall Protection**
- Where employees have access to:
  - A **wall opening** with a drop >1.2 m, or
  - A **floor opening**,  
  → **Highly visible guardrails** must be installed OR the opening must be **covered with load-bearing material**.

> Guardrails must be securely fastened to structural members.

> **Exception**: Vehicle maintenance pits and loading/unloading areas with visible edges are exempt.

#### 5. **Open-Top Enclosures (Bins, Hoppers, Vats, Pits)**
- If an employee can access an open-top enclosure from above:
  - Must be **covered** with a **grating, screen, or walkway** (≥500 mm wide with visible guardrails), or
  - Must have a **fixed ladder** if not covered.

> The covering must support:
- The **maximum load** that may be brought to bear, **and**
- A **live load of 6 kPa** (a standard engineering load)

> Prevents falls and structural failure.

#### 6. **Fixed Ladders and Stairways**
- **Required** when moving between levels more than **450 mm higher or lower**.
- Ladders must be:
  - **Highly visible** or clearly marked.
  - Installed with **three-point contact** (hands and feet) while ascending/descending.
  - Tools must be carried in **secure pouches or holsters**.

> Safety during movement between levels is prioritized.

#### 7. **Emergency Exits in Grain-Handling Facilities**
- All grain-handling facilities with manlifts or ladders to bins/silos must have a **secondary emergency exit** — a **fixed exterior ladder** meeting specific CSA standards (B 311-M197
