The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation 2017-84**, section 1, issued by the Government of Canada.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2017-84, section 1*
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of Regulation 2017-84 in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR), which is the official journal for federal regulations.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 explicitly repeals a prior regulation. While the specific name or subject matter of the original regulation is not included in your input, the repeated citation suggests that the repealed regulation was likely a rule related to a specific area of federal administration — possibly in the area of environmental protection, safety standards, or licensing — depending on the context of SOR/2017-84.

### What Does "Repealed" Mean?
When a regulation is repealed:
- It is officially removed from the legal framework.
- It is no longer enforceable or applicable.
- Any provisions, obligations, or requirements previously set out in the regulation are no longer in force.
- The repeal may be part of a broader legislative or administrative update to streamline, modernize, or replace outdated rules with more current or efficient ones.

### Context of SOR/2017-84:
SOR/2017-84 is a **Supplement to the Canada Gazette**, which typically contains amendments, corrections, or repeals of federal regulations. Without the full text of SOR/2017-84, we cannot identify the exact subject of the repealed regulation. However, such repeals are common in areas like:
- Environmental management
- Workplace safety
- Transportation standards
- Licensing and permits
- Food and drug regulations

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in your query has been **officially repealed** under *SOR/2017-84, section 1*. It is no longer in effect. To determine the original subject or purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2017-84. Since the original regulation is no longer active, it does not currently impose any legal obligations or requirements.
