## 🔍 OVERVIEW

This regulation outlines the **definitions, classifications, and procedural rules** governing the eligibility, calculation, and payment of superannuation and pension benefits under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*. It defines who qualifies as an employee, what constitutes full-time or part-time work, how pensions are structured, and how contributions and installments are managed — especially in cases where employees choose to pay into the Superannuation Account in installments rather than making lump-sum contributions.

- It was largely **in effect prior to 2016**, and many of its principles may have been incorporated into updated legislation or administrative guidelines.
