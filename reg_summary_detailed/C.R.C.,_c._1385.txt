**Detailed Summary of the *Urban Development and Transportation Plans Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- These regulations are officially known as the **Urban Development and Transportation Plans Regulations**.
- They are enacted under the authority of the **Railway Relocation and Crossing Act (the "Act")**, which provides the legal framework for funding the preparation of transportation and urban development plans.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Railway Relocation and Crossing Act*, which governs the funding and approval processes for transportation and urban development planning activities.

---

### **3. Eligible Costs for Payment Under Subsection 3(3) of the Act**
Payments authorized under subsection 3(3) of the Act are limited to **additional costs** that:
- Are **in excess of the normal operating costs** of the recipient (i.e., the entity preparing the plan), and
- Were **incurred specifically in the preparation of the plan**, as determined by the relevant Minister.

#### **Cost Eligibility by Plan Type:**
- **Transportation Plan**:
  - Costs must be approved by the **Minister of Transport** as having been incurred in preparing the plan.
- **Urban Development Plan**:
  - Costs must be approved by the **Minister of State for Urban Affairs** as having been incurred in preparing the plan.

> ⚠️ **Exclusion of Interest Costs**:  
> Any interest paid on funds borrowed during the preparation of the plan is **not included** in the calculation of eligible additional costs. This ensures that only direct, preparatory expenses are considered for reimbursement.

### **4. Conditions for Authorization of Payment**
A payment may be authorized under subsection 3(3) of the Act **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

#### **Condition 1: Prior Ministerial Approval**
- Before the preparation of the plan begins, the relevant Minister must have:
  - Approved the **proposed preparation** of the plan (i.e., the scope and intent).
  - Approved the **terms of reference** (i.e., objectives, boundaries, and key issues the plan will address).

> - For a **transportation plan**: Approval by the **Minister of Transport**.
> - For an **urban development plan**: Approval by the **Minister of State for Urban Affairs**.

#### **Condition 2: Access to Financial Records**
- The recipient (the entity responsible for preparing the plan) must have **granted access** at any time to the Minister of Transport or the Minister of State for Urban Affairs to:
  - Inspect and audit:
    - Receipts
    - Financial records
    - Other documentation related to the costs incurred in preparing the plan.

> This requirement ensures **transparency, accountability, and verification** of expenditures.

#### **Condition 3: Treasury Board Approval (for payments over $250,000)**
- If the total payment for the preparation of the plan (or plans) exceeds **$250,000**, **prior approval from the Treasury Board** is required.

> - This applies to:
>   - A transportation plan
>   - An urban development plan
>   - A combination of both a transportation and urban development plan **for the same transportation study area**

> The $250,000 threshold acts as a **financial control mechanism**, ensuring that larger expenditures undergo additional governmental scrutiny.

---

### **5. Joint Allocation of Funds When Multiple Plans Are Prepared**
- If **both a transportation plan and an urban development plan** are prepared for the **same transportation study area**, and payment has been authorized under the Act and these Regulations:
  - The **Minister of Transport** and the **Minister of State for Urban Affairs** must **jointly determine** how the total payment is divided between the two plans.
  - This ensures **coordinated funding** and prevents duplication or misallocation of resources.

> Example: If a combined study area includes both transit improvements and land-use changes, the Ministers must agree on the proportion of the funding allocated to each plan.

---

### **6. Flexibility in Timing of Payments**
- The relevant Minister (Minister of Transport or Minister of State for Urban Affairs, or both) may authorize **multiple payments over time** under subsection 3(3) of the Act.
- These payments can be made for **portions of the plan preparation** even **before the plan is fully completed**.

> This allows for:
> - Phased funding
> - Support during different stages of planning (e.g., feasibility studies, data collection, stakeholder consultations)
> - More responsive and adaptive financial support throughout the planning lifecycle
