### **Overview**

This regulation, originally enacted under the *Excise Tax Act* (S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12), establishes the **legal requirements for how a taxable supplier must disclose the Goods and Services Tax (GST)** to the recipient of a taxable supply. The regulation was designed to ensure transparency and consumer awareness regarding the inclusion of GST in the price of goods and services.

However, it is important to note that **this regulation has been repealed** by *SOR/2002-277, s. 14*, meaning it is no longer in force as of the date of repeal. This repeal reflects changes in the Canadian tax regime, particularly in how GST disclosure is administered.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### 1. **General Rule for GST Disclosure (Subsection 223(1))**
> *"The prescribed manner is giving clearly visible notice to the recipient of a taxable supply at the place where the supply is made."*

- **Purpose**: To ensure that consumers are clearly informed that a taxable supply includes GST.
- **Requirement**: The notice must be:
  - **Clearly visible** (e.g., posted in a prominent location, such as a sign or label).
  - **Provided at the place of supply** (i.e., where the service or product is delivered or used).
  - **Visible to the recipient** at the time of the transaction.
- **Applicability**: Applies to all taxable supplies unless an exception is provided.

> *Example*: A retail store selling goods must display a clear sign stating "All prices include GST" at the point of sale.

#### 2. **Special Case: Coin-Operated Telephone Service**
> *"In the case of a supply of a telephone service made by means of a coin-operated telephone, the prescribed manner is either the manner set out in subsection (1) or giving notice in the telephone directories issued by the supplier of the rates of tax set out in subsection 165.1(1) of the Excise Tax Act."*

- **Context**: This applies to telephone services accessed via coin-operated phones (e.g., in public places like restaurants or airports).
- **Options for compliance**:
  1. **Clear visible notice** at the location of the phone (as per general rule).
  2. **Notice in the telephone directories** (e.g., local phone books) published by the supplier, stating the GST rate applicable to the service.
- **Legal Basis**: The tax rate is defined in subsection 165.1(1) of the Excise Tax Act.
- **Rationale**: Since coin-operated phones are often not in direct contact with the customer, the directories provide an alternative method of public disclosure.

> *Example*: A phone booth in a mall must either have a visible sign saying "Tax included" or list the GST rate in the local telephone directory.

#### 3. **Special Case: Parking Space with Coin Payment**
> *"In the case of a supply of a parking space for which the consideration is paid by depositing coins in a parking meter, the prescribed manner is either the manner set out in subsection (1) or giving public notice that the price for the supply includes the tax."*

- **Context**: When a customer pays for parking using a coin in a parking meter.
- **Options for compliance**:
  1. **Clear visible notice** at the parking meter (as per general rule).
  2. **Public notice** (e.g., posted in a visible area such as a parking lot sign or in a public bulletin) that the price includes GST.
- **Rationale**: The payment is made via coins, and the consumer may not be aware of tax inclusion. Public notice ensures transparency.

> *Example*: A parking meter must either have a visible sign stating "All prices include GST" or have a public notice in the parking area indicating that the price includes tax.

### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Consumer Protection**: The regulation aims to prevent consumer confusion by ensuring that the tax component of a price is clearly communicated.
- **Enforcement**: Suppliers who fail to comply may face administrative penalties or be subject to audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
- **Flexibility**: The regulation allows for alternative methods of disclosure (e.g., directories, public notices) in specific contexts where direct visibility is impractical.
- **Repeal Context**: The repeal of this regulation in 2002 indicates that Canada has transitioned to a more modern and comprehensive GST disclosure framework. Current rules (under the *GST/HST Act*) now provide broader and more flexible disclosure requirements, often relying on clear labeling at point of sale or through digital interfaces.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation historically established the **required methods for disclosing GST** in specific types of transactions — particularly in coin-operated telephone services and parking meters — by mandating either visible signage or public notice. While it served an important role in ensuring tax transparency, it is now **repealed** and superseded by updated provisions in the modern tax regime.

**Note**: As of 2002, this regulation is **no longer in effect**. Current GST disclosure obligations are governed by the *Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax Act* (GST/HST Act), which provides more detailed and up-to-date rules on how suppliers must communicate tax inclusion in pricing.

**Recommendation for Practitioners**:  
When dealing with similar services today, refer to the current *GST/HST Act* and CRA guidance on disclosure, which emphasize clear, visible, and accessible tax information at the point of sale or service delivery.
