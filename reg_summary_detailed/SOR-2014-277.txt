Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Background and Context**
The regulation stems from a recognition that **Prince Edward Island (PEI)** has established **provincial legislative measures** to protect consumers who obtain payday loans. Specifically:
- PEI has enacted laws that **limit the total cost of borrowing** under payday loan agreements.
- These protections are designed to prevent predatory lending practices and ensure that borrowers are not subjected to excessively high interest rates or fees.

The **Lieutenant Governor in Council** (a key executive body in PEI) has formally requested that the **Governor in Council** (the highest executive authority in Canada) designate Prince Edward Island as a jurisdiction eligible to apply certain provisions of the **Criminal Code of Canada**—specifically, **section 347.1a**—which deals with criminal interest rate provisions.

This request is based on the principle that where a province has robust, enforceable consumer protection laws governing interest rates and borrowing costs, the federal government may allow those provinces to operate under a more flexible or protective framework under federal criminal interest rate rules.

---

#### **2. Legal Authority**
The Order is made under **subsection 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code of Canada** (S.C. 2007, c. 9, s. 2; R.S., c. C-46).  
This subsection grants the Governor in Council the power to **designate a province** for the purposes of the federal criminal interest rate provisions in the Criminal Code, **provided that the province has appropriate legislative safeguards in place**.

The designation allows the province to be treated as if it has adopted the federal criminal interest rate rules—specifically, those related to **unlawful interest rates**—but only **if the province has enacted its own consumer protection laws** that are equivalent in scope and effect.

---

#### **3. Key Provision of the Order**
> **Prince Edward Island is designated for the purposes of section 347.1 of the Criminal Code.**

This means:
- The **federal criminal interest rate provisions** (specifically those in section 347.1) will **apply in PEI**.
- However, this application is **conditional** and **not automatic**—it only takes effect when PEI’s own legislation and regulations are fully in force and functioning as intended.

---

#### **4. Conditions for Effectiveness**
The Order **does not come into force immediately**. It only becomes effective when **all of the following are simultaneously in force**:
1. **Sections 6 to 8 and 30 of the Payday Loans Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, Cap. P-2.1**  
   - These sections establish:
     - Maximum interest rates and fees allowed on payday loans.
     - Requirements for disclosure of loan terms.
     - Provisions to protect borrowers from excessive or deceptive lending practices.
     - Rules on the total cost of borrowing (e.g., caps on total finance charges).

2. **Section 24 of the Payday Loans Act Regulations, EC2013-67**  
   - This regulation provides **operational details** for implementing the above provisions, such as:
     - Specific definitions of interest and fees.
     - Procedures for calculating total borrowing costs.
     - Requirements for lenders to provide borrowers with clear, standardized information.

These legislative and regulatory measures are essential because they demonstrate that PEI has **adequate, enforceable consumer protections** in place—meeting the threshold required under the federal Criminal Code for designation.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force at **12:00 a.m. Atlantic time** on the **first day** when **both the Act and the Regulations are fully in force**.  
This ensures that the federal criminal interest rate provisions are only applied when PEI's own regulatory framework is operational and enforceable.

---

#### **6. Important Note: "Order not in force"**
The regulation explicitly states:  
> **[Note: Order not in force.]**

This is a **critical clarification**. Despite the formal designation being made, the Order is **not currently active or enforceable**.  
This likely means that as of the date of the document, **the required provincial legislation and regulations have not yet been fully enacted or are not yet in force**.  
Therefore, the designation does not yet trigger the application of section 347.1 of the Criminal Code in PEI.

This note reflects a **pragmatic and conditional approach**—the federal government is not applying criminal penalties for high-interest lending in PEI unless the province has fully implemented its own protective regime.

---

### **Conclusion and Significance**
This regulation:
- Demonstrates **intergovernmental cooperation** between federal and provincial authorities in consumer protection.
- Reflects a **flexible approach** to the Criminal Code’s interest rate provisions, allowing provinces with strong consumer protection laws to operate under more lenient or protective federal rules.
- Highlights that **federal criminal provisions are not automatically applied**—they are **conditional** on the existence of robust provincial legislation.
- Serves as a **prelude or framework** for future enforcement, should PEI’s Payday Loans Act and Regulations become fully operational.

This designation is a **forward-looking policy tool**, intended to protect consumers in PEI by aligning federal criminal provisions with provincial safeguards—only when those safeguards are fully in place and functioning. Until then, the federal criminal interest rate rules do not apply in the province.
