**Background and Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), specifically:

- **Subsection 91(6)** of the FAA: This provision allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on behalf of the Crown) to approve transactions when it is satisfied that a designated entity (in this case, Canadian National Railway Company) is legally and operationally empowered to carry them out.
- **Paragraphs 91(1)(a)** of the FAA: This grants the Governor in Council the power to make orders authorizing certain financial or corporate actions, including the incorporation of subsidiaries, when recommended by the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board.

The Order is made on the **recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**, indicating a collaborative federal decision-making process involving key departments responsible for transportation infrastructure and financial oversight.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail)** to proceed with the **incorporation of two wholly-owned subsidiaries** under the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*.

This authorization enables CN Rail to establish new legal entities that will operate as fully owned affiliates, allowing for more specialized operations, improved governance, or strategic business structuring—such as managing specific rail operations, logistics services, or infrastructure projects.

The Order explicitly authorizes the Canadian National Railway Company to:

- Procure the **incorporation of two wholly-owned subsidiaries**:

  2. **173336 CANADA INC**

These entities will be formed under the *Canada Business Corporations Act*, which is the primary legislation governing the formation and operation of private corporations in Canada. As wholly-owned subsidiaries, they will be directly controlled by CN Rail and will have no independent ownership or voting rights outside of CN Rail’s control.

**Timeline and Compliance Requirement:**  
The transactions described in this Order—specifically, the incorporation of the two subsidiaries—must be **completed no later than December 31, 1990**. This deadline establishes a clear and binding timeframe for execution, ensuring that the corporate action is carried out within a defined period and subject to accountability and monitoring by the federal government.

- **Regulatory Oversight**: By requiring approval from the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board, the federal government maintains oversight of significant corporate actions by a major transportation infrastructure provider.
- **Compliance with Financial Administration Laws**: The Order reflects a standard federal process for authorizing corporate actions in public or publicly significant entities, ensuring alignment with financial and administrative accountability standards.
