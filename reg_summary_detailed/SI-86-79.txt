---

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed by Statutory Instrument 2017-76, which was issued in the year 2017. This means that any legal provisions, duties, or requirements previously set out in the regulation are **no longer applicable** under current law.

**2. Legal Authority for Repeal:**  
The repeal was enacted under **section 36 of SI 2017-76**. Statutory Instruments are a form of secondary legislation used in jurisdictions like Canada (where SI stands for Statutory Instrument) or the United Kingdom (in some contexts). In this case, SI 2017-76 likely amended or replaced a prior piece of legislation, and section 36 specifically targeted the removal of certain provisions—possibly a section or multiple sections—of the original regulation.

**3. Implication of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedural rules previously established by the regulation are **no longer binding**.  
- Entities (such as government bodies, private organizations, or individuals) that previously relied on the regulation for compliance or operations must now refer to **current, active legislation**.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or consolidation effort to simplify, modernize, or align the law with updated policy or administrative needs.

**4. Contextual Considerations:**  
Although the original regulation is not provided, the fact that it is repeatedly listed and marked as repealed suggests it may have been a minor or outdated provision within a larger regulatory framework—possibly related to licensing, compliance, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—now superseded by newer laws or restructured regulations.

**5. Public Access and Legal Research:**  
In legal databases or official government publications, this repeal will be clearly noted. When searching for the regulation, users should look for the **repeal notice** in SI 2017-76, section 36, which will typically include:
- The original regulation being repealed
- The effective date of repeal
- A brief reason (e.g., consolidation, redundancy, or policy change)

Its removal was officially enacted through **section 36 of Statutory Instrument 2017-76**, which serves as the legal basis for its cancellation.
