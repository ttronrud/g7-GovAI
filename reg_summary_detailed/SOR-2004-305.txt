**Detailed Summary of the Nova Scotia Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations (S.C. 2004, c. 10, December 9, 2004)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Nova Scotia Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Regulations") were issued on **December 9, 2004**, by the **Lieutenant Governor in Council** of Nova Scotia, acting on the **report and recommendation of the Minister of Justice**, under **subsection 18(1) of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA)**. These regulations provide the operational framework for implementing the requirements of the Act in Nova Scotia.

The Regulations came into force on **December 15, 2004**, the date the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (S.C. 2004, c. 10) came into effect.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The Regulations establish the following key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (SOIRA), which provides the legal foundation for registering and managing information about individuals convicted of certain sex offences.
  
- **NSSOIRC**: Stands for the *Nova Scotia Sex Offender Information Registration Centre*, which is administered by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) "H" Division**. This is the central body responsible for receiving, processing, and maintaining sex offender registration data in Nova Scotia.

- **RCMP**: The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police*, responsible for law enforcement and, in this context, for administering the registration system through the NSSOIRC.

### **Reporting and Notification Requirements**

#### **1. Reporting by Sex Offenders in Nova Scotia**

- A **sex offender whose primary residence is located in Nova Scotia** may fulfill certain reporting obligations under the Act by **making a report by telephone** to the **NSSOIRC**.

  - Specifically, this applies to:
    - Reports required under **paragraph 4.1(a) or (b)** of the Act (which typically relate to initial registration or changes in address or contact information).
    - Reports required under **section 4.3** of the Act (which may involve updates to personal details or changes in circumstances).
    - Notifications required under **section 6** of the Act (such as changes in address or contact information).

- **Important Clarification**:  
  Despite allowing telephone reporting for some obligations, **subsection (1) does not eliminate the requirement for in-person reporting** under **paragraph 4.1(c)** of the Act. This means that **some reporting must still be completed in person**, ensuring accountability and verification of the offender’s identity and intent.

> This provision ensures that while technology facilitates access and convenience, the system maintains a requirement for face-to-face verification where necessary to prevent fraud or misrepresentation.

### **Authorized Personnel to Collect and Register Information**

The following individuals and entities are authorized in Nova Scotia to **collect and register information** under the Act:

1. **Members of the RCMP**  
   - Authorized to collect information from individuals suspected or convicted of sex offences.

2. **Police Officers Appointed to or Employed by Municipal Police Forces**  
   - Officers working in local police services (e.g., Halifax Regional Police, Cape Breton Regional Police, New Glasgow Police Service) are empowered to collect information related to sex offenders within their jurisdiction.

3. **Personnel at the NSSOIRC**  
   - Staff employed at the Nova Scotia Sex Offender Information Registration Centre whose duties include the **registration of information** are authorized to register that information for the purposes of the Act.

> This broad authorization ensures that information collection and registration can occur efficiently across both provincial and municipal law enforcement levels.

### **Designated Registration Centres**
