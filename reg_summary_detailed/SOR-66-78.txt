**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Special Election Regulations**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
The *Canadian Forces Superannuation Special Election Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Associate Minister of National Defence**, under **Vote 59d of the Appropriation Act Number 2, 1965**. These regulations are designed to address a specific historical injustice: **individuals who were erroneously advised**—by members of the Canadian Forces or public servants—**that they could not elect to count certain prior military service under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act (the "Act")**.

These individuals missed the prescribed time limits to make such an election due to **misinformation**, and this regulation provides a **special provision allowing them to retroactively elect** to count that service, even though they did not do so within the original timeframes.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Act"** refers to the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act*.
- **"Contributor"** includes not only current contributors but also **former contributors**—individuals who previously contributed to the superannuation system under the Act or Part V of the *Defence Services Pension Act*.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to a **contributor** who:
- Received **erroneous advice** from a member of the Canadian Forces or a public servant whose ordinary duties included giving advice on **elections under the Act or Part V of the Defence Services Pension Act**.
- As a result of that advice, **failed to elect** to count certain service **prior to becoming a contributor** under the Act.
- The service in question was **prior to the individual becoming a contributor** under the Act.

This means the regulation specifically targets **service that was not properly counted due to a mistake in advice**, not due to personal negligence or failure to act.

---

### **4. Eligibility to Make an Election**
A contributor who meets the above criteria may now:
- **Elect to count** the previously uncounted service for the purposes of the Act.
- This election is **available even if the individual is no longer a member of the Canadian Forces** at the time of making the election.
- The election must be made **within one year** of the date the individual is officially advised by the **Minister of National Defence** that:
  - The service may be counted under the Act.
  - The individual is eligible to make such an election.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This one-year window is critical. The individual must receive this formal notification and act within that period.

---

### **5. Form and Process of Election**
- All elections must be submitted in the **form prescribed by the Minister of National Defence**.
- The general rules governing elections under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* apply **mutatis mutandis** (with appropriate adjustments) to this special election.
- However, **exceptions** are provided in:
  - Subsection (1) of this section.
  - Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 7 of the Act.

These exceptions allow for the special circumstances of erroneous advice to be accommodated.

---

### **6. Financial Obligations Upon Election**
When a contributor makes an election under this regulation, they are required to **pay contributions** as if they had made a valid election under the Act within the prescribed time limits.

Specifically, the contributions owed are calculated as if the individual had:
- Made an election under **Clause (B) of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of Section 5** of the Act, **or**
- Made an election under **Clause (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), or (J) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of Section 5** of the Act, **or**
- Made an election under **subsection (2) of Section 48 of the Defence Services Pension Act**, **as it stood immediately before the coming into force of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act**.

> 🔍 **Key Point**: The financial obligation is based on the **rules in effect at the time** when the original election deadlines were set—specifically, as of **March 1, 1960**—to ensure consistency and fairness in the calculation.

### **7. Adjustment of Contributions (Refund or Reduction)**
If a contributor has already made an election under:
- **Clause (K) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of Section 5 of the Act**, or
- **Subsection (2a) of Section 48 of the Defence Services Pension Act**,

…for the service in question, **that election shall be deemed to have been made**:
- **Immediately upon receipt of the erroneous advice**, and
- **Within the prescribed time limit** under the relevant statutory provision.

> ✅ This is a crucial fairness mechanism: it treats the election as if it was made in a timely manner, despite the delay caused by the error.

Furthermore, an **adjustment** will be made to the contributions owed:
- Either through a **refund** (if the individual overpaid due to the incorrect election), or
- A **reduction in the number of instalments** (to avoid overpayment or undue financial burden).

> 💡 This adjustment is intended to correct any overpayment or unfair financial consequence resulting from the erroneous advice.

---

### **8. Calculation of Adjustment**
For the purposes of determining whether a refund or reduction is due:
- The election under subsection (1) of this regulation shall be **deemed to have been made** under **Section 4** of the Act.

> This ensures consistency in how the financial impact is assessed—treating the special election as equivalent to a valid election under the Act’s standard provisions.

---

### **9. Key Principles and Fairness Elements**
- **Corrective Justice**: The regulation corrects a historical error caused by **misinformation** rather than individual fault.
- **Timeliness**: The one-year window ensures that the opportunity to correct the error is not open indefinitely.
- **Procedural Fairness**: The process follows the formal rules of the Act, while allowing flexibility for the unique circumstances of erroneous advice.
- **Financial Equity**: Adjustments (refunds or installment reductions) prevent individuals from being financially penalized due to a systemic error.

---

### **10. Practical Implications**
- A former service member who served in the military before joining the Canadian Forces superannuation system may now **claim credit** for that service if they were misled into believing they could not elect it.
- The individual must **receive official notification** from the Minister of National Defence to activate the one-year window.
- The election must be submitted in the **official form** issued by the Department.
- Financial liability is based on **pre-1960 rules**, ensuring that the contribution burden is not increased beyond what would have been required had the election been valid from the start.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Canadian Forces Superannuation Special Election Regulations* serve as a **corrective measure** to address a significant administrative and informational failure in the early years of the Canadian Forces Superannuation system. By allowing individuals who were misled to retroactively elect to count prior service, and by providing financial adjustments where necessary, the regulations promote **fairness, equity, and accountability** in the pension system.

They reflect a principle that **public institutions must not penalize individuals for errors in advice**—especially when such errors are due to systemic or institutional shortcomings rather than personal lapses.

This regulation remains a **historically significant** and **legally binding** provision under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, ensuring that service members receive appropriate credit for their contributions, even when the process of claiming it was obstructed by misinformation.
