**Detailed Summary of the Exported Vessels Remission Order**

**Title:**  
*Exported Vessels Remission Order*

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Exported Vessels Remission Order*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to provide a formal remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of customs duties that have been paid or are otherwise payable on specific goods. These goods are subject to a special exemption under defined circumstances related to the shipbuilding industry.

Specifically, the remission applies to goods that were imported **on or after November 27, 1970**, provided that:

1. The goods are **wrought into or attached to vessels** (i.e., components or materials that are physically integrated into the construction or outfitting of a vessel), and  
2. The resulting vessels are declared by the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** as being either:
   - **Eligible ships under the Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program Regulations**, or  
   - **Eligible ships for export under the Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations**.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Eligibility Criteria for Vessels:**  
   - The vessel must be officially designated as "eligible" by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce.  
   - Eligibility is determined under two distinct regulatory frameworks:
     - *Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program Regulations*: Designed to provide temporary financial support to shipbuilders during periods of economic hardship or industry transition.
     - *Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations*: Aimed at supporting the export capacity of the shipbuilding sector by enabling the construction or modification of vessels for international markets.

2. **Timing of Importation:**  
   - The goods must have been imported on or after **November 27, 1970**. This establishes a historical cutoff date, suggesting the policy was introduced in response to specific economic conditions or industry needs during that period.

3. **Nature of Goods:**  
   - The goods must be directly used in the **construction, fabrication, or outfitting** of vessels (e.g., steel, engines, machinery, fittings, or other materials that are "wrought into" or "attached to" the vessel).  
   - This implies a direct physical integration of the imported goods into the vessel structure or function.

4. **Remission of Customs Duties:**  
   - The customs duties originally paid or that would otherwise be payable on such goods are **fully remitted** (forgiven or waived).  
   - This remission is not a reduction or partial refund, but a complete cancellation of the duty obligation for the qualifying goods.

**Policy Rationale (Implied):**  
This regulation appears to be a targeted economic intervention designed to:
- Support the shipbuilding industry during a period of transition or crisis.
- Encourage the production and export of vessels by reducing the financial burden on shipbuilders.
- Promote industrial development and international competitiveness by making it more feasible to construct and export ships.
- Align with broader government assistance programs aimed at stabilizing and revitalizing key manufacturing sectors.

**Legal Authority:**  
The Order is issued under the authority of the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce, based on existing regulatory frameworks—specifically the *Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance Program Regulations* and the *Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations*—which provide the legal basis for designating vessels as "eligible."

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *Exported Vessels Remission Order* is a targeted customs relief measure that forgives duties on imported goods used in the construction or modification of vessels deemed eligible under specific government assistance programs. It applies only to goods imported on or after November 27, 1970, and only when the resulting vessels are officially recognized as eligible for support under either the temporary assistance or export assistance programs. This policy serves to incentivize shipbuilding and export activity by reducing costs for manufacturers and exporters.

**Note:**  
This regulation is historical in nature, given the date of importation (1970), and may not be actively enforced in modern times. Its relevance today would depend on the current status of the Shipbuilding Temporary Assistance and Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations.
