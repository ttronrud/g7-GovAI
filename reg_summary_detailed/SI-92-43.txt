### **Background and Context**

1. **United Nations Resolution 717 (1991)**  
   The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution 717 adopted on October 16, 1991, established the **United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC)**. The mission's primary objective was to support the initial implementation of the **Agreements on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict**, which were signed in Paris on October 23, 1991. These agreements aimed to end decades of civil conflict in Cambodia, promote peace, and lay the foundation for a stable, democratic government.

2. **Canada’s Participation**  
   The regulation states that it is considered advisable for **Canada to participate** in UNAMIC. This reflects Canada’s commitment to international peacekeeping efforts and its role in supporting post-conflict stabilization in Southeast Asia.

### **Legal Basis**

The decision to deploy Canadian forces is grounded in **paragraph 31(1)(b)** of the **National Defence Act (R.S., c. 31 (1st Supp.))**. This provision authorizes the Governor General in Council to place Canadian Forces personnel on active service beyond Canada, in support of international peacekeeping operations, including those under the United Nations.

Specifically, the regulation cites **Section 60 of Schedule I, Item 14** of the National Defence Act. This item outlines the legal framework for deploying Canadian military personnel in peacekeeping missions authorized by the United Nations, including the provision for deployment beyond Canadian borders in support of UN operations.

### **Scope of Deployment**

The regulation authorizes the deployment of the following personnel from the Canadian Forces:

- **Regular Force**: Officers and non-commissioned members (NCOs) of the regular Canadian Armed Forces.
- **Reserve Force**: Officers and NCOs from the Canadian Forces Reserve who are either:
  - Already part of the UNAMIC mission, or
  - Serving in immediate support of the mission.

This means that both active-duty and reserve personnel may be mobilized and deployed, provided they are directly involved in or supporting the operations of UNAMIC.

### **Purpose of Deployment**

The primary purpose of this deployment is to:
- Support the implementation of the Paris Agreements.
- Assist in the political and security stabilization of Cambodia.
- Contribute to the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, and inclusive government.
- Provide security, monitoring, and logistical support to facilitate political dialogue and the transition from conflict to peace.

### **Key Legal and Operational Implications**

- **Mobilization Authority**: The Governor General in Council exercises the power to deploy forces under the National Defence Act, based on ministerial recommendation, ensuring that the decision is both legally sound and strategically aligned with Canada’s foreign policy and defense objectives.
- **International Commitment**: The deployment reflects Canada’s adherence to multilateralism and its role in global peace and security efforts.
- **Operational Flexibility**: The inclusion of both regular and reserve forces allows for scalable and responsive deployment, depending on the needs of the mission.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally authorizes Canada’s participation in the United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia. It is a legally binding directive that enables the deployment of Canadian military personnel—both from the regular and reserve components—under the authority of the National Defence Act. The mission is aligned with broader UN efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia, and Canada’s contribution underscores its commitment to peace, stability, and international cooperation in post-conflict regions.
