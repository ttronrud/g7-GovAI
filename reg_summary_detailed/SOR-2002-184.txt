### **Detailed Summary of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations**

These regulations, made under **section 73(1)a** of the *Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act* (the "Act"), provide a comprehensive set of definitions and operational rules to strengthen Canada’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) framework. They establish key terminology used throughout the Act and the regulatory regime, and they define specific types of financial transactions, entities, and records that must be reported or monitored to detect suspicious activity.
