## 🔧 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, which governs the operations and activities of banks and bank holding companies. |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value of shares and ownership interests reported on an entity’s **unconsolidated balance sheet**. This is the value as recorded in financial statements, not market value or fair value. *(Note: "Book value" was repealed in 2008 – this is now replaced by "balance sheet value")* |
| **Prescribed activity** | Activities involving the **development, design, holding, management, manufacturing, selling, or dealing with** any of the following: <br> - Data transmission systems <br> - Information sites <br> - Communication devices <br> - Information platforms or portals <br> that are used to **provide information services**. |

> ⚠️ This definition is central to the regulation — it identifies which IT-related businesses fall under regulatory scrutiny.

## 🚫 Prohibited Activities: The 5% Capital Threshold

A **bank holding company (BHC)** may **not** acquire control of, hold, acquire, or increase a substantial investment in an entity engaged in a prescribed IT activity **if the sum of the following exceeds 5% of the BHC’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests the BHC and its subsidiaries would acquire in the target entity (under paragraph 930(2)(f) of the Act).  
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests already held by the BHC and its subsidiaries in **other entities** engaging in prescribed IT activities that the BHC controls or has a substantial investment in.  
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the BHC and its subsidiaries to such IT entities (those it controls or has a substantial investment in).

> ✅ **Example:** If a BHC owns a digital platform company that provides financial information services, and the combined value of its stake in that company plus its stakes in other similar digital platforms plus its loans to those platforms exceeds 5% of its regulatory capital, the BHC is prohibited from increasing its ownership or control.

> 💡 This threshold is designed to **prevent excessive concentration of risk** in IT-related businesses, especially those with potential for systemic or operational risk due to their digital nature.

## 🚫 Additional Prohibitions (When the Entity Engages in Prohibited Activities)

Even if the 5% threshold is not exceeded, a BHC **cannot** acquire control or increase a substantial investment in an entity that engages in **any of the following activities**:

| Prohibited Activity | Explanation |
|--------------------|-----------|
| **Accepting deposit liabilities** | Entities that take deposits (e.g., online savings accounts) are excluded. This prevents BHCs from creating hybrid financial institutions combining banking and IT services. |
| **Dealing in securities** | Except where permitted under: <br> - Paragraph 930(2)(e) of the Act (e.g., certain investment activities) <br> - Paragraph 409(2)(c) of the Act (limited securities dealing by banks). |
| **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** | Not allowed unless specifically permitted under subsection 410(2) of the Act. BHCs cannot engage in retail or commercial trading through IT platforms. |
| **Engaging in activities prohibited under sections 412, 416, or 418 of the Act** | These sections restrict certain banking activities (e.g., lending to non-bank entities, investment in non-banking ventures). If an IT entity engages in such activities, the BHC cannot invest in it. |
| **Acquiring control of or investing in another entity** | Only allowed if: <br> - The entity is **controlled by the BHC**, and a bank would be permitted under **Part IX of the Act** to invest in it; OR <br> - The entity is **not controlled by the BHC**, and a bank would be permitted to invest under: <br>   - Subsection 466(2), <br>   - Paragraph 466(3)(b) or (c), <br>   - Subsection 466(4), <br>   - Subsection 468(1) or (2) of the Act. |

> 📌 **Exception for Subsection 468(4) to (6):** These provisions (which normally restrict certain investments) **do not apply** when determining whether a bank could invest in an entity under the above-mentioned sections.

> 🔍 This means the BHC can evaluate investment eligibility based on **bank-specific rules**, not on the broader restrictions that would otherwise apply to non-bank entities.

## 🚨 Special Provisions

### 1. **Exemption for Entities with Limited Activities**
- **Subsection 930(5) of the Act does not apply** when a BHC acquires control of or increases a substantial investment in an entity whose **business is limited to prescribed IT activities** (i.e., only the development, management, or provision of information services).
- This allows BHCs to invest in **pure IT platforms** (e.g., data portals, communication tools) **without triggering broader prohibitions** under the Act.

> ✅ This creates a **clear exemption pathway** for IT-focused ventures that do not engage in traditional banking or financial activities.

### 2. **No Limitation on Subsections 2(2) and (3)**
- The rules in subsections 2(2) and (2)(3) (which govern the scope of prohibited activities) **do not apply** in this exemption context.
- This means that even if the IT entity engages in some non-prohibited activities, if its **core business is limited to IT services**, the BHC can invest — as long as the 5% threshold is not exceeded.

## 🎯 Key Objectives of the Regulation

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | Prevents BHCs from becoming overly exposed to risks associated with IT platforms (e.g., cybersecurity, data breaches, platform failures). |
| **Financial Stability** | Avoids unintended creation of hybrid financial institutions that blur the lines between banking and technology. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Defines clearly what constitutes a "prescribed IT activity" and sets a measurable threshold (5% of capital) for investment. |
| **Compliance with Banking Restrictions** | Ensures that IT ventures do not engage in activities that are otherwise banned for banks (e.g., deposit-taking, securities dealing). |

## 📚 Interplay with the Bank Act

The regulation operates within the broader framework of the *Bank Act*, particularly:

- **Section 930(2)(f):** Defines what constitutes a "prescribed activity" in IT.
- **Section 930(5):** Governs the investment restrictions for bank holding companies.
- **Sections 412, 416, 417, 418, 410:** Define what banking activities are prohibited for banks.
- **Sections 466 and 468:** Govern the conditions under which a bank can acquire a substantial investment in another entity.

## 🚩 Important Notes and Interpretations

1. **Balance Sheet Value ≠ Market Value**  
   The use of **unconsolidated balance sheet value** means the calculation is based on internal accounting records, not current market prices. This makes the rule more conservative and easier to apply consistently.

2. **Subsidiaries Included**  
   The 5% threshold applies to **the BHC and its subsidiaries collectively**, not just the parent company. This ensures that consolidated risk is properly assessed.

3. **Loans Are Included**  
   Outstanding loans to IT entities are counted — not just equity investments. This prevents BHCs from using lending as a way to indirectly gain control or exposure.

4. **Exemption for Pure IT Platforms**  
   Entities that only offer information services (e.g., a digital news portal, a secure messaging platform, a data analytics tool) are exempt from many restrictions — **provided** they do not engage in prohibited banking activities.

5. **No Automatic Approval**  
   Even if the 5% threshold is met, a BHC must still ensure that the IT entity does not violate other prohibitions (e.g., dealing in securities, accepting deposits).
