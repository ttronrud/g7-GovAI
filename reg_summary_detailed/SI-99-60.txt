Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.  
It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which authorizes the inclusion of certain land parcels within a grant based on specific geographical or boundary criteria—particularly those adjacent to water bodies.

---

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose is to **expand the grant of land** in the former Settlement of Port Radium, Northwest Territories, by including a specific portion of the shoreline that lies within a defined distance of the ordinary high water mark.

---

**3. Geographic Scope and Specific Land Designation**  
The regulation applies to the following:

- **Location**:  
  Echo Bay, an inlet of Great Bear Lake, within the former Settlement of Port Radium, Northwest Territories.

- **Boundary Condition**:  
  Any portion of the lands described in the schedule attached to this regulation that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of Echo Bay is included in the grant.

> **Note**: The "ordinary high water mark" is a legally recognized benchmark used in land tenure and boundary demarcation to define the extent of land adjacent to water bodies. This inclusion ensures that lands directly adjacent to the water—particularly those with potential for access, use, or traditional significance—are formally recognized and protected.

---

**4. Specific Land Lots Included in the Grant**  
The following lots are explicitly included in the grant:

- **Lots 1 to 22**  
- **Lots 25 to 28**  
- **Block 1**  

These lots are defined as being part of the **former Settlement of Port Radium** in the Northwest Territories.

> The boundaries of these lots are based on a **plan of survey of record number 39359**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**.  
> A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under reference number **61**.

This ensures that the legal description and spatial boundaries of the land are officially documented and accessible for land title and registration purposes.

---

**5. Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The inclusion of the shoreline land within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark strengthens the legal claim to adjacent waterside areas, which may be significant for:
  - Indigenous use and traditional practices
  - Access and navigation
  - Environmental protection
  - Land tenure clarity
- The regulation formalizes land ownership and boundaries under the Territorial Lands Act, providing clarity and legal certainty for future land use, development, or dispute resolution.
- It reflects a recognition of the importance of shoreline areas, particularly in a remote and ecologically sensitive region like the Northwest Territories.

---

**6. Key Definitions and Measurements**  
- **30.48 metres (100 feet)**: This is the precise distance from the shoreline that defines the inclusion zone. It is a standard measurement used in land surveying and legal descriptions to define land adjacent to water bodies.
- **Ordinary high water mark**: The highest point reached by water during normal tidal or seasonal conditions, used as a baseline for land inclusion.

---

**7. Recordkeeping and Access**  
- The survey plan (record no. 39359) is officially archived in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** (Ottawa).  
- A copy is filed in the **Land Titles Office, Yellowknife**, under reference number **61**, ensuring that the grant is accessible to landowners, Indigenous communities, surveyors, and government agencies for verification and legal reference.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation formally expands the land grant in the former Port Radium settlement by including shoreline land within 100 feet of Echo Bay’s ordinary high water mark. It is a legally binding instrument issued under the Territorial Lands Act, based on a recognized survey plan and designed to provide clarity, legal protection, and recognition of land adjacent to water bodies—particularly in a region with cultural, environmental, and historical significance.

This action supports land rights, enhances legal certainty, and reflects ongoing efforts to recognize and formalize Indigenous and community land interests in northern Canada.
