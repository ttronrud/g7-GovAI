### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Transport to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.
- It is enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- This means the transfer of responsibilities is a formal administrative decision, authorized by a specific provision in the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which allows for the reallocation of ministerial duties within the federal government.

#### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
- The transfer involves **powers, duties, and functions** related to the **Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority**.
- These powers, duties, and functions are derived from the **Letters Patent of incorporation** for the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority.
- The Letters Patent were originally issued by **Order in Council P.C. 2012-1350**, dated **October 9, 2012**.
- The Letters Patent establish the legal foundation and operational framework of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, which is responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of the **Windsor-Detroit Bridge**, a critical international crossing between Canada and the United States.

#### **3. Scope of the Transfer**
- The powers, duties, and functions of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority are being **transferred from the Minister of Transport to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**.
- This reallocation reflects a shift in ministerial oversight based on broader government restructuring and policy priorities.

#### **4. Exception to the Transfer**
- **Section 9.1 of the Letters Patent** is explicitly **excluded** from the transfer.
- This means that any powers, duties, or functions specifically outlined in **section 9.1** of the Letters Patent **remain under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Transport**.
- The reason for this exclusion is likely due to the unique nature or specialized responsibilities of section 9.1—possibly involving cross-border coordination, specific operational mandates, or international treaty obligations that are considered more aligned with transportation policy or U.S.-Canada relations.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The transfer becomes effective on **November 4, 2015**.
- This date marks the point at which the new ministerial responsibility officially takes effect, and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority begins operating under the oversight of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs.

#### **6. Legal and Procedural Context**
- The regulation is published in the **Canada Gazette, Part I, Volume 147, Number 4**, on **January 26, 2013**.
- It is referenced under:
  - **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** (Statutory Code of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22, Section 207)
  - **R.S., c. P-34** (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter P-34 — Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)

#### **7. Significance and Implications**
- This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal government responsibilities, placing infrastructure and community-related functions under a ministry that also oversees broader infrastructure development and intergovernmental relations.
- It enhances coordination between federal infrastructure planning and community needs, particularly in cross-border regions like the Windsor-Detroit corridor.
- The exclusion of section 9.1 ensures that certain specialized or sensitive functions—possibly involving international agreements, emergency response, or specific operational protocols—remain under the purview of the Ministry of Transport, preserving continuity and accountability in critical areas.
