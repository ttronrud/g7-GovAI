The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-94, s. 24]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **SOR/2017-94, section 24**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status: Repealed**

- The specific regulation in question is **no longer in force**.
- It was formally **repealed** (removed from the legal framework) by **Regulation SOR/2017-94, section 24**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on **March 29, 2017**.
- The repeal means that the content of the regulation, which was previously applicable, is **no longer enforceable or binding** under Canadian law.

### Context of SOR/2017-94:

- **SOR/2017-94** is a statutory instrument (a type of regulatory document) issued under the authority of the Government of Canada.
- Section 24 of this instrument specifically identifies and removes (repeals) certain provisions from prior regulations, often to streamline, modernize, or align them with updated legislation or policy.
- The repeal likely occurred as part of a broader effort to eliminate outdated, redundant, or superseded rules, improve regulatory clarity, or reflect changes in legal or administrative frameworks.

### Implications:

- Any legal, administrative, or operational activity that previously relied on this regulation is now **subject to current, active regulations**.
- Legal practitioners, government agencies, or private entities must ensure they are referencing **current, valid regulations** rather than outdated or repealed ones.
- The repeal does not imply that the subject matter of the regulation was unimportant — rather, it indicates that the matter has been addressed by a newer, more current regulation or policy.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active, enforceable regulation** under the reference provided. The regulation was **fully repealed** by **SOR/2017-94, section 24**. Therefore, it does not currently apply, and any reference to it in legal or regulatory contexts should be treated as obsolete.

For accurate and up-to-date regulatory information, one should consult the **current version of the relevant statute or regulation** as published in the *Canada Gazette* or through official government databases such as [canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca) or the **Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) database**.

> 🔍 **Note**: Since the regulation is listed multiple times with the same repeal notice, this suggests it may have been part of a larger set of repealed provisions, possibly related to a specific area such as environmental standards, workplace safety, or licensing — but without further context (e.g., the original regulation’s title or subject), the precise scope of the repealed rule cannot be determined. Additional details would be needed to provide a more targeted summary.
