**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act** (R.S., c. T-7), made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories** — specifically within the **Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region** — from being available for disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or other forms of transfer) for a defined period.  

This withdrawal is intended to **facilitate the negotiation and conclusion of Aboriginal land agreements**. These agreements are typically between the Government of Canada, the Government of the Northwest Territories, and First Nations or Indigenous communities, aimed at securing land rights, self-governance, and economic development through formal land arrangements.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**  

#### 1. **Tracts Withdrawn from Disposal**  
Two schedules define the land parcels subject to withdrawal:

- **Schedule 1**:  
  - Includes **surface rights only** to the designated tracts of territorial land.  
  - These tracts are located in the **Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region** of the Northwest Territories.

- **Schedule 2**:  
  - Includes **both surface and subsurface rights** to the designated tracts.  
  - These tracts are also located in the **same geographic area** (Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region).

> ✅ **Effect**: All rights (surface and/or subsurface) to the lands listed in Schedules 1 and 2 are **withdrawn from disposal** for a period of **three years**, beginning on the day the Order comes into force.

---

### **Exclusions and Exceptions (Where Section 2 Does NOT Apply)**  

Despite the general withdrawal of land from disposal, the following activities and transactions are **explicitly excluded** from the restrictions imposed by the Order:

1. **Mineral Claims Located Before the Order's Effective Date**  
   - A person holding a **prospecting permit granted prior to the Order's date** may locate a mineral claim.  
   - The recording of such a claim is not affected.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims**  
   - Claims that were already located or recorded before the Order comes into effect are not impacted.

3. **Leasing of Land Under Mining Regulations**  
   - A lease granted under the **Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations** to a person who holds a **recorded mineral claim** is permitted, even if the lease covers land within that claim.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - If a **significant discovery licence** is issued to a holder of an exploration licence that was **granted before the Order's date**, and the licence covers land subject to that exploration licence — this issuance is **not blocked**.

5. **Production Licences (Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - Production licences issued to holders of:
     - A **significant discovery licence** (issued before the Order date), or  
     - An **exploration licence** (issued before the Order date),  
     and covering areas subject to those licences — are **not affected**.

6. **Surface Leases for Claim Holders**  
   - A surface lease issued under the Territorial Lands Act to a person with a **recorded mineral claim** or an **interest under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act** is allowed **if it is required** to enable the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest.

7. **Renewal of Interests**  
   - Renewals of existing mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production licences) are not impacted by the withdrawal.

> 🔍 **Purpose of Exclusions**: These exceptions ensure that **existing mining and exploration activities** — particularly those already underway or legally established prior to the Order — are not disrupted. This protects the continuity of mineral development and avoids unintended legal or financial consequences for holders of pre-existing rights.

### **Geographic Basis: Reference Maps**  

The Order references two **1:250,000-scale reference maps** recommended by the **Land Working Group**, which includes representatives from:

- Manitoba Denesuline  
- Athabasca Denesuline  
- Government of the Northwest Territories  
- Government of Canada  

These maps are **critical tools** for identifying the exact parcels of land involved in the withdrawal.  

- **Surface Lands Map**: Identifies all parcels shown as **Surface Lands** on the map.  
- **Surface-Subsurface Lands Map**: Identifies all parcels shown as **Surface-Subsurface Lands** on the map.

> 📍 These maps are **officially deposited** with the **Regional Manager, Land Administration, at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**, for reference and administrative use.

---

### **Key Administrative and Legal Notes**  

- **Effective Date**: The three-year withdrawal period begins on the day the Order is made.  
- **Duration**: The withdrawal is temporary — only valid for **three years**. After that, the tracts may be returned to the disposal process unless otherwise extended by new legislation.  
- **Applicability**: The Order applies only to the **Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region** in the Northwest Territories.  
- **No Impact on Substances or Materials**: Section 2 of the Order (which governs disposal) **does not apply** to the **disposition of substances or materials** under the **Territorial Quarrying Regulations**. This ensures that quarrying and mineral extraction activities under that specific regulation remain unaffected.

---

### **Significance and Implications**  

This Order is a **key tool in advancing Indigenous land rights** in the Northwest Territories. By temporarily removing certain lands from disposal, it:

- Creates a **stable and predictable environment** for negotiations between Indigenous communities and government parties.  
- Encourages **long-term, mutually beneficial land agreements** that may include shared resource management, economic development, and cultural preservation.  
- Respects **existing legal rights** of mineral claimants and exploration license holders who began operations before the Order.  
- Demonstrates a **co-governance approach**, with Indigenous representatives involved in the mapping and land identification process.

---

### **Conclusion**  

This regulation is a targeted, temporary measure designed to **support the negotiation of Aboriginal land agreements** in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories. It withdraws specific surface and subsurface land rights from disposal for three years, while **preserving existing mineral rights and exploration activities**. The use of a collaborative Land Working Group map ensures transparency and inclusivity in land identification. It reflects a balanced approach between protecting Indigenous land interests and maintaining the legal integrity of mineral resource development.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
*The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, withdraws certain surface and subsurface tracts of land in the Eastern Portion of the South Slave Region from disposal for three years to enable Aboriginal land agreements, while preserving existing mineral claims and mining rights granted before the Order’s date.*
