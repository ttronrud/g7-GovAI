**Detailed Summary of the Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Areas Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Areas Regulations* were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, under **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. These regulations establish and govern three designated marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Canadian Arctic — specifically within **Mackenzie Bay and the Mackenzie River Estuary** — in accordance with the **Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA)**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect and conserve marine ecosystems** while balancing the need for **indigenous rights, scientific research, and limited economic activities** such as fishing, exploration, and infrastructure development.

These regulations came into force upon registration and are legally binding under Canadian federal law.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Agreement**  
   Refers to the *Inuvialuit Final Agreement*, which was approved and declared valid under the *Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act*. This agreement is central to the regulatory framework, as it establishes the rights of the Inuvialuit people, including their co-management responsibilities and consent requirements for certain activities in the protected areas.

2. **Areas**  
   Denotes the **Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Areas**, which consist of three distinct zones:
   - Niaqunnaq Marine Protected Area
   - Okeevik Marine Protected Area
   - Kittigaryuit Marine Protected Area

3. **Waters**  
   Includes all waters, including the **seabed and subsoil** down to a depth of **five metres**. This definition ensures that both surface and underwater habitats are protected.

### **Designation of the Three Marine Protected Areas**

Each MPA is defined by specific geographic boundaries based on official survey plans:

#### 1. **Niaqunnaq Marine Protected Area**

- Defined by the waters within the boundaries described in:
  - **Plan number FB36305**, certified on **February 19, 2009**
  - Depicted in **Plan CLSR 91991, Sheet 2**
- These plans are officially deposited in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records**

#### 2. **Okeevik Marine Protected Area**
- Located in the **Mackenzie River Estuary**
- Defined by the waters within the boundaries of:
  - **Plan FB36305**, certified on February 19, 2009
  - Depicted in **Plan CLSR 91991, Sheet 3**
- This area is further subdivided into:
  - **Special Management Zone 1**
  - **Special Management Zone 2**
  - **Primary Protection Zone**

#### 3. **Kittigaryuit Marine Protected Area**
- Also located in the **Mackenzie River Estuary**
- Defined by the waters within the boundaries of:
  - **Plan FB36305**, certified on February 19, 2009
  - Depicted in **Plan CLSR 91991, Sheet 4**
- These plans are also deposited in the Canada Lands Surveys Records

> All boundary plans are legally recognized and serve as authoritative references for enforcement and management.

### **Prohibited Activities (Section 6)**

No person may:
- **Disturb, damage, destroy**, or **remove** any living marine organism or part of its habitat within the Areas.
- **Deposit, discharge, or dump** any substance (including waste or pollutants) in a way that could lead to such disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal.

This creates a **strong environmental protection baseline**, emphasizing the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.

---

### **Permitted Activities (with Conditions)**

Despite the prohibitions, certain activities are allowed **only if they meet strict conditions** and are authorized through appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.

#### 1. **Fishing**
- Permitted under:
  - The **Inuvialuit Final Agreement** (for Inuvialuit communities)
  - The **Fisheries Act** and its regulations
- Fishing must comply with established quotas, seasons, and gear restrictions to prevent overexploitation.

#### 2. **Dredging**
- Only permitted if:
  - Recommended under the **Inuvialuit Final Agreement**
  - Authorized by a **competent government authority**
  - Conducted in compliance with:
    - *Navigable Waters Protection Act*
    - *Fisheries Act*
  - And **does not result in or is not likely to result in** the disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal of marine mammals.

#### 3. **Scientific Activities**
- Permitted if:
  - Conducted in accordance with the *Fisheries Act* and its regulations, or
  - Recommended under the Agreement and authorized by a competent authority
- Purpose must be:
  - **Management of the protected areas**
  - **Monitoring conservation measures** (e.g., tracking species health, habitat changes)

#### 4. **Geophysical Operations**
- Defined under *section 2 of the Canada Oil and Gas Geophysical Operations Regulations*
- Permitted if:
  - Recommended under the Agreement and authorized by a competent authority
  - Conducted **on, through, or under the ice cover** of the Areas
  - Compliant with:
    - *Navigable Waters Protection Act*
    - *Species at Risk Act*
    - *Fisheries Act*
    - *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999*
  - And **does not result in or is not likely to result in** disturbance, damage, or removal of marine mammals

#### 5. **Exploratory Drilling (in Okeevik Special Management Zones)**
- Permitted only if:
  - Recommended under the Agreement and authorized by a competent authority
  - Conducted **on, through, or under the ice cover**
  - In compliance with:
    - *Navigable Waters Protection Act*

- **Primary Legal Basis**: The *Oceans Act*, specifically **subsection 35(3)**, empowers the Governor General to make regulations for marine protected areas.
- **Indigenous Rights and Co-Management**: The Inuvialuit Final Agreement is foundational. Activities requiring approval must be recommended under this agreement, reflecting **shared governance** and respect for Indigenous rights and knowledge.
- **Environmental Compliance**: All permitted activities must comply with multiple federal environmental statutes, emphasizing **intergovernmental and cross-sectoral accountability**.
- **Marine Mammal Protection**: A recurring theme in all permitted activities is the **prohibition of harm to marine mammals**, indicating a strong focus on species conservation.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Environmental Protection**  
   The regulations provide strong legal protection for sensitive Arctic marine ecosystems, including critical habitats for fish, birds, and marine mammals.

2. **Indigenous Rights and Participation**  
   The requirement that certain activities be "recommended under the Agreement" ensures that **Inuvialuit communities have a formal role in decision-making**, promoting equity and cultural stewardship.

3. **Balancing Development and Conservation**  
   While the regulations restrict harmful activities, they allow for **controlled development** (e.g., oil and gas, scientific research) under strict oversight, demonstrating a balanced approach to resource use and environmental protection.
