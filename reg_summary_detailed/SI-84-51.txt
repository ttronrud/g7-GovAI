**Detailed Summary of the Laminated Glass Dinnerware Remission Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
This regulation, known as the *Laminated Glass Dinnerware Remission Order*, is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**. It is based on a recommendation from the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, and is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. The primary objective is to provide a **partial remission (reduction)** of both **customs duties** and **sales tax** on a specific type of imported goods: *laminated glass dinnerware*.

The order is made in the **public interest**, aiming to support economic efficiency, reduce the cost of imported consumer goods, and promote fair trade practices for specific products that may have been subject to disproportionate tax burdens.

### **2. Scope of the Remission**

#### **A. Customs Duty Remission**
- **Applicable Goods**: Laminated glass dinnerware classified under **tariff item 7013.39.90** in the Customs Tariff.
- **Import Date**: Goods must have been imported **on or after January 1, 1988**.
- **Remission Granted**: A full remission (i.e., cancellation or refund) of the **customs duties** that were previously paid or are payable on these goods.
- **Key Point**: This remission applies only to the customs duty component and does not affect other taxes or charges.

#### **B. Sales Tax Remission**
- **Applicable Goods**: The same laminated glass dinnerware classified under **7013.39.90**, for which customs duty remission has been granted.
- **Sales Tax Adjustment**: A remission of sales tax is granted in an amount equal to the **difference** between:
  - The **original sales tax** that would have been payable on the goods, and  
  - The sales tax that would have been payable **if the duty-paid value** (used to calculate sales tax) had been reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission.

> In simpler terms:  
> The sales tax is reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission because the duty-paid value — which forms the basis for calculating sales tax — is now lower due to the customs duty being waived.  
> This ensures that the **overall tax burden** on the product is reduced in a proportionate way.

### **3. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

- A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue**.
- The claim must be submitted **within two years** of the date of importation of the goods.
- Failure to make a timely claim will result in the **loss of the right to remission**.

> This time limit ensures administrative accountability and prevents claims from being made years later without proper documentation or justification.

### **4. Legal and Regulatory Context**

- **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act** provides the legal basis for the Governor General in Council to issue such remission orders, especially when public interest justifies a reduction in tax or duty obligations.
- The order is **subject to Section 4** of the Financial Administration Act, which typically governs limitations on the power to make remissions (e.g., restrictions on the type of goods, duration, or conditions under which remission can be granted). While the specific content of Section 4 is not provided, it likely imposes general limitations such as:
  - A requirement that the remission be reasonable and not used for improper purposes.
  - A cap on the total amount or volume of remission.
  - Provisions to prevent abuse or misuse of the order.

### **5. Key Impacts and Rationale**

- **Economic Benefit**: Reduces the total cost of importing laminated glass dinnerware, making it more affordable for Canadian consumers and businesses.
- **Fairness**: Aligns the tax treatment of imported goods with the actual cost of production and importation, preventing double taxation where customs duties are reduced but sales tax remains unchanged.
- **Administrative Clarity**: Provides a clear, time-bound, and rule-based mechanism for businesses to claim remission, promoting transparency and predictability.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally governed remission of customs duties and sales tax on laminated glass dinnerware imported after January 1, 1988. It reflects a policy decision to reduce the financial burden on specific consumer goods, ensuring that the tax system remains both equitable and responsive to market realities. The requirement for timely claims ensures fiscal accountability and efficient administration of the tax system.

This Order is a practical example of how Canadian government policy can use targeted tax relief to support domestic markets, promote affordability, and maintain fiscal responsibility.
