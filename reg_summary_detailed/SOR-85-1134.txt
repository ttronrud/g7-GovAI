### **4. Dispute Resolution Fees**

The Order includes specific provisions for **dispute-related fees**:

- **Where the amount in dispute is not over $500**: A **minimum fee** applies (likely a small administrative fee).

### **5. Time-Based Charges (For Services Performed Outside Standard Hours)**

Fees are subject to **time-based surcharges** when services are performed outside standard business hours or on designated days:

#### a) **Services performed before 9:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. (including travel time)**  
- A **fee is charged per hour or part thereof** for each hour of work (including travel time) outside standard hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.).

#### b) **Services performed on Sundays or holidays**  
- A **fee is charged per hour or part thereof** for each hour of work (including travel time) on Sundays or public holidays.

> ⚠️ **Holiday Adjustment Rule**:  
> If a holiday falls on a **Saturday or Sunday**, the holiday is **moved to the next following day that is not a holiday**.  
> This ensures that the holiday is not used to justify a day off for the Port Warden’s operations and maintains consistency in scheduling and fee calculation.
