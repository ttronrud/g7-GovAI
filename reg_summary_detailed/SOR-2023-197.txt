Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the *Investments in Permitted Infrastructure Entities Regulations*, including key definitions, regulatory requirements, restrictions, and enforcement mechanisms.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Investments in Permitted Infrastructure Entities Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Regulatory Basis and Authority**
These regulations were made under the authority of the **Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**, specifically:
- Section 2.2a
- Paragraphs 494(b)b, 501(e)c, 553(b)d, 554(9)(c)e, 970(b)f, and 977(e)g

They were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, and are part of a broader policy framework aimed at **regulating investments by insurance entities in infrastructure**—particularly those involving public bodies.

The regulations are grounded in **fiscal and financial stability objectives**, ensuring that insurance companies do not over-expose themselves to infrastructure-related risks, especially when such investments are not aligned with long-term liabilities or public interest mandates.

### 🔹 **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA). |
| **Insurance Entity** | Includes life companies, societies, or insurance holding companies. |
| **Public Body** | Broadly defined to include: <br> • Government of Canada or a province, municipality, or foreign government or political subdivision <br> • Agencies or corporations of public bodies (excluding those managing pension funds or sovereign wealth funds with investment mandates) <br> • Regulatory bodies (federal, provincial, or foreign) <br> • Indigenous governments, band councils, or bodies acting on behalf of Indigenous groups <br> • International organizations governed by treaties to which Canada is a party <br> • Not-for-profit entities where a public body appoints board members |
| **Value** | Defined in three contexts: <br> 1. Value of shares/ownership interests or loans held by an insurance entity or subsidiary (unconsolidated balance sheet value) <br> 2. Value of loans made by a public body to a permitted infrastructure entity (reported on the latter’s balance sheet) <br> 3. Face value of guarantees given by an insurance entity or subsidiary |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The concept of "control or substantial investment" is subject to **recognition under other provisions** of the ICA. If a change in control or investment is deemed under subsections 493(7), 552(6), or 969(6), it **does not count as a new acquisition** under 495(2.1), 554(2.1), or 971(2.1).

### 🔹 **3. What Constitutes a "Permitted Infrastructure Entity"?**

A permitted infrastructure entity may engage in the following **prescribed activities**:
1. **Operating** an infrastructure asset
2. **Acquiring or holding** shares or ownership interests in another entity
3. **Holding, managing, or dealing with real property** related to an infrastructure asset
4. **Designing** an infrastructure asset or acting as a **general contractor** for its construction or maintenance

> ✅ These activities are only allowed **if the infrastructure asset involves a public body** (as defined below).

---

### 🔹 **4. Conditions for Insurance Entities to Invest in Permitted Infrastructure Entities**

#### ✅ General Rule:
An insurance entity may **only** acquire a **substantial investment** or **control** in a permitted infrastructure entity **if**:
- That entity (or each infrastructure asset it operates) **involves a public body**.

> This ensures that investments are tied to public-sector involvement, reducing private-sector risk exposure.

---

### 🔹 **5. Conditions for Ownership and Control (by Type of Entity)**

#### A. **Operating Infrastructure Assets**
An insurance entity may only acquire control or a substantial investment in a permitted infrastructure entity that **operates** an infrastructure asset **if**:
- The asset is **wholly owned** by:
  - The permitted infrastructure entity itself; or
  - Another permitted infrastructure entity that the insurance entity (or any of its life company subsidiaries) **controls or has a substantial investment in**, and that control/investment was acquired under **subsection 495(2.1), 554(2.1), or 971(2.1)** of the ICA; or
  - An entity **not affiliated** with the insurance entity and in which the insurance entity has **no substantial investment**.

#### B. **Designing or Acting as General Contractor**
For entities involved in **design or construction**:
- The infrastructure asset must either:
  - Be **operated by** the permitted infrastructure entity; or
  - Be operated by **another permitted infrastructure entity** that the insurance entity (or its life company subsidiary) controls or has a substantial investment in — again, under the relevant subsections (495(2.1), 554(2.1), or 971(2.1)).

> 📌 **Contractual Condition**: If a contract specifies that once construction is complete, the asset will be operated under public body conditions, then the asset is considered to involve a public body — even during construction.

---

### 🔹 **6. Expansion of Activities (New or Additional Activities)**

If a permitted infrastructure entity that an insurance entity already controls or has a substantial investment in begins a **new activity** (e.g., starts operating a new asset) that was **not previously engaged in**, the insurance entity may **only continue** its involvement if **at the time of first engagement**, one of the following applies:

- The infrastructure asset **involves a public body**; or  
- The **permitted infrastructure entity itself involves a public body**.

> This prevents insurance entities from gradually expanding into new infrastructure activities without meeting public body thresholds.

---

### 🔹 **7. What Does "Involves a Public Body" Mean?**

An infrastructure asset is said to involve a public body if:

1. The asset is **partially or fully located in the same country** as the public body — **except** for bodies listed in paragraph (e) of the public body definition (e.g., sovereign wealth funds, certain international organizations).
2. The public body fulfills **at least one** of the following conditions:
   - Owns ≥10% of the infrastructure asset  
   - Is the **purchaser** of all or substantially all of its products/services  
   - Is the **lessor** of all or substantially all of its assets  
   - Is the **guarantor** of all or substantially all of its revenues  
   - **Approves or sets prices** users pay for services  
   - **Determines rights** to access or use the asset  

> This ensures that public bodies have **significant influence or ownership** over the asset.

---

### 🔹 **8. What Does "Permitted Infrastructure Entity Involves a Public Body" Mean?**

A permitted infrastructure entity involves a public body if:
- The public body **controls or has a substantial investment** in it; **or**
- The **aggregate value of loans** made by the public body to the entity exceeds **10% of the entity’s total liabilities**.

> This allows indirect public involvement through financing, not just direct ownership.

---

### 🔹 **9. Prohibition on Investment for Matching Assets to Liabilities**

An insurance entity may **only** acquire control or increase a substantial investment in a permitted infrastructure entity **if one of the purposes is to match its consolidated assets with its long-term liabilities**.

> This ensures that investments are not made for speculative or unrelated reasons, but rather to align with the company’s long-term financial obligations (e.g., pension or annuity obligations).

---

### 🔹 **10. Capital Restrictions (Life Companies, Societies, and Insurance Holding Companies)**

To prevent excessive exposure, **capital limits** are imposed on insurance entities.

#### A. **Life Company Restrictions**
A life company **must not**:
- Acquire control or increase a substantial investment in a permitted infrastructure entity **if** the sum of the following values exceeds **20% of its regulatory capital**:

| Value Component | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| (a) Value of shares/ownership interests | Held by the life company or its subsidiaries in all permitted infrastructure entities where control/investment was acquired under **subsection 495(2.1)** |
| (b) Value of loans | Outstanding principal of loans made to such entities under 495(2.1) |
| (c) Value of guarantees | Outstanding guarantees given on behalf of such entities under 495(2.1) |

> If the threshold is exceeded:
- The life company **must not**:
  - Acquire additional shares or loans
  - Make new loans or guarantees
  - Acquire control of, amalgamate, or merge with an entity that holds shares/loans in such infrastructure entities (if acquired under 495(2.1))

> ⚠️ Regulatory capital is determined under the *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations*, with “company” interpreted as “society” in that context.

---

#### B. **Society Restrictions**
A society must not:
- Acquire control or increase investment in a permitted infrastructure entity if the sum of values (a), (b), and (c) exceeds **20% of its regulatory capital**, where:
- Control/investment was acquired under **subsection 495(2.1)
