**Regulation Summary: Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2023-771 and Designation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage as the Minister for the Canadian Multiculturalism Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Canadian Multiculturalism Act (R.S., c. 24 (4th Supp.))**, specifically under **Section 2**, which defines the term "Minister" for the purposes of the Act. The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, exercises this statutory power to amend or modify administrative arrangements related to the implementation of the Act.

**2. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2023-771**  
The regulation formally **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2023-771**, issued on **July 26, 2023**. This prior Order had established a different ministerial designation or administrative structure for the purposes of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act. By repealing it, the government removes the previous designation and any associated procedural or functional arrangements that were tied to that order.

The repeal indicates a deliberate policy or administrative shift — likely to streamline governance, correct a misalignment, or reflect a change in ministerial responsibilities — and ensures that the current statutory framework is now in line with the current ministerial structure.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage**  
The regulation designates the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** as the **Minister for the purposes of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act**. This means that, going forward, the Minister of Canadian Heritage will be the official responsible for:

- Implementing the policies and programs under the Act;
- Overseeing federal multiculturalism initiatives;
- Ensuring compliance with the Act’s objectives, including the promotion of multiculturalism, the protection of cultural rights, and the recognition of the contributions of diverse communities in Canada;
- Serving as the primary point of contact for federal multiculturalism-related matters.

This designation is significant because it formally assigns responsibility for the Act to a specific minister, providing clarity and accountability in the administration of multicultural policy.

**4. Role of the King’s Privy Council**  
The regulation explicitly notes that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**. This status is important because it confirms the minister’s formal standing within the federal government’s executive structure and affirms their authority to act in official capacities, including in the context of statutory duties under federal legislation.

**5. Implications and Significance**  
- **Administrative Clarity**: The repeal of P.C. 2023-771 and the designation of a new minister provide a clear, current, and legally binding structure for the governance of multiculturalism policy.
- **Policy Continuity and Accountability**: By assigning the responsibility to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the government ensures that multiculturalism remains a central priority within the portfolio of a ministry with a well-established mandate related to culture, heritage, and diversity.
- **Alignment with Government Priorities**: This move reflects the government’s commitment to strengthening multiculturalism as a national value and ensuring that the relevant minister has the authority and responsibility to advance it effectively.

**6. Regulatory Reference**  
The regulation is referenced in the official publication system as:
- **Repeal of**: P.C. 2023-771 (July 26, 2023)
- **Designation**: SI/2023-41 (a Statutory Instrument issued in 2023)

It is published under the authority of the **Canadian Multiculturalism Act**, and its provisions are binding under Canadian law.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation marks a formal administrative update to the governance of Canada’s multiculturalism policy. By repealing a previous order and designating the Minister of Canadian Heritage as the responsible minister, the federal government ensures that the implementation of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act is now clearly assigned, accountable, and aligned with current ministerial responsibilities. This step enhances transparency, strengthens policy coherence, and reinforces the federal government’s commitment to multiculturalism as a cornerstone of Canadian society.
