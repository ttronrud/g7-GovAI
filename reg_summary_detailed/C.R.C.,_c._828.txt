**Detailed Summary of the *Petroleum Refinery Liquid Effluent Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These Regulations are officially known as the **Petroleum Refinery Liquid Effluent Regulations** and are designed to regulate the discharge of certain deleterious substances from petroleum refineries into aquatic environments to protect fish and water quality.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Terms**

The Regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Fisheries Act*, which provides the legal basis for environmental protection of fish habitats. |
| **Day** | A period of 24 consecutive hours. |
| **Deposit** | To release or permit the release of liquid effluent or cooling water into water frequented by fish. |
| **Liquid Effluent** | Includes process water, cooling tower blow-down, tank draining, ballast water, storm water, and runoff from land used for waste disposal. *Excludes* water treated outside the refinery or protected from contamination. |
| **Once-Through Cooling Water** | Water that circulates once through heat exchangers and does not come into contact with process streams. |
| **Crude Oil** | Virgin or unrefined petroleum or hydrocarbons similar to petroleum brought into a refinery for processing. *Excludes* residual fuels or blending fuels used primarily for internal refinery needs. |
| **Refinery** | Facilities primarily involved in separating and converting crude oil into products such as gasoline, diesel, lubricants, and petrochemicals. Excludes natural gas processing or synthetic oil production from coal or bitumen. |
| **Storm Water** | Runoff from precipitation on or passing through the refinery. If protected from contamination, it is *deemed not storm water* under the Regulations. |
| **Owner** | The owner or operator of the refinery, or their authorized representative. |
| **Deleterious Substances** | Substances harmful to fish and aquatic ecosystems. Specifically prescribed as: |
| | - Oil and grease |  
| | - Phenols |  
| | - Sulfide |  
| | - Ammonia nitrogen |  
| | - Total suspended matter |  
| | - Any substance that alters the pH of effluent (paragraph 4(f)) |

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all refineries** that:
  - Did **not begin processing crude oil before November 1, 1973**, and
  - **Began processing on or after that date**.

> This means the Regulations do not apply retroactively to refineries that started operations before 1973.

---

### **4. Permitted Discharges: Conditions and Limits**

An owner may discharge a deleterious substance **only if** the following conditions are met:

#### **A. Monthly Average Deposit Limit (Section 5(1)(a))**
- The **arithmetic mean** of actual daily deposits of each deleterious substance during the month must **not exceed** the arithmetic mean of the authorized deposits for that substance in the same month.
- Authorized deposits are calculated based on the **reference crude rate** (see below).

#### **B. Daily Deposit Limits (Section 5(1)(b) & (c))**
- No single day’s actual deposit of any deleterious substance (a, b, c, d, or e) may exceed the authorized deposit for more than **one day in a month**.
- Additionally, daily actual deposits must not exceed the authorized deposit **on any given day**.

> This prevents spikes in pollution even if average monthly levels are acceptable.

#### **C. pH Limit for Phenols (Paragraph 4(f))**
- For substances that alter pH (specifically phenols), discharge is permitted **only if** the pH of the effluent or cooling water remains between **6.0 and 9.5**.

#### **D. Storm Water Discharge Limit (Section 9)**
- For oil and grease, phenols, and total suspended matter, the **aggregate monthly amount** of these substances in storm water must not exceed the monthly authorized limit.
- The authorized limit for storm water is calculated based on the **reference crude rate** and a multiplier per 10,000 Canadian gallons of storm water discharged.

> Storm water is considered a special category due to its potential for sudden, uncontrolled pollution.

---

### **5. Reference Crude Rate**

This is a key metric used to determine authorized and actual pollutant limits.

- **Definition**:  
  The **reference crude rate** is the **maximum design stream day crude rate** of the refinery, divided by 1,000 (i.e., expressed in *thousand barrels per day*).

- **Purpose**:  
  Serves as a baseline to scale pollutant limits according to the size and capacity of the refinery.

- **Revisions**:
  - Owners may revise the reference crude rate at any time by submitting a declaration to the Minister.
  - If the **arithmetic mean of stream day crude rates** over **two consecutive months** (excluding maintenance days) falls below **85%** of the last declared rate, the owner must revise the rate.
  - The revised rate is calculated as:
    - For **7+ consecutive days**: arithmetic mean of stream day crude rates / 1,000
    - For **14+ consecutive days**: arithmetic mean of stream day crude rates / 1,000
  - The revised rate **takes effect on the first day of the month** in which it is declared.

> This ensures that pollutant limits scale appropriately with actual refinery operation levels.

---

### **6. Authorized Deposit Calculation (Section 5(1))**

Authorized deposits are calculated daily using **Schedule I**, which provides base values per thousand barrels per day, multiplied by the refinery’s reference crude rate.

| Calculation Method | Applies to |
|-------------------|----------|
| Column II of Schedule I | Daily authorized deposit (for substances a–e) |
| Column III of Schedule I | Monthly authorized deposit (for substances a–e) |
| Column IV of Schedule I | Daily authorized deposit (for substances a–e) — likely for specific thresholds |

> These values are scaled by the **reference crude rate** of the refinery.

#### **Storm Water Adjustment (Section 9)**
- For each **10,000 Canadian gallons** of storm water discharged on a given day, the authorized deposit of a deleterious substance (a, b, or e) is **increased** by the amount in Column II of Schedule II.
- Monthly storm water limit is calculated using Column III of Schedule II × reference crude rate.

> This reflects the higher environmental risk associated with storm water discharges.

---

### **7. Actual Deposit Determination (Section 5(2))**

Owners must calculate actual deposits within **30 days after the end of each month** by:

- Measuring and calculating the **concentration** of each deleterious substance in composite samples.
- Using the **flow rate** (in Canadian gallons per minute) and concentration (in mg/L) to determine the total daily pollutant load.

> The actual deposit is calculated daily using data from the concentration and flow measurements.

---

### **8. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements**

#### **A. Daily Monitoring (for pH and pollutants)**
- For **phenols**, the owner must:
  - Monitor the pH of effluents and cooling water **every day** during the month of discharge (or when requested by the Minister).
  - Use the test method in **Schedule III** (based on Standard Methods, 13th ed., 1971).

#### **B. Weekly Testing (for pollutant concentrations)**
- Concentrations of deleterious substances (a–e) must be tested **every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday**, or upon request.
- Testing uses:
  - The **test method specified in Column II of Schedule IV** (modified as per Column III).
  - Or an **equivalent method approved by the Minister**.

#### **C. Composite Sample Definition (Schedule IV)**
A composite sample is defined as:
1. A 24-hour sample collected continuously at a rate proportional to flow.
2. A sample that delivers **at least 96 equal volumes** over 24 hours.
3. In cases where **continuous stream analyzers** are approved by the Minister, the effluent itself may be considered a composite sample.

> Ensures representative sampling that reflects average conditions.

#### **D. Sample Handling Requirements**
- Must follow procedures for:
  - Sampling
  - Preservation
  - Storage
  - Prevention of interference

> Ensures data integrity and reliability.

### **9. Reporting Obligations**

Within **30 days after the end of each month** (or when requested by the Minister), the owner must submit a report containing:

1. Arithmetic mean of authorized deposits for the month (based on Schedule I and reference crude rate).
2. Authorized deposits for each day of the month (from Schedule I and Schedule II).
3. Actual daily deposits of substances (a–e) (from Schedule IV).
4. Arithmetic mean of actual deposits for the month.
5. pH of composite samples.
6. Reference crude rate for the month.
7. Any additional information requested by the Minister.

> This provides transparency and enables the Minister to verify compliance.

---

### **10. Compliance Infrastructure**

Refineries must:
- Install and maintain **sampling connections** and **flow-measuring devices** that are acceptable to the Minister.
- Ensure these systems allow the Minister to verify compliance with all requirements.

> Ensures that monitoring is both accurate and verifiable.

---

### **11. Test Methods and Standards**

All testing must follow standardized procedures:

- **pH Testing**:
