**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation Designating the Republic of Croatia as a Designated State under the Visiting Forces Act**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This document is a **Proclamation issued by the Governor General of Canada**, Michaëlle Jean, on **January 12, 2009**, under the authority granted by **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act (VFA)**, which is found in **Chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985**.

The VFA governs the legal status, rights, and obligations of **foreign military forces and their civilian personnel** when they are stationed or operating in Canada. It allows the Canadian government to determine under what conditions foreign forces may enter Canada and how their personnel—especially civilians—are treated under Canadian law.

The key power invoked here is **Section 4**, which enables the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to:
- Designate a foreign country as a “designated state”;
- Specify the extent to which the VFA applies to that country;
- Designate civilian personnel of that country as part of a “civilian component” of a visiting force, subject to certain conditions.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### **(a) Designation of the Republic of Croatia**
The Governor General, by and with the advice of the Privy Council, **designates the Republic of Croatia as a designated state** under the Visiting Forces Act.

This means that **Croatia is recognized as a country with which Canada has established a formal legal relationship** under the VFA, allowing for the application of specific provisions of the Act to Croatian military and civilian personnel operating in Canada.

#### **(b) Scope of Applicability of the Visiting Forces Act**
The Proclamation declares that:
- The **Visiting Forces Act is applicable** to Croatia **with the exception of Part VI**.
  
> **Note on Part VI**: Part VI of the VFA typically deals with **provisions related to the treatment of Canadian citizens or residents in foreign forces**, or **immigration and entry requirements**. The exclusion of Part VI suggests that while most of the VFA applies (e.g., regarding rights of military personnel, liability, and legal protections), certain provisions—particularly those involving immigration, entry, or status of Canadian citizens in foreign forces—are not extended to Croatian personnel.

This exclusion is likely to ensure that **Croatian military or civilian personnel are not subject to Canadian immigration or citizenship-related obligations** that would otherwise apply to foreign forces under the VFA.

#### **(c) Civilian Personnel Designation**
The Proclamation designates **civilian personnel of Croatia** as part of the **civilian component of the visiting force** **if** they meet the following conditions:
1. They are **in the employ of the Croatian force** (i.e., the Croatian military or government);
2. They are **not stateless persons**;
3. They are **not nationals of any state that is not a designated state**;
4. They are **not citizens or residents of Canada**.

> This provision is critical because it defines **which Croatian civilians** are protected under Canadian law (e.g., in terms of legal rights, immunity, or treatment during their stay in Canada). It excludes:
> - Stateless individuals;
> - Nationals of non-designated states (e.g., a person from the U.S. or Germany, if those countries are not designated);
> - Canadians or Canadian residents (to avoid conflicts of jurisdiction or dual citizenship issues).

This designation allows the Canadian government to **treat Croatian civilian personnel as part of the visiting force**, thereby enabling them to be governed by the VFA’s protections and limitations—such as protection from arrest, detention, or prosecution—when they are in Canada, **provided they meet the eligibility criteria**.

### **3. Purpose and Significance**

This Proclamation serves several strategic and diplomatic purposes:

- **Diplomatic Recognition**: It reflects Canada’s formal recognition of Croatia’s status as a legitimate and stable international actor, consistent with Canada’s broader foreign policy and NATO alignment.
  
- **Legal Clarity**: It provides clear legal parameters for how Croatian military and civilian personnel will be treated in Canada, reducing ambiguity and potential legal disputes.

- **Facilitation of Cooperation**: It supports Canada’s ability to host or collaborate with Croatian forces in joint military exercises, training programs, or peacekeeping missions, especially in areas involving defense, security, or international cooperation.

- **Compliance with International Norms**: By designating Croatia under the VFA, Canada aligns with international practices where countries with strong democratic institutions and military structures are granted special legal status for visiting forces.

### **4. Effective Date and Legal Effect**

- The Proclamation takes effect **immediately upon publication**.
- It is binding on all persons, institutions, and authorities in Canada.
- It is issued under the authority of the **Governor General**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council**, which confirms the legal legitimacy of the decision.

The proclamation is **published in the Canada Gazette**, the official journal of the Government of Canada, and is accessible to the public and legal institutions.

### **5. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Part VI of the VFA is not applicable** to Croatia. This means that:
  - Croatian personnel are **not subject to Canadian immigration rules** or entry requirements under Part VI.
  - Canadian citizens or residents are **not treated as being in a foreign force** if they are working for Croatia (which is not the case here).
- The designation **does not extend to all Croatian nationals or civilians**—only those meeting the specific criteria (e.g., employed by the Croatian force, not stateless, not Canadian).

---

### **6. Conclusion**

This Proclamation is a **formal and legally binding instrument** that:
- Designates the **Republic of Croatia** as a designated state under the Visiting Forces Act;
- Applies the VFA to Croatia **except for Part VI**;
- Establishes a legal framework for the treatment of **Croatian civilian personnel** who are employed by the Croatian military or government and meet specified eligibility criteria.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to **international military cooperation**, **legal predictability**, and **diplomatic engagement** with countries like Croatia, particularly in the context of post-conflict recovery, regional security, and NATO-related activities.

### **Final Note on Historical Context**
Issued in **January 2009**, this proclamation occurred during a period of significant regional stability in the Balkans following the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Croatia had been a key participant in NATO and EU integration processes, and this designation likely supported Canada’s broader efforts to strengthen defense ties with European allies.

It also demonstrates how Canada uses **flexible legal tools** like the Visiting Forces Act to manage complex international relationships while maintaining legal consistency and national security standards.

**Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Canadian Government, through a formal proclamation, designated the Republic of Croatia as a designated state under the Visiting Forces Act, allowing Croatian military and civilian personnel (meeting specific criteria) to be treated under Canadian law, with the exception of Part VI, effective January 12, 2009.
