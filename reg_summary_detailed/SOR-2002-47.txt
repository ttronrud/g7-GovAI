## **4. Purpose and Rationale**

This regulation supports:
- **International aviation security cooperation**, especially in preventing terrorism and illegal activities.
- **Efficient border control and passenger screening**, particularly in the U.S. and other designated countries.
- **Compliance with international agreements**, such as those under the **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)** and bilateral security arrangements.

It balances the need for **security and transparency** with the **protection of individual privacy rights** and **data protection principles**.

## **5. Privacy and Legal Considerations**

- The regulation is part of a broader framework that respects **privacy laws** and **data protection standards**.
- It is **not a blanket data-sharing policy** — it is strictly limited to specific flights, specific authorities, and specific data fields.
- Canadian law (including the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* or PIPEDA) may apply to the handling of personal data, and operators must ensure compliance with privacy obligations when sharing information.
