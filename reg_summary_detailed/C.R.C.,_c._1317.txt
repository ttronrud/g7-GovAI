**Detailed Summary of the *Privileges and Immunities Accession Order (United Nations)***

This regulation establishes the legal framework in Canada for recognizing and implementing the **privileges and immunities of the United Nations (UN)**, in accordance with the **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations** (the "Convention"). The Order is formally titled the *Privileges and Immunities Accession Order (United Nations)* and may be cited accordingly.

---

### 1. **Legal Capacity of the United Nations**
- The United Nations is granted **the legal capacity of a body corporate** in Canada.
- This means that the UN may be treated as a legal entity capable of owning property, entering into contracts, and being sued in Canadian courts — consistent with international law and Canada’s recognition of the UN as a distinct international organization.

---

### 2. **Immunities and Privileges for UN Officials**
- The UN, as a whole, shall enjoy **immunities and privileges** in Canada as specified in **Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9** of the Convention.
- These include, but are not limited to:
  - Immunity from legal process (e.g., civil or criminal proceedings) in certain circumstances.
  - Immunity from search, seizure, and interference with property.
  - Protection of communications and documents.
  - Exemption from certain taxes and duties.
- These privileges apply to the UN’s operations and activities in Canada.

### 3. **Privileges and Immunities for Representatives of Member States**
- **Delegates, deputy delegates, advisers, technical experts, and secretaries** of delegations attending:
  - The **principal organs** of the UN (e.g., General Assembly, Security Council),
  - **Subsidiary organs** (e.g., Economic and Social Council),
  - **Conferences convened by the UN**,
- Are granted **privileges and immunities under Section 11 of the Convention** while:
  - Exercising their official functions, and
  - Traveling to and from the place of meeting.
- Importantly, **these immunities continue even after their duties are completed** — specifically, **paragraph 11(a)** of the Convention, which protects:
  - Words spoken or written,
  - Acts performed in the discharge of their duties,
  - Even if they are no longer officially representing a Member State.
- This ensures that representatives are protected from legal action or prosecution for statements or actions made in the course of their official duties, regardless of their current status.

---

### 4. **Taxation and Residence**
- If the application of taxation in Canada is based on **residence**, then:
  - Any periods during which UN representatives are **present in Canada to perform their duties** shall **not be counted as periods of residence**.
- This means that such individuals are **not considered residents** of Canada for tax purposes, and thus are **exempt from taxation** on income derived from their UN duties.
- This provision is critical in avoiding double taxation and ensuring that UN officials can carry out their work without being subject to Canadian income tax obligations based on physical presence.

---

### 5. **Exclusions from the Scope**
- The provisions in Sections (1), (2), and (3) **do not apply** to:
  - **Representatives of Canada**, or
  - **Canadian citizens**.
- This ensures that Canadian officials and nationals are not granted the same immunities or exemptions as foreign UN representatives, maintaining national sovereignty and tax compliance.

---

### 6. **Officials of the UN (as defined by the Secretary-General)**
- Officials whose names are included in categories designated by the **Secretary-General under Section 17 of the Convention** shall enjoy the **immunities and privileges set out in Section 18** of the Convention.
- This includes high-level staff such as technical or administrative personnel who are formally designated by the UN leadership.

---

### 7. **The Secretary-General and Assistant Secretaries-General**
- The **Secretary-General** and all **Assistant Secretaries-General**, along with their **spouses and minor children**, are granted:
  - **Diplomatic immunities and privileges**,
  - **Exemptions and facilities** consistent with international law (i.e., equivalent to those of diplomatic envoys).
- This includes protection from arrest, immunity from legal proceedings, and exemption from certain taxes and duties.

---

### 8. **Experts Performing UN Missions**
- **Experts** (excluding those who are "officials of the UN" as defined in Section 4 of this Order) who serve the UN in Canada shall:
  - Enjoy the privileges and immunities listed in **paragraphs 22(a) to (f)** of the Convention.
- However, the **Secretary-General may waive** any such privilege or immunity under **Section 23 of the Convention**.
- This allows flexibility in cases where public interest, national security, or legal requirements demand that certain immunities be removed.

---

### 9. **Taxation of Canadian Citizens**
- **Nothing in this Order exempts a Canadian citizen** from taxation on:
  - **Salaries and emoluments** earned in Canada.
- This is a critical safeguard to ensure that Canadian citizens, even if working for the UN, remain subject to Canadian tax laws.
- The exemption applies only to **UN-related income** and does not extend to general income or employment within Canada.
