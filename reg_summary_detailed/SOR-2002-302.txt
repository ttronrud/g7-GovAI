**Detailed Summary of the *Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Revenue Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Regulations***  
*(S.C. 1994, c. 41, par. 37(1)(a); S.C. 1987, c. 3)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish the procedural and financial framework for making **fiscal equalization offset payments** under **Part V of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act (the "Act")**. Specifically, they govern how the federal government calculates, estimates, and adjusts payments to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador when it receives offshore revenue (such as oil and gas royalties) that exceeds the amount of equalization payments it is entitled to under the federal fiscal system.

The regulations are enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **section 227a of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act**. This provision allows for the creation of rules governing fiscal equalization offsets—payments made to the federal government to offset the financial impact of offshore revenue gains by provinces.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the fiscal arrangements between Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador.
- **"Working day"**: A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday. This definition is used to determine payment dates and deadlines.
- *(Note: The "Fiscal Arrangements Regulations" were repealed in SOR/2008-320, s. 1, and are no longer in force.)*

---

### **3. Scope and Applicability**
These regulations apply specifically to:
- **Payments under Part V of the Act**, which deals with **fiscal equalization offset payments**.
- **Fiscal years** as defined in **section 219 of the Act**.

These rules govern the timing, method, and adjustment of payments related to the fiscal equalization offset, which arises when Newfoundland and Labrador receives significant offshore revenues (e.g., from oil and gas) that may reduce its need for federal equalization support.

---

### **4. Interim Determinations by the Federal Minister**
The **Federal Minister of Finance** (or designated minister) must make **two interim determinations** regarding the fiscal equalization offset payment for a given fiscal year:

#### **First Interim Determination**
- Must be made **no later than three months before the start of the fiscal year**.
- If this determination shows that a **fiscal equalization offset payment is payable** to Her Majesty in right of the Province:
  - The **Minister of Natural Resources** will pay the **estimated amount** of the payment in **equal monthly instalments**.
  - Payments are due on the **third working day after the 15th day of each month** during the fiscal year.

> Example: For a fiscal year starting January 1, 2024, the first determination would be made by April 1, 2024. Payments would begin on the third working day after the 15th of January (e.g., January 16, 2024), and continue monthly.

#### **Second Interim Determination**
- Must be made **no later than three months before the end of the fiscal year**.
- This determination may result in adjustments to the original payment based on updated financial data or revised estimates.

##### **Outcomes of the Second Determination:**

| Scenario | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Payment remains outstanding** | The Minister of Natural Resources adjusts the **remaining monthly instalments** to reflect the revised amount, starting with the first instalment **after the date of the second determination**. Alternatively, the full remaining balance may be paid in one lump sum. |
| **Overpayment has occurred** | The overpayment must be **recovered** in the month when the second determination is made, or in the following month. Recovery can come from: <br> - Any amount payable to Her Majesty in right of the Province under the Act or the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*; <br> - Or directly from the Province as a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**. |

> This ensures that the Province does not receive more than it is entitled to and that any overpayment is promptly corrected.

---

### **5. Final Determination (Under Section 222(1) of the Act)**
After the interim determinations, a final determination is made under **subsection 222(1)** of the Act.

##### **Outcomes of the Final Determination:**

| Scenario | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Outstanding amount remains payable** | The Minister of Natural Resources pays the **remaining balance** to Her Majesty in right of the Province in the **month following the month in which the final determination is made**. |
| **Overpayment has occurred** | The overpayment is recovered in the **month following the month in which the final determination is made**, from: <br> - Any amount payable to the Province under the Act or the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*; <br> - Or from the Province as a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada. |

> This final step ensures that all financial obligations are settled with precision and accountability.

---

### **6. Key Principle: Subsequent Adjustments Take Precedence**
Despite any other provisions, **every fiscal equalization offset payment made under the Act is subject to any subsequent adjustments** that arise due to:
- Adjustments made to **equalization payments** under the **Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act** or its regulations.
- Changes in revenue estimates, economic conditions, or policy decisions.

> This provision ensures that the fiscal equalization offset system remains flexible and responsive to broader fiscal policy changes, even if those changes occur after an initial payment has been made.

### **7. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Supplemental Regulations* (SOR) publication.
