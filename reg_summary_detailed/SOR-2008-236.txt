**Detailed Summary of the Fruit Remission Order, 2008**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**

The *Fruit Remission Order, 2008* is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This authority is derived from **Section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (a federal statute governing customs duties and related provisions). The Order is also supported by references to prior legislation:

- **S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 142(e) and 145(2)(j)** – These provisions authorize the government to make remission orders for specific types of imports, particularly in cases involving processing or agricultural products.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – This foundational statute provides the general framework for customs duty remission and related administrative powers.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **grant remission (a partial or full refund) of customs duties** that were previously paid or are payable under the *Customs Tariff* for certain agricultural products — specifically, **fruit** — when those products were imported for the purpose of **processing**.

This remission is intended to support and encourage the processing industry by reducing the financial burden of importing raw fruit for further value-added production, such as canning, juicing, or other industrial uses.

---

**3. Scope and Eligibility Criteria:**

The remission applies to:

- **Specific companies** listed in **Column I** of the attached schedule.
- **Specific products** listed in **Column II** of the schedule (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas, etc.).
- **Imported during a specific fiscal year** listed in **Column III** of the schedule.
- **Remission amount** limited to the amount specified in **Column IV** of the schedule.

In essence, the Order provides a **duty remission cap** per product per company per year — meaning that the company can only claim back up to the amount specified in Column IV, even if the full duty was originally paid.

**4. Conditions for Claiming Remission:**

A claim for remission **must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the designated authority) **no later than December 31, 2010**.

This deadline is a critical administrative requirement. Any claim submitted after this date will not be eligible for remission under this Order.

> **Note:** The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is the current administrative body responsible for processing remission claims in this context, likely due to the integration of customs and emergency preparedness functions in the federal structure.

---

**5. Effective Date:**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette* (the official journal of federal laws). This means that the remission provisions are immediately applicable upon publication, but claims must still be submitted within the specified deadline (December 31, 2010).

---

**6. Key Implications:**

- **Targeted Support**: The Order is not a general duty relief. It is narrowly tailored to specific companies and products involved in fruit processing.
- **Time-Bound**: The remission is limited to imports made during a specific year (as listed in Column III), and claims must be made within a fixed timeframe (by December 31, 2010).
- **Administrative Burden**: Companies must maintain records and ensure timely submission of claims to the Minister’s office.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: The remission is conditional and capped, preventing unlimited or uncontrolled refunds.

---

**7. Conclusion:**

The *Fruit Remission Order, 2008* is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted relief measure designed to support the processing sector by reducing the cost of importing fruit for industrial use. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and economic development, ensuring that benefits are delivered to qualifying entities within a defined timeframe and under strict administrative oversight.

This Order remains valid only to the extent it complies with the Customs Tariff and the statutory authority granted under Section 115a and related legislation. Its expiration or amendment would require further legislative action.

**Note:** This Order is a *non-renewable* and *time-bound* policy, effective only for imports during the years specified in the schedule and claims submitted by December 31, 2010. It does not extend to future years or products not listed.
