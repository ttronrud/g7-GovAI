---

### **Overview**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, provides for the **remission (full cancellation or refund) of specific charges and taxes** related to certain air travel services that occurred on **June 10, 2014**.

The purpose of this Order is to recognize and compensate individuals who participated in a **special, non-commercial flight arrangement** organized by **Air Canada** to transport members and civilians of the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** to and from Moncton for a **regimental funeral**, which was conducted in a manner that did not involve commercial pricing or profit motive.

### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### 1. **Definition of "Qualified Flight"**
A "qualified flight" is defined as any flight operated by **Air Canada** on **June 10, 2014**, that:
- Was provided **for no consideration** (i.e., free of charge),
- Solely for the purpose of transporting **travellers attending a Royal Canadian Mounted Police regimental funeral in Moncton**, and
- Was between the following routes:
  - **Ottawa (Macdonald-Cartier International Airport)** or **Toronto (Lester B. Pearson International Airport)** to **Moncton**; **or**
  - **Moncton** to **Ottawa** or **Toronto**.

> This means the flights were not commercial, were not part of routine operations, and were directly tied to a specific public service event (a funeral).

#### 2. **Definition of "Traveller"**
A "traveller" is an individual who, on June 10, 2014, was:
- A **member of the RCMP**, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act*;  
- A **civilian employee of the RCMP**, as referred to in **section 10** of the *RCMP Act*; **or**
- If neither of the above applies, a person **working in the "core public administration"**, as defined in **subsection 11(1) of the Financial Administration Act**.

> This ensures that only individuals with a legitimate public service connection are eligible for remission.

#### 3. **General Interpretation**
Unless otherwise stated, all terms used in this Order have the same meaning as in the **Air Travellers Security Charge Act (ATSCA)**.

### **Remission of Charges and Taxes**

The Order grants remission (i.e., full cancellation or refund) of the following:

#### **(a) Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC)**
- Remission is granted of the **security charge** imposed under **section 11 of the Air Travellers Security Charge Act** for any **air transportation service** that included a **chargeable emplanement** (i.e., boarding) of a **qualified traveller** on a **qualified flight**.

> This means that the security fee typically paid by passengers for air travel is waived for these specific flights.

#### **(b) Excise Tax (under the Excise Tax Act)**
- Remission is granted of any **excise tax** imposed under **section 165 of the Excise Tax Act** in respect of the same chargeable emplanement.

> This includes taxes on the air transportation service (such as fuel or aircraft-related taxes) that would normally apply.

#### **(c) Interest and Penalties**
- Remission is also granted of **any interest or penalties** that were paid or would have been payable on the amount remitted under sections (a) or (b).

> This ensures that individuals are not burdened with financial penalties due to the original charges.

### **Limitations and Conditions**

1. **No Double Remission**
   - Remission is **only granted to the extent** that the amount has **not already been refunded, credited, rebated, or remitted** under:
     - The **Financial Administration Act**, or
     - Any other Act of Parliament.

> This prevents overlapping or double benefits and ensures fiscal accountability.

2. **Eligibility Requirement – Claim Submission**
   - If the charge or tax was **paid by the individual** or **remitted by Air Canada to the Receiver General**, then remission is **only granted** if:
     - A **written claim** is submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within one year** of the date this Order comes into force; and
     - The claimant provides **evidence or information** demonstrating that:
       - The charge or tax was actually **paid by them**, or
       - The tax was **remitted by Air Canada** to the Receiver General.

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and verifiability of claims.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**

The Order is grounded in the **public interest**, recognizing that:
- The flights were **non-commercial**, **non-profit**, and conducted **in the interest of public service** (honoring a RCMP funeral).
- The individuals involved were **public servants** (RCMP members or core public administration staff).
- The government wishes to **acknowledge and support** such acts of service and solidarity within the public sector.

By waiving the security charge and excise tax, the regulation ensures that those who participated in this solemn and meaningful event are not financially penalized for their service.
