## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Hazardous Products Regulations**

### 🔹 **Introduction and Legal Basis**
The regulation is enacted under **Section 19a** of the *Hazardous Products Act* (HPA), which mandates consultation with provincial governments, worker representatives, employer organizations, and supplier organizations before introducing new regulatory measures.  
It is formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to **subsection 15(1)** of the HPA.  
This regulation establishes detailed classification, labeling, and evaluation criteria for hazardous products in Canada, aligning with international standards such as the **Globally Harmonized System (GHS)** and the **United Nations Model Regulations**.

| **Chemical Name** | Scientific name following IUPAC or CAS nomenclature rules, or an internationally recognized designation that clearly identifies the substance. |
| **Flash Point** | Lowest temperature (corrected to 101.3 kPa) at which vapors of a liquid ignite when exposed to an ignition source. |
| **Gas** | A substance that either: (a) has a vapor pressure >300 kPa at 50°C, or (b) is completely gaseous at 20°C and 101.3 kPa. |
| **GHS** | The *Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals* (7th Revised Edition). |
| **Hazardous Ingredient** | An ingredient in a mixture that, when evaluated alone, is classified in a health hazard category. |
| **Hazard Statement** | A phrase indicating the nature of a hazard (e.g., "Causes severe skin burns"). |
| **Initial Boiling Point** | Temperature at which the first vapor bubble appears (vapor pressure = 101.3 kPa). |
| **Initial Supplier Identifier** | Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer or importer operating in Canada. |
| **LC50 / LD50** | LC50: Concentration causing 50% death in test animals; LD50: Dose causing 50% death in animals via a specific exposure route. |
| **Liquid** | A substance that is not a gas and has a vapor pressure ≤300 kPa at 50°C, is not gaseous at 20°C, and has a melting point ≤20°C (or is confirmed via ASTM D4359-90 or penetrometer test). |
| **Manual of Tests and Criteria** | UN document providing standardized test methods and criteria for hazard evaluation. |
| **Manufacturer** | A supplier who manufactures, produces, processes, packages, or labels a hazardous product and sells it in Canada. |
| **OECD** | Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. |
| **Outer Container** | The most outward container visible during normal handling — *excludes* the only container of a product. |
| **Pictogram** | A graphic symbol with border/background to indicate a hazard (e.g., skull and crossbones). |
| **Precautionary Statement** | Recommended actions to reduce exposure risks (e.g., "Use only in well-ventilated areas"). |
| **Product Identifier** | Brand name, chemical name, common name, generic name, or trade name. |
| **Risk Group Classification** | Classification under the *Human Pathogens and Toxins Act* (Risk Group 2, 3, or 4) for biohazardous infectious materials. |
| **SADT (Self-Accelerating Decomposition Temperature)** | The lowest temperature at which self-accelerating decomposition begins (relevant for unstable substances). |
| **Scientifically Validated Method** | A method that is accurate, reproducible, and based on established scientific principles. |
| **Signal Word** | "Danger" (for severe hazard) or "Warning" (for moderate hazard) used to indicate severity. |
| **Solid** | A substance that is neither liquid nor gas. |
| **United Nations Model Regulations** | UN document on transport of dangerous goods (as amended). |
| **UN Number** | Four-digit code assigned under UN Model Regulations. |
| **Vapour** | Gaseous form released from a liquid or solid state. |
| **Workplace** | A place where a person works for remuneration. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: A reference to a "hazard class" means a class listed in **Schedule 2** of the HPA.

## 🧪 **Classification Principles and Procedures**

### 1. **Health Professionals**
- Defined as:
  - Physicians registered and practicing under provincial medical laws.
  - Nurses registered or licensed and practicing under provincial nursing laws.

> Used in the context of health hazard evaluations, especially for biological agents.

---

### 2. **Use of "Should"**
- In referenced or incorporated texts, **"should" is interpreted as imperative** (i.e., mandatory), unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

> Ensures strict compliance with regulatory requirements.

---

### 3. **Order of Hazard Severity in Classification Tables**
- In each subpart of Parts 7 and 8 (which cover hazard classifications), categories and subcategories are listed in **order of decreasing severity**.
- **Exception**: For Subpart 5 of Part 7 (related to biological hazards), the order may differ.

> This ensures that the most severe hazard is always evaluated first.

---

### 4. **Classification Rule: Most Severe Hazard Wins**
- If a product meets criteria for **multiple hazard categories/subcategories**, it must be classified in the **one representing the most severe hazard**.
- Once a category is assigned, **no further evaluation** is required for less severe categories in the same table.
- If a product is classified in a **more severe category**, it **does not need to be evaluated** for less severe ones.

> Prevents over-classification and ensures hazard clarity.

---

### 5. **Prescribed Classification in Schedule 4**
- If a product, mixture, or substance is **prescribed** in **Schedule 4** (a list of substances with fixed classifications), it **must be classified in that specific category/subcategory**.
- Additionally, the product **must be evaluated** for **all other hazard classes** (e.g., physical, health, environmental) using the relevant sections (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.7).

> Ensures full hazard assessment even when one hazard is predefined.

---

### 6. **Mixtures with More Severe Ingredients**
- If a mixture contains one or more ingredients classified in a **more severe hazard category** within the same classification table, the **mixture must be classified in that more severe category**.
- This applies only when the more severe ingredient is present in a concentration above the threshold specified in the hazard class.

> Ensures that mixtures are not downgraded due to less dangerous components.

---

### 7. **Impurities, Stabilizers, and Additives**
- **Known impurities, stabilizing solvents, or additives** that are:
  - Classified as hazardous, and
  - Present at a concentration **above the threshold** specified in a hazard class,

> Must be considered during classification.

> This ensures that additives or impurities do not reduce the hazard classification of a product.

---

### 8. **Packaging of Multiple Products**
- If **two or more individually packaged products** are combined in an outer container for sale or import, the **assemblage is not considered a single product**.
- Each product must be evaluated **separately** and classified independently.

> Prevents misclassification due to packaging.

---

### 9. **Animal Data Relevance**
- Animal data from a specific species **cannot be used** to classify a mixture or substance in any health hazard class (Subparts 1–10, 12 of Part 8) **if it has been proven scientifically** that the mechanism of action in that species is **not relevant to humans**.

> Promotes human-relevant data and avoids misleading hazard assessments.
