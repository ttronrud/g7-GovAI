### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Order Respecting the Seizure of Property Situated in Canada (Aircraft RA-82078)*  
(SOR/2023-120)

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

This order is issued under the authority of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**, specifically:

- **Paragraph 4(1)(b)(a)** of SEMA: Allows the Governor in Council to seize property situated in Canada that is owned, held, or controlled by individuals or entities designated under the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations.
- **Subsection 4(1.1)(b)** of SEMA: Provides for the seizure of property where the actions of a foreign state (in this case, the Russian Federation) constitute a grave breach of international peace and security.

The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) has determined that the actions of the **Russian Federation**—specifically its invasion of Ukraine and associated violations of international law—constitute a **grave breach of international peace and security**, resulting in a **serious international crisis**.

This legal basis enables Canada to take targeted economic measures against Russian-linked entities and individuals, including the seizure of assets located within Canadian territory.

### **Subject of the Seizure**

The property subject to seizure is:

- **An An-124-100-150 aircraft**, manufactured by Aviastar-SP.
- **Registration number**: RA-82078  
- **Serial number**: 9773054559153  
- **Location**: Lester B. Pearson International Airport (CYYZ), Toronto, Ontario  
- **Ownership or control**: The aircraft is directly or indirectly owned, held, or controlled by one or more of the following entities or individuals:

  1. **Aleksey Ivanovich Isaykin** (a Russian national and key figure in Volga-Dnepr Airlines)  
  2. **Volga-Dnepr Airlines (Ireland) Limited**  
  3. **Volga-Dnepr Logistics B.V.**  
  4. **Sberbank** (a major Russian state-owned bank)  
  5. **Volga-Dnepr Airlines**  
  6. **Volga-Dnepr Group**  

All of these entities are **designated under the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations**, which are administered under the SEMA framework.

### **Seizure Mechanism and Control**

The aircraft is **seized in full**, meaning:

- **No dealings** can be carried out with the aircraft (e.g., sale, transfer, lease, or use) except through the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**.
- The **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** is explicitly granted:
  - **Possession** of the aircraft
  - **Control** over the aircraft
  - Authority to **manage**, **maintain**, **preserve**, or **deal with** the aircraft in any way as deemed appropriate by the Minister.

This ensures that the asset is effectively removed from private or commercial use and placed under government administrative control, pending further legal or policy decisions.

---

### **Applicability and Timing**

- The Order applies **immediately upon registration** with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (or the relevant government body), **before** it is published in the *Canada Gazette*.
- This is in accordance with **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, which allows certain instruments to take effect immediately upon registration, without waiting for publication.

This immediate effect ensures swift enforcement of economic sanctions in response to the ongoing international crisis.

---

### **Repeal of Previous Order**

- The **prior Order Respecting the Seizure of Property Situated in Canada (Volga-Dnepr Airlines or Volga-Dnepr Group)** is **repealed**.
- This indicates that the current order supersedes an earlier measure, likely because the scope, target, or legal basis has evolved or been refined in light of new developments or designations.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), which is typically the same day it is issued and processed.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Context**

This regulation is part of Canada’s broader **economic sanctions regime** targeting the Russian Federation in response to its actions in Ukraine. The seizure of the aircraft serves several key policy objectives:

1. **Deterrence**: Demonstrates Canada’s commitment to enforcing international law and sanctioning entities involved in activities undermining global peace and security.
2. **Accountability**: Holds Russian-linked entities accountable for their involvement in actions that violate international norms.
3. **Asset Freezing**: Prevents the use of Canadian-based assets (including aviation assets) to support or benefit Russian interests.
4. **Alignment with International Measures**: Reflects Canada’s alignment with international sanctions efforts led by the United States, the European Union, and other allies.

---

### **Key Legal and Strategic Implications**

- The seizure of a commercial aircraft is a significant action, as it affects not only the financial interests of the involved parties but also raises questions about:
  - The use of civil aviation assets in geopolitical conflicts
  - The role of Canadian law in enforcing international sanctions
  - The balance between national security and economic rights

- The designation of **Volga-Dnepr Airlines** and its associated entities is particularly notable, as this airline has been linked to Russian state interests and has been used for transporting goods and personnel in ways that have raised concerns about its role in supporting Russian economic activities.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a concrete and legally grounded enforcement measure under Canadian law that:

- Targets a specific aircraft (RA-82078) located in Canada  
- Seizes it under the authority of the Special Economic Measures Act  
- Places full control in the hands of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services  
- Reflects Canada’s response to the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine  
- Is effective immediately upon registration  

It exemplifies how Canada uses targeted economic sanctions to uphold international peace and security, while ensuring that legal processes are followed and that assets are not exploited for strategic or commercial benefit by sanctioned actors.
