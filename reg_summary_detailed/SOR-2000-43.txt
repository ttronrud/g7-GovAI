**Detailed Summary of the Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations** were issued under the authority of the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)**, specifically:

- **Section 48(1)**: This provision allows the Minister of the Environment to propose regulations related to environmental protection, including those affecting emissions or pollution from fuel dispensing systems.
- **Section 34(1)**: This enables the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to make regulations when a proposed regulation is consistent with environmental protection objectives and does not conflict with other federal or provincial legislation.
- **Section 34(1)b**: The federal-provincial advisory committee was given the opportunity to provide expert advice on the proposed regulations, ensuring stakeholder input and intergovernmental coordination.

Additionally, the Governor in Council concluded that the proposed regulations **do not overlap** with any other existing federal or provincial laws regulating substances or aspects of gasoline use — confirming that the regulation is a standalone environmental measure.

The final regulations were adopted on **June 5, 1999**, and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, giving interested parties the opportunity to submit comments or file objections, which is a standard procedural requirement under CEPA.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **reduce air pollution** caused by gasoline vapour emissions during fuel dispensing — particularly from nozzles used to dispense gasoline or gasoline blends containing **benzene**.

Benzene is a known carcinogen and volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to ground-level ozone formation and smog. By limiting the flow rate at which fuel is dispensed, the regulation aims to:

- Minimize the release of hydrocarbon vapours during fueling.
- Improve public health and environmental quality.
- Reduce the contribution of fueling operations to urban air pollution.

Importantly, the rules **do not apply** to dispensing into **heavy-duty vehicles**, as these vehicles have different emission characteristics and are typically refuelled in different settings (e.g., commercial fleets, service stations with specialized equipment).

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Gasoline** | A fuel sold or marketed as gasoline, or a petroleum distillate or mixture of distillates, oxygenates, or additives suitable for spark-ignition engines. It must meet specific physical and chemical standards, including: <br> - Vapour pressure ≥ 38 kPa <br> - Antiknock index ≥ 80 <br> - 10% distillation temperature: 35°C to 70°C <br> - 50% distillation temperature: 65°C to 120°C <br> (Based on CAN/CGSB-3.5-94 standard) |
| **Gasoline Blend** | A mixture of gasoline and an oxygenate (e.g., ethanol) designed for use in spark-ignition engines. |
| **Heavy-Duty Vehicle** | Any on-road vehicle with: <br> - Maximum design loaded weight > 3,856 kg <br> - Curb weight > 2,722 kg <br> - Or a cross-sectional area > 4.2 m² (projected geometric area along longitudinal axis) |
| **On-Road Vehicle** | Any self-propelled vehicle designed for operation on public roads. |
| **Oxygenate** | An oxygen-containing, ashless organic compound added to gasoline to increase oxygen content and improve combustion efficiency (e.g., ethanol, methanol). |
| **Retailer** | A person who owns or operates a business where gasoline or a gasoline blend is sold or offered for sale to consumers. |
| **Wholesale Purchaser-Consumer** | A person who is not a retailer and stores gasoline or a gasoline blend in a tank of at least **2,100 litres** for use in on-road vehicles (e.g., fleet operators, industrial users). |

---

### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

- **Nozzles used to dispense gasoline or gasoline blends that contain benzene**  
- **Into on-road vehicles** (excluding heavy-duty vehicles)

**Exclusions**:
- Nozzles used **only** to dispense gasoline or gasoline blends into **heavy-duty vehicles** are **not subject** to these flow rate limits.

This exclusion recognizes that heavy-duty vehicles may be refuelled under different operational conditions and that their emissions profiles differ from light-duty vehicles (e.g., passenger cars).

---

### **5. Flow Rate Limit**

- **Maximum allowable flow rate**: **38 litres per minute (L/min)**  
- **Prohibited action**: No retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer may use or offer for use a nozzle that dispenses fuel at a rate **exceeding 38 L/min**.

This limit is intended to reduce the amount of fuel vapours released during dispensing, especially during the initial stages when vapours are most volatile.

---

### **6. How to Determine Flow Rate**

To verify compliance with the 38 L/min limit, a person must perform a **measured dispensing test** using the following procedure:

#### **Step-by-Step Procedure**:
1. **Equipment Required**:
   - A **digital stopwatch** that reads to at least **0.01 seconds**.
   - The **dispenser’s volume meter** (to measure dispensed volume).

2. **Start Point**:
   - Begin the stopwatch when the volume meter shows **2.0 L** of fuel has been dispensed.

3. **Stop Point**:
   - Stop the stopwatch when the volume meter reaches **12.0 L** (i.e., 10.0 L of fuel is dispensed after the initial 2.0 L).

4. **Measure Time and Volume**:
   - Record:
     - Start time (in seconds): \( t_1 \)
     - End time (in seconds): \( t_2 \)
     - Start volume: \( V_1 = 2.0 \) L
     - End volume: \( V_2 = 12.0 \) L

5. **Calculate Flow Rate (in L/min)**:
   \[
   \text{Flow Rate (L/min)} = \frac{(V_2 - V_1)}{(t_2 - t_1)} \times 60
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{10.0}{(t_2 - t_1)} \times 60
   \]

> Example: If the time between 2.0 L and 12.0 L is 15.0 seconds:
> Flow rate = (10.0 / 15.0) × 60 = 40.0 L/min → **Exceeds limit** → Violation.

### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- **Compliance Responsibility**: Retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers are responsible for ensuring that all nozzles used to dispense fuel into on-road vehicles (excluding heavy-duty vehicles) meet the 38 L/min limit.
- **Verification Requirement**: The flow rate must be measured regularly and documented to demonstrate compliance.
- **Penalties**: While not explicitly stated in the text, under CEPA, failure to comply may lead to enforcement actions, including fines or corrective orders, depending on subsequent administrative procedures.

---

### **8. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force **12 months after the date of registration** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*.

Since the regulations were published on **June 5, 1999**, they became effective on **June 5, 2001**.

---

### **9. Environmental and Public Health Rationale**

- **Reduction of VOC Emissions**: Faster dispensing leads to greater release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including benzene, which contribute to smog and respiratory health issues.
- **Improved Air Quality**: By limiting flow rates, the regulation helps reduce urban air pollution, particularly in densely populated areas.
- **Alignment with International Standards**: The regulation reflects broader global efforts to reduce fuel vapour emissions at the point of dispensing, such as in the U.S. and European Union.

---

### **10. Key Limitations and Considerations**

- **Does not cover heavy-duty vehicles**: The exemption acknowledges that these vehicles are often refuelled in larger, more controlled environments and may have different emission profiles.
- **Does not regulate fuel composition**: The regulation only controls **dispensing speed**, not the chemical content of gasoline or blends.
- **Does not apply to non-benzene-containing fuels**: Only fuels containing benzene are subject to the flow rate limit.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Gasoline and Gasoline Blend Dispensing Flow Rate Regulations** represent a targeted environmental measure under CEPA designed to reduce emissions of harmful vapours during fueling. By setting a maximum flow rate of **38 L/min** for nozzles dispensing gasoline or gasoline blends containing benzene into on-road vehicles (excluding heavy-duty vehicles), the regulation promotes cleaner air and better public health outcomes.

The rules are practical, measurable, and enforceable, relying on a clear testing methodology to ensure compliance. The regulation reflects a balance between environmental protection and operational feasibility for fuel retailers and consumers.
