**Detailed Summary of the Remission Order under the Canadian Dental Care Plan (C-DPC) – S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Treasury Board** and the **Minister of Health**, establishes a **remission (forgiveness) of overpayments** under the **Canadian Dental Care Plan (C-DPC)** for specific individuals who were **erroneously determined to be eligible** or **incorrectly assessed** in terms of co-payment obligations due to an error in calculating their **adjusted family net income**.

The order is intended to correct **unreasonable financial burdens** placed on individuals who received dental care services under the Plan, but were subject to incorrect eligibility or co-payment determinations—particularly during a transitional period in the Plan’s implementation.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Authority**: The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**.
- **Applicable Legislation**: 
  - *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*
  - *R.S., c. F-11* (Financial Administration Act)

This gives the government the power to make remission orders when the collection of certain amounts would be unreasonable.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |

## **Section 1: Remission for Individuals Who Were Erroneously Determined Eligible (or Had Inaccurate Co-Payment Determinations)**

**Eligibility Criteria (Subject to subsections 2 and 3):**

A person is eligible for remission if they meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Application Timing**:  
   - Applied for coverage **prior to September 5, 2025**.

2. **Eligibility Periods**:  
   The person was determined to be eligible for **one of the following coverage periods**:
   - A period **beginning May 1, 2024**, and **ending on or before June 30, 2025**; **OR**
   - A period **beginning on or after June 1, 2025**, and **ending on June 30, 2026**.

3. **Error in Eligibility or Co-Payment Determination**:  
   The individual was:
   - **Erroneously determined to be eligible**, or
   - Subject to an **inaccurate co-payment determination** due to an **incorrect calculation of their adjusted family net income**.

4. **Receipt of Improperly Paid Dental Services**:  
   During the relevant coverage period, the person:
   - Received dental care services for which:
     - An amount **should not have been paid**, or
     - A **lower amount should have been paid** (i.e., overpayment occurred).

5. **Financial Consequence**:  
   **But for this Order**, the person would have been required to **repay** the overpaid amount to the Plan.

### **Special Provision for Services Completed After Coverage Ends**

Remission is **only granted** for dental care services that:
- Were **completed after the end of the person’s coverage**,  
- But the person **began receiving** those services **before the end of their coverage**,  
- And it was **approved under the Plan** that the services would be completed after coverage ended.

> This ensures that remission applies only to services that were planned or authorized to extend beyond the original coverage period.

---

### **Exclusion Clause**

Any person who **incorrectly attested** in their application that they **did not have access to dental insurance on or after May 1, 2024** is **excluded** from the application of subsections (1) and (2).

> This prevents individuals from claiming remission if they knowingly misrepresented their insurance status.

---

## **Section 2: Remission for Individuals Who Were Subsequently Found Ineligible Due to Access to Dental Insurance**

This applies to individuals who:

1. **Applied for coverage before May 1, 2024**;  
2. Were **determined to be eligible** and **received dental care services** during that time;  
3. Were **subsequently found to be ineligible** for coverage because they **had access to dental insurance** (i.e., they were already covered by another plan);  
4. **But for this Order**, would have been required to **repay** the amount paid under the Plan for those services.

---

### **Amount of Remission**

In **both cases** (Section 1 and Section 2), the **amount to be remitted** is:

> The **total amount paid under the Plan** to dental care professionals for the dental care services that the person received.

This includes any overpayments or incorrect co-payments that resulted from the eligibility or income calculation errors.

---

## **Purpose and Rationale**

This remission order addresses several key issues:

1. **Errors in Income Calculation**:  
   The Plan uses adjusted family net income to determine eligibility and co-payment levels. Errors in this calculation—especially during a transitional phase—can lead to individuals being wrongly classified as eligible when they should not have been.

2. **Unfair Financial Burden**:  
   Individuals who receive dental services under the Plan but are later found to be ineligible or who had inaccurate co-payment assessments are required to repay funds. This creates an **unreasonable financial burden**, especially when the error was due to a system or administrative flaw.

3. **Transitional Periods**:  
   The specific timeframes (May 1, 2024 – June 30, 2025 and June 1, 2025 – June 30, 2026) reflect a **critical transition period** in the implementation of the C-DPC, where eligibility rules were being adjusted or clarified.

4. **Prevention of Fraud or Misrepresentation**:  
   The exclusion of individuals who falsely claimed lack of dental insurance ensures that the remission is not used to cover deliberate misrepresentation.

## **Implications for Stakeholders**

- **Patients**:  
  Individuals who received dental services during the specified periods and were wrongly assessed may now receive a **full refund** of overpaid amounts, reducing financial hardship.

- **Dental Professionals**:  
  The Plan will continue to pay directly for services, and any remission will reduce the financial exposure of the government to overpayments.

- **Government and Administration**:  
  The order corrects systemic errors in income assessment and improves the fairness and accuracy of eligibility determinations, especially during transitional phases.

- **Fraud Prevention**:  
  The exclusion clause reinforces the importance of truthful disclosure in health plan applications.

## **Conclusion**

This remission order is a **corrective measure** designed to ensure **fairness, equity, and reasonableness** in the administration of the Canadian Dental Care Plan. It directly addresses **administrative errors** in eligibility and co-payment assessments, particularly during a period of transition, and provides **financial relief** to individuals who would otherwise have been required to repay funds they did not owe. By clearly defining eligibility criteria, exclusion rules, and the scope of remission, the order enhances transparency and trust in the Plan’s operations.

**Final Note**: This order is a **temporary and corrective** measure and does not alter the underlying eligibility rules or financial structure of the Canadian Dental Care Plan. It is intended to resolve specific, identified issues arising from income calculation errors and transitional implementation.
