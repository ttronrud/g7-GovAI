The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2015-72, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2015-72, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The regulation is **repealed**. It no longer exists in force as of the date specified in the repeal notice.

**Repeal Instrument**:  
- **SOR/2015-72** (Supplemental Orders and Regulations, 2015, No. 72)  
- **Section 1** of this regulation contains the repeal provision.

**What Was Repealed**:  
While the original text of the repealed regulation is not provided, the notation "[Repealed, SOR/2015-72, s. 1]" implies that a prior regulation (possibly related to a specific area such as licensing, safety, environmental standards, or financial regulation) was formally cancelled by this order. The exact subject matter of the original regulation would have been defined in its original text, which is no longer accessible or in effect.

**Purpose of the Repeal**:  
Regulations are often repealed when:  
- They are outdated or no longer relevant.  
- They conflict with newer legislation.  
- They create administrative or legal inconsistencies.  
- A more comprehensive or updated regulation has been introduced.  

In this case, the repeal likely occurred to modernize, simplify, or align the regulatory framework with current policy or legal standards.

**Implications**:  
- Any legal or operational obligations previously derived from the repealed regulation are no longer enforceable.  
- Entities or individuals who were previously subject to its provisions must now comply with current, applicable regulations.  
- Legal or compliance teams should refer to current legislation or regulatory updates to ensure adherence to valid rules.

**Conclusion**:  
The regulation referenced has been formally removed from the legal framework through **SOR/2015-72, section 1**. As such, it is **no longer in force**, and its provisions are superseded. To understand the current regulatory environment, one must consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, which may now govern the subject area previously covered by the repealed rule.

> 🔍 **Note**: To determine the original subject of the repealed regulation, a search of the official government publication (e.g., Canada Gazette or the legislation database such as CanLII or the Government of Canada’s regulations portal) under SOR/2015-72 would be required. Without the original text, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice.
