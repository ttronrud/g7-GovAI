## 📊 Investment Limits (Sections 506–508)

These sections set **maximum allowable investments** in various types of assets, based on the company’s type (life vs. property & casualty).

---

### 🔹 **Section 506 – Investment Limit (Minimum Capital Requirement)**

Applies to **life insurance companies**. The total investment limit is calculated as:

| Component | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 70% of the amount determined under subsection (4) | (Base capital) |
| 15% of liabilities for **non-participating life insurance policies** | |
| 25% of liabilities for **participating life insurance policies** | |
| 5% of liabilities for the following annuities: | |
| - Life annuities (guaranteed or not) with defined periodic payments | |
| - Annuities with guaranteed interest rates >10 years | |
| - Group long-term disability annuities (to retirement age) | |
| - Other disability annuities (to age 65 or for life) | |

> 💡 This section sets a **conservative cap** on how much a life insurer can invest in annuities and policies, especially those with guaranteed returns or long-term commitments.

---

### 🔹 **Section 507 – Investment Limit (Intermediate Capital Requirement)**

Applies to **life insurance companies**. The limit is:

| Component | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 70% of the amount determined under subsection (4) | |
| 15% of liabilities for **non-participating life insurance policies** | |
| 25% of liabilities for **participating life insurance policies** | |
| 5% of liabilities for the same annuities as in Section 506 | |

> 📌 This is a **more relaxed** limit than Section 506 but still tightly controls exposure to long-term liabilities.

---

### 🔹 **Section 508 – Investment Limit (Maximum Capital Requirement)**

Applies to **life insurance companies**. The limit is:

| Component | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| 100% of the amount determined under subsection (4) | |
| 20% of liabilities for **non-participating life insurance policies** | |
| 40% of liabilities for **participating life insurance policies** | |
| 5% of liabilities for the same annuities as in Sections 506–507 | |

> ⚠️ This is the **most permissive** of the three, allowing greater investment in participating policies and annuities, but still constrained by the high weight on policy liabilities.

---

### 🔹 **Property & Casualty (P&C) and Marine Companies**

For **P&C or marine insurers**, the investment limit is:

- **10%** (Section 506)
- **25%** (Section 507)
- **35%** (Section 508) of **total assets**

> 🔍 These limits are based on **total assets**, not policy liabilities, reflecting the different risk profiles of P&C and marine insurers.

---

## 💡 Purpose of the Investment Limits

- To **prevent overexposure** to high-risk investments (especially in real estate or equity).
- To ensure that **liabilities (especially long-term annuities and participating policies)** are adequately backed by capital.
- To maintain **financial resilience** in the face of market downturns or adverse claims.
- To promote **prudent risk management** across the insurance sector.

## 🏢 Regulatory Capital and Subsidiary Investments (Section 506 Subsection)

For the purpose of determining the investment limits, the **regulatory capital** of a company includes:

1. **Regulatory capital of the company itself**.
2. **Excess of total assets over total liabilities** (including deferred taxes and subordinated debt) in:
   - Financial institutions
   - Bank or insurance holding companies
   - Entities controlled by them
3. **Deferred realized capital gains/losses** from real estate or share transactions (only for life companies).
4. **Subordinated indebtedness** issued by such entities.
5. **Minority interests** in controlled entities.
6. **Investments** in financial institutions or entities (excluding subordinated debt) that are part of the regulatory capital of another entity.
7. **Loans** made by the company or its designated entities to:
   - Insurance companies
   - Securities dealers
   - Entities controlled by them  
   *(if such loans are part of the regulatory capital of the insurer or the regulated entity)*

> ✅ This ensures that **the parent company’s capital is not diluted** by risky exposures in its subsidiaries.
