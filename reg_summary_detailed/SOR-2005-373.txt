## **Key Provisions and Detailed Analysis**

---

### **1. Requirements for Requests for Permission or Leave Without Pay**

Under **sections 114(1), (2), and 115(1)** of the Act, employees may apply for:
- **Permission to seek nomination or run for office**, or
- **Leave of absence without pay** due to political activity.

#### **Mandatory Elements of the Written Request:**
All such requests must be submitted in **writing** and must include the following information:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nature of Duties** | The employee’s permanent and temporary duties, including position title. |
| **Detailed Description of Duties** | A formal, approved description of responsibilities, reviewed and approved by the relevant organization. |
| **Work Location** | The physical location where the employee performs duties. |
| **Level and Visibility of Position** | The importance, visibility, and influence of the role (e.g., seniority, public exposure). |
| **Nature of Election and Electoral District (if applicable)** | For candidates, the type of election (e.g., federal, provincial) and the electoral district involved. |

> This ensures that the Commission can assess whether the employee’s political involvement could impair their ability to remain impartial in performing public service duties.

#### **Additional Information May Be Requested**
The Public Service Commission (PSC) may, at its discretion, request **any other information** necessary to determine whether:
- The employee’s political activity **impairs or appears to impair** their ability to perform duties impartially.

> This provision allows flexibility in assessing context-specific risks, especially in roles with high visibility or public accountability.

---

### **2. Commission’s Review and Decision-Making Process**

When evaluating a request under **sections 114 and 115**, the Commission must:
- **Review and analyze** all information provided by the employee and the relevant organization.
- Make a decision within **30 days** of receiving all required information.

#### **Notification Requirements:**
The Commission must notify, in writing:
- The **employee**, and
- The **deputy head** of the relevant organization,

along with:
- The **decision** (approval or denial),
- The **reasons** for the decision, and
- Any **applicable conditions** (e.g., restrictions on political activity, time limits, etc.).

> This ensures transparency, fairness, and accountability in the decision-making process.

---

### **3. Application to Investigations Under Sections 118 and 119**

This Part applies to investigations initiated under:
- **Section 118**: Allegations of improper political activity by employees.
- **Section 119**: Allegations of improper political activity by deputy heads.

Thus, the regulations govern both **pre-approval requests** and **post-incident investigations** into political conduct.

---

### **4. Filing an Allegation**

An individual may submit an allegation that an employee or deputy head has violated the Act (e.g., failed to comply with sections 113(1), 114(1)–(3), or 115(1), or a deputy head contravened section 117).

#### **Submission Requirements:**
- Must be submitted in **writing**.
- Must be made within specific timeframes:
  - **If the improper activity occurred during an election period**: within **30 days after the election period ends**.
  - **If the activity began outside an election period**: within **30 days after becoming aware** of the activity, **but no later than one year after the activity began**.

> This creates a reasonable window for reporting while preventing indefinite delays.

#### **Exceptions to Time Limits:**
Failure to submit within the timeframe **does not bar investigation** if:
- The political activity **could impair or appear to impair** the employee’s ability to act impartially; **or**
- There is **reason to believe** the deputy head violated **section 117** (which prohibits deputy heads from engaging in certain political activities).

> This ensures that serious concerns are not dismissed simply due to timing.

---

### **5. Determining When an Allegation is "Submitted"**

To establish the date of submission, the following rules apply:

| Method | Submission Date |
|-------|------------------|
| **By mail** | Six days after the **postmark** or **postage meter impression** (whichever is later) |
| **Hand-delivered or courier** | The **day of delivery** |
| **Electronic transmission** | The **day it is transmitted** |

> This standardized approach ensures consistency and clarity in determining the timeline for investigations.

---

### **6. Commission’s Response to Allegations**

If the Commission decides to **investigate** an allegation:

- It must **notify**:
  - The **person who made the allegation**,
  - In the case of an **employee**: the **employee** and the **deputy head** of their employing organization,
  - In the case of a **deputy head**: the **deputy head** and the **Clerk of the Privy Council**.

- It must inform both parties that:
  - They have the **right to be heard**,
  - Whether submissions are to be made **orally or in writing**.

> This promotes due process and ensures fair treatment under the rules of natural justice.

#### **If the Allegation is Withdrawn:**
The Commission **may continue the investigation** if:
- In the case of an **employee**: the political activity could impair impartiality; or
- In the case of a **deputy head**: there is reason to believe a violation of section 117 occurred.

> This prevents individuals from withdrawing allegations simply to avoid consequences, especially when there is a real risk of impaired impartiality.

---

### **7. Outcome of an Investigation**

#### **Allegation Against an Employee:**
The Commission must issue a written decision with:
- Whether the allegation is **substantiated**,
- Any **corrective action** (e.g., reprimand, suspension, disciplinary measures), or
- A decision to **dismiss** the employee (if warranted).

> This ensures that employees are not only assessed for misconduct but also that appropriate corrective measures are taken when necessary.

#### **Allegation Against a Deputy Head:**
The Commission must issue a written decision with:
- Whether the allegation is **substantiated**,
- And notify the **deputy head** and the **Clerk of the Privy Council**.

> Note: No dismissal is possible under this provision — only substantiation or non-substantiation.

---

### **8. Disclosure of Personal Information**

The Commission may **disclose personal information** obtained during investigations if the disclosure serves one or more of the following public interests:

| Justification | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Promotes political impartiality | Helps ensure that public servants remain neutral. |
| Promotes accountability | Encourages responsible behavior by public servants. |
| Corrects improper political activity | Enables remedial action to prevent future misconduct. |
| Prevents recurrence | Supports institutional learning and policy improvement. |
| Encourages proper practices | Reinforces norms of acceptable political behavior. |

> However, before disclosing information that may infringe on **privacy rights**, the Commission must determine whether:
> - The **public interest in disclosure outweighs** the individual’s privacy interest.

> This balances individual rights with institutional integrity and transparency.

---

### **9. Effective Date and Repeal Note**

- These regulations **came into force** on the date that **Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act** came into effect.
- **Note**: The regulations were in force as of **December 31, 2005** (as per SI/2005-122).
- **Repealed provision**: Section 1 of SOR/2012-239 (which repealed part of the original regulation) is noted in the text, indicating that **some elements have been updated or replaced** by later legislation.

> This shows that the regulations are subject to periodic review and revision to adapt to evolving governance and accountability standards.
