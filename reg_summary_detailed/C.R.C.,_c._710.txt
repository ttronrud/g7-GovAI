### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **promote stock improvement** in Canadian agriculture by enabling farmer cooperatives (associations) to access high-quality purebred sires. By allowing controlled, accountable, and monitored use of government-owned breeding stock, the regulations ensure:
- Efficient use of genetic resources.
- Protection of public assets (government-owned animals).
- Accountability among farmers through enforceable agreements.
- Fair financial and logistical responsibilities.

---

### **Key Principles and Governance Features**

- **Accountability**: Strong emphasis on reporting, caretaker performance, and member liability.
- **Control and Oversight**: The Director maintains authority over animal use, health, and return.
- **Fair Cost Allocation**: Transportation costs are shared appropriately—government covers initial and return transport; associations bear operational costs.
- **Flexibility with Oversight**: Inter-association exchanges are allowed only with Director approval, ensuring no unregulated or unmonitored use.
- **Long-Term Planning**: Six-year agreements allow stable planning for breeding programs while maintaining flexibility for renewal or termination.

### **Conclusion**

The *Loaning of Purebred Sires Regulations* establish a structured, transparent, and accountable framework for the temporary transfer of government-owned purebred male livestock to farmer cooperatives. The regulations balance the need for agricultural advancement with the protection of public assets, ensuring that animals are properly cared for, used responsibly, and returned when necessary. The system promotes stock improvement while safeguarding the interests of both the Department and the participating farmers through clear responsibilities, enforceable agreements, and robust oversight.
