The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **SOR/2008-170, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The referenced regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2008-170* (SOR/2008-170), specifically **section 1** of that instrument.
- **Meaning of Repeal**: This means that the regulation in question no longer exists in force and is no longer applicable or enforceable under current law. It has been formally removed from the legal framework.
- **Context**: SOR/2008-170 is a statutory instrument issued in Canada (typically under the authority of a federal or provincial government) to amend or repeal existing regulations. The repeal of a regulation typically occurs when the law is outdated, redundant, or superseded by new legislation.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer valid. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to current, active regulations that have not been repealed.

### Important Notes:
- There is **no content** of the original regulation provided in your query — only the notice of its repeal.
- Therefore, a detailed summary of the *substance* of the regulation (e.g., its purpose, scope, provisions) **cannot be provided**, as the regulation itself has been removed from the legal record.
- The only factual information available is that the regulation was **repealed in 2008** under SOR/2008-170, section 1.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does not contain the actual regulation; it only indicates that a regulation has been **officially repealed**. As such, the summary is limited to the procedural and legal significance of the repeal. To understand the original content of the regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation prior to its repeal — which is no longer accessible or in force.

If you have access to the original regulation or can provide the full text or title (e.g., "Regulation respecting X"), I can assist in summarizing its content.
