Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, legal basis, key provisions, implications, and procedural background.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Critical Habitat of the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific Southern Resident Population Order**

---

#### **1. Legal Framework and Applicable Act**
The regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **Part 2 of Schedule 1**, which designates certain wildlife species as "endangered" and mandates the protection of their **critical habitat**.

- **Relevant Provisions of SARA**:
  - **Section 58(1)**: Applies to the critical habitat of listed species.
  - **Section 58(4)** and **(5)**: Authorize the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and implement critical habitat orders.
  - **Section 58(8)**: Requires consultation with wildlife management boards when the proposed critical habitat affects areas governed by land claims agreements.

---

#### **2. Species at Risk**
- **Species**: *Orcinus orca* – the **Killer Whale (Northeast Pacific Southern Resident Population)**.
- **Status**: Listed as **Endangered** under SARA (Part 2 of Schedule 1).
- **Geographic Range**: The Southern Resident population is found in the **northeastern Pacific Ocean**, primarily in **British Columbia, Canada**, with key areas including the **Salish Sea** (e.g., Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, Strait of Juan de Fuca).

---

#### **3. Background and Justification for the Order**

The regulation is based on the following factual and procedural elements:

- **Recovery Strategy**: The Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans jointly developed and finalized a **recovery strategy** for the Southern Resident Killer Whale population.
- **Critical Habitat Identification**: This strategy identified specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — areas where the whales rely on food, breeding, and social interactions.
- **Public Registry**: The identified critical habitat has been formally included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the information.
- **No Conflict with Subsection 58(2)b**: The critical habitat specified in this Order does **not** fall within any area referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, which would otherwise trigger restrictions on the use of land for certain purposes (e.g., development or resource extraction) without additional assessment.

> This is a key point: the Order avoids triggering the more restrictive provisions of SARA related to land use and development, thereby simplifying regulatory implementation.

---

#### **4. Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards**

- The Ministers recognize that **some portions of the designated critical habitat** may lie within areas governed by **land claims agreements**.
- These agreements typically involve Indigenous communities who have **autonomy over wildlife management**.
- Therefore, under **section 58(8)** of SARA, the Ministers **consulted** with the relevant **wildlife management boards** before issuing the Order.
- This consultation ensures that Indigenous rights, traditional knowledge, and stewardship responsibilities are respected and integrated into the decision-making process.

---

#### **5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The Order **designates specific geographic areas** as **critical habitat** for the Southern Resident Killer Whale population.
- **Critical habitat** is defined under SARA as the **specific areas** required by a species for:
  - Survival
  - Reproduction
  - Feeding
  - Breeding
  - Movement
- These areas are legally protected under SARA, meaning:
  - **No actions** that destroy or degrade the habitat can be carried out without a permit.
  - **Development, resource extraction, or other activities** that may impact the habitat are subject to review and mitigation.
- The designation aims to **support the recovery** of the population, which has faced significant threats including:
  - Declining salmon populations (primary food source)
  - Noise pollution
  - Ship traffic
  - Habitat degradation

---

#### **6. Procedural and Legal Context**

- **Repeal of Prior Order**:  
  The **Critical Habitats of the Northeast Pacific Northern and Southern Resident Populations of the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Order (SOR/2009-68)** is **repealed**.
  - This indicates that the previous designation was outdated or no longer scientifically valid or legally aligned with current recovery science and data.

- **New Order**:  
  The current Order replaces the old one with a **more accurate, up-to-date, and scientifically grounded** designation based on the most recent recovery strategy.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (as per the regulation), which typically occurs shortly after publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

- **Legal Citation**:  
  - **S.C. 2002, c. 29**: Original enactment of SARA  
  - **S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60**: Amended provision to support critical habitat designations  
  - **SOR/2009-68**: Repealed prior order  

---

#### **7. Key Outcomes and Implications**

| Outcome | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Legal Protection of Habitat** | Critical habitat areas are now legally protected under SARA, preventing harmful activities without proper authorization. |
| **Support for Recovery** | Enables targeted conservation efforts (e.g., salmon restoration, noise reduction, marine protected areas). |
| **Indigenous Engagement** | Consultation with wildlife management boards strengthens co-management and respects Indigenous rights and responsibilities. |
| **Scientific Rigor** | Based on the latest recovery strategy and public registry, ensuring the designation is current and evidence-based. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Avoids conflicts with land claims agreements and does not trigger restrictive provisions under section 58(2)b. |

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Ministers of the Environment and Fisheries and Oceans** are responsible for enforcing the Order.
- Any proposed activity that may affect the critical habitat must:
  - Be assessed for impact
  - Receive approval from the relevant federal authority
  - Include mitigation measures if necessary
- Violations may result in penalties under SARA.

---

#### **9. Broader Conservation Context**

This Order is part of a broader national effort to:
- Restore the Southern Resident population, which has declined from around 150 individuals in the 1990s to fewer than 100 today.
- Address the root causes of decline, particularly the loss of salmon habitat and the cumulative effects of human activity in marine environments.
- Promote **ecosystem-based management** that considers the interdependence of species, habitat, and human activities.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the **critical habitat** of the **Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific Southern Resident Population** under the *Species at Risk Act*, based on the most recent recovery strategy and after full consultation with Indigenous wildlife management boards. It replaces a prior, outdated designation and ensures that legally protected areas are accurately identified and enforced. The Order reflects a commitment to science-based conservation, Indigenous partnership, and the long-term recovery of one of Canada’s most iconic and endangered marine species.
