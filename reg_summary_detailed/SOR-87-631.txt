**Detailed Summary of the Calculation of Interest Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 27, s. 11)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Calculation of Interest Regulations*, made under subsection 64.1(3) of the *Indian Act*, provide a clear and standardized method for calculating interest in specific circumstances related to the reinstatement of individuals who were previously removed from Band Lists under the *Indian Act*. These regulations came into effect on **November 1, 1987**, and are designed to ensure fairness, consistency, and transparency in determining interest owed to individuals who apply for reinstatement following removal.

These regulations are particularly relevant to cases involving **reinstatement of status**—a process by which individuals who were removed from a Band List due to non-compliance with membership criteria may regain their status. The regulations define how interest is calculated on the principal amount outstanding, when it begins to accrue, and how it is applied in relation to repayments or withholdings.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Indian Act*, the foundational legislation governing Indigenous status, band membership, and related rights in Canada.

2. **Principal Amount Outstanding**  
   This is the base amount used to calculate interest. It is defined as:
   - The amount received by a person under **paragraph 15(1)(a)** of the *Indian Act* **as it read immediately prior to April 17, 1985**, or under any previous provision of the Act dealing with the same subject matter,
   - **Less** $1,000,
   - **Less** any amounts withheld under **subsection 64.1(1)** of the Act,
   - **Less** any amounts repaid under **subsection 64.1(2)** of the Act.

   > *Purpose:* This definition ensures that only the net amount of financial support received (after deductions) is subject to interest, and excludes a fixed $1,000 threshold and any repayments or withholdings.

3. **Reinstatement**  
   Defined as the formal process of entering a person’s name back onto a Band List, which can occur under:
   - Subsections 64.1(1) or (2) of the *Indian Act*, or
   - Membership rules established under **section 10** of the *Indian Act*.

### **Interest Calculation Rules**

Interest is calculated under the following conditions for persons applying for reinstatement:

#### 1. **On What Basis?**
- Interest is calculated **only on the principal amount outstanding**.
- It does **not apply to any other financial elements** such as administrative fees or penalties.

#### 2. **Frequency of Calculation**
- Interest is calculated **quarterly**.
- The rate is based on the **average month-end balance** of the principal amount outstanding over the quarter.

#### 3. **Interest Rate**
- The rate is equal to the **quarterly average** of the interest rates applied by the **Bank of Canada** to **six-month Treasury bills**.
- This ensures that the interest rate is tied to market conditions and reflects current monetary policy.
- The rate is updated periodically based on the Bank of Canada’s published rates.

#### 4. **Start Date of Accrual**
The start date for interest depends on the type of reinstatement:

##### a) **For reinstatement under subsections 64.1(1) or (2) of the Act**  
Interest begins on the **later of**:
- **November 1, 1987** (the effective date of the regulations), or  
- The **date of signature** on the application for reinstatement.

> *Rationale:* This ensures that interest does not begin before the regulations took effect and that it aligns with the timing of the individual’s application.

##### b) **If there is a gap between signing and submission of the application**  
If the date of signing the application is more than **30 days** before it is received by the Registrar:
- Interest begins from the **date the application is actually received** by the Registrar.

> *Purpose:* Prevents unfair advantage or delay in interest accrual due to administrative processing delays.

##### c) **For reinstatement under Band Membership Rules (under section 10 of the Act)**  
Interest begins on the **later of**:
- **November 1, 1987**, or  
- The **date of reinstatement** (i.e., when the person is officially re-admitted to the Band List).

> *Note:* This provision allows flexibility for Bands that have their own rules for reinstatement, which may differ from federal provisions.

### **Application of Withheld or Repaid Amounts**

When an individual:
- Has an amount **withheld** under subsection 64.1(1), or  
- Has an amount **repaid** under subsection 64.1(2),

the amount must be applied in the following order:

1. **First**, against the **principal amount outstanding**.  
2. **Second**, against **accrued interest**.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that the principal is not reduced by interest payments before the principal itself is fully addressed.

---

### **Effective Date of Application**

For the purposes of **section 6** (which governs the timing of when an amount is considered applied), the effective date is defined as:

- **For amounts withheld under subsection 64.1(1):**  
  The date the person **would have been entitled to receive** the amount **but for** the withholding.

- **For amounts repaid under subsection 64.1(2):**  
  The date the amount was **actually received by the band**.

> *Purpose:* Provides clarity on when financial obligations are considered fulfilled, which is important for accounting and legal purposes.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Fairness and Transparency**  
   The regulations establish a transparent, objective, and market-linked method for calculating interest, reducing arbitrary or inconsistent decisions by officials.

2. **Market-Based Interest Rates**  
   Using Bank of Canada Treasury bill rates ensures that interest is not fixed or arbitrary but reflects real economic conditions.

3. **Protection of Individuals’ Rights**  
   By clearly defining when interest begins and how it is applied, the regulations protect individuals from being denied compensation for delays in reinstatement.

4. **Administrative Clarity**  
   The rules provide clear guidance to bands, registrars, and applicants on:
   - When interest starts,
   - How it is calculated,
   - What amounts are subject to it,
   - How repayments or withholdings are prioritized.

5. **Historical Context**  
   These regulations were introduced in response to concerns about financial injustice faced by individuals who were removed from Band Lists and later reinstated. The $1,000 deduction and the use of specific thresholds reflect the historical financial structure of the *Indian Act* at the time.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The regulations apply **only to reinstatements** under subsections 64.1(1) and (2) of the *Indian Act* or under Band membership rules.
- They do **not apply to other types of financial claims** or status changes.
- The use of **six-month Treasury bill rates** may result in fluctuating interest over time, depending on monetary policy.
- The 30-day gap rule ensures that administrative delays do not unfairly benefit applicants.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Calculation of Interest Regulations* represent a significant step toward equitable treatment of individuals who have been removed from Band Lists and later reinstated. By introducing a clear, transparent, and market-based system for calculating interest, the regulations:

- Ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for delays in reinstatement,
- Provide consistency and accountability in financial administration,
- Align with broader principles of justice and financial integrity in Indigenous governance.

These regulations remain a key component of the *Indian Act*’s framework for managing financial obligations and status changes, and they continue to serve as a reference for bands and government agencies administering reinstatement processes.
