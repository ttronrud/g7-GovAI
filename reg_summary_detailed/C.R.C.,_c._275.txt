**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Hog Farm Registration (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Saskatchewan Hog Farm Registration (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a specific set of rules governing the registration and marketing of hogs in Saskatchewan, particularly for interprovincial and export trade.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972 of Saskatchewan* (Loi). This foundational legislation establishes the legal framework under which the hog marketing system operates, including the authority of the Commission to regulate marketing.

- **Commission**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission*, established under the Act and the Hog Marketing Plan. The Commission is responsible for administering the registration system, overseeing compliance, and ensuring fair and transparent marketing practices.

- **Hog**: Defined as any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (commonly known as the domestic pig) that is produced in the Province of Saskatchewan. This definition ensures that only pigs raised within Saskatchewan are subject to these regulations.

- **Plan**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and amended periodically under the authority of the Act. The Plan outlines the structure, objectives, and operational guidelines for hog marketing, including pricing, distribution, and registration procedures.

- **Producer**: A broad and inclusive definition of who qualifies as a producer:
  - Any person engaged in **producing or feeding hogs** and making them available for slaughter.
  - The **employer** of such a person.
  - Any person who, under a **lease or agreement**, is entitled to a **share of the hogs** produced or fed by a producer.
  - Any person who **takes possession of hogs** from a producer under a **security arrangement for a debt** (e.g., a lender or creditor).

This definition ensures that all individuals with a direct or indirect interest in hog production or ownership are included in the regulatory framework.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **marketing of hogs** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada).
- Persons and property **situated within the Province of Saskatchewan**.

This means:
- The rules do **not apply** to local or intraprovincial sales (e.g., selling hogs within the same province for direct consumption or local markets).
- The regulations are specifically designed to manage the movement and sale of hogs beyond Saskatchewan, ensuring traceability, accountability, and compliance with marketing standards.

---

### **4. Mandatory Registration Requirement**

A **key requirement** under these regulations is:

> **No producer may market hogs unless they have been allocated a farm unit registration number by the Commission.**

This means:
- All producers involved in selling hogs **outside Saskatchewan** (interprovincial or export) must be formally registered.
- The registration number serves as a unique identifier for each farm unit, enabling tracking of origin, ownership, and compliance with marketing standards.

---

### **5. Application Process for Registration**

Producers must apply for a farm unit registration number **at the time of marketing their first shipment of hogs** through the Commission.

Key points:
- Registration is **not required prior to first shipment**—it must be applied for **when the first shipment is made**.
- The process is tied directly to the **first marketing activity** involving interprovincial or export sales.
- The Commission is responsible for processing the application and issuing the registration number.

This provision ensures that only producers who are actively participating in regulated markets are formally included in the system, promoting transparency and accountability.

### **6. Purpose and Implications**

The regulation serves several important functions:
- **Traceability**: By assigning unique farm unit numbers, the Commission can track the origin of hogs in the supply chain, which is critical for food safety, disease control, and market integrity.
- **Market Integrity**: Prevents unregulated or untraceable sales of hogs in interprovincial and export markets.
- **Compliance and Accountability**: Ensures that all producers are formally registered and accountable to the Commission.
- **Fair Competition**: Provides a level playing field by requiring all producers to follow the same registration and reporting standards.
