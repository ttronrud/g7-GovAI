**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Liquor Board Employees’ Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview**

The *Saskatchewan Liquor Board Employees’ Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **subsection 23(2)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This Order provides for the **remission (forgiveness)** of certain income tax, interest, and penalties that would have been owed by specific employees of the Saskatchewan Liquor Board due to the inclusion of **strike pay** in their taxable income during a specific labor dispute.

The Order is made in the public interest and reflects a recognition of the unique circumstances surrounding the 1979 strike, particularly the financial hardship faced by employees who received strike pay but were later assessed for income tax on that payment.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Income Tax Act* (in French: *Loi*). All tax-related provisions referenced in the Order are derived from this Act.

2. **Strike Pay**  
   Specifically defined as the strike pay received by employees in connection with the **strike against the Saskatchewan Liquor Board** that:
   - Began on **November 26, 1979**
   - Ended on **December 17, 1979**  
   This is a narrow, time-bound definition, limiting the scope of the remission to only the strike pay from this specific event.

3. **Taxpayer**  
   A person who meets **all of the following criteria**:
   - Was a member of the **Liquor Board Branch of the Saskatchewan Government Employees’ Union**;
   - Had income for the purposes of an assessment under the *Income Tax Act* that included an amount of strike pay received in **1979**;
   - Did **not object** to the tax assessment that included the strike pay (i.e., did not formally challenge or dispute the assessment).

> *Note*: The requirement that the taxpayer "did not object" to the assessment is significant—it excludes individuals who actively contested the inclusion of strike pay in their taxable income, thereby ensuring the remission applies only to those who accepted the initial tax assessment.

### **Core Provision: Remission of Taxes**

The Order grants a **full remission** (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of:
- Income tax
- Interest
- Penalties

that would have been payable under:
- **Part I** of the *Income Tax Act* (general income tax provisions)
- **Part I.1** of the *Income Tax Act* (provisions related to specific types of income or assessments)

**BUT ONLY IF**:
- The taxpayer’s income for the assessment year (1979) included strike pay as defined above.

In other words, **if the strike pay had not been included in the taxpayer’s taxable income**, the tax liability would not have arisen. Therefore, the remission is retroactive in effect—removing the tax burden that would have been imposed due to the inclusion of strike pay in taxable income.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order is grounded in the principle that **strike pay is not ordinary income** and should not be treated as such for tax purposes, especially when:
- It is compensation for a work stoppage due to industrial action;
- It is typically provided to employees as a form of support during a strike;
- The inclusion of such payments in taxable income may have been unjust or disproportionately burdensome.

By remitting the taxes, the government acknowledges that:
- The employees were not receiving income from employment during the strike;
- The strike pay was a form of compensation, not a regular wage or business income;
- The financial hardship experienced by employees during the strike warranted a public interest intervention.

---

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Limited Time Frame**: Applies only to strike pay received during the strike from **November 26 to December 17, 1979**.
- **Limited Group**: Applies only to employees of the **Liquor Board Branch** of the Saskatchewan Government Employees’ Union.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Taxpayers who objected to the assessment (i.e., challenged the inclusion of strike pay in their income) are **not eligible**.
  - Employees from other unions or other government departments are **not covered**.
- **No Extension**: The Order does not extend to future strikes or other forms of compensation.

---

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

- This Order is a **practical application of equitable treatment** in tax law, recognizing that certain types of income (like strike pay) may not be economically or morally equivalent to regular employment income.
- It reflects a **governmental acknowledgment** of the socio-economic impact of industrial action on public sector employees.
- It demonstrates how the *Financial Administration Act* can be used to correct tax assessments in exceptional circumstances when fairness and public interest are paramount.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Saskatchewan Liquor Board Employees’ Remission Order* is a targeted, historically grounded tax relief measure designed to:
- Remove unjust tax liabilities imposed on employees of the Saskatchewan Liquor Board who received strike pay during a specific 1979 strike;
- Recognize that strike pay should not be treated as taxable income in the same way as regular wages;
- Ensure fairness and equity in the tax treatment of public sector employees during labor disputes.

It serves as both a **corrective measure** and a **symbol of public interest**, balancing fiscal responsibility with social equity in the administration of income tax.

**Note**: This Order is no longer in force or applicable in modern times, as it addresses a historical event (1979) and applies only to a specific group of employees under a specific set of circumstances. It is preserved in legal records as a precedent for future tax remission decisions in similar public sector labor disputes.
