**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Canada Wildlife Act**, specifically **subsection 4(1)**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to assign public lands for wildlife research, conservation, or interpretation.

The regulation establishes that certain designated public lands in the Province of Ontario are being **transferred in administrative responsibility** from provincial jurisdiction to the **federal Minister of the Environment**.

This transfer is made **not because of a change in ownership**, but because the Governor in Council has determined that these lands are **required for wildlife research, conservation, or interpretation** — objectives that fall under federal jurisdiction under the Canada Wildlife Act.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### **A. Transfer of Administrative Authority**
The federal government, through the Minister of the Environment, is **assigned administrative, management, and control** over the following public lands:

- The **Long Point National Wildlife Area** (Ontario)
- The **Prince Edward Point National Wildlife Area** (Ontario)

This authority replaces the previous administrative control of two specific parcels of land in Ontario that were previously managed under provincial orders in council:

1. **Item 3.1 of Part IV of Schedule to Order in Council P.C. 1978-3459** (November 16, 1978)
2. **Item 8 of Part IV of Schedule to Order in Council P.C. 1978-3532** (November 23, 1978)

> ⚠️ *Note: These earlier provincial orders are not published in the Canada Gazette Part II*, which means they may not have been formally notified or made publicly accessible, thereby making this federal regulation the authoritative and current designation.

### **4. Legal and Administrative Implications**

- **Federal Oversight**:  
  The Minister of the Environment now has **exclusive responsibility** for:
  - Administration
  - Management
  - Control
  of these lands in accordance with the **Canada Wildlife Act**, particularly **subsection 4(2)**, which allows federal management of lands designated for wildlife purposes.

- **Provincial Jurisdiction Removed**:  
  The previous provincial orders (P.C. 1978-3459 and P.C. 1978-3532) are **superseded** by this federal assignment. Provincial authorities no longer manage these specific parcels for wildlife purposes.

- **Consistency with National Wildlife Area Status**:  
  These lands are now formally recognized as **National Wildlife Areas (NWAs)** under federal law. This status provides stronger protection, consistent management standards, and access to federal funding and policy frameworks for conservation.

- **Public Access and Use**:  
  While the regulation focuses on management and conservation, it implies that public access may be restricted or regulated to protect sensitive habitats, consistent with NWA guidelines.

### **6. Environmental and Conservation Significance**

- Both areas are ecologically significant:
  - **Long Point NWA** is a major migratory bird habitat, including nesting grounds for waterfowl, shorebirds, and raptors.
  - **Prince Edward Point NWA** supports important wetlands and provides critical habitat for waterfowl and other species.

- Federal management ensures:
  - Compliance with national environmental standards
  - Long-term conservation planning
  - Protection from incompatible development or land use
  - Integration with broader national wildlife strategy

### **7. Note on Publication**

- The regulation **does not appear in the Canada Gazette Part II**, which is the official publication for federal legislative instruments.  
- This raises a potential issue of **public transparency and legal validity**, as such regulations typically require publication to be enforceable and accessible.
- However, since the land transfers are based on prior provincial orders (which were also not published), and the federal government is acting under statutory authority, the regulation may still be valid *in practice*, though its **formal notice and public access** may be deficient.

> 🔍 *Recommendation*: For full legal enforceability, future similar instruments should be published in the Canada Gazette Part II to ensure transparency and compliance with constitutional and administrative law principles.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally assigns federal management of two key wildlife areas in Ontario — **Long Point** and **Prince Edward Point** — to the **Minister of the Environment** under the **Canada Wildlife Act**. It reflects a federal commitment to the conservation and scientific study of wildlife habitats, ensuring that these ecologically sensitive lands are managed with consistent, science-based, and protected standards. While the lack of publication in the Canada Gazette Part II may raise procedural concerns, the regulation serves a clear and important conservation purpose.
