### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Order with Respect to the Withdrawal of Lands from Disposal in the Yukon Territory – In Connection with Native Land Claims Settlement

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the federal government to withdraw certain lands from disposal for specific purposes, including facilitating the settlement of Indigenous land claims.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withhold specific parcels of land in the Yukon Territory from disposal** (i.e., from being sold, leased, or otherwise transferred to private parties) in order to **facilitate the resolution of native land claims**. This action supports the process of Indigenous land rights recognition and settlement under federal policy and legal frameworks.

The withdrawal is temporary and expires on **December 31, 1993**, after which the lands may be subject to normal disposal procedures unless otherwise extended or modified.

---

### **Scope of Lands Withdrawn**

The following types of land and resources are specifically withdrawn from disposal:

1. **Surface Lands**  
   - All parcels described in the **Schedule** attached to the order.
   - These lands are categorized as:
     - "RURAL LANDS"
     - "AREAS FOR SITE SPECIFIC SELECTIONS"
   - These designations are based on maps held at the **Federal Claims Office**, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, in Whitehorse, Yukon.

2. **Maps Referenced**  
   - The withdrawal applies to areas shown on the following maps:
     - *Territorial Resource Base Maps*
     - *Gwich’in* (specific regional designation)
   - Copies of these maps are officially deposited with:
     - The **Supervisor of Lands**, Yukon Regional Office (Whitehorse)
     - The **Mining Recorder’s Office** in Whitehorse, Watson Lake, Mayo, and Dawson

3. **Underlying Resources Withdrawn**  
   The withdrawal extends not only to surface land but also includes:
   - **All mines and minerals**, including:
     - Solid, liquid, and gaseous minerals
     - Sand and gravel (even though these are typically subject to quarrying regulations)
   - **Forest resources** (e.g., timber), which would normally be subject to disposal under the *Yukon Timber Regulations*

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** This withdrawal does **not** affect:
> - Existing mineral claims in good standing under:
>   - *Yukon Quartz Mining Act*
>   - *Yukon Placer Mining Act*
> - Existing **oil and gas rights, interests, and privileges** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*
> - **Surface rights** in good standing granted under **Section 8 of the Territorial Lands Act**

This means that current holders of valid claims or rights retain their legal entitlements and are not displaced by this withdrawal.

### **Savings, Exceptions, and Reservations**

The regulation explicitly **exempts** certain tracts from the withdrawal:

- Any tract of territorial land that is:
  - Subject to a **lease** or
  - An **agreement for sale**
  - Made **pursuant to the Territorial Lands Act or Territorial Lands Regulations**

These lands remain available for disposal or use as per existing agreements and are not included in the temporary withdrawal.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Indigenous Land Claims Context**  
   This order is part of a broader federal effort to resolve land claims by Indigenous peoples, particularly in the Yukon, where the Gwich’in and other First Nations have long-standing interests in traditional territories.

2. **Temporary Nature**  
   The withdrawal is **not permanent**. It expires on **December 31, 1993**, and does not preclude future disposal unless otherwise ordered.

3. **Non-Disruption of Existing Rights**  
   The regulation respects and protects existing legal rights, including:
   - Valid mineral claims
   - Oil and gas rights
   - Surface rights in good standing

4. **Clarity in Resource Management**  
   By clearly identifying which lands and resources are withdrawn, the regulation provides legal certainty for stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, government agencies, and potential investors.

---

### **Administrative Implementation**

- The order is administered through:
  - The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**
  - The **Supervisor of Lands (Yukon)**
  - The **Mining Recorder’s Offices** (Whitehorse, Watson Lake, Mayo, Dawson)

- The maps referenced serve as the **official record** of the lands affected and are publicly accessible through the Federal Claims Office.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation constitutes a **temporary, targeted withdrawal** of specific lands and natural resources in the Yukon Territory from disposal, with the sole purpose of enabling the settlement of Indigenous land claims. It ensures that critical areas—particularly those relevant to traditional use and community development—are preserved for negotiation and resolution. Importantly, it does not undermine existing rights or interests, and it includes clear safeguards and exceptions to protect legal entitlements.

While the order expires in 1993, its significance lies in its role as a foundational step in the federal government’s approach to Indigenous land rights and resource governance in northern Canada.

> **Note:** This regulation is historical in nature and reflects policy practices from the early 1990s. Modern land claims settlements in Canada (e.g., the Gwich’in Final Agreement or other treaties) may have superseded or expanded upon the provisions outlined here.
