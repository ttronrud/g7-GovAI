**Detailed Summary of the Small Craft Harbours Leasing Regulations**

---

**1. Regulation Title and Citation**  
These regulations are formally titled the *Small Craft Harbours Leasing Regulations* and may be cited as such. They establish the framework governing the leasing and licensing of lands, buildings, and other structures that are part of small craft harbour facilities.

---

**2. Definitions**  
- **"Lands, buildings and other structures"**:  
  This term refers to all land, buildings, and other physical assets that constitute part of a small craft harbour facility and are under the control and management of the Minister of the Environment.  
  **Exclusions**: The term explicitly *does not include* wharfs, piers, or breakwaters. This clarifies the scope of what is subject to leasing or licensing under these regulations—focusing on the core operational infrastructure (e.g., office buildings, administrative areas, dockside facilities) rather than the water-facing structural elements.

- **"Minister"**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of the Environment**, who is responsible for overseeing the management and leasing of small craft harbour facilities.

---

**3. Authority to Lease or Grant Licences (Override of General Rules)**  
- Despite the existence of the broader *Public Lands Leasing and Licensing Regulations*, the Minister of the Environment is granted **special authority** to enter into leases or grant licences for the use or occupation of the designated lands, buildings, and structures.  
- This authority is **not limited** in terms of duration or conditions—meaning the Minister may set any term and impose any conditions (e.g., rent, renewal terms, usage restrictions) that they deem "necessary or advisable" for the effective management and operation of the small craft harbour.

> **Key implication**: This provision grants the Minister significant discretion, allowing tailored arrangements that may better serve the specific needs of small craft harbours, which may differ from standard public land use.

---

**4. Requirement for Minister of Finance Approval (Banking Leases)**  
- Any lease or licence intended for the purpose of **banking** (i.e., where the lessee or licensee is using the property to conduct financial or banking activities) **must receive prior written approval** from the **Minister of Finance**.  
- This ensures that financial activities on public land are subject to fiscal oversight and compliance with financial regulations.

> **Purpose**: Prevents misuse of public infrastructure for financial gain without proper oversight and safeguards.

---

**5. Treasury Board Advisory Committee on Land Management Approval (Leases Exceeding 10 Years)**  
- No lease or licence with a term **exceeding 10 years** may be entered into or granted without the **prior approval** of the **Treasury Board Advisory Committee on Land Management (TBACLM)**.  
- This committee evaluates land use proposals based on strategic, economic, and policy considerations, ensuring that long-term land commitments align with broader government land management objectives.

> **Purpose**: Introduces a layer of strategic review for long-term leases, preventing indefinite or unreviewed commitments to private parties.

---

**6. Treasury Board Approval for Leases Exceeding 20 Years**  
- No lease or licence—**including renewals**—may have a term or series of terms that **exceed 20 years** without the **prior approval of the Treasury Board**.  
- This provision applies to both initial leases and extensions, reinforcing a cap on long-term commitments to prevent excessive public land transfers.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that no single entity holds public harbour assets for more than 20 years without high-level governmental oversight, promoting accountability and preventing long-term monopolization.

---

**7. Payment of Rental or Consideration**  
- All rental payments or other financial consideration (e.g., fees, charges) arising from any lease or licence granted under these regulations must be **paid or made payable to the Receiver General**.  
- The Receiver General is the official government body responsible for collecting and managing public revenue.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that all financial proceeds from the use of public harbour assets are properly accounted for and go into the public treasury, maintaining fiscal transparency and accountability.
