### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Portions of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada Regulations**

#### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **subsection 123(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**.
- This provision allows the federal government to transfer certain portions of public administration to other departments or units, typically to improve efficiency, streamline operations, or realign organizational responsibilities.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- The regulation formally **transfers specific portions of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)** to other parts of the federal public service.
- The transfer is not a reorganization of the entire organization, but rather a **reassignment of specific units and functions** within FINTRAC.

#### **3. Units Affected by the Transfer**
The following two units within FINTRAC are specifically designated as being transferred:
- **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**
- **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

These units are responsible for managing:
- Email infrastructure and services
- Data centre operations (including hardware, software, and system maintenance)
- Network services (including internal and external connectivity, security, and performance)

The transfer implies that these technical and operational functions are being moved from the original structure of FINTRAC to another federal department or unit, likely to allow better integration with broader public service IT services or to align with broader government digital transformation goals.

#### **4. Applicability of Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**
- **Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act** applies to all individuals:
  - Currently employed
  - Engaged in work
  - Working within the transferred units
- This means that the employment conditions, terms, rights, and obligations of staff in these units are governed by the PSEA.
- The transfer does **not** alter the employment status or rights of the staff; it only changes the administrative and operational context of their work.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on November 15, 2011**.
- This date marks the official start of the transfer and the application of the new administrative structure and employment provisions.

#### **6. Key Implications**
- **Operational Shift**: The technical and support functions previously managed by FINTRAC are now under the responsibility of a different unit or department, which may have broader IT or public service infrastructure responsibilities.
- **Employment Continuity**: Staff in the transferred units retain their employment rights, benefits, and job protections under the Public Service Employment Act.
- **Efficiency and Integration**: The move likely aims to improve efficiency by consolidating IT services, reducing duplication, and enabling better coordination with other federal departments’ IT systems.
- **Compliance and Accountability**: The transfer ensures that all personnel involved remain subject to public service employment standards, including fair treatment, grievance procedures, and performance management.

#### **7. Legal and Administrative Context**
- The regulation is part of a broader trend in the Canadian federal government to **modernize and streamline public service operations** through the rationalization of IT and administrative functions.
- The transfer reflects a strategic shift in how financial intelligence and regulatory bodies manage their internal infrastructure, separating operational IT support from core regulatory functions.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally transfers the **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit** and the **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit** from FINTRAC to another federal public service entity. It is issued under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act and comes into effect on **November 15, 2011**. The transfer is designed to enhance operational efficiency and integration, while ensuring that all employees involved continue to be protected under public service employment standards.
