### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation designates specific provisions, requirements, and conditions under the *Canada Transportation Act* (the "Act") as being subject to enforcement under **subsection 177(1)** of the Act.  

Subsection 177(1) empowers the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) to impose penalties (fines) for contraventions of its rules and regulations.

### **2. Key Definitions and References**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Canada Transportation Act*, which establishes the legal framework for transportation services in Canada and governs the regulation and oversight of transportation sectors (e.g., rail, air, road, and marine).
- The **"Designated Provisions"** are those listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** to these regulations.
- These designated provisions are formally recognized as enforceable under **subsection 177(1)** of the Act, meaning that violations of these provisions can lead to financial penalties.

### **3. Financial Penalties (Fines) for Contraventions**

The regulation establishes maximum monetary penalties for violations of the designated provisions, depending on the type of party involved:

| Party Type | Maximum Fine Amount |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Corporation** | Amount specified in **Column 2** of the Schedule |
| **Individual** | Amount specified in **Column 3** of the Schedule |

- The fines are **maximum amounts**—that is, they represent the upper limit of penalties that may be imposed in a given case.
- The actual penalty may be less, depending on the nature, severity, and circumstances of the contravention.
- The distinction between corporate and individual penalties reflects the different legal and financial responsibilities of entities and individuals under Canadian regulatory frameworks.

---

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- **Clarity in Enforcement:** Provides clear guidance on which rules are subject to financial penalties.
- **Accountability:** Reinforces accountability among transportation operators by establishing measurable consequences for non-compliance.
