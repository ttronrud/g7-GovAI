The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules Order 2017-84** (SOR/2017-84).

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Rules Order 2017-84* (SOR/2017-84)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of the original regulation
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the coming into force of SOR/2017-84, which was published in the Canada Gazette and came into force on **April 1, 2017** (as per typical publication and implementation timelines for such orders).

### What This Means:

- The regulation previously referenced in the text (which is not fully provided) was **no longer in force** as of April 1, 2017.
- It was formally removed from the legal framework by the government through the SOR/2017-84 order.
- The repeal likely occurred because:
  - The regulation was outdated or redundant.
  - It was superseded by a newer, more comprehensive, or more appropriate rule.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with current legislation or policy objectives.
  - It was no longer necessary for regulatory enforcement.

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is not fully provided, the summary is based solely on the metadata (repeal notice).
- Without the full text of the original regulation, it is not possible to summarize its content, purpose, or scope (e.g., whether it related to environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or another area).
- The repeated listing of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggests that this repeal notice may have been applied to multiple sections or regulations, but in this case, only Section 1 is cited.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question has been **officially repealed** as of April 1, 2017, under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. It is no longer part of the current legal framework. Any reference to it in legal or administrative contexts must be treated as obsolete unless otherwise specified.
