### 📚 **2. Definitions and Key Concepts**

The regulations provide a comprehensive and precise set of definitions that form the foundation for interpreting all provisions. Below are the most critical definitions, explained for clarity:

| Term | Meaning & Context |
|------|-------------------|
| **Food** | As defined in the Food and Drugs Act — any substance intended for human consumption. |
| **Meat Product** | Includes carcasses, blood, or by-products of food animals (beef, poultry, etc.). *Excludes* gelatin, bone meal, collagen, hydrolyzed proteins, and minor meat content. |
| **Dairy Product** | Milk or milk-derived food with no added oils or fats beyond milk fat. |
| **Egg** | Domestic chicken (*Gallus domesticus*) or turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo*) eggs. *Excludes* balut (a type of fermented egg). |
| **Processed Egg Product** | Eggs that have undergone processing (e.g., egg whites, yolks, powder) — governed by standards in Volume 2 of the *Standards of Identity Document*. |
| **Fish** | Includes shellfish, crustaceans, marine animals, and their parts/products. |
| **Shellfish** | Bivalves (clams, oysters) or carnivorous molluscs (snails), and derived products. |
| **Maple Product** | Concentrated sap from *Acer* trees or maple syrup — strictly defined. |
| **Organic Product** | Certified under Canadian organic standards (subsection 345(1)) or by a foreign entity accredited under international rules. |
| **Food Animal** | Birds or mammals (non-marine) from which edible meat can be derived. |
| **Game Animal** | Wild ruminants, pigs, or birds hunted commercially under government authorization. |
| **Sanitary Condition** | A state where food is not at risk of contamination — essential for safe handling. |
| **Contaminated Food** | Food containing harmful microorganisms, chemicals, or extraneous materials that pose a health risk. |
| **Commercially Sterile** | As defined in Food and Drug Regulations (B.27.001): food preserved so that it will not support microbial growth under normal storage conditions. |
| **Hermetically Sealed Package** | A package designed to prevent microbial entry, including spores. |
| **Prepackaged Food** | Packaged in the way it is normally sold to consumers — includes both commercial and consumer prepackaged. |
| **Consumer Prepackaged Food** | Packaged for individual use, not for resale or commercial purposes. |
| **Principal Display Panel (PDP)** | The most visible part of the label where key information (name, ingredients, allergens) must appear. |
| **Principal Display Surface (PDS)** | The surface of the container most visible during sale or use. If none exists, 40% of the container surface (excluding top/bottom) is used. |
| **Close Proximity** | Immediately adjacent to a label item with no intervening text or graphics. Required for allergen or ingredient disclosures. |
| **Processed Fruit or Vegetable Product** | Foods that are cooked, frozen, concentrated, pickled, or preserved — must meet standards in Volume 4 of the *Standards of Identity Document* or have a grade in the *Compendium*. |
| **Ready-to-Eat Meat Product** | Meat treated to inactivate pathogenic bacteria (vegetative forms and toxins) and control spores — safe to eat without further cooking (only requires washing, thawing, or warming). |
| **Refrigerated Food** | Stored at or below 4°C, not frozen. |
| **Tray / Egg Carton** | Packaging for up to 30 eggs in separate compartments. A tray is non-carton packaging. |
| **Ornamental Container** | Decorative container (e.g., ceramic vase) that also holds food — label must appear on bottom or tag. |
| **Compendium** | *Canadian Grade Compendium* — sets standards for grades of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other foods. |
| **Standards of Identity Document** | Defines acceptable names, compositions, and standards for foods (e.g., "whole milk," "chicken breast"). |
| **Food Compositional Standards Document** | Defines nutrient content, composition, and labeling for processed foods. |

> ⚠️ **Hierarchy of Standards**:  
> The *Compendium* **prevails over** the *Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Grades Document* when there is a conflict or inconsistency.
