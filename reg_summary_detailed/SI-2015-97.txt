---

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Legal Authority**
- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207).
- This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign certain powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers, typically to align government responsibilities with evolving policy priorities or organizational structures.

#### 2. **Subject of Transfer**
- The powers, duties, and functions related to the **Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act** (commonly referred to as the *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act*, or B2ST Act) are being transferred.
- The *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act* was enacted to support the development of infrastructure and transportation corridors that enhance cross-border trade, particularly between Canada and the United States. It often includes provisions related to bridge construction, maintenance, funding, and coordination of trade-related infrastructure projects.

#### 3. **Transfer of Responsibility**
- **From**: The **Minister of Transport**  
  (Previously responsible for overseeing transportation policy, including infrastructure projects related to trade corridors.)
- **To**: The **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**  
  (A portfolio that typically includes broader infrastructure development, community services, and intergovernmental coordination, making it a more strategic fit for trade-related infrastructure initiatives.)

#### 4. **Effective Date**
- The transfer takes effect on **November 4, 2015**.
- From that date, the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs assumes all responsibilities, authority, and functions previously assigned to the Minister of Transport under the *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act*.

#### 5. **Legal Basis and Citation**
- The regulation is cited under:
  - **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** – The enabling provision of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
  - **R.S., c. P-34** – The *Public Service Act*, which provides the foundational framework for public service governance and ministerial responsibilities.
  - **S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 179** – A relevant section of the *Statutes of Canada*, which may provide additional context or support for ministerial reorganization or functional reallocation.

#### 6. **Purpose and Rationale**
- The transfer reflects a strategic shift in government policy to centralize trade infrastructure planning under a ministry with broader jurisdiction over infrastructure development and intergovernmental relations.
- It ensures that trade-related bridge projects receive coordinated support from a ministry that can engage with regional communities, provincial governments, and other stakeholders.
- This reallocation supports the long-term goal of strengthening Canada’s trade connectivity, particularly in key border regions.

#### 7. **Implications**
- The Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs now leads policy, funding, and oversight of bridge projects under the *Bridge to Strengthen Trade Act*.
- The Minister of Transport no longer has direct responsibility for these functions, although transport-related aspects may still be addressed within broader transportation policy.
- This change may improve interdepartmental coordination and align infrastructure planning with broader economic and community development goals.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a formal and legally grounded reorganization of ministerial responsibilities within the federal government. By transferring the powers and functions related to trade bridge initiatives from the Minister of Transport to the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, the government aims to enhance the effectiveness and coherence of trade infrastructure policy. The transfer is effective as of **November 4, 2015**, and is supported by statutory authority under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This move underscores a broader trend of aligning government structures with evolving economic and infrastructure priorities.
