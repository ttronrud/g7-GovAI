Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the **CUSMA Rules of Origin Regulations**, as referenced in your query. This summary provides clear, structured interpretation of the definitions, key principles, and regulatory framework established under these rules — which are critical for determining whether a product qualifies as "originating" under the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the CUSMA Rules of Origin Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Authority**
The CUSMA Rules of Origin Regulations were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to:
- **Subsection 16(2)a** and **(4)b of the Customs Tariff**.

These provisions empower the government to establish rules that determine whether a good qualifies as “originating” under CUSMA — a key factor in determining eligibility for preferential tariff treatment (e.g., zero or reduced tariffs) among Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

> **Statutory References:**
> - S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)
> - S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 186
> - S.C. 1997, c. 36

These regulations form the **legal framework for origin determination** under CUSMA and are aligned with the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** standards, particularly those related to customs valuation and origin rules.

## 🔍 Core Purpose of the Regulations

To define **what constitutes an "originating good" or "originating material"** — meaning goods or materials that are **produced in one of the three CUSMA countries (Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.)** and meet specific criteria that allow them to qualify for **preferential tariff treatment** under CUSMA.

Origin is determined based on:
- The **production process**
- The **location of production**
- The **value content of inputs** (materials and labor)
- The **nature of components** (e.g., incorporated, indirect, recovered)

This ensures that only products manufactured or substantially transformed in a CUSMA country receive preferential treatment, preventing the use of foreign inputs to "hide" origin.

## 📚 Key Definitions (Organized by Category)

### 1. **Fundamental Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agreement (CUSMA)** | The Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement, which establishes trade rules, including origin requirements. |
| **CUSMA Country** | A Party to CUSMA: Canada, Mexico, or the United States. |
| **Customs Value** | The value used to determine duty for importation. It varies by country: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Canada | Value for duty under the *Customs Act*, interpreted as per subsection 2(1) of these Regulations. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Mexico | *Valor en aduana* under the Mexican Tax Law, converted to MXN at the exchange rate specified in subsection 2(1). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• U.S. | Value under U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, converted to USD at the applicable rate. |
| **Days** | Calendar days including Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. |
| **Month** | A calendar month. |

---

### 2. **Production and Materials Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Production** | Includes growing, cultivating, raising, mining, harvesting, fishing, trapping, hunting, capturing, breeding, extracting, manufacturing, processing, assembling, or aquaculture. |
| **Material** | Any good used in the production of another good — including parts or ingredients. |
| **Self-Produced Material** | A material produced by the same producer who manufactures the final good. |
| **Intermediate Material** | A self-produced material designated as such under subsection 8(6). Used in further production but not directly incorporated. |
| **Indirect Material** | Materials used in production, testing, or equipment maintenance but not physically incorporated. Includes: fuel, lubricants, tools, dies, spare parts, catalysts, safety gear, testing supplies. |
| **Direct Material Costs** | Value of materials used in production, excluding indirect materials and packaging. |
| **Direct Labour Costs** | Wages and benefits for employees directly involved in production. |
| **Direct Overhead** | Costs directly tied to production (excluding direct materials and labour). |
| **Net Cost** | Total cost minus excluded costs: sales promotion, marketing, after-sales service, royalties, shipping/packing, and non-allowable interest. |
| **Net Cost Method** | Method used to calculate regional value content of a good based on net cost allocation. |

> ⚠️ **Excluded Costs** (not included in net cost):
> - Sales promotion, marketing, after-sales service
> - Royalties
> - Shipping and packing costs
> - Non-allowable interest costs

> ✅ **Non-Allowable Interest Costs**: Interest on debt exceeding **700 basis points (7%) above** the federal government's benchmark interest rate for comparable maturities in the country where the producer is located.

---

### 3. **Origin and Non-Origin Status**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Originating Good/Material** | A good or material that meets the origin rules and qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under CUSMA. |
| **Non-Originating Good/Material** | A good or material that fails to meet origin rules and does not qualify for preferential treatment. |
| **Non-Originating Material** | A material used in production that is not originating. |

> ⚖️ **Key Principle**: A good must meet one of the following origin rules:
> - Be **produced in a CUSMA country**
> - Contain **at least 50% regional value content** (based on net cost method)
> - Be **fully or partially composed of recovered materials** and meet specific criteria (e.g., remanufactured goods)

---

### 4. **Origin Determination – Key Concepts**
#### 🟩 **Identical Goods & Materials**
- Goods/materials that are:
  - Identical in physical characteristics, quality, and reputation
  - Produced in the same country
  - Produced by the same producer or another producer if no identical goods were made by the original producer

> ✅ These qualify as originating if they meet all three conditions.

#### 🟨 **Similar Goods & Materials**
- Goods/materials that:
  - Are not identical but have **similar characteristics and component materials**
  - Enable the same function and are **commercially interchangeable**
  - Are produced in the same country
  - Are produced by the same producer or another producer

> ⚠️ "Similar" is a lower threshold than "identical" — used when exact match is not possible.

#### 🟩 **Fungible Goods/Materials**
- Interchangeable for commercial purposes with identical properties.
> Example: Different brands of steel with same tensile strength and composition.

> Used to determine whether materials can be substituted without affecting the product’s function.

#### 🔧 **Recovered Materials**
- Materials derived from:
  - Disassembly of used goods
  - Cleaning, inspection, or reprocessing
- Must be **reused in production** of a new good
- Applies to **remanufactured goods**

> Example: Reusing parts from old electronics to build new devices.

#### 📦 **Packaging Materials vs. Packing Materials**
| Term | Scope |
|------|------|
| **Packing Materials & Containers** | Used to protect goods during **transportation** (e.g., wooden crates, foam inserts). Excludes retail packaging. |
| **Packaging Materials & Containers** | Used for **retail sale** (e.g., boxes, labels, wrapping). Included in net cost. |

> Note: Only **transportation packaging** is excluded from valuation for origin purposes.

---

### 5. **Production Location – "Location of the Producer"**
- The **place where the producer uses a material** in production.
- OR
- The **warehouse or receiving station within 75 km (46.6 miles)** of the actual production site.

> This rule ensures that even if a material is received at a nearby warehouse, it still counts as being produced in the same country.

---

### 6. **Related Persons**
- A person is considered **related** if:
  - They are officers/directors of each other’s businesses
  - Legally recognized partners
  - Employer-employee relationship
  - One owns ≥25% of voting stock or shares
  - One controls the other
  - Both are controlled by a third party
  - Members of the same family (as defined in paragraph 45(3)(a) of the Customs Act)

> This prevents manipulation of origin by using related entities to artificially inflate regional value content.

---

### 7. **Remanufactured Goods**
A good qualifies as **remanufactured** if:
- Classified in Chapters 84–90 or under heading 94.02
- **Excludes** certain subheadings (e.g., 84.18, 85.09, etc.)
- Is **entirely or partially composed of recovered materials**
- Has **similar life expectancy** and **performs the same function** as a new product
- Has a **factory warranty similar to new
