**Detailed Summary of the Indian Bands Council Elections Order (February 11, 1997)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**
This regulation, issued by the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, establishes a framework for the democratic selection of band councils through **elections** in accordance with the **Indian Act**. It was introduced to promote good governance and ensure that band councils are elected by eligible members of the respective First Nations communities. The order applies specifically to bands listed in **Schedules I, II, and III** of the annexed Order, which are bands recognized under the Indian Act.

The primary objective is to transition from a system where band councils may have been appointed or otherwise selected without formal electoral processes to one where council members are elected by the band members, thereby enhancing accountability, transparency, and community representation.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Election of Councils for Bands in Schedules I, II, and III**
- **Effective Date**: After **March 4, 1997**, the council of any band listed in **Schedule I, II, or III** shall be selected by **elections conducted in accordance with the Indian Act**.
- This means that starting March 4, 1997, band councils must be formed through a formal electoral process, as defined in the Indian Act (e.g., rules for nomination, voting, eligibility, and conduct of elections).
- The elections must follow the procedural guidelines established under the Indian Act, including the requirement that only eligible band members (typically those who are enrolled members of the band) can vote.

#### **2. Application to Newly Added Bands**
- For any band that is **added to Schedule I, II, or III after March 31, 2010**, the requirement to hold elections applies **after the date the amendment comes into force** that adds the band to the schedule.
- This provision ensures that newly recognized bands are also subject to democratic governance from the outset, preventing the continuation of non-elected or appointed councils.
- It reflects a commitment to uphold democratic principles in the governance of all recognized bands, regardless of when they were added to the schedules.

#### **3. Repeal Clause**
- The Order is **not retroactive** to bands added before March 4, 1997.
- The Order **comes into force on March 4, 1997**, meaning that the requirement to hold elections via the Indian Act begins on that date for all bands already listed in Schedules I, II, or III.

### **Legal Authority**
The Minister issued this Order **pursuant to subsection 74(1) of the Indian Act**, which grants the Minister the authority to make regulations concerning the election of band councils. This provision enables the federal government to establish rules for the governance of First Nations bands in a way that aligns with constitutional and legislative frameworks.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Democratic Governance**:
   - The Order institutionalizes **democratic participation** in band governance, allowing band members to have a direct say in who leads their community.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   - Elections ensure that council members are accountable to the band members and that leadership is based on public trust and consensus rather than appointment or hereditary succession.

3. **Consistency Across Bands**:
   - By applying the same electoral standards to all bands in the schedules (both existing and newly added), the Order promotes **uniformity and fairness** in governance practices.

4. **Long-Term Governance Reform**:
   - This regulation represents a significant step toward modernizing the governance structures of First Nations bands, aligning them with contemporary democratic standards.

5. **Cultural and Political Considerations**:
   - While the Indian Act provides the procedural framework, the Order does not override the cultural and historical context of many bands. It seeks to balance federal oversight with community autonomy, ensuring that elections are conducted in a manner respectful of cultural practices and community needs.

### **Limitations and Contextual Notes**

- **No Mention of Indigenous Input or Consultation**: While the Order promotes democratic elections, it was issued under federal authority and does not explicitly require consultation with the bands themselves or their leadership during its development. This has been a point of criticism in later years regarding the balance between top-down regulation and community-led governance.
  
- **Flexibility in Implementation**: The actual conduct of elections may still be subject to interpretation or local variations, depending on how the Indian Act is applied in practice at the band level.

- **Post-2010 Amendments**: The provision for newly added bands after March 31, 2010, acknowledges that the governance model must evolve with changes in recognition and band status.

### **Conclusion**
The **Indian Bands Council Elections Order (February 11, 1997)** is a foundational piece of federal regulation that mandates the election of band councils for all bands listed in Schedules I, II, and III of the Indian Act, beginning March 4, 1997. It ensures that leadership is chosen through democratic processes, strengthens accountability, and sets a precedent for future bands to follow. The Order also applies to bands added after 2010, reinforcing the principle of equitable and inclusive governance across all recognized bands.

This regulation marks a pivotal shift in the governance of First Nations communities under the Indian Act, emphasizing transparency, participation, and democratic legitimacy in band leadership.
