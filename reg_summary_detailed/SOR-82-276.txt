This sequence indicates that a specific regulation (identified by section 1 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2017-135) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by the **Supplemental Orders and Regulations (SOR) No. 2017-135**, which was issued in Canada.

- **SOR/2017-135** is a statutory instrument published by the Government of Canada, typically under a federal department (such as Health, Environment, or Transportation), and it contains amendments or repeals to existing regulations.
- The reference to **section 1** suggests that the regulation being repealed was originally part of a regulatory framework and was specifically targeted by section 1 of this instrument.
- The repeated entries imply that the repeal applies to a regulation or set of regulations that were previously in force, and now are no longer valid or enforceable.

### Key Points:
- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in effect**.
- **Reason for Repeal**: It was repealed as part of a broader regulatory update or consolidation, likely to simplify the regulatory framework, correct inconsistencies, or align with new policy directions.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2017-135, which typically occurs in the official Gazette (e.g., the Canada Gazette).
