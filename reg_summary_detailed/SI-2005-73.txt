Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions in Public Administration (Effective August 1, 2005)**

#### **Legal Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)**.
- It is enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- This provision allows for the transfer of control, supervision, and administrative responsibilities between federal departments and agencies.

---

### **Effective Date**
- **August 1, 2005, at 00:00:02** (i.e., midnight, August 1, 2005).

---

### **Key Transfers and Reassignments**

The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of specific services and **powers, duties, and functions** from the **Department of Human Resources Development (HRD)** to the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)** and the **Minister of National Revenue**.

---

## **1. Transfer to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)**

### **Services Transferred:**
- **National Collection Services**
- **Collections Litigation and Advisory Services**

### **From:**
- The **Department of Human Resources Development (HRD)**

### **To:**
- The **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)**

### **Nature of Transfer:**
- Full **control and supervision** of these two operational units is transferred.
- These services are responsible for:
  - Collecting government debts (particularly those related to education and student financial assistance).
  - Managing litigation and advisory functions associated with debt collection.
- The transfer reflects a strategic realignment to consolidate debt collection functions under a single, centralized revenue agency — the CCRA — which is better positioned to enforce collection policies and manage financial compliance across federal programs.

---

## **2. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions to the Minister of National Revenue**

This transfer involves **specific ministerial responsibilities** related to the **collection of debts** due to:

---

### **A. Debts Due to Her Majesty in Right of Canada**

#### **Under the following Acts:**

1. **Canada Education Savings Act (CESA)**  
   - Powers and duties related to collection of debts due to the federal government under this Act.

2. **Canada Student Loans Act (CSLA)**  
   - Collection of debts due to the federal government under this Act.

3. **Canada Student Financial Assistance Act (CSFAA)**  
   - Collection of debts due to the federal government under this Act, **but only if not being collected by a designated service provider** under CSFAA.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The transfer applies **only when the debt is not being collected by a service provider** specified in the CSFAA. This means that if a third-party service provider (e.g., a private collection agency) is already handling collection, the Minister of National Revenue does not assume responsibility.

---

### **B. Debts Due to Her Majesty in Right of a Province**

#### **Under the following Acts:**

1. **Canada Education Savings Act (CESA)**  
2. **Canada Student Financial Assistance Act (CSFAA)**  
   - Collection of debts due to **a province**, again **only if not being collected by a service provider** under CSFAA.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This is a significant expansion of provincial debt collection responsibilities into the federal framework — indicating that the federal government (via the Minister of National Revenue) will step in when provincial collection mechanisms are inadequate or absent.

---

### **C. Transfer from the Minister of Social Development (HRD)**

#### **Powers, Duties, and Functions Transferred:**

- Relating to the collection of debts due to **Her Majesty in Right of Canada** under:

1. **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**  
   - **Exclusions:**  
     - Subsections **66(2.1)** and **(3)**  
     - **Section 107** of the CPP Act  
     → These specific provisions are **not included** in the transfer.

2. **Old Age Security Act (OAS)**  
   - **Exclusions:**  
     - Subsections **37(2.1)** and **(4)**  
     - **Section 40** of the OAS Act  
     → These specific provisions are **excluded** from the transfer.

> ✅ This means the Minister of National Revenue assumes responsibility for **most CPP and OAS debt collection**, but **not** for debts governed by the excluded subsections or sections.

---

### **Administrative and Functional Implications**

| Aspect | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Ministerial Responsibility** | The **Minister of National Revenue** now bears direct responsibility for collection activities related to education, student loans, and pension/old age security debts (excluding specified exclusions). |
| **Centralization of Debt Collection** | Consolidates debt collection under a single revenue authority (CCRA and the Minister of National Revenue), improving coordination, accountability, and enforcement. |
| **Service Provider Exclusions** | The transfer is conditional — only applies when **no designated service provider** is collecting the debt. This preserves existing private-sector collection arrangements where appropriate. |
| **Provincial Debt Collection** | The federal government steps in when provinces fail to collect debts under CESA and CSFAA — a notable shift in federal-provincial fiscal responsibilities. |

---

### **Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**

- **Improved Efficiency and Accountability**: Centralizing debt collection under the CCRA and Minister of National Revenue streamlines operations and enhances enforcement.
- **Strengthening Revenue Collection**: Ensures timely recovery of government funds, especially in areas like education and social security.
- **Clarifying Jurisdiction**: Defines clear lines of responsibility between federal departments and the Minister of National Revenue.
- **Modernization of Public Service Structure**: Aligns with broader government efforts to restructure public administration for greater effectiveness and transparency.

---

### **Key Exclusions (Important Notes)**

| Act | Excluded Provisions | Reason |
|-----|---------------------|--------|
| Canada Pension Plan (CPP) | Subsections 66(2.1), (3); Section 107 | These may relate to specific benefit calculations, eligibility, or administrative exceptions. |
| Old Age Security Act (OAS) | Subsections 37(2.1), (4); Section 40 | These may pertain to special rules on benefit payments or administrative discretion. |

> These exclusions suggest that certain aspects of CPP and OAS administration remain under the purview of HRD or other departments, particularly where they involve benefit entitlements or complex eligibility determinations.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **major reorganization of federal debt collection responsibilities** in Canada, effective August 1, 2005. It:

- Transfers **operational control** of **National Collection Services** and **Collections Litigation and Advisory Services** from HRD to the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency**.
- Assigns **ministerial authority** to the **Minister of National Revenue** to collect debts under key education and social security legislation — **excluding specific sections** that involve administrative or eligibility-based exceptions.
- Introduces a **conditional framework** where federal collection only occurs when private service providers are not handling the debt.
- Expands federal involvement in **provincial debt collection**, particularly in education-related matters.

This shift reflects a broader federal policy trend toward **centralizing revenue enforcement** and strengthening the **Minister of National Revenue’s role** in ensuring government financial accountability.

---

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
Effective August 1, 2005, the Government of Canada transferred control of key debt collection services and ministerial responsibilities related to education, student financial assistance, and pension/old age security debts from the Department of Human Resources Development to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and the Minister of National Revenue, with specific exclusions for certain sections of the CPP and OAS Acts.
