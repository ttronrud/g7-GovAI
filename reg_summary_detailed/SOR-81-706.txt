**Detailed Summary of the Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The *Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Regulations* are approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish zoning controls to ensure the safe operation of Fort Simpson Airport by defining spatial limitations on structures, natural features, and land use around the airport.

These regulations are formally titled the **Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Regulations** and are designed to protect aviation safety by controlling elevations, land use, and environmental factors that could interfere with aircraft approaches, take-offs, and flight paths.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Fort Simpson Airport, located in the vicinity of Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a reference for all measurements. It is coincident with **Department of Transport monument No. 840-305**, located at:<br>Latitude: 61°45′20.2905″<br>Longitude: 121°13′59.6865″<br>Assigned elevation: **165.81 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. It ensures a clear zone for aircraft during landing approach. Described in **Part III of the schedule**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, except where terrain is lower than 9 meters above ground—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. This surface defines the upper boundary of the airport zone. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing surface, including runways, designated for take-off and landing in a specific direction. Defined in **Part V of the schedule**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. Ensures safe clearance between the runway and surrounding areas. Described in **Part VI of the schedule**. |

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all lands** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances, that fall within the following boundaries:

- The lands **within** the designated airport zone; and  
- The lands **directly under** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits.

The outer limits of the zone are defined by a specific boundary description in **Part II of the schedule**, based on a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the Airport Reference Point (ARP). The boundary follows this path:

1. Begins at the intersection of the northern boundary of the **Protective Easement for Lot 19, Group 911, Plan 59432 (C.L.S.R.) 1037 (L.T.O.)** with a 4,000-meter-radius circle centered at the ARP.
2. Proceeds **clockwise along the circumference** of the circle until it intersects the southern boundary of the same protective easement.
3. Moves **westward** along the southern boundary of the easement to its southwest corner.
4. Proceeds **northerly** along the western boundary to the northwest corner.
5. Then moves **easterly** along the northern boundary back to the starting point.

This boundary is illustrated on **Department of Transport Fort Simpson Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1544**.

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including natural growths) on any land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- **Approach Surface**
- **Outer Surface**
- **Transitional Surface**

> This means all structures must remain below these imaginary planes to prevent interference with aircraft during approach or departure.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that natural features do not create hazards due to height or bird attraction.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Prohibition**

No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may allow such land or any part of it to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical safety measure to prevent bird strikes, which can pose serious risks to aircraft operations.

### **7. Description of Key Surfaces (as per Schedule)**

#### **Approach Surfaces**
Two approach surfaces are defined—one for each runway pair:

- **Runway 12–30 (approach 12 & 30):**
  - Inclined plane with **1:50 slope** (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontal).
  - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line:
    - 300 meters **above** the end of the strip elevation.
    - 15,000 meters **horizontally** from the end of the strip.
    - Outer ends of this line are **2,400 meters** from the runway centerline.

- **Runway 17–35 (approach 17 & 35):**
  - Inclined plane with **1:40 slope** (1 meter rise per 40 meters horizontal).
  - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line:
    - 75 meters **above** the end of the strip elevation.
    - 3,000 meters **horizontally** from the end of the strip.
    - Outer ends are **375 meters** from the runway centerline.

> These surfaces ensure safe zones for aircraft during landing approaches, reducing the risk of collisions with obstacles.

#### **Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (165.81 m)**.
- If the actual ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is adjusted to **9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface forms the upper boundary of the entire airport zone.

#### **Strips (Runway Areas)**
- **Runway 12–30**:
  - Width: **300 meters** (150 m on each side of the centerline).
  - Length: **1,948.8 meters**.
- **Runway 17–35**:
  - Width: **150 meters** (75 m on each side).
  - Length: **1,644 meters**.

> These are the active areas where aircraft take off and land.

#### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes with a **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces.
- Rise upward and outward until they intersect with:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent strip.

> These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway and the outer zone, ensuring consistent clearance and safety.
