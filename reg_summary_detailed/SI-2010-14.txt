**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
*List of Wildlife Species at Risk (Decisions Not to Add Certain Species) Order***

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulatory order, issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29, by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, **decides not to add two specific populations of wildlife to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk**:

1. **Winter Skate (*Leucoraja ocellata*)**  
   - Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence population  
   - Eastern Scotian Shelf population  
   - Georges Bank–Western Scotian Shelf–Bay of Fundy population  

2. **Chinook Salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*)**  
   - Okanagan population (in British Columbia)

The decision is based on a comprehensive assessment of the species’ status, recovery potential, socio-economic impacts, and existing regulatory frameworks. The Order also **approves the inclusion of a public statement** in the government’s registry under Section 120 of SARA, explaining the rationale for these decisions.

## **I. Winter Skate (*Leucoraja ocellata*) – Decision Not to List**

### **1. Species Background**
- **Classification**: A flat, bottom-dwelling fish (skate) found in the Northwest Atlantic.
- **Physical Characteristics**: Diamond-shaped body with enlarged pectoral fins, long tail, two small dorsal fins, light to dark brown upper surface, white to greyish underside often with brown blotches near the tail.
- **Distinguishing Features**: Rounded snout and eye spots on the upper side (though not always present); easily confused with *Little Skate* (*Leucoraja erinacea*).
- **Range**: Found from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Hatteras, USA. Most abundant in Canadian waters along Georges Bank, the Scotian Shelf, and the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.

### **2. COSEWIC Assessment**
- The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has identified **four distinct populations** of Winter Skate in Canada.
- The three populations under consideration for listing are:
  - Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence
  - Eastern Scotian Shelf
  - Georges Bank–Western Scotian Shelf–Bay of Fundy
- The **Northern Gulf–Newfoundland population** was assessed as "Data Deficient" and thus excluded from listing consideration.

### **3. Population Status and Declines**
- **Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Eastern Scotian Shelf populations**: Significant declines observed.
- **Georges Bank–Western Scotian Shelf–Bay of Fundy population**: Mature individuals remain stable in abundance; no change in geographic range since last assessments.

### **4. Primary Threats and Recovery Challenges**
- **Main Threat**: Fishing-related bycatch (not direct harvesting).
- **Key Biological Vulnerabilities**:
  - Delayed maturity
  - Long intergenerational time (many years between birth and reproduction)
  - Low fecundity (few offspring per year)
  - High natural mortality among adults
- These factors make the species **highly vulnerable to exploitation** and **poorly suited for recovery**, even with reduced human impacts.

> **Critical Finding**: The dominant impediment to recovery is **natural mortality**, not human-caused mortality. Listing would not address this root cause.

### **5. Socio-Economic Impacts of Listing**
- **Commercial Fisheries Closure**: Listing would require closing commercial fisheries in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) areas 4T and 4VW.
- **Estimated Annual Economic Losses**:
  - Millions of dollars in lost revenue
  - Significant job losses (direct and indirect)
- **Stakeholder Opposition**:
  - Lack of support from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and the fishing industry
  - Some Aboriginal communities have expressed reservations

### **6. Existing Regulatory and Management Measures**
- **Fisheries Act** already provides legally enforceable protections against killing, harming, or capturing the species.
- **Groundfish Integrated Fisheries Management Plans** will include targeted conservation measures such as:
  - Closure of the commercial skate fishery
  - Mandatory discarding of all Winter Skate caught as bycatch
  - Live release of caught individuals where feasible
  - Monitoring of discard rates
- These measures are **already sufficient** to mitigate human-induced mortality and are consistent with SARA-compliant management plans.

> **Conclusion**: Listing these populations would provide **minimal benefit** to species recovery while causing **substantial economic harm**. Existing legislation and management tools are adequate to protect the species.

## **II. Chinook Salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) – Okanagan Population**

### **1. Species Background**
- One of six Pacific salmon species native to North America.
- **Life Cycle**: Born in freshwater, grow in streams/lakes/estuaries, migrate to ocean, return to natal streams to spawn (die after spawning).
- **Okanagan Population**:
  - Limited to the Okanagan River (a tributary of the Columbia River).
  - Genetically similar to Upper Columbia Summer Chinook due to some hatchery-origin fish entering Canada.
  - Anadromous (migrate between ocean and freshwater).

### **2. Spawning and Life Cycle**
- Enter Okanagan River in June–July
- Spawning peaks in late October (10–14°C water temperature)
- Eggs incubate through winter; fry emerge in January–May

### **3. Threats to the Okanagan Population**
- **Primary Threat**: Dams on the Columbia River (especially in the U.S.) block migration routes and reduce survival.
- **Hatchery Influence**: A small proportion of Okanagan fish originate from U.S. hatcheries, contributing to genetic similarity with Upper Columbia Summer Chinook.

### **4. Recovery Potential Assessment**
- **Recovery is highly improbable without large-scale hatchery augmentation**.
- The most viable solution is the **Upper Columbia Summer Chinook Salmon hatchery**, proposed by the Confederate Tribes of the Colville Reserve (Washington State).
- This hatchery could produce enough fish to **increase straying** into the Okanagan River, potentially forming a viable, hybrid wild population over time.

### **5. Economic Impacts of Listing**
- Listing would trigger **section 32 prohibitions** under SARA — banning killing, harming, capturing, or taking of the species.
- Since Okanagan Chinook Salmon **cannot be easily distinguished** from other Chinook populations in the region, listing would require:
  - Closure of **all commercial Chinook salmon troll fisheries** on the west and north coasts of Vancouver Island.
- **Annual Economic Losses (BC Economy)**:
  - $7.7 million in lost wages
  - $4.2 million in lost industry profits
  - $7.3 million in lost commercial fishing licence values
  - **Total: ~$19 million per year**

> **Key Finding**: The closure of these fisheries would **not lead to recovery** of the Okanagan population and would instead cause **significant economic damage**.

### **6. Existing Management Measures**
- Amendments to the **Pacific Salmon Treaty (2009)**:
  - Reduced catch limits by 30% on the west coast of Vancouver Island
  - Reduced by 15% in southeast Alaska
- These actions have already improved survival rates of Chinook salmon in the region.
- The federal government will continue managing the Okanagan population under the **Fisheries Act**, which includes existing protections and monitoring.

> **Conclusion**: Recovery is not feasible through listing alone. Existing fisheries management and international cooperation are sufficient to protect the population. Listing would be **economically unjustifiable** and **operationally impractical**.

## **III. General Principles Underlying the Decisions**

1. **Recovery Potential is Central**  
   The decision to list a species must be based on whether listing would **contribute meaningfully to recovery**. In both cases, the scientific assessments show that recovery is **not achievable through listing alone**, especially due to:
   - High natural mortality (Winter Skate)
   - Need for large-scale hatchery augmentation (Okanagan Chinook)

2. **Socio-Economic Considerations**  
   The potential for **economic disruption, job losses, and industry harm** is substantial. These impacts are weighed against the species’ actual risk of extinction.

3. **Existing Legal and Management Frameworks**  
   - For Winter Skate: The *Fisheries Act* and groundfish management plans already provide enforceable protections.
   - For Okanagan Chinook Salmon: International treaty and regional fisheries management are already in place.

4. **Stakeholder Input and Consensus**  
   Lack of support from key provinces, industry, and Indigenous communities reinforces the decision not to list.

5. **Scientific Rigor and Transparency**  
   The Order includes a public statement (annex) explaining the scientific basis and rationale, ensuring transparency and accountability under SARA.

## **IV. Legal and Procedural Basis**

- The decision is made under **subsection 27(1.1) and (1.2) of SARA**, which allow the Minister of the Environment to **decide not to list** a species if:
  - The species is not at risk of extinction
  - Listing would not contribute to recovery
  - There are significant socio-economic or practical barriers
- The Minister of the Environment made the recommendation based on advice from the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** and supported by **COSEWIC assessments** and **Recovery Potential Assessments**.
- The
