**Detailed Summary of the *Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations***  
*(Cited as: Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Oil Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations* establish a standardized, transparent, and consistent framework for financial accounting and reporting by companies involved in the construction, operation, and management of oil pipelines in Canada. These regulations are designed to ensure accurate, reliable, and comparable financial records that reflect the true economic condition of oil pipeline operators—particularly in relation to their transportation infrastructure, costs, revenues, and capital investments.

The regulations apply exclusively to companies authorized by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)**—commonly referred to as the **Commission**—to construct or operate oil pipelines. They are primarily aimed at promoting accountability, transparency, and regulatory oversight of pipeline operations.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Board** | Repealed (SOR/2020-50, s.1) – no longer in effect |
| **Book Cost** | The original cost of plant recorded in plant accounts *without* deductions for accumulated depreciation, amortization, or any other adjustments. This represents the gross cost basis. |
| **Commission** | The Canadian Energy Regulator (CER), responsible for regulating pipeline operations and reviewing financial disclosures. |
| **Contingent Assets** | Assets whose value is uncertain and only realized upon fulfillment of uncertain conditions. Not recognized on the balance sheet until conditions are met. |

| **Fiscal Year** | Either the calendar year or a fiscal year approved by the Commission for a company’s accounting purposes. |
| **Minor Item of Plant** | A component or part of a larger plant unit (e.g., a valve or pump) that is physically distinct and has material value. Included in plant accounts. |
| **Net Salvage Value** | Salvage value minus removal costs. Represents the net proceeds from the disposal of retired plant. |
| **Operator** | A company authorized by the Commission to operate or construct an oil pipeline, where ownership is held in *undivided interest*. |
| **Other Plant** | Property or installations not directly related to pipeline transportation operations. Recorded separately. |
| **Plant** | Any installation or property whose cost is recorded in the Plant Accounts (Schedule II), specifically those used in pipeline operations or held for future use. |
| **Plant Retired** | A plant unit (whether replaced or not) or a minor item not replaced that is sold, abandoned, demolished, dismantled, or withdrawn from service. |
| **Plant Unit** | A complete structure, apparatus, or equipment that forms a component of a pipeline installation, including physically distinct parts with material value. |
| **Salvage Value** | Amount received for retired plant, including insurance proceeds and proceeds from salvaged materials. |
| **Transportation Plant** | Plant used in pipeline operations or held for future pipeline operations. |
| **Undivided Interest** | Joint beneficial ownership of pipeline assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses by two or more companies or persons. |

  - Accessible to Commission representatives upon request.
  - Retained for **one year after the Commission grants leave to abandon** the pipeline operation.

### **Group 2 Companies**
- Any company operating or constructing an oil pipeline that is **not** a Group 1 company.

> These accounts form the foundation of the company’s financial statements.

### **2. Plant Accounts (Schedule II – Accounts 100)**
- Subsidiary to balance sheet accounts **30 (Transportation Plant)** and **38 (Transportation Plant Leased to Others)**.
- Used to classify and track transportation plant assets.
- Must be supported by **subsidiary accounts** that record:
  - Costs by **location** (e.g., pumping stations, main pipelines, storage facilities, delivery points)
  - Any other facility that is separately located

> *Note*: Plant accounts must reflect actual construction, acquisition, and retirement costs.

### **3. Retained Earnings Accounts (Schedule III – Accounts 300)**
- Show changes in retained earnings annually and include:

> **Common expenses** between gathering and trunk functions must be:
- Equitably apportioned
- Supported by records showing the basis of apportionment
