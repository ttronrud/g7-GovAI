### **Purpose and Scope of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes the formal transfer of a specific portion of the federal public administration within the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)** — namely, the **Domestic Terrestrial Animal Pathogen Unit (DTAPU)** — to a new administrative structure or function under the broader framework of public service employment rules.

The transfer is not a reorganization of personnel or operations per se, but rather a regulatory adjustment to ensure that the employment conditions and governance of the DTAPU are aligned with the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA), particularly in terms of employment rights, responsibilities, and accountability.

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

1. **Application of Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act**  
   - Subsection 132(1) of the PSEA applies to **all persons employed or engaged** in the **Domestic Terrestrial Animal Pathogen Unit (DTAPU)**.  
   - This means that all employees and staff within the DTAPU are now subject to the employment standards, rights, duties, and procedures set out in the PSEA.  
   - These standards typically include provisions related to:
     - Fair treatment and due process
     - Employment terms (e.g., contracts, pay, working conditions)
     - Promotion, discipline, and termination procedures
     - Job security and protection from unfair dismissal
     - Public service values (integrity, accountability, transparency)

2. **Definition of the Transferred Portion**  
   - The regulation specifically identifies the **Domestic Terrestrial Animal Pathogen Unit (DTAPU)** as the portion of the CFIA being transferred into the scope of public service employment governance.  
   - The DTAPU is a specialized unit responsible for:
     - Monitoring and managing animal diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza)
     - Detecting, containing, and responding to outbreaks of terrestrial animal pathogens
     - Ensuring food safety and animal health through surveillance and diagnostic activities
   - This unit operates at the domestic level and focuses on terrestrial (non-aquatic) animal pathogens.

3. **Regulatory Effect and Implementation**  
   - The regulation brings the DTAPU under the formal employment framework of the federal public service.  
   - This ensures that the unit's workforce is protected under federal employment laws and that its operations are conducted in accordance with public service standards.  
   - It may also facilitate better oversight, accountability, and consistency in how personnel are managed across the federal government.

4. **Effective Date**

### **Significance and Context**

- This transfer reflects a broader government initiative to strengthen the governance and accountability of specialized public service units, especially those dealing with public health and food safety.  
- By aligning the DTAPU with the PSEA, the federal government ensures that its employees are protected under the same employment standards as other federal public servants.  
- It also reinforces the principle that critical public health and safety units must operate with transparency, fairness, and adherence to established employment norms.
