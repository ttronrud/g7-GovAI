Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

### **Regulation Amending Various GST/HST Regulations, No. 12**  
*Made under sections 277a and 277.1b of the Excise Tax Act*  
*Effective as of the date of publication in the Canada Gazette*

---

## **Overview**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, amends several existing Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) regulations. The amendments are designed to **adjust the application of certain provisions related to tax rebates and net tax calculations** for periods ending after 2022 — particularly with respect to the **January 1, 2023** reporting period — while maintaining continuity in tax treatment for certain pre-2023 events.

The regulation applies to **GST/HST claims and reporting periods ending after 2022**, but includes **specific exceptions** to ensure consistency in how tax liabilities and rebates are calculated for transactions or events that occurred **before January 1, 2023**.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **Section 1 & Section 2: Rebate Determination for Claim Periods Ending After 2022**

#### Purpose:
To determine the **rebate under section 259 of the Excise Tax Act** for a person (taxpayer) in a claim period ending after 2022.

#### Key Rules:
- **General Rule**: For all claim periods ending after 2022, the rebate is calculated **as if Sections 1 and 2 of this regulation had not come into force**.
- **Exception (Special Rule for January 1, 2023)**:
  For the claim period that includes **January 1, 2023**, the rebate is calculated **as if Sections 1 and 2 had not come into force** **only** in respect of:
  1. **Tax that became payable before 2023**  
     → The rebate is calculated without applying the new rules for such pre-2023 tax liabilities.
  2. **Amounts deemed to have been paid or collected before 2023**  
     → These deemed payments are treated as if the new rules did not apply.
  3. **Amounts required to be added to net tax due to:**
     - A **branch or division becoming a small supplier division before 2023**, or  
     - The **person ceasing to be a registrant before 2023**

#### Implication:
This ensures that **changes introduced by the regulation do not retroactively affect tax liabilities or rebates** for events that occurred prior to January 1, 2023. It protects taxpayers from unintended consequences where changes in rebate calculation rules would otherwise alter outcomes for pre-existing obligations.

> 🔍 *Example*: If a business had a tax liability that became due on December 31, 2022, and the rebate is calculated for a claim period starting January 1, 2023, the rebate will be determined **without applying the new Section 1/2 rules** — preserving the original tax treatment.

### **Section 3: Special Quick-Method Rate for Reporting Periods Ending After 2022**

#### Purpose:
To determine the **net tax of a registrant** for reporting periods ending after 2022.

#### Key Rule:
- For reporting periods that include **January 1, 2023**, the **special quick-method rate** applicable to a supply is:
  - **Adjusted to reflect what it would have been if Section 3 had not come into force**, **only for consideration paid or becoming due before 2023**.

#### What This Means:
- If a supply was made and the consideration (e.g., payment) was **received or became due before January 1, 2023**, the special quick-method rate used in calculating tax **must be based on the rate that would have applied had this regulation not existed**.
- This ensures that **tax rates for pre-2023 transactions are not distorted** by the new rules.

> ⚠️ *Consequence*: Taxpayers cannot use the new special quick-method rate for pre-2023 transactions. The rate must reflect the prior regime — preserving accuracy and fairness in tax calculation for older supplies.

### **Section 4: Deemed Effective Date**

#### Provision:
Section 4 is **deemed to have come into force four years before** the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

#### Implication:
- This provision **does not apply retroactively** in the normal sense.
- Instead, it creates a **"deemed effective date"** for the purpose of certain tax calculations or compliance timelines.
- It may be used to ensure that **certain rules are in effect long enough to allow for proper planning or compliance**, especially in relation to property or transaction records.

> 📅 *Example*: If the regulation is published on January 1, 2024, Section 4 is deemed effective January 1, 2020.

> 💡 *Purpose*: This allows for **greater stability and predictability** in how tax obligations are assessed over time, particularly in cases involving long-term assets or ongoing operations.

---

### **Section 5: Deemed Effective Date – February 24, 2022**

#### Provision:
Section 5 is **deemed to have come into force on February 24, 2022**.

#### Implication:
- This sets a **specific, fixed effective date** for Section 5, which likely governs certain tax treatment rules (e.g., related to tax collection, reporting, or eligibility for certain exemptions).
- The date is **not tied to publication** but is **fixed in time**, ensuring that any tax obligations or rights arising from this section are governed by the rule from that point forward.

> ✅ *Benefit*: Provides clarity and certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities regarding when a particular rule began applying — especially for transactions or events occurring between February 24, 2022, and January 1, 2023.

### **Section 6: Application to Acquisitions, Imports, or Introductions After July 27, 2018**

#### Purpose:
To apply the regulation to **property transactions** where tax becomes payable **after July 27, 2018**, but was either:
- Not paid on or before July 27, 2018, **or**
- Paid after July 27, 2018, without having become payable on or before that day.

#### Key Elements:
- Applies to:
  - Acquisitions
  - Importations
  - Bringing into a participating province
- Of **property** (goods, assets, etc.) where tax liability arises **after July 27, 2018**
- With one of the two conditions:
  1. Tax became payable **after July 27, 2018**, but was **not paid by that date**  
     → The regulation applies to the tax liability.
  2. Tax was **paid after July 27, 2018**, but **did not become payable on or before that date**  
     → The regulation applies to the payment.

#### Implication:
- This provision ensures that **tax treatment for property transactions after July 27, 2018** is governed by the updated rules — particularly where there is a **timing mismatch** between when tax became due and when it was paid.
- It helps resolve inconsistencies in tax treatment for delayed or retroactive tax obligations.

> 📌 *Example*: A company imports equipment on August 1, 2019. The tax becomes payable on that date, but was not paid until September 1, 2019. This transaction falls under Section 6 and is subject to the updated rules.

## **Key Takeaways for Taxpayers and Professionals**

2. **January 1, 2023** is a key threshold — all rules are adjusted for that period,
