**Detailed Summary of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit Remission Order**

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically subsection 23(2.1)a), aims to **remit (forgive) overpayments** made to individuals under two key federal income support programs during the COVID-19 pandemic:

- The **Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)**  
- The **Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB)**

The primary objective is to **correct an unfair and unjust situation** where individuals who were self-employed or had self-employment income were **incorrectly denied eligibility** for these benefits because their self-employment income was not properly considered in eligibility assessments. This results in overpayments that are now being remitted under specific conditions.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made by:
- **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**,  
- On the **recommendation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development** and the **Treasury Board**,  
- Pursuant to **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**.

This provision allows the government to issue orders for the remission of overpayments when they are deemed **unreasonable or unjust**, particularly in circumstances of emergency or public health crisis.

---

### **3. Scope of the Remission**

The Order applies to two distinct types of overpayments:

---

#### **A. Remission of CERB Overpayments**

**Eligibility Conditions:**

1. **Eligibility Based on Self-Employment Income:**
   - The individual would have been eligible to receive a CERB payment **if their self-employment gross income had been taken into account** for the purpose of determining whether they qualify as a "worker" under **paragraph (b)** of the definition of "worker" in **Section 2 of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act**.

   > *Note:* Under normal CERB rules, only individuals with employment income (e.g., wage or salary) are considered eligible. Self-employed individuals were often excluded because their income was not counted under the standard definition of "worker." This regulation recognizes that such individuals should have been eligible had their self-employment income been properly assessed.

2. **Filing Requirement:**
   - The person must have filed a **return of income under the Income Tax Act** for the **2019 and 2020 taxation years** with the **Minister of National Revenue**, **not later than December 31, 2022**.

   > This requirement ensures that the individual has formally reported their income, confirming the existence of self-employment income and providing a basis for assessing eligibility.

**Remission Process:**

- If the overpayment has already been **repaid**, remission is **only granted** if the individual:
  - Makes a **written claim for remission** to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**.

> This means that repayment alone does not automatically result in remission — a formal request is required.

---

#### **B. Remission of EI ERB Overpayments**

**Eligibility Conditions:**

1. **Eligibility Based on Self-Employment Income:**
   - The individual would have been eligible for the **Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB)** **if their self-employment gross income had been considered insurable earnings** under:
     - **Subparagraph 153.9(1)(a)(iii)**, or  
     - **Subparagraph 153.9(1)(c)(iii)**  
     of the *Employment Insurance Act*.

   > These subparagraphs define insurable earnings for certain types of self-employed workers. The regulation acknowledges that self-employed individuals who earned income during 2019–2020 were eligible for EI ERB had their income been counted as insurable earnings.

2. **Filing Requirement:**
   - The person must have filed a **return of income under the Income Tax Act** for the **2019 and 2020 taxation years**, **not later than December 31, 2022**.

**Remission Process:**

- If the overpayment has been **repaid or returned**, remission is **only granted** if the individual:
  - Makes a **written claim for remission** to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**.

> Again, repayment or return does not automatically trigger remission — a formal written request is required.

### **4. Key Principles Underlying the Order**

- **Equity and Fairness:** The regulation addresses a perceived **unfairness** in the original eligibility rules, which excluded many self-employed individuals from receiving emergency benefits due to technical misapplication of income definitions.
- **Recognition of Self-Employment Income:** It formally recognizes that self-employment income, when properly reported, qualifies as a valid basis for eligibility under both CERB and EI ERB.
- **Administrative Accountability:** The requirement to file income returns ensures that individuals have demonstrated compliance with tax obligations and have provided verifiable evidence of income.
- **Prevention of Double Burden:** By remitting overpayments, the government avoids requiring individuals to repay funds they were never truly entitled to receive.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is made** (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette or official government notice).

> This means individuals can begin applying for remission immediately upon the Order’s issuance, provided they meet all eligibility criteria.

---

### **6. Practical Implications for Individuals**

- **Self-employed individuals** who were not eligible for CERB or EI ERB due to the exclusion of self-employment income may now apply for remission of any overpayments they made.
- Individuals must **have filed their 2019 and 2020 income tax returns** by **December 31, 2022**, to qualify.
- A **written claim** must be submitted to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development** — no automatic remission occurs upon repayment.
- The government is not forgiving the overpayment in full — rather, it is **remitting** (i.e., canceling or reducing) the amount owed, based on the individual’s eligibility under the revised criteria.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Order **does not apply to all overpayments** — only those resulting from the exclusion of self-employment income in eligibility determinations.
- It applies **only to overpayments repaid or to be repaid** under specific sections of the CERB and EI ERB Acts.
- It does **not extend to other types of benefits** or overpayments outside of CERB and EI ERB.
- It does **not cover overpayments due to fraud, misrepresentation, or intentional non-compliance**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **targeted and equitable correction** to a flaw in the original emergency benefit frameworks during the pandemic. By recognizing self-employment income as a valid basis for eligibility and providing a clear pathway for remission of unjust overpayments, the government ensures that vulnerable self-employed individuals are not penalized for circumstances beyond their control.

It reflects a balance between **fiscal responsibility** and **social equity**, demonstrating the government’s commitment to fairness in emergency financial assistance programs.
