#### 3. **Corporate Name Change**
- On **June 12, 2018**, the corporate name of **10804142 Canada Inc.** was officially changed to **Project Deliver II Ltd.**
- This name change was not merely administrative; it reflected a reorganization within the government’s project structure and was necessary to align the entity with its operational and legal identity under the GCOA.

#### 4. **Corporate Structure and Ownership**
- **Project Deliver II Ltd.** is:
  - A corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA).
  - A **wholly-owned subsidiary** of **Project Deliver I Ltd.**
- According to **Section 3 of the GCOA**, **Project Deliver I Ltd.** is designated as an **agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
