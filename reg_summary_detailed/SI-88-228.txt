**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulatory declaration, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on behalf of the Canadian government, formally establishes the effective date of the *First Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985*. Below is a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of its key components and implications:

---

### **1. Background and Context**

- **Statute Revision Commission (SRC) Completion**:  
  The Statute Revision Commission, a body established to modernize and streamline Canada’s legal framework, has completed its work on the *First Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985*. This supplement is a formal update to the official codification of Canadian laws, aimed at improving clarity, consistency, and accessibility by revising, consolidating, and organizing existing statutes.

- **Official Certification and Deposit**:  
  The printed version of the First Supplement was officially attested and certified under the following procedures:
  - Signed by the **Governor General**, the head of state of Canada.
  - Countersigned by the **Minister of Justice**, indicating governmental endorsement and approval.
  - Certified as correct by the **Chairman of the Statute Revision Commission**, confirming its accuracy and completeness.
  
  This officially certified copy was deposited in the **Office of the Clerk of the Parliaments** on **August 3, 1988**. This step ensures that the supplement is formally recognized as part of the official legal record and is accessible to legislative and legal bodies.

### **2. Legal Authority**

- The declaration is issued under **subsection 13(2) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act**.  
  This provision grants the Governor General in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of Justice) the authority to declare when a supplement to the Revised Statutes shall come into force. It allows the government to implement statutory changes without requiring a new parliamentary act, as long as the supplement is properly prepared and approved.

### **3. Key Provision of the Declaration**

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Governor General in Council formally declares that **December 12, 1988** is the day on which the *First Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985* shall:
  - Come into force,
  - Take legal effect,
  - Be treated as if enacted by an Act of Parliament.

- **Legal Status**:  
  The enactments contained in the supplement are **not merely supplementary or advisory**. Instead, they are given the full force of law. This means that:
  - The provisions in the supplement are legally binding.
  - They are treated as if they were passed by Parliament through a formal legislative act.
  - They are enforceable by courts and administrative bodies from December 12, 1988 onward.

### **4. Significance and Implications**

- **Legal Clarity and Consistency**:  
  The supplement enhances the coherence and accessibility of Canada’s legal system by replacing outdated or fragmented statutes with a modern, organized structure.

- **No Need for New Parliament Acts**:  
  Because the supplement is declared to have the force of law under existing statutory authority (subsection 13(2)), it does not require a new bill to be introduced and passed by Parliament. This streamlines the legislative process and allows for timely updates to the law.

- **Judicial and Administrative Application**:  
  From December 12, 1988, courts, legal practitioners, and government agencies must apply the laws in the supplement as if they were enacted by Parliament. This ensures uniformity in legal interpretation and application across jurisdictions.

- **Public Access and Transparency**:  
  The deposit of the supplement in the Clerk of the Parliaments’ office ensures that it is publicly available, accessible to legal professionals, and subject to parliamentary oversight.
