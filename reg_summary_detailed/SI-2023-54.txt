The regulation you have referenced is a formal transfer of administrative responsibility under Canadian federal legislation. Here is a detailed and accurate summary of the provision:

---

**Regulatory Summary:**

**Regulation:**  
Section 207 of *S.C. 2003, c. 22* (Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22 — *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*)  
Referenced in *R.S., c. P-34* (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter P-34 — *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*)

**Key Provision:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, transfers from the **Treasury Board Secretariat** to the **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)** the **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Canadian Digital Service (CDS)**.

---

**Detailed Interpretation:**

1. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision empowers the Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet, acting through the Governor General) to reassign administrative responsibilities between federal departments and agencies, provided it is recommended by the Prime Minister.

2. **Transfer of Function:**  
   The transfer involves the **control and supervision** of the Canadian Digital Service — not merely its personnel or budget, but the overall governance, strategic direction, and operational oversight of the CDS. This includes decisions on service delivery, digital transformation initiatives, and policy development related to government digital services.

3. **Precedent and Context:**  
   The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* was enacted in 2003 to enable more flexible and efficient restructuring of the federal public service. This specific transfer reflects a broader trend of aligning public service functions with current policy priorities, such as digital government, innovation, and service delivery.

4. **Organizational Background:**  
   - The **Treasury Board Secretariat** traditionally oversees the administration of federal public service operations, including human resources, financial management, and policy coordination.  
   - The **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)** is responsible for programs related to employment, social security, and public services such as employment insurance, disability benefits, and workforce development.  
   - The **Canadian Digital Service (CDS)** was established to modernize government services through digital innovation, improve accessibility, and enhance citizen engagement. It is a cross-cutting initiative that supports digital transformation across federal departments.

5. **Implications of the Transfer:**  
   - The CDS will now operate under the **oversight and strategic direction of DESD**, which may influence its focus on digital services related to employment, social programs, and public benefits.  
   - This shift may strengthen integration between digital innovation and social policy delivery, ensuring that digital tools are aligned with the needs of vulnerable populations and workforce development.  
   - It also reflects a strategic realignment of federal public service priorities, placing digital transformation within a broader social and economic policy framework.

6. **Legal and Administrative Effect:**  
   The transfer is not a dissolution or reorganization of the CDS itself, but a change in administrative supervision. The CDS continues to exist as a functional unit, but now reports to the DESD’s leadership, which may include a new digital services portfolio or unit.

7. **Timeline and Implementation:**  
   While the regulation is dated 2003, the actual implementation of this transfer likely occurred later, possibly in the context of the evolution of digital government initiatives in Canada. The CDS was later formally established as a distinct entity under the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) in 2018, indicating that this 2003 transfer may have been a preliminary or transitional step.

---

**Important Note:**  
There is a potential inconsistency in the reference to the *Canadian Digital Service*. The CDS as a formal, standalone entity was not established until later in the 2010s. The 2003 regulation may refer to an earlier version or a precursor initiative. Therefore, this transfer may represent a **provisional or historical administrative realignment** rather than the current operational structure.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative control from the Treasury Board Secretariat to the Department of Employment and Social Development, specifically for the Canadian Digital Service. It reflects an early attempt to integrate digital transformation efforts within a social policy context. While the CDS evolved significantly after 2003, this provision remains a foundational element in the federal government’s approach to digital public service delivery and interdepartmental coordination.

---

**Final Note:**  
For current governance of the Canadian Digital Service, the most accurate and up-to-date information is found in more recent legislation, such as the *Digital Government Strategy* and the *Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED)*’s role in digital transformation. This 2003 regulation should be viewed as a historical administrative transfer rather than a current operational directive.
