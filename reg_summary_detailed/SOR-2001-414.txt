The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2006-318, s. 6]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision was **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 6 of the Statutory Instrument 2006-318** (SOR/2006-318).

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been **repealed** by the amendment set out in **SOR/2006-318, section 6**.

**SOR/2006-318**:  
This is a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in Canada, typically under the authority of a federal government department (such as Health Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, or another regulatory body). SOR/2006-318 is commonly known as an **amending instrument** that updates or removes outdated, obsolete, or redundant regulations.

**Section 6 of SOR/2006-318**:  
Section 6 specifically **repeals** certain provisions of prior regulations. In this case, the repeated reference to "s. 6" indicates that the regulation being referenced was one of the provisions targeted for removal under that section. The exact content of the repealed regulation would have previously governed a specific area such as:

- Environmental protection  
- Product safety  
- Health standards  
- Workplace regulations  
- Licensing or compliance requirements  

However, without the original text of the repealed regulation, the precise subject matter cannot be fully determined.

**Implications of Repeal**:  
- The legal obligations, rules, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.  
- Any actions or compliance measures based on that regulation are now **invalid or outdated**.  
- Regulatory agencies must refer to current, active regulations that have replaced or superseded the repealed ones.  
- The repeal may reflect changes in policy, technological advancement, or a shift in legislative priorities.

**Why Was It Repealed?**  
Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
- Obsolescence (e.g., outdated procedures or standards)
- Inefficiency or lack of practical application
- Replacement by a more modern or comprehensive regulation
- Overlapping or conflicting provisions
- Legislative review and simplification of the regulatory framework

**Conclusion**:  
The regulation referenced is **fully repealed** and **no longer exists in current law**. It was removed by **Section 6 of SOR/2006-318**, which is a formal legislative amendment. As such, it should not be used as a basis for legal compliance, policy interpretation, or administrative action. To understand the current regulatory framework, one must consult the **current, active regulations** that succeeded or replaced it — which may be found in the official government publications such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Statutes* database.

> 🔍 **Note**: To obtain the full context of what the repealed regulation originally covered, you would need to consult the original text of the regulation before repeal (e.g., a prior regulation such as the *Regulations respecting the use of certain chemicals* or *Health and Safety Code*), which may be archived in the *Federal Register* or the *Parliament of Canada’s legislation database*.

If you can provide the **name of the original regulation** or the **regulatory framework** (e.g., Health, Environment, Transportation), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary of what the repealed provision originally governed.
