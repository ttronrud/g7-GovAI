**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993"**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**

This regulation, officially titled the *Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993*, was enacted to address a specific employment issue within the **Department of Forestry** in Canada during a defined time period (March 1, 1993 – December 31, 1993).

The primary purpose is to **exclude certain temporary workers from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** — specifically, those hired for short-term, intermittent assignments totaling less than six months over any 12-month period.

---

### **2. Scope of Exclusion**

The exclusion applies to individuals appointed on or after **March 1, 1993**, for one or more **specified periods of less than three months**, where the **total duration of such appointments across any consecutive 12-month period does not exceed six months**.

These appointments are limited to specific job groups within the Department of Forestry:

#### **A. Administrative Support Category**
- **Clerical and Regulatory Group**
- **Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing Group**

#### **B. Technical Category**
- **Engineering and Scientific Support Group**
- **Social Science Support Group**

#### **C. Operational Category**
- **Heating, Power and Stationary Plant Operation Group**
- **General Labour and Trades Group**
- **General Services Group**

> Note: This exclusion applies only to **temporary appointments** that are short-term and not continuous.

---

### **3. Legal Basis**

The regulation is grounded in two key provisions of the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**:

- **Subsection 41(1)**: Allows the Public Service Commission (PSC) to **exclude** certain individuals from the operation of the PSEA when it is determined that doing so is **not practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service**.
  
- **Subsection 37(1)**: Enables the Governor in Council (on recommendation) to **make regulations** that define how temporary employment arrangements operate under specific conditions.

The PSC concluded that applying the full PSEA to these short-term, temporary workers would be **impractical and contrary to the operational needs** of the Department of Forestry during that period.

### **4. Key Decisions and Rationale**

#### **Why the Exclusion Was Made**
- **Operational Flexibility**: The Department of Forestry required flexibility in staffing due to seasonal demands, project-based work, or temporary staffing needs.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Applying the full employment protections and procedures of the PSEA (e.g., hiring, termination, grievance processes) to short-term roles would create unnecessary administrative burden and cost.
- **Best Interests of the Public Service**: The Commission determined that excluding these temporary appointments from the PSEA better serves the efficiency and responsiveness of the department during a transitional or peak work period.

#### **What Is Excluded**
- The exclusion means that **these temporary workers are not governed by the standard employment rights, protections, and procedures** under the Public Service Employment Act.
- This includes:
  - No entitlement to certain benefits or protections (e.g., job security, collective bargaining rights, formal grievance processes).
  - No obligation to follow standard hiring or promotion procedures.
  - No right to permanent status or automatic entitlement to pension or retirement benefits under the PSEA.

> Importantly, this exclusion applies **only to temporary appointments** meeting the specified criteria (less than 3 months per assignment, total <6 months in any 12-month period).

---

### **5. Regulatory Authority and Approval Process**

- The **Public Service Commission** made the decision based on its assessment that the exclusion was both **practicable and in the public interest**.
- The Commission **recommended** the creation of the regulations to the **Secretary of State of Canada**.
- The **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of both the Secretary of State and the Public Service Commission, formally **approved and enacted** the regulations.
- This reflects a **collaborative, policy-driven process** involving legal, administrative, and operational considerations.

---

### **6. Legal Effect and Citation**

- The Order is formally cited as:  
  **"Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993"**
- It establishes that individuals hired under these conditions are considered **"persons" who are not employed pursuant to the Public Service Employment Act**.
- The exclusion is **time-limited** to the period from **March 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.
- It does **not extend beyond this timeframe** or apply to other departments or job categories.

---

### **7. Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Employment Status** | Workers are considered temporary and not subject to full public service employment rights. |
| **Job Security** | No protection against termination without cause during the term of appointment. |
| **Grievance Rights** | No access to formal grievance or appeal processes under the PSEA. |
| **Benefits** | No entitlement to pension, health benefits, or other long-term benefits tied to PSEA. |
| **Transparency** | Hiring and termination decisions may be more flexible and less subject to formal review. |
| **Departmental Efficiency** | Enables faster hiring and deployment of temporary staff for project-based or seasonal work. |

---

### **8. Limitations and Boundaries**

- The exclusion **does not apply** to:
  - Permanent appointments.
  - Appointments exceeding six months in any 12-month period.
  - Appointments outside the specified job groups.
  - Appointments before March 1, 1993.
- The exclusion is **specific to the Department of Forestry** and does not extend to other federal departments.

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **temporary, targeted exemption** from the Public Service Employment Act, designed to meet the unique operational needs of the Department of Forestry during a specific period. It balances administrative flexibility with public service accountability by allowing short-term, project-based staffing without imposing the full burden of permanent employment rules.

While it provides practical benefits to the department, it also **reduces the legal protections and stability** available to temporary workers. As such, it serves as a case study in how public service employment policy can adapt to specific operational realities through targeted legislative and regulatory tools.

### **Final Note**

This Order is a **non-permanent, time-bound measure** and is not intended as a precedent for future employment practices. It reflects a decision made in 1993 and is no longer in effect beyond December 31, 1993. Any future temporary staffing arrangements would require new assessments and regulatory approvals.
