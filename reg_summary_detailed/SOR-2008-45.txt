**Detailed Summary of the Exemption Regulations (Persons) – S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 58**

### **Regulatory Background**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, under **paragraph 12(e)a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**. This provision allows for exemptions from the requirement to obtain export or import permits when specific conditions are met, particularly in cases involving national security, public safety, or essential governmental functions.

The purpose of these **Exemption Regulations (Persons)** is to **identify and exempt certain individuals** from the general requirement under the Export and Import Permits Act to obtain permits for goods entering or leaving Canada. The exemption applies **only when these persons are acting in the course of their official employment** and performing duties directly related to public safety, security, or regulatory enforcement.
