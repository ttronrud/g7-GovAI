### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Registration Regulations**

This regulation, formally titled the **Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Area Registration Regulations**, was enacted under the authority of the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* (S.C. 1987, c. 3), and came into force on **May 20, 1988**. It establishes a formal system for the **administration, registration, and management of interests and instruments** relating to the offshore area of Newfoundland and Labrador, including the recording of ownership, changes, and transactions in a centralized registry.

The regulation is designed to ensure transparency, legal certainty, and administrative efficiency in the governance of offshore hydrocarbon and mineral rights, and it provides a framework for how interests (such as ownership rights or leasehold interests) and instruments (like agreements or security interests) are registered, maintained, and updated.

## **1. Legislative Basis and Approval Process**

- The proposed regulations were **published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on January 23, 1988**, providing interested parties with a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources.
- The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources **consulted with the Minister of Energy for the Province of Newfoundland**, and received **formal approval** from that provincial minister for the adoption of the regulations.
- As a result, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the federal Minister, **made the regulations effective on May 20, 1988**, pursuant to:
  - Subsections **53(1)** and **113(1)** of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act;
  - Sections **118** and **125** of the Act.

> This process reflects a collaborative governance model between federal and provincial authorities, ensuring that the regulation respects both national policy and regional interests.

## **2. Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Establish a **system of registration** for interests and instruments in the **Newfoundland offshore area**;
- Ensure **accurate, accessible, and up-to-date records** of ownership and rights;
- Prescribe **fees** to be paid in connection with registration (though fees are not detailed in this excerpt);
- Provide **procedures for recording changes**, cancellations, and notices related to offshore interests.

> The term "interest" refers broadly to rights in offshore areas (e.g., exploration, production, or development rights), while "instruments" include deeds, agreements, security interests, or notices.

## **3. Role of the Registrar**

The **Registrar** is the central administrative officer responsible for overseeing the registration system. Key responsibilities include:

### **3.1 Appointment and Succession**
- The Registrar is appointed by the Board under the Act.
- In the absence of the Registrar, the **Deputy Registrar** assumes all powers and duties.
- If no person is designated as Registrar by the Board, the Deputy Registrar automatically acts in that capacity.

### **3.2 Registration of Interests**
- Upon registration of an interest, the Registrar must:
  - Prepare a **detailed abstract** of the interest;
  - Enter the abstract into a **central register** (the "register") without delay.

### **3.3 Contents of the Abstract**
Each abstract must contain the following information:
1. **Type, effective date, and term** of the interest;
2. **Names of interest owners** (or individual holders if multiple), and the **name of any representative** appointed under section 53 of the Act;
3. **Particulars of shares** (e.g., percentage ownership) in the interest;
4. A **description of the offshore area, geological formations, and substances** to which the interest applies.

> *Note: The section on "shares in the interest" was repealed in 2007 (SOR/2007-227, s.3), suggesting that the structure of interest ownership may have been revised in later amendments.*

### **3.4 Additional Notations Required in Abstracts**
The abstract must also include:
- **Changes** to previously recorded information (excluding corrections under subsection 9(2));
- Any **Board order, decision, or action** that is expressly subject to **section 124 of the Act**;

- Any **extension of the interest term** under the Act.

### **3.5 Handling of Expiration or Cancellation**
- If an interest **expires or is cancelled**, the Registrar must:
  - Endorse a **memorandum of expiration or cancellation** on the original copy of the interest;
  - Make a **notation in the abstract** to reflect this.

### **3.6 Consolidation of Interests**
- When two or more interests are **consolidated** (e.g., merged into one), the Registrar must:

  - Enter it into the register immediately;
  - Include **all notations from the original abstracts** in the new one.

## **4. Documentation and Record-Keeping**

### **4.1 Stamping and Receipt Records**

### **4.3 Acceptance and Registration of Instruments**
- Upon acceptance:
  - The instrument is **registered**;
  - A **notation of registration** is made in the abstract of each relevant interest;
  - A record of registration is entered in the daybook.

### **4.4 Cancellation of Instruments**
- If an instrument is later **cancelled** (e.g., due to breach or termination), the Registrar must:
  - Make a **notation of cancellation** in every abstract where the instrument was previously registered.

## **5. Office of the Registrar**

- The office is located in **St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador**.
- It is open **Monday to Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.**, excluding statutory holidays when the Board offices are closed.

### **Records Maintained at the Office**

## **7. Correction of Errors or Omissions**

- If the Registrar discovers an **error or omission** in an abstract (e.g., incorrect name, missing address, incorrect term), the error must be **corrected promptly**.
- Upon correction, the Registrar must send a **certified copy of the corrected abstract** to:
  - The **interest owner** (or representative under section 53);
  - Any **secured party** under a security notice that has not been fully discharged at the time of correction.

> This ensures that all stakeholders are promptly informed of changes that may affect their rights.

## **8. Surrender of Interests**

An interest may be **surrendered** (i.e., voluntarily relinquished) in whole or in part.

### **Surrender Procedures**
- **Full surrender** (of all offshore area) requires:

- **Partial surrender** (of a portion of the offshore area) requires:

### **Effect of Surrender**
- The Registrar must:
  - Endorse a **memorandum of surrender** on the original interest document;
  - Make a **notation of surrender** in the abstract.

> This allows for flexible management of rights, especially as exploration or development plans evolve.
