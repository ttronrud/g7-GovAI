### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in Nunavut (Ukkusiksalik National Park)**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made on the advice of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**.
- **Purpose**: To formally withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in Nunavut from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer) to establish **Ukkusiksalik National Park**.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **protect and preserve a large area of land in Nunavut** by permanently withdrawing it from potential commercial or developmental use. This action supports the creation of **Ukkusiksalik National Park**, a significant protected area aimed at:
- Conserving biodiversity and natural ecosystems.
- Protecting cultural and traditional Inuit values and heritage.
- Promoting environmental sustainability and public access to natural landscapes.

The park is intended to be a **national park of Canada**, covering approximately **20,558 km²**, making it one of the largest protected areas in the country.

---

#### **3. Scope of Withdrawal**
- **Geographic Location**: Adjacent to **Roes Welcome Sound in Hudson Bay**, in the northern part of Nunavut.
- **Description of Land**:
  - The land is precisely described using a detailed coordinate-based survey method (based on the **North American Datum 1983**).
  - The boundary follows a complex path involving:
    - Shorelines (e.g., western shoreline of Roes Welcome Sound),
    - Streams and lakes (e.g., unnamed streams, Masivak Creek),
    - High and low water marks,
    - Boundary monuments (e.g., 201RE, 202RE, etc.),
    - Triangulation stations (e.g., 739043, 6490700, 6490705).
  - The entire tract includes **all surface and subsurface rights**, including:
    - Rights to minerals (solid, liquid, gaseous),
    - Hydrocarbons (oil and gas),
    - All natural resources and associated rights.

> **Note**: The land includes **all shoals, islands, sandbars, and spits** that may be exposed at low tide.

---

#### **4. Duration of Withdrawal**
- The withdrawal from disposal is effective **from the date the Order is made** until **October 1, 2014**.
- This temporary period allows time for:
  - Final environmental assessments,
  - Consultation with Inuit communities,
  - Legal and administrative processes to formally establish the park,
  - Public and governmental review.

> After October 1, 2014, the land remains protected under the broader framework of national park designation, unless otherwise amended.

#### **5. Exceptions to the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exclusions)**
Despite the general withdrawal of land from disposal, the following activities are **explicitly exempted** under the Territorial Lands Act:

| Exception | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mineral claims pre-existing before the Order** | Locating or recording a mineral claim made before the Order's date is not affected. |
| **Leasing of recorded claims** | A lease granted under the **Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations** to a person with a recorded claim (if the lease covers part of the claim) is allowed. |
| **Significant discovery licences** | A licence issued under the **Canada Petroleum Resources Act** to a holder of a prior exploration licence (if the area overlaps) is permitted. |
| **Production licences** | A production licence issued to a holder of a prior exploration or significant discovery licence (if covering overlapping areas) is allowed. |
| **Surface leases** | A surface lease granted to allow a claim holder to exercise rights (e.g., drilling, mining) is permitted. |
| **Renewals of interests** | Renewals of existing mineral or surface rights are allowed. |

> These exceptions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing operations** are not disrupted during the transition to park status.

> **Important Clarification**: Section 2 (which normally prevents disposal of land) **does not apply** to these specific pre-existing or ongoing mineral-related activities.

#### **6. Inuit-Owned Land Exception**
- **Inuit-Owned Land Parcel RE-32** is **excluded** from the withdrawal.
- This parcel, located within the broader tract, is **owned by Inuit** and is **not subject to the withdrawal**.
- This reflects the importance of **Inuit land rights and self-determination** in the region.

---

#### **7. Repeal and Legal Status**
- The Order includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that it is a **temporary measure** intended to be superseded by a permanent designation.
- Once the park is formally established through legislation (e.g., a national park act), this Order will be **replaced or repealed** by a more permanent legal instrument.

---

#### **8. Key Impacts and Significance**
- **Environmental Protection**: The withdrawal safeguards a vast, ecologically sensitive region of the Canadian Arctic, including wetlands, coastal zones, and boreal forests.
- **Cultural Preservation**: The area holds cultural and spiritual significance for Inuit communities, especially those in the Qikiqtaaluk Region.
- **Resource Management**: Prevents potential mining or drilling activities in a key ecological zone, aligning with Canada’s commitment to sustainable development and biodiversity conservation.
- **Legal Precedent**: Demonstrates the government’s ability to use statutory powers to create protected areas through administrative orders, even before full legislative approval.

It legally protects a vast area of Arctic land from development while respecting existing Indigenous rights and mineral interests. The temporary nature of the withdrawal allows for thorough consultation, environmental review, and final legislative action to formally designate the area as a national park. It underscores the balance between conservation, Indigenous rights, and resource management in Canada’s northern territories.
