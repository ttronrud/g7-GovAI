### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The **Redside Dace (*Clinostomus elongatus*)** is a small freshwater fish species recognized as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   The Ministers responsible for Parks Canada and Fisheries and Oceans jointly developed and adopted a **recovery strategy** for the Redside Dace. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.  
   
   This recovery strategy has been officially **registered in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the scientific basis for designating critical habitat.

3. **Legal Basis for Exclusion of Certain Habitat:**  
   Under **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, certain areas may be excluded from the definition of critical habitat if they are located in a **place that is not suitable for the species’ survival or recovery**, or if they fall under specific statutory exemptions (e.g., areas where development or land use is legally permitted under other acts).

   Additionally, **subsection 58(5)** of SARA provides that any portion of the critical habitat located in such a place must be **excluded** from the formal designation in a regulatory order.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Scope of Critical Habitat Designation:**  
   The Order formally designates the **critical habitat** of the Redside Dace as identified in the recovery strategy, **excluding** any portion that falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.

2. **Legal Application of Subsection 58(1):**  
   Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Redside Dace **only to the extent that it is not excluded** under subsection 58(2).  
   - This means that **only the portions of the critical habitat not located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b** are legally protected under the Act.  
   - Any remaining portions (i.e., those in areas designated under subsection 58(2)b) are **not subject to the requirements of critical habitat protection** under SARA.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Areas:**  
   The Order explicitly excludes from protection any portion of the Redside Dace’s critical habitat that lies within a place identified under **subsection 58(2)b**. This exclusion is required by law and is consistent with the intent of SARA to balance species conservation with legitimate land use and development activities.

4. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   - To legally define and protect the essential areas required for the Redside Dace’s survival and recovery.  
   - To ensure that federal activities (e.g., infrastructure projects, land development, or resource management) do not occur in protected critical habitat areas.  
   - To provide a clear, enforceable framework for environmental decision-making, in accordance with the recovery strategy and public registry requirements.

### **Implications and Significance**

- **Conservation Focus:** The Order ensures that conservation efforts are targeted at the most biologically significant areas where the Redside Dace depends on specific environmental conditions (e.g., clean, cold, well-oxygenated streams with stable substrates).
  
- **Legal Compliance:** The exclusion of certain areas under subsection 58(2)b ensures the Order complies with the procedural and legal requirements of SARA, particularly regarding the protection of habitat while allowing for necessary human activities.

- **Transparency and Accountability:** By publishing the Order in the Species at Risk Public Registry, the government ensures public access to information, promotes stakeholder engagement, and supports accountability in species recovery efforts.

- **Interagency Collaboration:** The joint action by the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans reflects a coordinated approach to protecting biodiversity, combining expertise in environmental protection and fisheries management.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that formally designates the critical habitat of the endangered Redside Dace, while legally excluding certain areas from protection as required by SARA. It reflects a science-based, transparent, and legally sound approach to species conservation, balancing ecological needs with practical land-use considerations. The Order serves as a foundational step in the recovery of the Redside Dace and reinforces Canada’s commitment to protecting biodiversity under its environmental legislation.
