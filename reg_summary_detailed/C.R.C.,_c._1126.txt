**Detailed Summary of the National Parks Highway Traffic Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *National Parks Highway Traffic Regulations* establish rules governing the operation, parking, and use of motor vehicles and other vehicles (such as bicycles, horses, and all-terrain vehicles) within national parks and certain designated parkways in Canada. These regulations are designed to ensure public safety, preserve natural environments, maintain order, and protect park infrastructure and users.

Importantly, the regulations **apply only in national parks and designated parkways**, and they are **subject to specific exclusions** based on location (e.g., Banff, Jasper, Newfoundland) and type of vehicle or activity.

- **Passenger Vehicle**: Includes automobiles, motorcycles, motorhomes, and trucks with a **gross vehicle weight (GVW) not exceeding 4,550 kg**. Also includes converted buses for camping.
- **Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)**: Total weight of the motor vehicle plus any load.
- **Highway**: Any road, street, avenue, driveway, lane, bridge, or path within a park intended for public vehicle passage or parking.
