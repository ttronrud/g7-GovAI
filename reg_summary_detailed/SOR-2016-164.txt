The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2018-197, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2018-197, section 1**, where "SOR" stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Regulations* (in the context of Canadian federal legislation, particularly under the *Regulations of the Government of Canada*).
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the text, such repeals typically take effect upon the publication of the statutory instrument in the *Canada Gazette*, which occurred in 2018.
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it is **no longer in force** and **cannot be cited or applied** in legal or administrative contexts. Any prior provisions or obligations derived from it are nullified.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the regulation was outdated, redundant, inconsistent with current laws, or superseded by a newer, more effective regulation. Specific reasons are not included in the provided text but would typically be outlined in the explanatory notes or legislative intent of SOR/2018-197.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** described in the text — only a **repeal notice**. The regulation referenced has been **fully removed from the legal framework** as of the date of SOR/2018-197. Therefore, it does not contain any substantive provisions, requirements, or enforcement mechanisms.

> ⚠️ Note: Without additional context (such as the original title or subject matter of the repealed regulation), it is not possible to determine the specific content or scope of the regulation that was repealed. To obtain further details, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2018-197 or its explanatory documents.

If you can provide the original title or subject of the regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of..." or "Regulation on food safety"), I can offer a more targeted summary of what it may have addressed before being repealed.
