---

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed, meaning it is no longer applicable or enforceable under current law.

**2. Repeal Mechanism:**  
The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2010-90**, specifically under **section 701** of that instrument. Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation tools used by Canadian provinces or federal departments to implement laws passed by Parliament or the legislature. In this case, SOR/2010-90 (a provincial regulation) was issued to amend or remove outdated or obsolete rules.

**3. Legal Implications:**  
- Any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are **no longer binding**.  
- Entities (such as businesses, government agencies, or individuals) that previously relied on this regulation must now refer to current, active legislation or regulations that have replaced it.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization or consolidation effort to simplify the legal framework.

**4. Context and Purpose of the Repeal:**  
While the original content of the regulation is not provided, the repetition of the repeal notice suggests that multiple provisions or sections were affected. Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
- Obsolescence (e.g., outdated procedures or standards)
- Redundancy (e.g., overlapping with other rules)
- Inconsistency with current laws or policies
- Better alignment with modern regulatory frameworks

**5. Access to Replacement Provisions:**  
To understand what replaced the repealed regulation, one should consult:
- The full text of **SOR/2010-90** (Statutory Instrument 2010-90)
- The official legislative database (e.g., the Ontario Legislative Assembly website, or the Government of Canada's legislation database)
- Relevant successor regulations or amendments that may now govern the same subject matter

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the repeated entries has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2010-90, section 701**. As such, it is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Legal or administrative actions based on this regulation are now invalid. For current guidance, stakeholders must refer to the updated or replacement regulations that were introduced in the same or subsequent instruments.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Without the original text of the regulation, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., scope, application, penalties) cannot be provided. The current summary is limited to the legal status and implications of the repeal.

If you can provide the original regulation or its subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, licensing, safety), I can offer a more detailed analysis of its former content and purpose.
