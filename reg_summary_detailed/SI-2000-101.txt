**Detailed Summary of the Selkirk First Nation (GST) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make orders that provide for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes in the public interest, particularly when such action is recommended by the Minister of Finance and aligns with broader policy or self-government objectives.

The Order specifically applies to the **Selkirk First Nation** and relates to the **remission of Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was previously paid during a defined period.

---

**2. Legislative Basis**

The Order is grounded in the **Selkirk First Nation Self-Government Agreement**, which was signed on **July 21, 1997**, and as amended on **November 2, 2000**. This agreement is central to the Order because it establishes the framework under which the remission of tax is authorized. The Order refers to the version of the agreement in effect as of November 2, 2000.

Additionally, the Order is informed by **sections 15.7 to 15.11** of the Self-Government Agreement, which outline the specific conditions and provisions under which a refund or remission of tax may be granted. These sections are interpreted as providing the legal basis for the tax remission being granted in this Order.

**3. Definitions**

The Order includes two key definitions:

- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the Selkirk First Nation Self-Government Agreement, as it existed on **November 2, 2000**. This version includes all amendments and modifications made up to that date. The agreement serves as the foundational legal instrument that justifies the tax remission.

- **"Person"**: Defined in accordance with **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**. This definition typically includes individuals, corporations, and other taxable entities as defined in Canadian tax law. In this context, it ensures that only those entities legally recognized under the Excise Tax Act are eligible for the remission.

**4. Scope of the Remission**

The Order grants a **remission of GST** to eligible persons (i.e., entities or individuals within the Selkirk First Nation) for the following:

- **Tax Period**: From **October 1, 1997**, to **October 31, 2000**.
- **Tax Type**: Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is a federal consumption tax under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.
- **Amount of Tax**: The remission applies to the **amount of GST paid** during the specified period, as provided for under **sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**.

This means that the Selkirk First Nation is being granted a formal cancellation of the GST that was previously paid during those years, effectively returning the tax to the entity or individual as a benefit under the self-government agreement.

**5. Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **conditional** and subject to the following key restriction:

> **No refund of that tax is payable under section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act.**

This is a critical safeguard. While the Order allows for the remission of GST, it explicitly **excludes** the possibility of a refund being processed under **section 18.1** of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act. This provision likely ensures that the remission is not double-counted or treated as a refund under a different legal mechanism, maintaining clarity and consistency in the financial and legal treatment of the tax.

In other words, the remission is not a refund under the general refund system, but a specific, authorized cancellation under the self-government agreement.

---

**6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on **November 2, 2000** — the date when the Selkirk First Nation Self-Government Agreement was amended and officially updated. This timing ensures that the remission is implemented in alignment with the formalization of the self-government agreement, reinforcing the connection between the tax relief and the legal recognition of the First Nation’s self-governance status.

---

**7. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council determines that it is in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This reflects a broader policy objective of supporting Indigenous self-governance, recognizing the financial and administrative challenges faced by First Nations in establishing self-administered systems, and promoting equitable treatment in tax matters.

By remitting GST paid during the early years of self-government, the government acknowledges the costs associated with transitioning to self-management and supports the long-term sustainability of First Nation governance structures.

---

**8. Key Implications**

- **Financial Relief**: The Selkirk First Nation receives a direct financial benefit by having GST paid during 1997–2000 forgiven.
- **Self-Governance Support**: The remission is a tangible outcome of the self-government agreement, reinforcing the government’s commitment to partnership and shared responsibility.
- **Legal Clarity**: The Order clearly defines the scope, conditions, and legal basis for the remission, reducing ambiguity in tax treatment.
- **Prevention of Overlap**: The exclusion of section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act prevents potential overlap or confusion with other refund or compensation mechanisms.

**Conclusion**

The *Selkirk First Nation (GST) Remission Order* is a targeted, legally sound, and constitutionally grounded measure that provides financial relief to the Selkirk First Nation by remitting GST paid between October 1, 1997, and October 31, 2000. This remission is authorized under the Self-Government Agreement and is conditional on the absence of any refund under section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act. The Order underscores the federal government’s recognition of Indigenous self-governance and its commitment to supporting First Nations through financial and administrative accommodations. It serves both as a practical benefit and a symbolic affirmation of partnership and equity.
