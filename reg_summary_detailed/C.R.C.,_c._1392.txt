**Detailed Summary of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Regulations* (the "Regulations") provide the detailed framework for how pensions are calculated, managed, and modified for members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), particularly in relation to spousal benefits, pension reductions, and eligibility criteria. These Regulations are enacted under the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* (the "Act") and govern key aspects of pension administration, including service credit, pension elections, actuarial calculations, and the conditions under which pension reductions can be made or revised.

## **Key Definitions and Provisions**

---

### **1. Definitions and Interpretations**

#### **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act*.
- Establishes the legal foundation for pension continuation and related benefits.

#### **"Authorized Advisor"**
- Includes:
  - A member of the RCMP;
  - A person employed in the federal public service;
  - A person whose services were retained by the Minister under the Act.
- These individuals are authorized to provide advice on pension matters and may be held accountable if they provide erroneous or misleading information.

#### **Service as a Special Constable or Provincial Police Officer**
- Any period of service as a **special constable** in the RCMP or as a member of a **provincial police force** that entered into an arrangement with the Governor in Council under **Section 5 of the Act prior to the coming into force of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act** is deemed to be **service in the RCMP** for the purposes of the Act.
- This provision ensures continuity of service credit for individuals who transitioned into the RCMP through formal agreements.

> **Important Exception (Repealed):**  
> A provision stating that such service counts only if the service was continuous and the disability is not eligible under provincial workers’ compensation law was **repealed** by *SOR/2013-125, section 2*. Thus, it no longer applies.

### **10. Calculation of Pension Reduction (Section 17)**

The amount of the pension reduction is calculated as follows:

1. **Calculate the actuarial present value** of:
   - The officer’s pension under Part II of the Act;
   - The supplementary benefits under the *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act* (SRBA).

2. **Convert this value into a joint and survivor pension**:
   - A pension payable during the officer’s lifetime (monthly, starting one month after election);
   - A survivor’s pension payable after the officer’s death (30%, 40%, or 50% of the original pension), also monthly, starting one month after death.

3. **Subtract** the first monthly installment of the survivor’s pension from the first monthly installment of the officer’s pension (as if the officer had not elected).

4. **Adjust the result** to account for:
   - The **lesser of**:
     - The officer’s life expectancy;
     - The spouse’s life expectancy;
     - The duration of the marriage;
   - The **effective month** of the reduction (as per subsection 22(1) or (2));
   - The **annual increase** under Section 18 (i.e., increases in the reduction due to changes in supplementary benefits).

> This ensures that the reduction is not applied beyond the life of the officer, spouse, or marriage.

---

### **11. Annual Adjustment of the Reduction (Section 17)**

- On **January 1 of each year** after the election takes effect, the **reduction amount is increased** by the amount that would be payable as a supplementary benefit under the SRBA **if the reduction were treated as a pension payable under Part II of the Act on the election date**.

> This ensures that the reduction grows with inflation and changes in pension benefits.

### **12. Actuarial Assumptions (Section 17)**

Only the following demographic assumptions apply:
- **
