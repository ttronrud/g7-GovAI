**Detailed Summary of the National Revenue Transfer of Property Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Purpose**  
The *National Revenue Transfer of Property Regulations* are established under **section 52 of the Financial Administration Act**. These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**. The primary purpose of these regulations is to provide a legal framework for the **disposition (i.e., transfer or sale) of specific property** that is under the control, management, and administration of the Minister of National Revenue.

This property consists of **clothing, goods, and uniform accoutrements** that were acquired specifically for use in the **manufacture of uniforms** for personnel employed in the **administration or enforcement of the Customs Act**.

**2. Scope and Definition of Key Terms**

- **Minister**: Refers to the current Minister of National Revenue, who is responsible for overseeing the administration and enforcement of federal tax and customs policies. In this context, the Minister has the authority to act on behalf of the Crown in managing and transferring the specified property.

- **Property**: Defined as clothing, goods, and uniform accoutrements that are:
  - Under the **control, management, and administration** of the Minister of National Revenue;
  - Acquired **specifically for the purpose of manufacturing uniforms**;
  - Intended for use by **persons employed in the administration or enforcement of the Customs Act**.

This definition ensures that only items directly related to uniform production for customs officers are eligible for transfer under these regulations.

**3. Key Provision: Sale of Property**

The central provision of the regulations grants the Minister the authority to:

- **Sell** the designated property (clothing, goods, and uniform accoutrements) to any individual or entity;
- **On the condition** that the purchaser uses the property **exclusively in the manufacture of uniforms for the Crown**;
- Such use must occur under a **contract** entered into between the purchaser and the Crown (i.e., the federal government).

This means that the sale is not a general commercial transaction. The buyer must commit to producing uniforms for Crown employees—specifically those involved in customs operations—ensuring that the property continues to serve its original public purpose.

**4. Implications and Objectives**

- **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: Allows the government to dispose of surplus or obsolete uniform materials that are no longer needed for current use, thereby reducing storage and maintenance costs.
- **Public Accountability**: Ensures that the sale of government property is tied to a clear public purpose—uniform production for customs enforcement staff.
- **Transparency and Oversight**: Requires a formal contract between the buyer and the Crown, ensuring accountability and compliance with government procurement and property management standards.
- **Preservation of Public Purpose**: Prevents the misuse of government property by requiring that any sale results in the continued production of uniforms for Crown employees.

---

**5. Limitations and Conditions**

- The sale is **not open-ended**; it is conditional upon the buyer’s commitment to use the property in the **manufacture of uniforms for the Crown**.
- The buyer must enter into a **valid contract with the Crown** that outlines the terms of use, including specifications, timelines, and quality standards (implied through the requirement of a formal agreement).
- The property must be **directly related to uniform manufacturing** for customs personnel and cannot be sold for general commercial use.

**6. Citation and Reference**

These regulations are officially cited as the **National Revenue Transfer of Property Regulations** and may be referenced in all official documents, legal proceedings, or administrative actions involving the transfer of uniform-related property.

**Conclusion**  
The *National Revenue Transfer of Property Regulations* provide a clear, legally sound mechanism for the Minister of National Revenue to manage and dispose of surplus uniform-related property. By enabling the sale of such items under strict conditions—specifically requiring their use in manufacturing uniforms for customs personnel—the regulations balance fiscal efficiency with public accountability and the continued service of government operations. The regulations ensure that government assets are not merely liquidated for profit, but are instead repurposed to support the essential functions of the Canadian Customs system.
