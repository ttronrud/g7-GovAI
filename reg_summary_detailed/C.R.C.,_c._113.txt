### **Detailed Summary of the St. John’s (Torbay) Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled:  
**"St. John’s (Torbay) Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and serve to establish zoning and land-use restrictions around St. John’s (Torbay) Airport in the Districts of St. John’s East and St. John’s West, Newfoundland and Labrador.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to St. John’s (Torbay) Airport, located in St. John’s East and St. John’s West districts. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation measurements. It is defined in Part I of the Schedule and is **deemed to be at 431 feet above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip 11–29 and 17–35), at a slope of **1 foot vertical to 50 feet horizontal**. It rises to a horizontal line 1,000 feet above the strip end elevation, 50,000 feet horizontally from that end, and ends 8,000 feet from the runway centerline. This surface ensures safe aircraft approach clearance. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **150 feet above the ARP (i.e., 431 + 150 = 581 feet ASL)**. If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, a **30-foot buffer above ground** is applied instead. This surface defines the maximum allowable height for structures and natural features over a wide area around the airport. |
| **Strip** | A designated rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, including runways, used for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. The two main strips are: <br> - **Runway 11–29**: 1,000 ft wide, 8,900 ft long <br> - **Runway 17–35**: 1,000 ft wide, 7,400 ft long <br> Both are centered on their respective runways and extend 500 ft on each side of the centerline. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surface, with a slope of **1 foot vertical to 7 feet horizontal**, extending until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. This ensures safe clearance during aircraft transitions between runways. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to **all lands and adjacent waters** near or around the airport.
- The boundaries of the regulated area are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which describes the outer limits of the airport and its associated land parcels.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are officially part of the airport (e.g., operational runways, taxiways, or active airfield zones) are **exempt** from these zoning restrictions, even if they fall within the broader boundary.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**
No person may:
- Construct or erect any building, structure, or object;
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object;

**on any land subject to these regulations**, if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces at the location:
- The **approach surface**;
- The **outer surface**;
- The **transitional surface**.

This rule ensures that no structure or object (including trees, antennas, or signage) creates a hazard during aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.
- This provision protects aviation safety by preventing overhanging vegetation that could interfere with flight paths.

---

#### **6. Prohibition of Waste Disposal Attracting Birds**
- No owner or occupier may use any land subject to these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** to birds; or
  - **Attractive** to birds.
- This restriction helps prevent bird strikes, which pose a serious threat to aircraft safety.

---

#### **7. Land Boundary Description (Legal Boundary of Regulated Area)**
The regulated land area is precisely defined by a detailed **legal description** in the schedule. The boundary follows a complex, multi-segmented path involving:
- Runway intersections and reference points (e.g., 500 ft SW from a point 1,300 ft SE along runway 17–35, and 24,809.54 ft on a bearing of N. 41°16′34″ W from the “Signal” survey station).
- A series of directional bearings and distances from key landmarks such as:
  - Maunder’s Lane
  - Tupper Street lot lines
  - McDonald Drive
  - Portugal Cove Road
  - Kent’s Pond Subdivision
  - Higgins Line
  - Ridge Road
  - Robert Winton, Robert Hanlon, Anderson’s Pond, Peter F. Murphy, E. J. Squires, George V. Eustace, Michael Rogers, Edward/Richard/George Fields, Whiteway Pond, John Butler, Bullocks Town Road, Torbay Road, Mahons Road, Middle Cove Road, Pine Line, John Roach, Michael Tobin, William Hewitt, John Dyer, Power, and others.

The boundary is **closed**, returning to the **point of beginning**, forming a large polygonal zone surrounding the airport.

> This boundary is **verified and shown** on **Department of Transport Plan No. MT-0451 (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)**, dated **January 6, 1970**.

#### **8. Regulatory Status and Repeal Note**
- The regulation includes a note stating: **"[Revoked, SOR/81-662, s. 1]"**  
  This indicates that the regulation was **formally revoked** by **Statutory Order 81-662**, Section 1, and is **no longer in force** as of that date.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: While the text provided appears to be a historical or archived version of the regulation, the **revocation notice** suggests that **this regulation is no longer active**. Any current zoning or aviation safety rules at St. John’s (Torbay) Airport would now be governed by **updated, current legislation**, possibly under the **Aviation Act**, **Transportation Act**, or **Airport Operations Regulations**, rather than this specific zoning regulation.

### **Summary Table**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | To regulate land use and construction near St. John’s (Torbay) Airport to ensure aviation safety. |
| **Applies to** | All lands and adjacent waters within the defined boundary (Part II of Schedule). |
| **Key Restrictions** | No structures exceeding approach, outer, or transitional surfaces; no bird-attracting waste disposal. |
| **Height Limits** | Based on approach (1:50 slope), outer (150 ft AGL or 30 ft above ground), and transitional (1:7 slope) surfaces. |
| **Boundary** | Precisely defined legal description with over 20 segments and key reference points. |
| **Status** | **Revoked** by SOR/81-662, Section 1. **Not currently in effect.** |

### **Conclusion**
The **St. John’s (Torbay) Airport Zoning Regulations** were a comprehensive set of rules designed to protect aviation safety by controlling the height, location, and use of structures and natural features near the airport. The regulation established precise geometric surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) and clearly defined the land boundaries using detailed survey coordinates.

However, due to the **formal revocation in 1981 (SOR/81-662)**, these regulations are **no longer legally enforceable**. They represent a historical regulatory framework and should not be used as current guidance.

For present-day compliance, stakeholders should refer to:
- Current **Aviation Safety Regulations**
- **Transportation Act** provisions
- **Department of Transportation** current zoning or airport master plans
- **Air Traffic Control and Runway Safety Guidelines**

> ✅ **Final Note**: This document is **historical and superseded**. It is of interest for archival, legal, or planning research but **does not apply today**.
