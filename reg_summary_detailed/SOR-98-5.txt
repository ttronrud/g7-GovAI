### **Detailed Summary of the Licensed Dealers for Controlled Drugs and Narcotics Fees Regulations (1056)**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6 and s. 7(2)*  
*Effective Date: January 1, 1998*  

---

## **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish the **fees and remission provisions** for applicants seeking or renewing a **dealer’s licence** to handle **controlled drugs and narcotics for veterinary use** in Canada. The regulation was made under the authority of:

- **Paragraph 19.1(a)a of the Financial Administration Act** – to set fees for government services.
- **Subsection 23(2.1)b of the Financial Administration Act** – to remit fees in the public interest when appropriate.

The primary goal is to ensure fair, transparent, and equitable fee structures while recognizing the financial hardship faced by small or newly licensed veterinary businesses that operate on limited revenue.

## **2. Definitions (Key Terms)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Controlled drug** | Same meaning as in *Section G.01.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations* — substances regulated due to potential for abuse or harm. |
| **Dealer’s licence** | A licence issued under either: <br> - *Section G.02.007 of the Food and Drug Regulations* (for controlled drugs), or <br> - *Section 10.1 of the Narcotic Control Regulations* (for narcotics). |
| **Dealer’s licence for controlled drugs / narcotics** | *Repealed* by SOR/2011-83, s. 2 — no longer applies. |
| **Narcotic** | Same meaning as in *Section 2 of the Narcotic Control Regulations* — substances like opioids, stimulants, etc., with high potential for abuse. |
| **Package/label** | To place a controlled drug or narcotic into its immediate container or affix an inner or outer label. |
| **Sell** | Includes offering for sale, exposing for sale, having in possession for sale, or distributing — whether or not for consideration. |
| **Site** | Either: <br> - A single building specified in the licence located more than 1 km from any other building in the licence; or <br> - Multiple buildings within 1 km of each other. |

> ⚠️ *Note:* The term “site” is critical because fees are charged per site, not per licence.

## **3. Scope of Application**

### ✅ Applies To:
- Applicants applying for a dealer’s licence **specifically for controlled drugs or narcotics used in veterinary medicine**.

### ❌ Does Not Apply To:
- **Government entities** (federal or provincial branches or agencies).
- **Persons or organizations engaged solely in scientific research or investigation**.

> This regulation **excludes** government operations and purely academic or research activities.

---

## **4. Licence Fees**

### **Standard Fee (for full-year operations):**
- **$1,750 per site**  
  (charged for each site where licensed activities are conducted)

### **Reduced Fee (for applicants not yet completing their first calendar year):**
- **$875 per site**  
  Applies only if the applicant has not completed a full calendar year of licensed activities after receiving the first licence.

> Example: A new veterinary pharmacy opening in January 2023 would pay $875 if it only operates through 2023 and does not complete a full year of operations.

---

## **5. Fee Remission (Exemption from Payment)**

Remission (partial or full waiver) of the fee is granted **only if** the following conditions are met:

### **Conditions for Remission:**
1. The **fee payable exceeds 1.5% of the applicant’s actual gross revenue** from:
   - Sale of controlled drugs and narcotics
   - Testing
   - Packaging or labelling
   *(for the previous calendar year)*

2. The applicant provides a **statement signed by the individual responsible for financial affairs** that details the actual gross revenue.

3. The applicant has **not completed a full calendar year** following the issuance of their first licence — and must submit the statement **within one month after the end of that year**.

4. In **all other cases**, the statement must be submitted **with the renewal application**.

### **Amount of Remission:**
- Equal to the **difference between the fee due and 1.5% of the actual gross revenue**.

> Example:  
> - Standard fee: $1,750  
> - Actual gross revenue: $100,000  
> - 1.5% of $100,000 = $1,500  
> - Fee exceeds threshold → Remission = $1,750 – $1,500 = **$250**

---

## **6. Minister’s Review and Additional Information Requirements**

If the Minister of Health determines the provided revenue statement is **inadequate or insufficient**, the Minister may:

- **Require written additional information** within **90 days** of the request.
- The information must be sufficient to verify actual gross revenue.

### **Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
- **No remission** if:
  - The applicant fails to provide the required information within 90 days; **or**
  - The provided information is still deemed insufficient to determine actual revenue.

> This ensures accountability and prevents fraudulent claims of remission.

---

## **7. Timing of Fee Payment**

### **General Rule:**
- The fee is payable **once the Minister issues a written notice requiring payment**.

### **Special Cases:**

| Case | Payment Deadline |
|------|------------------|
| **Applicant who has not completed their first calendar year** | After the statement under subsection 4(1)(b) is submitted |
| **All other cases** | During the **second month after the end of the calendar year following the issuance of the first licence** |

> This allows flexibility for new applicants who may not have generated significant revenue in their first year.

---

## **8. Exclusion from Remission**

An applicant **is not eligible for remission** if they must also hold an **establishment licence** under **Division 1A of Part C of the Food and Drug Regulations**.

> This exclusion applies because such licences involve broader regulatory obligations (e.g., facility compliance, safety standards), and the fee structure may not be aligned with the remission criteria.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This provision has been **repealed** by SOR/2018-69, s. 85 — **the exclusion no longer applies** as of that date.

> ✅ **Current Status**: The remission exclusion for establishment licence holders is **no longer in force**.

---

## **9. Repealed Provisions (Important Notes)**

Several sections of the original regulation have been **repealed**:

| Repealed Section | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| *Dealer’s licence for controlled drugs / narcotics* | SOR/2011-83, s. 2 — these outdated terms were replaced by the modern "dealer’s licence" definition. |
| *Exclusion of government or scientific research entities* | SOR/2011-83, s. 4 — removed to clarify scope. |
| *Remission exclusion for establishment licence holders* | SOR/2018-69, s. 85 — removed to simplify and modernize the rules. |

> These changes reflect ongoing efforts to **modernize and simplify** the regulatory framework.

---

## **10. Effective Date**

- **January 1, 1998**  
  These regulations came into force on this date, replacing earlier versions.

---

## **Key Takeaways and Practical Implications**

| Feature | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Per-site fee** | Businesses with multiple locations (within 1 km) pay a single fee per site, not per location. |
| **Revenue-based remission** | Only applicants with low revenue relative to the fee qualify — encourages financial transparency. |
| **One-year grace period** | New applicants can pay a reduced fee ($875) if they haven’t completed a full year. |
| **Ministerial review process** | Ensures accuracy and prevents fraud — applicants must provide verifiable financial data. |
| **Exclusion of government/research entities** | Clarifies that only private veterinary dealers are covered. |
| **Modernization** | Removal of outdated terms and exclusions makes the rules more relevant and accessible. |

## **Conclusion**

The *Licensed Dealers for Controlled Drugs and Narcotics Fees Regulations (1056)* provide a **clear, equitable, and transparent fee structure** for veterinary dealers handling controlled substances. By introducing a **revenue-based remission mechanism**, the regulation supports small or new businesses that may not generate substantial income, while maintaining accountability through required financial disclosures.  

Although some provisions have been repealed or updated, the core framework — especially the **per-site fee and remission based on 1.5% of gross revenue** — remains a key tool for balancing regulatory compliance with economic feasibility in the veterinary pharmaceutical sector.

> 🔍 **Best Practice for Applicants**:  
> - Maintain accurate financial records.  
> - Submit revenue statements promptly.  
> - Be prepared to provide additional documentation if requested.
