## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Regulations, 1984**

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**

These regulations were introduced under the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act* (COCD Act) to establish a clear, consistent, and transparent method for determining **Canadian ownership rate** and **control status** of a person or entity in Canada. The goal is to identify whether a foreign entity or individual has a significant level of ownership or control over a Canadian entity — particularly relevant for national security, foreign investment screening, and regulatory oversight.

The 1984 version **revokes the outdated 1982 regulations (P.C. 1982-3929)** and replaces them with a more modern, detailed framework that accounts for complex ownership structures, equity classifications, and market dynamics.

> **Key Purpose**: To determine whether a person (or group of persons) is considered to have a "Canadian ownership rate" of 50% or more — which triggers reporting obligations, control requirements, or other regulatory consequences under the COCD Act.

## 📚 Key Definitions and Concepts

The regulations define numerous terms essential to understanding how ownership is calculated and who qualifies as a "Canadian owner."

| Term | Definition & Context |
|------|------------------------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act*; the legal basis for these regulations. |
| **Entity** | Includes corporations, partnerships, or trusts. The main subject of ownership analysis. |
| **Formal Equity** | Includes shares, rights, or instruments that represent ownership in an entity. Excludes certain non-equity interests (e.g., debt, options). |
| **Forward Equity** | A right to acquire formal equity at a future date (e.g., options or warrants). Treated similarly to formal equity for ownership purposes. |
| **Publicly Traded Class of Formal Equity** | A class of equity that is traded openly in the market (e.g., on a Canadian stock exchange), with prices regularly published. |
| **Recorded Owner** | The name registered in official records (e.g., shareholder register). May not reflect actual beneficial ownership. |
| **Bearer Unit** | A unit with no registered owner — held physically or by possession. These are excluded from calculations. |
| **Measured Block Threshold** | The minimum number of units that must be held to trigger "measured block" status: |
| - **1%** for an applicant or investor directly related to the applicant (equity-related). |
| - **5%** for other investors. |
| If multiple classes exist, the threshold applies to the class with the most units. |
| **Measured Block** | A block of units equal to or greater than the threshold. Units in such blocks are treated as collectively owned by one person for ownership calculations. |
| **Active Member** | An individual receiving benefits from a pension plan (defined benefit or defined contribution). Relevant for pension-related ownership. |
| **Primary Investor** | An investor not equity-related to the applicant who owns equity in the applicant or in an equity-related investor. |
| **Secondary Investor** | An investor not equity-related to the applicant who owns equity in an investor making an inquiry. |
| **Small Applicant** | A Canadian entity with: |
| - Total assets < $50 million; |
| - No reason to believe its Canadian ownership rate would be below 75%; |
| - No public listing or trading outside Canadian exchanges. |
| **Market-Maker Shares** | Units owned by a market-maker (e.g., Toronto Stock Exchange) that constitute ≤ 0.5% of a class — treated as a separate category. |
| **Stock of Responsibility** | A designated class of shares owned by a market-maker for trading purposes. |
| **Equity-Related Persons** | Individuals or entities connected through: |
| - Blood relationship (e.g., siblings, children); |
| - Marriage or adoption; |
| - Direct ownership >50%; |
| - Aggregate ownership >50% in a group of related persons. |
| **Equity-Related Group** | A group where every member is equity-related to every other member. |
| **Unrelated Group** | A group where no such connections exist. |

> ⚠️ **Important**: A person who owns more than 50% in one entity is considered equity-related to themselves in other entities — meaning cross-entity ownership is treated as interconnected.

## 📐 How Ownership Rate is Calculated

The core of the regulations lies in calculating the **Canadian ownership rate** — the percentage of formal equity that is owned by Canadian citizens or residents.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify All Formal Equity Units**  
   All shares, rights, or instruments representing ownership (excluding certain types) are included.

2. **Exclude Specific Units**  
   The following units are **excluded** from the calculation:
   - Shares held by a **dealer acting as underwriter** during a 60-day period after signing an underwriting agreement.
   - **Bearer units** as of February 9, 1982.
   - Units with a **fixed or determinable yield** not exceeding a "reasonable yield" compared to market yields (to avoid overvaluation).
   - Units that, if included, would result in the entity having a total equity percentage of 100% — these are excluded to prevent double-counting.

3. **Determine Ownership Through Unit Holders Lists**  
   Entities maintain a **unit holders list** — a record of registered owners. This list is used to determine who owns how many units.

4. **Aggregation of Units in a "Measured Block"**  
   - If a person has **two or more entries** on the unit holders list for the same class of equity:
     - They are treated as **one entry** if:
       - Same address, no distinguishing features (e.g., account numbers).
       - Different addresses but entity knows units are held by the same person.
       - Different account numbers but same address and entity has reason to believe they belong to the same person.
   - Only entries representing **10% or more of the measured block threshold** are counted.

5. **Threshold Application**  
   - For **equity-related applicants/investors**: threshold = **1%**.
   - For **others**: threshold = **5%**.
   - If multiple classes of equity exist, apply the threshold to the class with the **largest number of units**.

6. **Classification of Equity Interests**  
   - **Partnerships/Trusts**: All substantially similar units form one class of equity.
   - **Corporations**: All shares in the same class (or same series) form one class.
   - **Rights to Income/Revenue or Capital**: If they represent 100% of income or capital, they are treated as **100 units** owned in proportion to each interest holder.

7. **Forward Equity Rules**  
   - Units of forward equity are grouped by:
     - Identical attributes (e.g., same terms, price, date of issue).
     - Issued on the same day and at the same price.

8. **Election to Create New Classes**  
   An applicant or investor can **choose** to treat new units issued after a selected date as a **separate class of equity** — useful for tracking changes over time.

## 🛠️ Entity Responsibilities and Procedures

Entities must maintain and update their **unit holders list** and may prepare a **revised unit holders list** to reflect accurate ownership. The revised list may include:

- Entries where the entity has **no reason to believe** the units are held by someone other than the recorded owner.
- Entries where the number of units is **less than the measured block threshold**.
- Statements of ownership by individuals (especially those with addresses in Canada).
- Any other entry that the entity can **demonstrate is necessary** to show accurate ownership.

> ✅ **Note**: Entities must ensure that their lists reflect actual ownership, not just legal registration.

## 📉 Exclusions and Special Provisions

| Exclusion | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Bearer Units (as of Feb 9, 1982)** | These are untraceable and lack clear ownership records. |
| **Underwriter Shares (60-day window)** | To prevent manipulation during initial public offerings. |
| **Low-Yield Units** | To avoid giving undue weight to units with fixed returns that do not reflect market value. |
| **Units that would make total equity 100%** | Prevents overcounting and ensures realistic ownership percentages. |

> 💡 **Yield Calculation**: For low-yield units, the calculation considers whether the holder would be entitled to **incentives under the Petroleum Incentives Program Act** — if so, the yield is adjusted accordingly.

## 🤝 Equity-Relatedness Rules (Critical for Control Determination)

Ownership is not just about percentage — it’s also about **connections** between parties.

- **Individuals** are considered equity-related if:
  - Related by blood, marriage, or adoption.
- **Entities** are considered equity-related if:
  - One has >50% ownership in both entities.
  - One has >50% in one and is related to someone with >50%
