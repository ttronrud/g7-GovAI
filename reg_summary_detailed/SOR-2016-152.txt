Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Crib, Cradles and Bassinets Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21), enacted under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), as made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Health.

## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

The **Crib, Cradles and Bassinets Regulations** (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish detailed safety standards for cribs, cradles, bassinets, sleep accessories, and related products in Canada. These regulations are designed to protect children from injury during sleep, play, and care by setting strict requirements on design, materials, structural integrity, and performance.

The regulations apply to all **cribs, cradles, bassinets, sleep accessories**, and **stands** (e.g., elevating devices) that are **designed or advertised for use with a child**, including those used for sleeping, changing, or play.

These standards are enforceable under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*, and violations may result in product recalls, fines, or other penalties.

## 📚 Key Definitions

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulation defines several core terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Accessory** | A product (e.g., change table, sleep accessory) designed to be used with a crib/cradle/bassinet. Must support a child’s weight, attach to the product, and serve a primary function: changing diapers, providing sleeping space, or enabling caregiver interaction. |
| **Access Side** | A side of a crib or accessory where the top portion can be adjusted (e.g., raised or lowered). The bottom part is stationary. |
| **Adjustment Position** | A fixed position in which a movable part of an access side is latched or locked. Must not move without deliberate unlocking. |
| **Bassinet** | A product with sides to confine a child, sleeping surface ≤ 4,000 cm², and primary function of providing sleeping accommodation. |
| **Cradle** | A product with sides to confine a child, sleeping surface > 4,000 cm² and ≤ 5,500 cm². |
| **Crib** | A product with sides to confine a child, sleeping surface > 5,500 cm². |
| **Fastener** | Includes both removable fasteners (e.g., zippers, snaps, straps) and permanent ones (e.g., screws, bolts, nails). |
| **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)** | Standards from the OECD (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17) used to evaluate chemical migration from materials. |
| **Key Structural Component** | Critical parts including sides, mattress support, stabilizing bars, structural cover, and stand. |
| **Mattress Support** | The surface that supports the child. In products without a mattress, this is the base. |
| **Occupant Retention Area** | The enclosed space bounded by the sleeping surface and interior sides — where the child sleeps. |
| **Responsible Person** | The manufacturer (if made in Canada) or importer (if imported) — responsible for compliance. |
| **Slat** | A post, bar, rod, or similar structural element in the frame. |
| **Stand** | A device designed to elevate a crib/cradle/bassinet but not to transport a child. |
| **Stationary Side** | A side with no adjustment positions. |
| **Structural Cover** | A removable textile or pliable cover that defines the occupant retention area and attaches via fasteners. |
| **Supplied With** | A stand or mattress designed and sold only with a specific crib/cradle/bassinet from the same manufacturer. |

## 🛡️ Core Safety Requirements

### 1. **Assembly and Assembly Markings**
- **Key structural components** must be designed so that they can only be assembled correctly **one way**, according to manufacturer instructions.
- If multiple assembly methods are possible, **permanent, conspicuous markings** must be present indicating the correct assembly — and these markings must remain visible even when the product is incorrectly assembled.

> ⚠️ Purpose: Prevents unsafe configurations due to improper assembly.

---

### 2. **Lead, Mercury, and Toxic Metal Limits**
- **No more than 90 mg/kg total lead** in any accessible part or surface coating.
- **No compound of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, or barium** if more than **1,000 mg/kg** migrates from the material.
- **No more than 10 mg/kg total mercury**.

> ✅ Testing must follow **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)** as defined by the OECD.

> ⚠️ Applies to **accessible parts** and **surface coatings** (as defined in the Surface Coating Materials Regulations).

> 🔍 Purpose: Prevents toxic exposure from materials that may leach into the environment or come into contact with a child.

---

### 3. **Mattress Support Angle**
- The **angle of the mattress support** must not exceed **7° from the horizontal** in any position.
- Applies to **cribs, cradles, bassinets, sleep accessories, and stands**.

> ⚠️ Prevents dangerous tilting that could lead to falls or injury.

---

### 4. **Swinging or Rocking Restrictions**
- Any product that rocks or swings must:
  - Not rock or swing beyond **20° from the horizontal**.
  - Have an angle at rest of **no more than 7° from horizontal**.

> 🔍 Prevents excessive movement that could cause a child to fall or be injured.

---

### 5. **Prohibited Accessible Parts That Could Cause Injury**
- **No part** of the product (e.g., protruding edges, sharp corners) that:
  - Is located **above the mattress support**,
  - Is **accessible to a child**, and
  - Could cause **shearing or pinching injuries**.

> 🔍 Prevents pinching, crushing, or shearing injuries during sleep or play.

---

### 6. **Side Design Requirements**
- Products must have **only stationary sides and access sides**.
- No other types of sides (e.g., fully movable ones) are allowed.

> ⚠️ Ensures predictable and safe boundary conditions.

---

### 7. **Slat Stability Test (Schedule 1)**
- Slats must **not turn, dislodge, deform, or become damaged** when subjected to a specified test (as outlined in Schedule 1).
> 🔍 Ensures slats remain secure and do not collapse or shift during use.

---

### 8. **Post Height Limitations**
- **No post** may extend more than **1.5 mm above the lowest point on the upper surface of the higher adjoining side** (within 76 mm from outer surface).
- **Exception**: If the product meets the **cut-out test** (per ASTM F1169), posts may extend beyond 406 mm.
- **Removable extensions** on posts must still comply with subsection (2).

> 🔍 Prevents sharp or dangerous protrusions above the sleeping surface.

---

### 9. **Openings and Bounded Openings Test (Schedule 2)**
- A **solid block (60 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm)** must **not pass through any completely bounded opening** when tested in the following ways:
  - **Section 1 & 3**: For products with **rigid sides**.
  - **Section 2 & 4**: For products with **textile/pliable sides**.

> 🔍 Prevents children from slipping through gaps in sides or covers.

> 📌 Applies to both **cribs** and **cradles/bassinets/accessories**.

---

### 10. **Structural Cover Restrictions**
- A **structural cover** must not create or expose any completely bounded opening that allows a **60 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm block** to pass through — whether in rigid or pliable side products.

> 🔍 Ensures that covers do not create dangerous gaps.

---

### 11. **Mesh Safety (Schedule 3 & 4)**
- **Mesh** (textile or pliable material) used in sides or bottom must:
  - **Not tear or detach** during testing (Schedule 3).
  - Have **openings too small** for a **hemispherical probe** (as described in Schedule 4) to pass through.

> 🔍 Prevents children from getting caught or injured in mesh.

---

### 12. **Flame Resistance (CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.5)**
- All textile or pliable materials must have a **flame spread time > 7 seconds** under either of these conditions:
  - No raised fiber surface; or
  - Raised fiber surface with ignition or fusion of base fibers.

> 🔍 Prevents rapid fire spread in case of ignition.

---

### 13. **Catch-Test (Schedule 5)**
- **Instrument test** (as illustrated in Schedule 5) must not catch on:
  - Any **mechanism, fastener, or projection** above the mattress support (for cribs/stands).
  - Any **projection inside the occupant retention area** (for cradles/bassinets/accessories).

> 🔍 Prevents entrapment or
