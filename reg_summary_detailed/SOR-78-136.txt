The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of 2017, published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on March 29, 2017 (SOR/2017-84)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** and no longer in force.
- **Repeal Date**: The repeal took effect on **March 29, 2017**, as part of the official publication of SOR/2017-84.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of the original regulation was specifically repealed.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact original purpose of the regulation is not detailed in your input, repeals of this nature typically occur when:
  - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - A more comprehensive or updated regulation has been introduced.
  - Legislative amendments or policy changes rendered the regulation obsolete or inconsistent with current law.
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation no longer apply. Legal or administrative entities must refer to current, active regulations for compliance.

### Important Notes:
- The repetition of the same line seven times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error. In official legal databases, such repetitions are not standard and may indicate a technical glitch or misrepresentation.
- The fact that it is listed multiple times with identical repealing information does not alter the legal outcome — the regulation remains repealed regardless of how many times it is listed.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, and is **no longer in effect**. It should not be cited or applied in any legal, administrative, or compliance context. For current regulations, one should consult the official list of active statutes and regulations published by the Government of Canada.

> ✅ Recommendation: Users should consult the official Canada Gazette or the legislation database (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)) to verify current active regulations and avoid relying on repealed provisions.
