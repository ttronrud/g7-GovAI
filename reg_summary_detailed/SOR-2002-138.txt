### **Detailed Summary of the Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Regulations (2001)**

The **Moose Jaw Airport Zoning Regulations**, made under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* (specifically subsections 5.4(2) and 5.5(1)a), were officially enacted on **April 7, 2001**, following a public notice and opportunity for stakeholder input. These regulations establish strict spatial and environmental controls around Moose Jaw Airport in Saskatchewan to ensure the safety, efficiency, and integrity of aviation operations.

---

## **I. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**: The regulations are made pursuant to:
  - **Section 5.5(1)a** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which requires publication of proposed zoning regulations in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in local newspapers to allow public comment.
  - **Section 5.4(2)**, which authorizes the Minister of National Defence (Minister) to adopt such regulations after public consultation.

- **Notice and Public Participation**:
  - The proposed regulations were published in **two successive issues** of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (March 31 and April 7, 2001).
  - They were also published in local newspapers:
    - *Moose Jaw Times Herald* (March 23 and 24, 2001)
    - *Regina Leader Post* (April 6 and 7, 2001)
  - This provided a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, municipalities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations to the Minister.

- **Final Adoption**: After review and public feedback, the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, **formally adopted** the regulations.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the Moose Jaw Airport located in the Municipality of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Zoning Reference Point (AZRP)** | A fixed point at **573.02 meters above sea level**, located at the beginning of runway 10L–28R on the centerline of the runway. This serves as the elevation benchmark for all other surfaces. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runways (strips), designed to ensure safe aircraft approach paths. They slope at specific gradients (1:60 initially, then 1:50) and extend up to 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane set at **45 meters above the AZRP elevation** (i.e., 573.02 + 45 = 618.02 m ASL). Where this plane would be below 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic constraints. |
| **Strip** | A 300-meter-wide, rectangular area (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline) designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Three strips are defined: 10L–28R, 10R–28L, and 03–21. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 gradient** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), extending from the lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces up to the outer surface or adjacent transitional surfaces. |

## **III. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including **public road allowances**.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part 7 of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are part of the airport itself are **not covered** by these regulations.

> **Note**: The regulation applies to all land use, development, and natural features within the designated perimeter.

---

## **IV. Prohibitions on Development and Land Use**

### **1. Building and Structure Restrictions**
No person may:
- Place, erect, construct, or permit the construction of any **building, structure, or object** (including additions) on regulated land **if the highest point** of that object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This ensures that no structures—such as towers, hills, or rooftops—interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

### **2. Natural Growth Restrictions**
No owner or lessee may permit **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to exceed:
- The elevation of any of the above surfaces **at the location of the object**.
- This includes preventing tree overgrowth that could create visual or physical hazards during flight operations.

> Example: A tree growing beyond the outer surface is prohibited, even if it's not a man-made structure.

### **3. Interference with Aeronautical Communications**
No land use may be permitted that could:
- Cause **interference with radio or communication signals** used by air traffic control or aircraft.
- This includes electromagnetic emissions, noise, or signal-blocking features.

> Purpose: To maintain reliable and secure communication between pilots and air traffic control.

### **4. Restrictions on Land Use to Reduce Bird Hazards**

To minimize **bird hazards** to aviation, the following land uses are **prohibited** unless otherwise approved:

- Sanitary landfills  
- Food garbage disposal sites  
- Sewage lagoons  
- Open water storage reservoirs  

> **Exception**: Open water storage reservoirs may be permitted **only under the following conditions**:
> - The **total surface area does not exceed 1 hectare**; or  
> - For **dry ponds** (non-permanent water bodies), if:
>   - Measures are taken to **reduce bird hazards** (e.g., fencing, netting, water management), **and**
>   - **Ministerial approval** is obtained for any use **exceeding 48 hours per calendar year**.

> This allows limited temporary water storage (e.g., for irrigation or emergency use) while minimizing risk to aviation safety.

## **V. Description of Runway Strips and Approach Surfaces**

### **Strip Dimensions (from the 1997 Zoning Plan, E.3054)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| 10L–28R | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 2,656.25 m |
| 10R–28L | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 2,339.10 m |
| 03–21 | 300 m (150 m on each side) | 1,156.32 m |

> These strips define the active areas for aircraft operations and determine the boundaries of the approach and transitional surfaces.

---

### **Approach Surfaces (by Runway Approach)**

Each approach surface is a **two-stage inclined plane**:
1. **Initial slope**: 1:60 (1 meter vertical per 60 meters horizontal) from the runway end to the outer surface.
2. **Secondary slope**: 1:50 (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal) to a **horizontal imaginary line** located:
   - 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end,
   - 2,400 meters from the runway centerline (on each side),
   - At a height of **291.0 to 291.7 meters above the elevation at the runway end** (depending on the approach).

> These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear, unobstructed path during approach, especially in low visibility or adverse weather.

---

### **Transitional Surfaces**

- Extend from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces.
- Slope at **1:7** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend upward and outward until they meet the **outer surface** or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.
- Prevents obstructions near the edges of runways from affecting aircraft during approach or departure.

---

### **Outer Surface**

- A **common horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the AZRP** (573.02 m ASL → 618.02 m ASL).
- **Exception**: Where the plane would fall below **9 meters above ground**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to avoid impractical or unsafe constraints.

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or vegetation over the entire regulated area.

---

## **VI. Geographic Boundaries (Legal Description)**

The outer limits of the regulated lands are defined by a detailed **legal description** in **Part 7 of the Schedule**, using **survey references and section boundaries** (Township, Range, Sections, Parcels, Plans, Road Allowances).

### **Key Elements of the Boundary Description**

- Begins at the **Northeast corner of Section 28, T15R26W**.
- Traverses through:
  - Section 28, Section 30, Section 36, Section 35, Section 25, Section 23, Section 22, Section 21, Section
