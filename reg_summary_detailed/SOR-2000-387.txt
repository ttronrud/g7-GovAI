### **Regulation Summary: National Parks Wilderness Area Declaration Regulations**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- **Governing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
- **Recommendation**: Made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**  
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **subsection 5(8)a of the National Parks Act**  
- **Statutory Reference**: *R.S., c. 39 (4th Supp.), s. 3(2)*  
  - This refers to the *National Parks Act* as amended, specifically section 3(2), which authorizes the declaration of certain areas as wilderness within national parks.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **formally designate specific regions within designated national parks of Canada as "wilderness areas"**.  
These designations are based on the principle that the areas either:
- Already exist in a **natural state**, or  
- Have the **potential to return to a natural state** through appropriate management and conservation efforts.

This recognition supports the preservation of ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural processes, in accordance with Canada’s environmental and conservation objectives.

#### **3. Scope and Application**
- The regulation applies to **specific regions** identified in the **administrative map plans** included in the schedule.
- Each region is identified by:
  - A **number** (in column 2 of the schedule), which corresponds to a specific area on the map.
  - A **national park** (in column 1 of the schedule), which contains the designated wilderness area.
- The declaration is **geographically specific**, meaning only those regions listed in the schedule are affected.

#### **4. Definition of "Wilderness Area"**
Under this regulation, a wilderness area is defined as:
> A region that:
> - Exists in a **natural state**, or  
> - Is **capable of returning to a natural state**  
> within the boundaries of a national park.

This definition emphasizes **ecological integrity**, **minimal human impact**, and **natural processes** such as fire, succession, and species migration.

#### **5. Key Provisions**
- **Declaration of Status**: The areas listed in the schedule are **officially declared** as wilderness areas within the named national parks.
- **Legal Effect**: Once declared, these areas are subject to **special protection and management standards** under the National Parks Act, which typically include:
  - Restrictions on development, logging, mining, or other extractive activities.
  - Prohibitions on permanent infrastructure or human habitation.
  - Emphasis on ecological monitoring and preservation of natural processes.
- **No Development**: The designation implies that these areas are **off-limits to commercial or industrial development**, unless explicitly permitted under special circumstances.

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.  
- This ensures immediate legal effect upon publication, allowing for prompt implementation of conservation measures.

#### **7. List of Designated Areas (Schedule Reference)**
While the full list of regions is not provided in the text, the numbers listed (e.g., 83937, 83938, ..., 98221, 88832, 88833) represent **unique identifiers** for the wilderness areas in the schedule.  
These numbers correspond to:
- **Column 1**: The name or identifier of the national park (e.g., Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, etc.)
- **Column 2**: The map number or administrative region within that park.

Note: The list appears to contain a mix of numbers, some of which may be duplicates or errors (e.g., repeated numbers, gaps), but these are likely part of a larger administrative or mapping system. A full interpretation would require access to the actual schedule and map plans.

#### **8. Implications and Significance**
- **Conservation Value**: The designation strengthens Canada’s commitment to protecting ecologically significant, undisturbed natural landscapes.
- **Policy Alignment**: This regulation aligns with broader federal environmental policies, including the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act* and the *Canada National Parks Act*, which promote sustainable stewardship of natural heritage.
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Indigenous communities, environmental groups, researchers, and recreational users may be affected, particularly in terms of access and land use.

### **Conclusion**
The *National Parks Wilderness Area Declaration Regulations* formally establish specific regions within designated national parks as protected wilderness areas. These areas are defined by their natural state or potential to return to it, and they are protected under the National Parks Act. The regulation enhances Canada’s conservation framework by legally recognizing and safeguarding ecologically intact or recoverable natural landscapes. It comes into force upon registration and is a key tool in preserving Canada’s natural heritage for future generations.
