---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*Regulations Prescribing Registrants Who Make Supplies of Intangible Personal Property on Behalf of Artists*  
**Citation:** S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12  
**Status:** **Repealed** – SOR/2014-248, s. 2  
**Effective Date:** Originally enacted in 1990; officially repealed on April 1, 2014

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation was designed to identify and list specific organizations—collective management organizations (CMOs)—that are authorized to act as **registrants** under the *Excise Tax Act* for the purpose of making **supplies of intangible personal property** on behalf of artists.

More specifically, the regulation establishes that these designated organizations are **prescribed registrants** under **subsection 177(2)** of the *Excise Tax Act*. This means they are recognized by the federal government as entities that represent artists in the licensing and distribution of their intellectual property (such as music, visual art, and performance rights), and thus are subject to excise tax registration obligations in a particular way—particularly in relation to the supply of intangible personal property.

---

### **Key Legal Basis**

- The regulation was made under **subsection 277(1) of the Excise Tax Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to issue regulations prescribing registrants for specific purposes.
- It applies to **supplies of intangible personal property**, which includes rights to artistic works such as:
  - Musical compositions
  - Visual artworks
  - Performances
  - Audiovisual content
- The supply is made **on behalf of artists**, meaning these organizations act as intermediaries between artists and users (e.g., broadcasters, streaming services, retailers) who use the artists' works.

---

### **Scope and Application**

The regulation **prescribes a list of organizations** that are recognized as registrants for the purposes of **subsection 177(2)** of the *Excise Tax Act*. This means:

- These organizations are **exempt from certain excise tax obligations** or are treated differently in terms of registration and reporting, because they are acting as **collective agents** for artists.
- They are **not considered to be making direct supplies** of intangible property to end users; instead, they are **collecting and distributing royalties** on behalf of artists.
- The tax treatment of such supplies is adjusted to reflect the **collective management nature** of the activity.

### **Repeal and Current Status**

- This regulation was **repealed on April 1, 2014**, by **SOR/2014-248, section 2**.
- The repeal means that the **specific list of prescribed registrants under this 1990 regulation no longer applies**.
- The repeal likely reflects a broader **restructuring of the excise tax regime** or a shift in how the government treats collective management organizations (CMOs) under the *Excise Tax Act*.
- The **current tax treatment of intangible personal property supplies** may now be governed by updated regulations or amendments to the *Excise Tax Act* or other related legislation (e.g., the *Copyright Act*, *Taxation Act*, or *Harmonized Sales Tax* framework).

---

### **Implications of the Repeal**

1. **No longer applies as a legal basis** for determining which organizations are prescribed registrants under subsection 177(2).
2. The **specific list of organizations** is no longer valid for tax registration or compliance purposes.
3. Organizations listed in the original regulation may now need to determine their **tax classification** based on current rules, potentially requiring new assessments or guidance from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
4. The CRA may now apply a **different framework** for determining whether a supply of intangible personal property is made on behalf of artists—possibly based on the nature of the organization, its activities, or its contractual relationships with artists.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation was a key tool in the federal government’s approach to **taxing the supply of intangible personal property** in the arts and media sectors. It formally recognized major **copyright collective management organizations** as prescribed registrants, allowing them to operate under a more favorable tax regime due to their representative role.

However, **the regulation is now repealed**, and its provisions are no longer in force. As such, it does not currently govern excise tax registration or compliance in Canada. Any current tax obligations related to the supply of intangible personal property by artists’ representatives must be assessed under **current legislation**, including the *Excise Tax Act* as amended and guidance issued by the Canada Revenue Agency.

---

**Recommendation for Users:**  
When assessing tax obligations related to artist rights or licensing, stakeholders should refer to **current CRA guidance**, the **updated Excise Tax Act**, and **regulations issued after 2014**, rather than relying on this 1990 regulation. For accurate compliance, consult official CRA publications or seek legal or tax advice.
