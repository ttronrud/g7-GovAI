**Detailed Summary of the Safe Containers Convention Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Safe Containers Convention Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Safe Containers Convention Regulations") are a set of Canadian regulations enacted under the *Safe Containers Convention Act* to implement the **International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC)**. These regulations establish mandatory safety standards for containers used in international maritime transport and ensure their safe design, construction, maintenance, inspection, and repair.

The regulations were first proposed and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **January 23, 1982**, providing interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the Minister of Transport. Following this public consultation, the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, adopted the regulations under subsection 3(1) of the Safe Containers Convention Act.

These regulations apply to **new and existing containers** used in international transport, **excluding those specially designed for air transport**.

### **Safety Approval Plate Requirement (Section 3)**

Every container must be:
- **Approved and examined** in accordance with **Annex I and Annex II** of the Convention.
