**Detailed Summary of the Subsidiaries Holding Bank Shares (Banks) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Subsidiaries Holding Bank Shares (Banks) Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **paragraph 559(h) of the Bank Act**. These regulations came into effect on **June 1, 1992**, and are intended to provide flexibility in the ownership structure of banks by allowing certain subsidiaries to hold shares in their parent bank, under specific conditions.

The regulations are formally cited as the **Subsidiaries Holding Bank Shares (Banks) Regulations** and are part of the broader regulatory framework governing the operations and governance of Canadian banks under the *Bank Act*.

**Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the regulations define several key terms:

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary federal legislation that regulates banking institutions in Canada. This regulation operates within the framework established by the Act.

2. **Distribution**  
   Defined as "distribution" under **subsection 273(3) of the Bank Act**. This refers to the issuance or sale of shares of a bank to the public, including public offerings, private placements, or any form of share issuance that results in the transfer of ownership.

3. **Regulated Securities Entity**  
   A financial institution whose primary business is engaging in securities trading and that is subject to regulatory oversight in its securities activities. Regulation may come from:
   - An Act of Parliament,
   - A provincial legislature, or
   - Foreign laws governing securities.

This definition is crucial because it identifies which types of subsidiaries are eligible to hold shares in a bank.

**Main Provision: Permitted Shareholding by Subsidiaries**

Under **paragraph 70(c) of the Bank Act**, subject to the conditions in **Section 4**, a bank may allow a subsidiary that qualifies as a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares of the bank — **provided** that:

> The **aggregate value** of shares of the bank held by all such subsidiaries (excluding shares referred to in **Section 72 of the Bank Act**) does **not exceed 1% of the bank’s regulatory capital**.

**Key Points of this Provision:**

- **Eligible Subsidiaries**: Only subsidiaries that are *regulated securities entities* may hold shares.
- **Aggregate Limit**: The total value of shares held by all such subsidiaries (collectively) must not exceed **1% of the bank’s regulatory capital**.
- **Exclusion Clause**: Shares mentioned in **Section 72 of the Bank Act** (which typically refers to shares held by the bank’s parent, directors, or certain internal entities) are **excluded** from the 1% cap.
- **Purpose**: This limit is designed to maintain the independence of the bank’s ownership structure, prevent excessive concentration of control, and protect the stability and integrity of the banking system.

**Exception: Shareholding During a Share Distribution**

A significant exception exists when a subsidiary of the bank is acting as a **securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution of shares** (e.g., an initial public offering or a share issuance to the public).

In such cases:

> The bank may permit the subsidiary to hold shares of the bank **in excess of the 1% limit** set in Section 3 (i.e., the 1% cap), **until the distribution is completed**.

**Key Points of the Exception:**

- The exception applies **only** when the subsidiary is acting as a **securities underwriter**.
- The underwriting role must be directly related to the **distribution of shares** of the bank.
- The temporary over-limit holding is **not permanent** — it ends once the distribution is concluded.
- This provision recognizes that underwriters often need to hold shares temporarily to support market stability, ensure fair pricing, or meet underwriting obligations during share offerings.

**Regulatory Objectives and Rationale**

The purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Allow flexibility** in the corporate structure of banks by enabling subsidiaries engaged in securities activities to participate in ownership.
2. **Preserve bank stability and independence** by imposing a strict cap (1%) on subsidiary shareholding to avoid conflicts of interest or undue influence.
3. **Support market participation** by permitting underwriters to hold shares temporarily during share issuances, which can improve market confidence and ensure smooth distribution processes.
4. **Align with international practices** in financial regulation, where similar provisions allow regulated securities entities to hold bank shares under defined limits.

**Conclusion**

The *Subsidiaries Holding Bank Shares (Banks) Regulations* represent a targeted and balanced approach to regulating ownership within banking groups. They:

- Permit regulated securities subsidiaries to hold bank shares, **subject to a strict 1% cap** on aggregate holdings,
- Allow **temporary over-limit holdings** during share distributions when a subsidiary acts as a securities underwriter,
- Are grounded in the *Bank Act* and designed to protect the financial stability and integrity of the banking system.

These regulations remain relevant as part of Canada’s ongoing efforts to balance operational flexibility with prudential oversight in the financial sector.
