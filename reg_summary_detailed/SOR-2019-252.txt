**Detailed Summary of the Environmental Response Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Environmental Response Regulations*, made under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, establish a comprehensive framework to prevent and respond to oil pollution incidents involving vessels and oil handling facilities in Canada. These regulations are designed to protect the marine environment, particularly sensitive ecosystems and communities, by mandating strict operational procedures, emergency preparedness, and accountability for oil-handling activities.

These regulations were adopted through a series of statutory amendments and are currently in force as of **June 25, 2019**, with specific provisions governing the notification, planning, response, and review of oil pollution prevention and emergency plans.

---

## **1. Legal Authority and Legislative Basis**

The regulations are made under the authority of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, specifically:

- **Paragraphs 35(1)(d), (e)a, and (f)a** – Authority to regulate environmental response.
- **Subsection 182(1)b** – Powers to prescribe conditions for oil handling operations.
- **Paragraphs 244(f)c and (h)d** – Powers to establish requirements for oil pollution prevention and emergency response.

These provisions empower the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to prescribe rules related to oil pollution prevention and emergency response, including notification timelines, operational standards, and emergency planning requirements.

## **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*.
- **Area of Environmental Sensitivities**: A location containing:
  - Threatened, vulnerable, or endangered species;
  - Cultural or high socio-economic significance (e.g., Indigenous lands, protected habitats).

## **3. Classes of Vessels Subject to Regulations**

The following vessels are subject to the oil pollution prevention and emergency response requirements under **subsection 167(1)** of the Act:

| Class | Criteria |
|------|--------|

| **Other Vessels** | 400 GT or more that carry oil as cargo or fuel |
| **Towing/Pushing Vessels** | Any vessel (including non-oil tankers) that is towing or pushing another vessel carrying oil as cargo or fuel, **if the combined GT is 150 GT or more** |

### **Exclusions**
The following vessels are **not covered**:
- Foreign vessels **only transiting** through Canadian territorial sea or exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and not engaged in loading/unloading oil.
- **Pleasure craft** (non-commercial recreational vessels).
- **Government vessels**, **naval auxiliaries**, or vessels owned/operated by a foreign state used solely for non-commercial government service.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The regulations **do not apply** to vessels operating **north of latitude 60°N**, which includes the Arctic region.

## **5. Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (OPEP)**

The operator must also prepare an **Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (OPEP)** that outlines how the facility will respond to a discharge of oil. This plan must include:

### **Core Requirements of the OPEP:**

1. **Incident Response Procedures**  
   - Step-by-step actions to respond to an oil spill.

2. **Oil Pollution Scenarios**  
   - For facilities **south of 60°N**:
     - Class 1 (e.g., small facility): ≥1 m³ discharge
     - Class 2: ≥5 m³
     - Class 3: ≥15 m³
     - Class 4 (large facility): ≥50 m³  
   - For facilities **north of 60°N**:
     - Scenario based on **maximum possible discharge of up to 10,000 tonnes** (the prescribed maximum quantity).

3. **Assumptions and Factors Considered**  
   - Nature of oil product
   - Types of vessels involved
   - Tides, currents, and weather conditions
   - Proximity to environmental sensitivities
   - Measures to minimize environmental damage
