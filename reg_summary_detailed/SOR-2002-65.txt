**Detailed Summary of the CIFTA Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is based on **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which authorizes the government to make remission orders to provide relief from customs duties under specific conditions.
- The Order is formally published as **Statutory Instrument 1997, Chapter 36**.

---

### **2. Definition of "Goods"**
- The term **"goods"** is specifically defined in the Order as:
  > *Goods that would have been eligible for the Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff rate of duty as of December 31, 1997, had they been imported on that date, but are not eligible for that rate of duty if imported on or after January 1, 2002.*

- In simpler terms:
  - These are goods that **would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada-Israel Agreement (CIFTA)** on **December 31, 1997**, meaning they were eligible for a reduced or zero duty rate under that agreement at that time.
  - However, **after January 1, 2002**, the CIFTA tariff rate was **no longer available** for these goods due to changes in trade agreements or implementation timelines.
  - Therefore, the goods are now subject to higher duty rates under the standard Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) or General Preferential Tariff (GPT) rates.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Remission Order**
- The Order provides a **customs duty remission** (i.e., a refund or reduction of duties) for goods imported between **January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002**, which were previously eligible for the CIFTA tariff rate but are now subject to higher duties due to the termination or suspension of that rate.

---

### **4. Calculation of Remission Amount**
- The amount of duty remitted is equal to the **difference between two duty amounts**:
  1. **The customs duties payable at the time of import** (i.e., the MFN or GPT rate applicable on or after January 1, 2002).
  2. **The customs duties that would have been payable at the CIFTA rate** — as if the goods had qualified for that rate on January 1, 2002.

- Mathematically:
  > **Remission Amount = (MFN/GPT Duty Rate on Jan 1, 2002) – (CIFTA Duty Rate on Jan 1, 2002)**

- The calculation is based on the **Customs Tariff and its regulations as they existed on January 1, 2002** — not the current rates or future changes.

- This ensures that the remission is retroactively calculated based on the **prevailing tariff structure at the cutoff date (January 1, 2002)**, preserving fairness and consistency.

---

### **5. Conditions for Claiming Remission**
- A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue** within **four years** of the date the goods were imported.
- This four-year window is a strict deadline and applies regardless of whether the claim is filed immediately or later.
- Failure to file within this period results in **loss of entitlement** to the remission.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws).
- Registration is the formal step that makes the Order legally enforceable.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Context**
- **Historical Background**: The Canada-Israel Agreement (CIFTA) was a trade agreement that provided preferential tariff treatment for certain goods imported from Israel into Canada. The agreement was likely phased out or modified after December 31, 1997, leading to the loss of eligibility for these goods after January 1, 2002.
- **Purpose**: This remission order serves as a **compensatory measure** to prevent importers from bearing the full financial impact of losing access to a previously available, lower-duty rate due to changes in trade policy.
- **Scope**: Applies only to goods that **would have qualified for CIFTA on December 31, 1997**, and those imported **between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002**.
- **Limitation**: The remission does not apply to goods imported before January 1, 2002, nor after December 31, 2002.

---

### **8. Key Takeaways for Importers and Stakeholders**
- Importers of eligible goods during the 2002 period may be entitled to a **duty refund** equal to the difference between the CIFTA rate and the applicable MFN/GPT rate on January 1, 2002.
- A **claim must be submitted within four years** of importation — this is a critical deadline.
- The remission is **not automatic** and requires proactive application to the Minister of National Revenue.
- The calculation is based on **tariff rates as of January 1, 2002**, ensuring consistency and predictability.

### **Conclusion**
This CIFTA Remission Order is a targeted, time-limited legislative measure designed to **compensate importers** who lost access to preferential tariff treatment under the Canada-Israel Agreement after its effective end date. It ensures fairness by refunding the difference in duty paid due to the loss of the CIFTA rate, while imposing a clear deadline for claims and limiting the scope to specific goods and a defined timeframe. It reflects the Canadian government’s commitment to managing trade transitions and supporting economic stability during shifts in international trade agreements.
