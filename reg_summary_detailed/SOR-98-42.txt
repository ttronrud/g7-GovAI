**Detailed Summary of the *Used or Second-hand Motor Vehicles Regulations*, S.C. 1997, c. 36**

---

### **Overview**

The *Used or Second-hand Motor Vehicles Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 36) are a set of rules made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **subparagraph 132(1)(m)(ii)** of the *Customs Tariff*. These regulations establish specific exemptions from standard customs duties and import restrictions for certain used or second-hand motor vehicles.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **allow the importation of used vehicles without paying customs duties or being subject to full tariff obligations**, under defined and limited circumstances. This promotes practicality, economic efficiency, and fairness in cases where new vehicles are not feasible or available, particularly in specialized or personal contexts.

These regulations **come into force on January 1, 1998**, and are intended to apply only to motor vehicles that meet specific eligibility criteria.
