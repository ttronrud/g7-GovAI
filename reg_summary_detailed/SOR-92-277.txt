**Detailed Summary of the Life Companies Borrowing Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 47)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Life Companies Borrowing Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Insurance Companies Act* (*Act*), establish the regulatory framework governing the debt obligations of life insurance companies in Canada. These regulations were enacted on **June 1, 1992**, and are designed to ensure that life companies maintain financial stability by limiting their exposure to debt relative to their total assets.

The regulations are primarily aimed at implementing **subsection 473(1)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*, which sets a cap on the total debt obligations of life companies as a percentage of their total assets. This regulatory measure helps protect policyholders and ensures that life insurers remain solvent and financially sound.

### **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada. All provisions in these regulations are interpreted within the context of this Act.

2. **"Prescribed Subsidiary"**  
   A subsidiary of a life company is considered a *prescribed subsidiary* if:
   - It is a subsidiary of the life company; **and**
   - It is **not** a financial institution that is not engaged in insuring risks.  
   
   *Exclusion*: Subsidiaries that are financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit unions) not involved in the business of insuring risks are excluded from being considered prescribed subsidiaries.  
   → This ensures that only subsidiaries directly involved in insurance or related activities are included in debt obligation calculations.

3. **"Debt Obligation"**  
   Defined in accordance with **subsection 2(1)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*.  
   → This means any liability or obligation of a company to pay money in the future, such as loans, bonds, notes, or other forms of indebtedness.

4. **"Aggregate of Total Debt Obligations"**  
   The total debt obligations of a life company consist of:
   - The debt obligations of the life company itself; **plus**
   - The debt obligations of its **prescribed subsidiaries** that are **not held by the life company**.  
   
   *Important Note*: Debt obligations of prescribed subsidiaries that are *owned or held by the life company* are not included in the calculation. This prevents double-counting and focuses on external liabilities.

5. **"Total Assets"**  
   For a life company at a particular time, total assets mean:
   - The sum of the assets that would appear on the company’s balance sheet **as at that time**,  
     prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out in **subsection 331(4)** of the *Insurance Companies Act* (i.e., the Superintendent’s prescribed accounting standards),  
   **minus**  
   - The assets of any subsidiary that is **not a prescribed subsidiary** (i.e., non-insurance financial institutions).  
   
   → This definition ensures that only relevant, insurance-related assets are included in the calculation of the asset base, while excluding non-insurance subsidiaries from the asset pool.

6. **"Prescribed Percentage"**  
   The maximum allowable ratio of a life company’s total debt obligations to its total assets is **20%**.  
   → This means that at any given time, a life company may not have more than **20% of its total assets** committed to debt obligations.

### **Regulatory Purpose and Scope**

- **Objective**: To prevent life insurance companies from taking on excessive debt, which could threaten their financial stability and, ultimately, the security of policyholders.
- **Applicability**: Applies to **life companies** and their **prescribed subsidiaries**.
- **Limitation**: The 20% debt-to-asset ratio applies only to **debt obligations not held by the parent company** in its own balance sheet. This allows life companies to hold debt in subsidiaries (e.g., for investment or operational purposes) without exceeding the cap, as long as the total debt (including subsidiary debt) does not exceed 20% of total assets.

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

| Provision | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Debt Cap (20%)** | Ensures financial prudence by capping debt at 20% of total assets. This acts as a buffer against financial distress. |
| **Exclusion of Non-Insurance Subsidiaries** | Prevents the inclusion of non-insurance financial institutions (e.g., banks) in the asset pool, ensuring accuracy and relevance. |
| **Inclusion of Subsidiary Debt** | Allows life companies to leverage subsidiaries for financing, but only if the total debt (parent + subsidiary) remains within the 20% limit. |
| **Accounting Standards** | Requires use of the Superintendent’s prescribed accounting standards, ensuring consistency and transparency in financial reporting. |

### **Legal Basis**

These regulations are made under the authority of:
- **Subsection 2(1)** of the *Insurance Companies Act* – definition of "debt obligation"
- **Subsection 473(1)** – establishes the requirement for a debt-to-asset ratio
- **Section 703** – provides the authority for the Minister of Finance to issue regulations on debt obligations

The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, reflecting a standard process for regulatory development in Canadian insurance law.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Life Companies Borrowing Regulations* provide a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework to manage the financial risk associated with debt in life insurance companies. By defining what constitutes a "debt obligation," identifying which subsidiaries are included, and setting a strict 20% debt-to-asset ratio, the regulations promote financial stability, protect policyholders, and ensure that life insurers operate within safe and sustainable limits.

These rules remain foundational in Canadian insurance regulation, emphasizing prudence, accountability, and sound financial management in the life insurance sector.
