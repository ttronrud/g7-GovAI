**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (Repealed – SOR/2001-494, s. 2 and s. 6)**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation was originally enacted under the **Municipal Grants Act, 1980**, and was promulgated by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works. It establishes the **rules and definitions governing grants in lieu of real property taxes or frontage/area taxes** that may be paid by the Government of Canada to municipal or local taxing authorities.

The regulation was initially published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 5, 1980**, providing a reasonable opportunity for interested parties (such as municipalities, property owners, or other stakeholders) to submit comments or objections before the regulation came into force.

However, **this regulation has since been repealed**:
- **Section 2** of SOR/2001-494 repealed the regulation entirely.
- **Section 6** of SOR/2001-494 repealed a specific provision relating to certain federal properties being included in the definition of “federal property” for the purposes of the Act.

As such, **this regulation is no longer in force** and does not apply to current tax or grant arrangements in Canada.

### **Key Elements of the Regulation (Prior to Repeal)**

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
To define when and how the federal government may provide **grants in lieu of real property taxes or frontage/area taxes** to local taxing authorities. These grants are intended to compensate municipalities for the cost of property taxes that would otherwise be collected from federal property that is leased or occupied by non-departmental entities.

This ensures that local governments are not financially burdened by property taxes on federal lands or buildings used by government agencies, international bodies, or diplomatic missions.

---

#### **2. Definitions Used in the Regulation**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act* (PILTA), which provides the legal framework for such grants.
- **International Organization**: As defined in Section 3 of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act* — includes entities like the UN, World Bank, etc., operating in Canada.
- **Visiting Force**: As defined in the *Visiting Forces Act* — refers to foreign military forces temporarily stationed in Canada.

---

#### **3. Criteria for Determining Taxable Attributes (Paragraph b of Subsection 2(1) of the Act)**

For the purpose of determining whether a tax levy should be applied to federal property (e.g., for financing operating costs), the following criteria may be used:

- The **actual or estimated cost of constructing a new building**
- The **number of rooms, living units, or beds** in a building
- The **number of persons occupying** the building
- Any **lot, parcel, improvement, or property component** that an assessment authority would normally use to calculate a frontage or area tax on taxable private property

These criteria are used to assess the **economic or functional value** of federal property in relation to local tax assessments.

#### **4. Definition of "Federal Property" (Under Subsection 2(1) of the Act)**

The regulation defines which real properties owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada qualify as **federal property** eligible for grants in lieu of property taxes. This includes:

#### **5. Amendments to Schedules (Prior to Repeal)**

  - **Canada Museums Construction Corporation Inc.** – For buildings housing the **National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa)** and **Canadian Museum of Civilization (Hull)**.
  - **Cape Breton Development Corporation** – For property used by the **Department of Transport** for the **Canadian Coast Guard College**.
  - **National Battlefields Commission** – For property administered by the Commission (title may be in Commission or Crown).
  - **National Capital Commission (NCC)** – For land on which the **National Gallery of Canada** and **Canadian Museum of Civilization** are located.

- **Schedule IV** (List of corporations exempt from real property tax) was **amended by adding** a new entry immediately after a specified existing entry (the specific entry is missing in the provided text).

> These amendments updated the list of qualifying corporations that are exempt from real property taxes and thus eligible for grants in lieu of such taxes.

### **Key Legal Basis**

- The regulation operates under **subsection 8(1) of the Municipal Grants Act, 1980**, which authorizes the Minister of Public Works to make regulations respecting grants in lieu of real property taxes or frontage/area taxes.

---

### **Repeal and Current Status**

- **Repealed by SOR/2001-494, Section 2** – Entire regulation is no longer in force.
- **Repealed by SOR/2001-494, Section 6** – Specific provision about certain federal properties being included in "federal property" is also removed.

> **Conclusion**: This regulation is **obsolete and no longer applicable** in Canadian tax or grant policy. The framework for payments in lieu of taxes is now governed by the **Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act (PILTA)**, but the specific definitions and classifications outlined here have been superseded by subsequent amendments or replaced by other legislation.

---

### **Significance and Historical Importance**

Although now repealed, this regulation was historically significant because:

1. It established a **clear, detailed framework** for identifying federal property eligible for tax relief.
2. It recognized the **unique status** of certain federal properties (e.g., those used by Indigenous peoples, diplomatic missions, or international organizations).
3. It provided **practical criteria** for assessing taxability based on physical attributes (rooms, occupancy, construction costs), enabling fair and transparent tax equity.
4. It reflected a **principle of fiscal fairness**, ensuring that municipalities are not unfairly burdened by taxes on federal property used for public or international functions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation, while **no longer in effect**, represents a foundational effort by the Canadian government to balance municipal taxation with federal property use. Its provisions laid the groundwork for modern tax-exempt or grant-based arrangements involving federal real estate. However, due to changes in policy and legislation (particularly SOR/2001-494), the regulation has been **fully repealed** and is not applicable today.

For current guidance on grants in lieu of property taxes, reference should be made to the **Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act** and its current amendments, which may have updated or replaced the definitions and eligibility criteria outlined in this 1980 regulation.
