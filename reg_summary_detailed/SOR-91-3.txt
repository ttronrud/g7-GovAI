**Detailed Summary of the Export Inspection and Certification Exemption Regulations**

**Regulatory Text:**  
The Minister of Agriculture, pursuant to subsection 19(6) of the *Health of Animals Act*, hereby makes the annexed Regulations exempting animals from the application of section 19 of the Health of Animals Act.  
*Statutory Citation:* S.C. 1990, c. 21  
*Date of Issuance:* December 10, 1990  
*Regulation Title:* Export Inspection and Certification Exemption Regulations  
*Reference Citation:* These Regulations may be cited as the *Export Inspection and Certification Exemption Regulations*.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of these Regulations is to exempt certain animals from the mandatory inspection and certification requirements set out in **Section 19 of the Health of Animals Act** when those animals are being exported. This exemption facilitates the international movement of animals by reducing bureaucratic and procedural barriers, provided that the animals fall within the specified categories.

Section 19 of the Health of Animals Act generally requires that animals be inspected and certified for health before they can be exported. This regulation provides a specific exception to that requirement for certain types of animals, allowing for the export of those animals without undergoing the full health inspection and certification process.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **General Exemption:**  
   All animals are exempt from the application of Section 19 of the Health of Animals Act **except** for the following specific categories:

   - Horses  
   - Swine (pigs)  
   - Foxes  
   - Mink  
   - Members of the suborder **Ruminantia** (commonly known as ruminants, which include cattle, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and similar species)  
   - Members of the family **Camelidae** (which includes camels, alpacas, llamas, and vicuñas)

2. **Scope of Exemption:**  
   The exemption applies to animals that are being exported from Canada. The exemption is intended to streamline the export process for animals that are not considered high-risk or that do not pose significant public health or animal health concerns in the context of international trade.

3. **Applicability:**  
   The exemption is conditional and only applies to animals that are legally exported under the terms of the regulation. It does not imply that such animals are free from disease or health risks; rather, it indicates that the mandatory inspection and certification required under Section 19 of the Act are not required for these animals, provided they meet other applicable export requirements (such as those related to disease status, movement permits, or international destination standards).

4. **Excluded Animals (Subject to Section 19):**  
   The following animals are **not** exempt and must still comply with the inspection and certification requirements under Section 19 of the Health of Animals Act:
   - Horses (e.g., for export to countries with specific equine health standards)
   - Swine (due to the risk of diseases such as African swine fever or classical swine fever)
   - Foxes (due to potential zoonotic disease risks)
   - Mink (due to concerns related to mink-related diseases and environmental impacts)
   - Ruminants (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats) — a major category of livestock with significant disease transmission risks
   - Camelids (e.g., camels, alpacas, llamas) — due to their sensitivity to certain pathogens and the importance of health monitoring in trade

---

**Rationale Behind Exclusion of Specific Species:**  
The exclusions reflect a risk-based approach to animal health regulation:
- **Ruminants and camelids** are considered high-risk due to their susceptibility to contagious diseases (e.g., brucellosis, foot-and-mouth disease, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), which can have significant implications for animal and human health in importing countries.
- **Horses and swine** are subject to strict international health standards, particularly due to the spread of diseases such as equine influenza, equine infectious anemia, and swine-origin influenza.
- **Foxes and mink** are often associated with wildlife disease transmission and may carry pathogens that can affect domestic animals or humans, necessitating health monitoring.

---

**Effective Date and Legal Authority:**  
- The regulation was issued on **December 10, 1990**, and came into force as part of the *Health of Animals Act* (S.C. 1990, c. 21).
- The Minister exercised authority under **subsection 19(6)** of the Act, which allows for the exemption of animals from the requirements of Section 19 when deemed appropriate for export purposes, particularly to promote international trade while maintaining animal health safeguards.

---

**Implications for Exporters and Regulators:**  
- Exporters of exempt animals (e.g., non-ruminant, non-camelid species) may avoid the need to obtain a formal health certificate under Section 19, provided the animals meet other applicable requirements (e.g., documentation, movement permits, destination country regulations).
- However, the exemption does not relieve exporters of other legal or sanitary obligations, such as compliance with the *Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)* guidelines, import country requirements, or disease-free status declarations.
- The CFIA or relevant provincial authorities may still conduct health checks or require documentation based on the destination country or specific disease concerns.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *Export Inspection and Certification Exemption Regulations* provide a targeted exemption from mandatory health inspections for certain animals under Section 19 of the *Health of Animals Act*. This facilitates the efficient export of animals that are deemed lower risk, particularly those not belonging to high-risk categories such as ruminants, swine, horses, foxes, mink, or camelids. The regulation reflects a balance between promoting international trade and maintaining animal health and biosecurity standards. However, the exclusion of key species underscores the importance of disease control and international health coordination in animal trade.

This regulation remains a key tool in Canada’s animal health policy framework, especially in the context of international trade agreements and evolving disease risks.
