## 🔍 Key Definitions and Concepts

### 1. **Residential Unit Held for an Eligible Purpose**
- A residential unit is considered held for an **eligible purpose** if it is used for one of the following purposes under the definition of *qualifying residential unit* in subsection 256.2(1):
  - (a)(ii)(A): Used as a place of residence or lodging by an individual.
  - (a)(ii)(A.1): Used as a place of residence or lodging by a person who is not an individual (e.g., a company or trust), but still meets the eligibility criteria.

> ⚠️ *Note: This is a critical distinction — only units held for a qualifying residential purpose qualify for certain tax exemptions and rebates.*

## 🏡 Taxable Supply Criteria: Excluded Renovated Housing Supply

A **taxable supply** is treated as an **excluded renovated housing supply** under specific conditions when the property is a **substantially renovated residential complex**.

### Conditions for an Excluded Renovated Housing Supply:
The supply qualifies **only if all of the following are met**:

1. **Renovation Status**:
   - The residential complex is a **substantially renovated residential complex**.
   - The renovation must have occurred **after** the complex was previously used as a residential complex.

2. **Pre-Renovation Use**:
   - The complex was **held or used as a residential complex immediately before** the beginning of the substantial renovation.

3. **Post-Renovation Use (Sale or Interest Transfer)**:
   - **Case A**: Sale of the complex to a **non-builder**.
     - The complex must **not** have been occupied by an individual as a place of residence or lodging **after the substantial renovation is substantially completed**.
   - **Case B**: Supply of an **interest in the complex** (e.g., lease, ownership interest).
     - Must meet the conditions in **subparagraphs (b)(i) and (ii)** of subsection 256.2(3.1) of the Act.

> ✅ This exclusion allows for **tax relief** on the sale or transfer of residential complexes that undergo major renovations, provided they were previously used as residential units and are not occupied post-renovation.

## 📜 Prescribed Conditions for Subsection 256.2(3.1)

These conditions define when a taxable supply is considered a **"prescribed property"** under section 256.2(3.1) of the Act — which triggers special rebate rules.

### A. In the Case of a Supply of:
- An **addition** to a multiple unit residential complex, or
- A **residential complex or interest** (not an excluded renovated housing supply)

#### Conditions:
- The property must have been:
  - In existence on **September 13, 2023**,
  - Not in the process of being constructed,
  - Not being used as a residential complex at that time.

> 📌 *This establishes a "cut-off" date (Sept 13, 2023) to exclude properties under construction or in development from qualifying for the rebate.*

---

## 🏘️ Prescribed Property Requirements (Multiple Unit Complexes)

For a **taxable supply** of a **multiple unit residential complex** (or addition) to qualify for a rebate, the following must be true:

### 1. Minimum Unit Requirements:
- Either:
  - **4 or more units**, with **at least 4 units** each having:
    - Private kitchen facilities
    - Private bath
    - Private living area
  - OR
  - **10 or more residential units**

### 2. Qualifying Residential Units:
- **All or substantially all** of the units in the complex (or addition) must be:
  - **Qualifying residential units**,
  - Held by the person **for an eligible purpose** (i.e., for use as a place of residence or lodging) **at the time** referenced in paragraph 256.2(3)(b) of the Act.

> 🔍 This ensures that the property is genuinely intended for residential use, not for commercial or industrial purposes.

---

## 🔗 Prescribed Property for Additions

When an **addition** is added to an existing multiple unit complex, it qualifies as prescribed property **only if**:

1. The addition meets the **unit count and facility requirements** (same as above).
2. All or substantially all units in the **combined complex and addition** are held for an eligible purpose.
3. The units are held for an eligible purpose **at the specified time** (when tax first becomes payable or is deemed paid).

> ✅ This ensures that the entire property (original + addition) functions as a residential complex.

## 💰 Rebate Rules under Section 256.21(1) of the Excise Tax Act

### General Principle:
If a person is entitled to a **rebate under subsection 256.2(3)** of the Act (for a residential complex, interest, or addition), and the property is located in one of the following provinces:

- **Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland and Labrador**

...and **subsection 256.2(3.1)** applies, then:

### ✅ Two Key Rules Apply:

#### 1. **Section 47 of the New Harmonized Value-added Tax System Regulations, No. 2 Does Not Apply**
- This means the **standard tax rebate rules** (which apply to other types of property) **do not apply** — the special rebate rules outlined below take precedence.

#### 2. **Rebate Amount Calculation**
The rebate amount is calculated **per qualifying residential unit** based on a formula that considers:
- The **total HST/GST tax** payable (or deemed paid) at the time tax first becomes payable.
- The **unit’s percentage of total floor space** in the complex or addition.

### 📍 Provincial Variations in Rebate Amounts (Prince Edward Island)

In **Prince Edward Island (PEI)**, the rebate amount is **tiered** based on when the construction or renovation was substantially completed.

| Completion Year | Rebate Rate | Maximum Rebate (per unit) |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------|
| Before 2029     | Full amount (up to $35,000) | Lesser of $35,000 or (tax × floor space %) |
| 2029            | 90% of tax × floor space % | Lesser of $31,500 or (0.9 × tax × floor space %) |
| 2030            | 80% of tax × floor space % | Lesser of $28,000 or (0.8 × tax × floor space %) |

| 2035            | 30% of tax × floor space % | Lesser of $10,500 or (0.3 × tax × floor space %) |

> 💡 This **gradual reduction** reflects a policy of phasing out incentives as the renovation timeline progresses — encouraging timely development.
