The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements:

> [Repealed, SI/2012-23, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SI/2012-23, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SI/2012-23, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SI/2012-23, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SI/2012-23, s. 5]

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2012-23**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2012-23 (SI 2012/23), commonly referred to as the *Statutory Instruments (Repeal) Order 2012* or similar, depending on the jurisdiction.
- **Section Cited**: Section 5 of SI 2012-23 specifically identifies the repeal of certain provisions, including the one in question.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer applicable**. Legal entities, individuals, or authorities were not required to comply with it after the date of repeal.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SI 2012-23, which is typically published in the official government gazette (e.g., the Canada Gazette, the UK Statutory Instruments, or the relevant national publication).

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is not provided in the query, this summary is based solely on the repealing reference.
- The repetition of the same line five times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error — it does not indicate that multiple distinct regulations were repealed, but rather that the same repeal notice applies to one or more provisions.
- Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., scope, purpose, key provisions) cannot be provided.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by Statutory Instrument 2012-23, section 5. It is no longer in force, and any prior application of its provisions is invalid. For a detailed understanding of what the original regulation governed, the original text would need to be accessed from historical legal databases or government publications.

If you can provide the name of the original regulation or the relevant legislation (e.g., a statute or policy area such as environmental protection, health, or employment), I can assist in identifying what it may have covered before repeal.
