**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Dominion Succession Duty (1957) Regulations*

**Enactment Authority:**  
The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is made under **Section 12 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to prescribe specific provinces or territories that will be subject to the application of the succession duty regime under the Act.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of these Regulations is to **designate specific provinces** for the application of the Dominion Succession Duty, as required by Section 12 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act. Specifically, the regulation establishes which provincial jurisdictions will be included in the scope of the succession duty legislation.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Citation of the Regulation:**  
   The Regulations are officially cited as the *Dominion Succession Duty (1957) Regulations*, providing a formal title for reference and legal citation.

2. **Designation of Provinces:**  
   The regulation explicitly **prescribes the Province of Ontario and the Province of Quebec** as the provinces that are subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act.  
   - This means that succession duties (a form of estate tax or duty levied on the transfer of property upon death) will apply to estates located in Ontario and Quebec under the framework of the Dominion Succession Duty Act.

3. **Legal Effect:**  
   By prescribing Ontario and Quebec, the regulation ensures that these provinces are included in the federal succession duty scheme. This is significant because the Dominion Succession Duty Act was a federal law, and its application in certain provinces was limited or required specific statutory authorization—this regulation provides that authorization.

4. **Scope and Application:**  
   The regulation applies to all matters governed by Section 12 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, particularly with respect to the imposition of succession duties on estates passing to beneficiaries in Ontario and Quebec. It may affect how duties are calculated, when they are payable, and who is liable.

5. **Historical Context (Implied):**  
   The year "1957" in the title suggests this regulation was enacted during a period when Canada was refining its tax and succession frameworks. The Dominion Succession Duty Act was introduced to provide a uniform federal approach to succession taxation, with provincial variations possible under specific conditions. This regulation formalizes the inclusion of Ontario and Quebec—two of Canada’s largest and most populous provinces—into that federal framework.

**Significance:**  
- This regulation ensures **federal consistency** in the application of succession duties across key provinces.  
- It reflects a federal policy choice to apply the Dominion Succession Duty in Ontario and Quebec, potentially to promote uniformity in estate taxation and to avoid conflicting provincial rules.  
- It serves as a foundational administrative instrument that enables the federal government to implement its succession tax policy in specific jurisdictions.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Dominion Succession Duty (1957) Regulations* formally designate **Ontario and Quebec** as the provinces subject to the succession duty provisions under the Dominion Succession Duty Act. Issued by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, the regulation operates under Section 12 of the Act and provides the legal basis for the federal imposition of succession duties in these two provinces. It is a key piece of administrative legislation that supports the federal government’s authority to regulate estate taxation in designated jurisdictions.
