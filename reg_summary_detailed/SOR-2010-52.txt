**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–2**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This exemption order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to make temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.

The order is formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 34** (Statutory authority)
- **R.S., c. R-2; S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2** (Relevant sections of the Radiocommunication Act)

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this exemption is to **allow the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** — acting on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada — to **interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications** during a specific, time-limited period, without being subject to the usual regulatory restrictions under the Radiocommunication Act.

This is justified under the **three key objectives**:
- **Security**
- **Safety**
- **International relations**

These are the only permissible justifications for interference or obstruction under this exemption.

### **3. Scope of the Exemption**

#### **a. Time Period**
The exemption is **temporary** and applies only for the period:
- **From March 12, 2010, to March 21, 2010**  
  (a 10-day window)

#### **b. Geographic Limitation**
The exemption is **geographically confined** to a specific area in **British Columbia**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following coordinates:

| Vertex | Coordinates |
|-------|-------------|
| A | 50°09′ N, 123°11′ W |
| B | 50°09′ N, 122°56′ W |
| C | 49°06′ N, 122°38′ W |
| D | 49°06′ N, 123°21′ W |

This area covers a region in **northern British Columbia**, likely including parts of the **Kootenay and Interior regions**, near the **Columbia River corridor**, and possibly bordering areas of interest due to security or international monitoring concerns.

> This boundary is not a large area — it is approximately 40–50 km in width and spans about 100 km in length, forming a relatively small, defined zone.

### **4. Conditions for Application of the Exemption**

#### **a. Subsection 4(1) Exemption (Interference with Radiocommunication)**
- Applies **only if** the radio apparatus is:
  - Installed, operated, or possessed
  - **With the specific purpose** of interfering with or obstructing a radiocommunication
- Such interference must be carried out **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The interference must serve one of the three stated purposes: **security, safety, or international relations**.

#### **b. Paragraph 9(1)(b) Exemption (Obstruction of Radiocommunication)**
- Applies **only if** the radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed **for the purposes of security, safety, or international relations**.

> Both exemptions are conditional and strictly tied to these justifications — they do **not** permit interference for commercial, political, or other non-authorized reasons.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization (Proportionality and Reasonableness)**

To ensure that the interference is both **necessary and proportionate**, the Order mandates that:

> *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies, and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This means:
- The RCMP must **limit the geographic scope** of interference to the smallest possible area.
- The **number of radio frequencies** affected must be minimized.
- The **duration** of interference must be as brief as possible.
- This principle ensures compliance with the principle of **proportionality** and **least intrusion**, protecting the broader public interest in radio spectrum use.

---

### **6. Who is Authorized to Use the Exemption?**

- The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** is explicitly named as the entity authorized to use this exemption.
- The exemption is **not available to private individuals or other government agencies** without specific authorization.
- The RCMP must act **within the legal framework** of the Order and in accordance with its stated purposes.

---

### **7. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- It is **not retroactive** and only applies during the specified time frame.
- Enforcement is subject to oversight and accountability, consistent with Canadian legal standards for emergency and security measures.

---

### **8. Key Implications and Significance**

- This Order is a **temporary, targeted, and narrowly defined** exception to Canada’s strict radio spectrum regulations.
- It demonstrates how the government can respond to **national security or safety threats** by temporarily suspending rules that normally protect radio communications from interference.
- It reflects a **balance between national security needs and the protection of lawful radio communications**.
- The requirement to minimize interference ensures that such actions do not cause undue disruption to public services (e.g., emergency services, aviation, or public safety communications).

---

### **Conclusion**

This exemption order is a **limited, time-bound, and geographically restricted** authorization allowing the RCMP to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications in a specific region of British Columbia during a 10-day window in March 2010. The use of such interference is strictly limited to **security, safety, or international relations** purposes and must be conducted in a **proportionate and minimally invasive** manner. It underscores the importance of regulatory flexibility in times of national need while maintaining safeguards to prevent abuse or overreach.

**Note**: This exemption is **not a permanent or general rule**. It is a specific, one-time action tied to a defined event or operational need, and its existence does not imply a broader policy of allowing interference with radio communications.
