### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a standardized fee structure for bait services provided by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to individuals or entities. The primary objective is to ensure fair and transparent financial accountability for the use of DFO-provided bait services, which are often used in fisheries research, monitoring, and enforcement activities.

The fee is designed to cover the administrative, operational, and logistical costs associated with the provision of bait—such as preparation, storage, transportation, and distribution—by the Department.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Fee Amount**  
   - The fee to be paid by any person receiving bait services from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is **$0.60 per kilogram of bait**.  
   - This rate applies uniformly to all types of bait (e.g., fish, crustaceans, or other biological materials) used in DFO operations.

2. **Applicability**  
   - The fee applies to any individual, organization, or entity that receives bait services directly from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  
   - This includes, but is not limited to:  
     - Researchers conducting scientific studies  
     - Fisheries inspectors performing compliance checks  
     - Government agencies or authorized bodies using bait in regulatory or monitoring activities  
     - Other authorized users under DFO programs

3. **Payment Responsibility**  
   - The fee is payable by the recipient of the bait services at the time of service delivery or as otherwise required by DFO procedures.  
   - Payment may be made in cash, cheque, or through an approved electronic or financial transfer system, as determined by DFO policy.

4. **Scope of Services Covered**  
   - The fee covers bait that is:  
     - Prepared, processed, or stored by DFO personnel  
     - Transported or distributed by DFO staff  
     - Provided under official DFO programs or projects  
   - It does not cover bait provided under private arrangements or commercial operations unrelated to DFO activities.

5. **Exemptions and Exceptions**  
   - The regulation does not explicitly list exemptions. However, in practice, exemptions may be granted in specific cases (e.g., emergency field operations, public interest research, or non-commercial educational purposes), subject to approval by the Minister or a designated DFO official.

6. **Enforcement and Compliance**  
   - DFO is responsible for enforcing the fee requirement. Non-compliance may result in administrative penalties or the refusal of future bait services.  
   - Recipients are expected to maintain records of bait usage and associated fees for audit or compliance purposes.

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is issued under the authority of **Order in Council P.C. 1988-440**, which grants the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the power to establish fees and charges related to services provided by the Department.  
- This authority is derived from broader legislative frameworks governing the operations and funding of DFO programs, including the *Fisheries Act* and associated regulations.

### **Historical and Contextual Notes**

- The regulation was originally issued in **1988** and remains in force as of 1996, indicating its long-standing relevance.  
- The fee of $0.60 per kilogram was set at a time when bait services were primarily used in scientific and regulatory contexts.  
- The 1996 date of issuance suggests that the Order was formally published or reaffirmed in official government records, possibly to ensure continuity and legal clarity in administrative practice.
