**Detailed Summary of the General Export Permit No. Ex. 18 – Portable Personal Computers and Associated Software**

**Issuing Authority:**  
The Secretary of State for External Affairs, acting under subsection 6(1) of the *Export Permit Regulations*, Canadian Regulations, Chapter 602 (C.R.C., c. 602).

**Effective Date:**  
April 14, 1989

**Permit Designation:**  
General Export Permit No. Ex. 18 – "Portable Personal Computers and Associated Software"

---

### **Purpose of the Permit**  
This regulation establishes a general authorization allowing Canadian individuals or entities to export portable personal computers (PPCs) and the associated software designed specifically for use in those devices. The permit aims to facilitate the export of technology for legitimate business and educational purposes while maintaining control over sensitive technology transfers.

---

### **Scope of Authorization**  
Under this permit, any person may export:

- **Portable personal computers** (e.g., laptops, handheld devices, or similar mobile computing equipment)
- **Associated software** that is designed to run on or be used with those portable personal computers

**Conditions for Exportation:**  
The export must comply with the following two key conditions:

1. **No Transfer of Technology:**  
   The export must not result in any transfer of technology. This means that:
   - The software and hardware must not be used in a way that enables the recipient to gain access to proprietary knowledge, design, or technical processes.
   - No technical data, source code, or advanced design information may be shared or indirectly transferred through the export.

2. **Restricted Use by Exporter Only:**  
   The exported portable personal computers and their associated software may only be used by the **exporter** themselves.  
   - The devices and software must not be used by third parties.
   - Use must be strictly limited to **business or educational purposes** — not for personal, recreational, or non-authorized applications.

---

### **Prohibited Exports**  
This permit **does not authorize** the export of goods listed in Section 2 of the Export Permit Regulations to any country included on the **Area Control List** (ACL).  
- The Area Control List typically includes countries deemed high-risk due to political instability, human rights concerns, or potential misuse of technology (e.g., for military or surveillance purposes).  
- Exports to such countries are restricted or prohibited under Canadian export control policy.

---

### **Reporting Requirements**  
If the exported goods are subject to reporting obligations under the *Customs Act*, the exporter must include one of the following statements on the required form:

- “Exported under the authority of General Export Permit No. Ex. 18”  
- “Exporté en vertu de la Licence générale d’exportation no Ex. 18”

This ensures transparency and compliance with Canadian customs and export control procedures.

---

### **Duration of Authorization**  
The export authorization is valid for a period **not exceeding three months** from the date of export.  
- This time limit ensures that the export remains within a defined, manageable timeframe and helps monitor compliance with the permit conditions.

---

### **Key Implications and Context**  
- This permit reflects Canada’s early efforts to manage the growing global market for personal computing technology in the late 1980s.
- It balances the need to promote Canadian technological exports with the imperative to prevent unauthorized dissemination of sensitive technology.
- By restricting use to the exporter and limiting technology transfer, the regulation protects Canadian intellectual property and national security interests.
- The exclusion of certain countries from the permit highlights Canada’s strategic approach to export controls based on geopolitical risk.

### **Conclusion**  
General Export Permit No. Ex. 18 provides a streamlined, flexible pathway for Canadian businesses and institutions to export portable personal computers and their software for business or educational use, provided strict conditions are met. It is a foundational tool in Canada’s export control framework during a period of rapid technological advancement and international trade expansion. The permit underscores the importance of preventing technology transfer to restricted regions and ensuring that exported goods are used solely by the exporter for authorized purposes.
