**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Export of Consumable Stores Supplied to Vessels and Aircraft Permit"**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
This regulation is officially titled the *Export of Consumable Stores Supplied to Vessels and Aircraft Permit* and may be cited as **General Export Permit No. Ex. 3**. It establishes the legal framework under which Canada can export specific types of consumable supplies to vessels and aircraft that are departing from Canadian ports or airports.

**2. Definition of "Consumable Stores"**  
The term *consumable stores* is explicitly defined and includes the following categories:  
- **Fuel oils** (e.g., diesel, aviation fuel)  
- **Lubricants** (e.g., engine oils, hydraulic fluids)  
- **Provisions and supplies required for a voyage or flight** (e.g., food, water, emergency rations, navigation tools, spare parts)  
- **Medical and surgical supplies** (e.g., first-aid kits, medications, diagnostic tools, personal protective equipment)

This definition ensures that only essential, short-term supplies necessary for operational use during a voyage or flight are covered under the permit.

**3. Scope of Authority**  
Under the authority of this permit, **any person** (individuals, companies, or organizations) may:  
- Supply **usual and reasonable quantities** of consumable stores  
- From **Canada** to **vessels and aircraft** that are **departing from Canada**  
- With the intent that the stores be used **by or on board** the vessel or aircraft during its journey  

The term *usual and reasonable quantities* implies that the amount supplied must be proportionate to the vessel or aircraft’s operational needs, based on standard industry practices and the expected duration of the voyage or flight. This prevents over-supply or export of excess or non-essential items.

---

**4. Legal Basis**  
The permit operates under **Section 15 of the Export and Import Permits Act**. This provision allows for certain types of exports to be conducted without requiring a separate permit, provided they meet specific criteria (such as being for essential operational use and falling within defined categories). The permit thus provides a streamlined, simplified mechanism for the export of consumable stores.

**5. Customs Entry Requirements**  
When a shipment of consumable stores is exported under this permit, and a **customs entry form** must be completed (e.g., for customs declaration or clearance), the form must be **endorsed** with one of the following statements:  
- **"Exported under the authority of General Export Permit No. Ex. 3"** (in English)  
- **"Exporté en vertu de la Licence générale d'exportation no Ex. 3"** (in French)

This endorsement serves as official documentation that the export was authorized under this specific permit and is required for compliance with Canadian customs and trade regulations.

---

**6. Key Objectives and Implications**  
- **Simplifies export processes**: Eliminates the need for individual permits for routine consumable supplies, reducing administrative burden.  
- **Supports international maritime and aviation operations**: Ensures vessels and aircraft can depart Canada with essential supplies needed for safe and efficient operation.  
- **Ensures compliance and traceability**: The requirement to endorse customs forms ensures that exports are properly documented and traceable to the permit.  
- **Prevents misuse**: The definition of "usual and reasonable quantities" and the focus on essential operational needs help prevent the unauthorized export of surplus or non-essential goods.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a clear, accessible, and legally grounded framework for the export of essential consumable stores to Canadian vessels and aircraft. It balances operational necessity with regulatory oversight, enabling smooth international operations while ensuring compliance with Canadian export control laws. The requirement to properly endorse customs forms ensures accountability and transparency in the export process.
