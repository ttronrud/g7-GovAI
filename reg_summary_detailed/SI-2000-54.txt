**Detailed Summary of the Firearms Fees Remission Order**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice** and the **Treasury Board**. This authority is derived from **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the government to make fee remission orders when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

**Purpose of the Order:**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to provide a **fee remission** to eligible individuals who applied for a **possession licence** under the *Firearms Act* during a specific time period and who had previously paid a prescribed fee for the licence.

**Key Details of the Remission:**

- **Amount of Remission:**  
  A remission of **$35** is granted to qualifying applicants.

- **Eligible Applicants:**  
  Any individual who:
  - Made an application for a **possession licence** under the *Firearms Act*;
  - Did so during the period from **December 1, 1999, to June 9, 2000**, inclusive;
  - Paid a fee of **$45** for the licence.

- **Fee Reference:**  
  The $45 fee was the amount specified in **column 2 of item 1 of Part 1 of Schedule I to the Firearms Fees Regulations**. This schedule outlines the fees applicable to various types of firearm licences and applications.

**Context and Public Interest Justification:**
The order is justified on the grounds of **public interest**, suggesting that the remission serves a broader societal or administrative purpose—potentially to:
- Ease the financial burden on individuals who applied during a transitional or high-demand period;
- Recognize the timing of the fee structure (which may have been subject to change or review);
- Promote access to firearm licensing by reducing financial barriers for applicants during a specific window.

**Legal Citation:**
The regulation is formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**  
  This refers to the original enactment of the *Firearms Fees Regulations* (1991), and specifically section 7(2), which authorizes fee remissions under certain conditions.

**Nature of the Regulation:**
This is a **temporary, targeted fee remission**, not a permanent change to the fee structure. It applies only to individuals who:
- Applied within the specified time frame (Dec 1, 1999 – Jun 9, 2000);
- Paid the $45 fee as defined in the regulations.

**Effect and Implementation:**
- The remission of $35 is **refundable** to the individual, effectively reducing the total cost of the licence from $45 to $10.
- The order does not alter the legal requirements for obtaining a possession licence; it only modifies the financial obligation for those who meet the specified criteria.
- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond the stated period and is not available to applicants outside the defined timeframe.

**Conclusion:**
This Firearms Fees Remission Order is a targeted, administrative measure designed to provide financial relief to individuals who applied for a possession licence during a specific period and paid the standard fee. By remitting $35 of the $45 fee, the government acknowledges the public interest in reducing financial barriers to access, while maintaining compliance with the regulatory and financial framework established under the *Firearms Act* and the *Financial Administration Act*. It reflects a discretionary, policy-based approach to fee administration rather than a general or automatic adjustment.
