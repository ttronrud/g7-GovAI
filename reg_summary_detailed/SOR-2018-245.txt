### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Regulations Respecting Compulsory Insurance for Ships Carrying Passengers**  
*(S.C. 2009, c. 21, s. 10; S.C. 2001, c. 6)*

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **paragraphs 39(a)a and (b)a of the Marine Liability Act**.  
This means the regulation is a legally binding administrative measure enacted to implement specific provisions of the *Marine Liability Act*—specifically, to ensure that ships carrying passengers are required to maintain adequate liability insurance.

---

#### **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

- **Carriage by water under a contract of carriage** of passengers from one place in Canada to another (directly or via a foreign port).
- **Carriage by water otherwise than under a contract of carriage** (e.g., non-commercial or ad hoc transport), provided that:
  - The person being carried is not a member of the crew, master, or any employee engaged in the ship’s business;
  - The person is not carried as part of a sail trainee program or a class of persons prescribed under paragraph 39(d) of the Act;
  - The person is not a stowaway, trespasser, or someone boarding without the master’s or owner’s knowledge;
  - The person is not carried in a non-commercial or public-purpose vessel.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions** (where the regulations do *not* apply):
> - **Adventure tourism activities** that meet the conditions in subsection 37.1(1) of the *Marine Liability Act*.
> - **Carriage of sail trainees** or persons belonging to a class prescribed under paragraph 39(d) of the Act.
> - **Search and rescue operations** conducted by the **Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary**.
> - **Government or provincial carriage** (including entities entitled to indemnification under Part 4 of the Act).
> - **Carriage by pleasure craft**, as defined in **Section 2 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**.

---

#### **3. Mandatory Liability Insurance Requirement**

Every individual or entity performing **the whole or part of a passenger carriage** by sea must maintain **liability insurance** covering:

- **Death or personal injury** resulting from an incident occurring during the carriage.
- The incident must be due to the **fault or neglect** of the carrier, their servants, agents, or mandataries acting within the scope of employment.

> ✅ **Minimum Coverage Amount**:  
> The insurance coverage must be **not less than $250,000 multiplied by the passenger capacity** of the ship.  
> For example:
> - A ship with 50 passenger capacity → minimum coverage = $250,000 × 50 = **$12.5 million**.

---

#### **4. Proof of Insurance Requirements**

The insured must ensure that **proof of insurance** is carried on board the ship at all times.

##### **Forms of Proof of Insurance**:
- **If the ship is covered by a Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Club** that is a member of the **International Group of Protection and Indemnity Associations (IGP&A)**:
  - The **certificate of entry** issued by the P&I club is acceptable.
- **Otherwise**:
  - A **certificate of insurance** in the form specified in the **Schedule** must be carried.

> 🔍 The certificate must be signed by the insurer or its authorized representative.

---

#### **5. Fleet Coverage and Certificate Requirements**

If the liability insurance covers a **fleet of ships** (i.e., multiple vessels under one policy), the following rules apply:

- A **certificate of insurance must be carried on one ship** in the fleet.
- A **copy of the certificate must be carried on every other ship** in the fleet.

> 📝 The certificate must clearly state:
> - The **amount of insurance applicable to each ship** in the fleet; or  
> - The **amount of insurance applicable to the ship with the highest passenger capacity**, along with the **total number of ships** in the fleet to which that amount applies.
> - That the policy provides **the same coverage** as if a **separate policy** had been issued for each individual ship in the fleet.

> 🚫 Exceptions:
> - If a ship is **exempt from registration** under subsection 46(1) of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, then its **name and official number** do not need to appear on the certificate.
> - If the fleet has **more ships than can be listed on the front** of the certificate, the **additional ships must be listed on the back** of the document.

---

#### **6. Exceptions to Proof of Insurance Requirement**

A carrier is **not required** to carry proof of insurance on board if:

1. It is **not feasible** due to lack of space or protection from the elements (e.g., exposed to weather, flooding, etc.).
2. The proof is stored on an **electronic device**, and it is **technically impossible** to display the certificate due to device limitations (e.g., screen size, software incompatibility).

> ⚠️ **Important Exception Clarity**:  
> Even if proof is not carried due to these reasons, the carrier must **produce the proof to a designated officer** under subsection 128(1) of the *Marine Liability Act* within **24 hours** of the officer boarding the vessel.

---

#### **7. Effective Date of the Insurance Requirement**

The insurance obligations under Sections 3 and 4 do **not take effect immediately**. Instead, they begin on the **earlier of**:

- The moment when the **first of the following events occurs** for a carrier who already had a valid policy before the regulations came into force:
  - The policy **expires**;
  - The policy is **cancelled**;
  - The policy is **modified** (e.g., coverage reduced or changed).

- Or, in **all other cases**, **60 days after the regulations come into force**.

> ✅ This grace period allows carriers to transition smoothly to compliance.

---

#### **8. Effective Date of the Regulation**

These regulations come into force on the **30th day after publication in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.

---

#### **9. Definition of "Ship" (for Context)**

Per paragraph 36(1)(a) of the *Marine Liability Act*, a **"ship"** includes:
- Any vessel or craft designed, used, or capable of being used for navigation (seagoing or not).
- **Excludes**:
  - Air cushion vehicles (e.g., hovercrafts).
  - Vessels propelled manually by paddles or oars.

> This definition ensures that only vessels used in commercial or operational passenger transport are covered by the insurance requirements.

---

#### **10. Certificate of Insurance Format (Summary)**

The certificate must include the following information:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Name of Insured** | Full legal name of the entity responsible for the carriage |
| **Address** | Physical address of the insured |
| **City, Province** | Location details |
| **Postal Code** | Postal address |
| **Policy Effective Date** | Start date of coverage |
| **Policy Expiry Date** | End date of coverage |
| **Insurer Details** | Name, address, city, province, postal code |
| **Coverage Statement** | Confirms coverage applies to listed ships and matches coverage of individual policies |

> 🔐 The certificate must be signed by the insurer or an authorized representative.

### **Key Takeaways & Practical Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Mandatory Insurance** | All passenger-carrying vessels (commercial or otherwise) must have liability insurance. |
| **Coverage Threshold** | Minimum coverage scales with passenger capacity—significant financial obligation for large vessels. |
| **Fleet Coverage** | A single policy covering multiple ships must still provide equivalent individual coverage. |
| **Proof of Insurance** | Must be visible and accessible; electronic or paper forms accepted with strict conditions. |
| **Grace Period** | Existing carriers with valid policies get a 60-day window to comply. |
| **Exclusions** | Tourism, government, pleasure craft, and certain emergency operations are exempt. |
| **Compliance Enforcement** | Failure to carry proof may result in penalties; failure to produce within 24 hours of inspection is a violation. |

### **Conclusion**

These regulations establish a **comprehensive and enforceable framework** for ensuring that ships carrying passengers in Canada maintain sufficient liability insurance to protect victims of accidents or injuries. The rules are designed to:

- Promote **safety and accountability** in passenger maritime transport.
- Provide **clear, standardized requirements** for both individual and fleet operations.
- Balance **practicality** (e.g., allowing exemptions for small vessels or non-commercial operations) with **strong legal enforceability**.

By aligning with international standards (especially P&I clubs and the *Marine Liability Act*), these regulations enhance Canada’s maritime safety framework and ensure that passengers are protected against financial loss due to negligence or accidents at sea.
