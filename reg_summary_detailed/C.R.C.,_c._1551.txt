**Detailed Summary of the *Textile Labelling and Advertising Regulations***

---

### **Overview**
The *Textile Labelling and Advertising Regulations* (the "Regulations") implement and enforce **Section 3 of the Textile Labelling Act** (the "Act") to ensure **transparency and accuracy in the disclosure of textile fibre content and origin** for consumer textile products sold, imported, or advertised in Canada. These regulations establish mandatory requirements for **labelling**, **advertising**, and **exemptions**, with a focus on protecting consumers from misleading or deceptive claims.

The Regulations define key terms, specify the content and format of required labels, outline conditions under which certain labelling obligations are waived, and regulate how information must be presented in both physical labels and advertising.

---

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Textile Labelling Act* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for labelling requirements. |
| **Country of Origin** | The country where a textile fibre was grown or manufactured, or where a non-included textile product was substantially made. |
| **Narrow Fabric** | A textile product 30 cm or less in width, typically used as trim or decorative elements (e.g., binding, edging). |
| **Reclaimed Textile Fibre** | Fibre recovered from existing yarns, fabrics, consumer goods, or plumage (e.g., recycled polyester from old garments). |
| **Disclosure Label** | A label that complies fully with the Act and Regulations in form, content, and presentation. If two labels are used (e.g., under subsection 14(3) or (4)), both are considered disclosure labels. |
| **Representation Label** | Any label containing a claim about the textile fibre content of a product. |

---

## **Core Provisions and Requirements**

### **1. Mandatory Disclosure Label Requirements**

Every representation label applied to a **prescribed consumer textile article** (as defined in Schedule I) must meet the requirements of a **disclosure label**, unless:

- The article is **exempted** by the Regulations from paragraph 3(b) of the Act; or  
- It satisfies the exemption conditions in subsection (2).

> **Prescribed consumer textile articles** are those listed in **Schedule I** (e.g., clothing, home textiles, accessories).

---

### **2. Prohibition Against Contradictory or Deceptive Claims**

A representation label **cannot contradict, qualify, or detract from any information** in a prior disclosure label applied to the same product.  
This ensures **consistency and truthfulness** in labelling and prevents misleading consumers through conflicting statements.

---

### **3. Exemptions from Labelling Requirements**

Certain products or sales are **exempt** from the mandatory disclosure label requirement under section 3 of the Act:

| Exemption Scenario | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Schedule II items** | Articles listed in Schedule II (e.g., industrial, institutional, or non-consumer goods). |
| **Pre-1972 Sales** | Articles sold or advertised by a dealer if they were received before December 1, 1972, from the manufacturer. |
| **Sales to non-Canadian dealers or duty-free stores** | Sales outside Canada or to duty-free retailers. |
| **Imported articles labelled before resale** | Articles imported and labelled before being resold. |
| **Sales to specific entities** | Sold to commercial enterprises, government departments, educational institutions, religious organizations, or healthcare facilities for use by employees, students, or members. |
| **Sales to individual consumers** | If the individual had the opportunity to examine the fabric or swatch before purchase and the fibre content was clearly shown on the bill of sale or delivery document. |
| **Mail-order piece goods (including narrow fabrics)** | If the fibre content is clearly shown in the **mail order catalogue** at the time of order. |
| **Filling, stuffing, padding, or interlining** | If the only required label is provided under provincial law. |

> These exemptions recognize practical realities such as bulk industrial use, pre-existing supply chains, and limited consumer access.

### **4. Importation of Unlabelled Articles**

A dealer may import a **prescribed consumer textile article without a disclosure label** if:

1. They provide the **inspector** at the port of entry with:
   - A statement of intent to import,
   - Date and place (or proposed) of importation,
   - Nature and quantity of the article,
   - Address where the article will be labelled,
   - A sample of the product (as reasonably requested).

2. **Before resale**, they:
   - Apply the disclosure label in the prescribed manner,
   - Notify the inspector of the labelling,
   - Allow the inspector a **reasonable opportunity to inspect** the labelled article.

> The inspector is either at the port of entry or the nearest available inspector.

---

### **5. Second-Hand Articles**

A **clearly identified second-hand article** (labelled as such) is **exempt** from section 3 of the Act. This protects resale and prevents confusion between new and used goods.

---

### **6. Required Information on the Disclosure Label**

All required information must be clearly and prominently displayed on the label:

| Requirement | Details |
|----------|--------|
| **Fibre Content** | Must be shown in the manner prescribed in **Part III** of the Regulations (e.g., percentages of cotton, polyester, etc.). |
| **Dealer Name and Address** | Must be included **unless replaced** by an identification number. |
| **Country of Origin** | Must be shown if the product is imported, **unless already shown** on another label. |

> **Exceptions**:
> - For **remnants** (cut pieces of fabric):
>   - If the original manufacturer’s name is unknown,
>   - Or if the remnants are sold together in a bundle or displayed with other remnants from different sources (not all from the same dealer), the dealer name may be omitted.

---

### **7. Language Requirements**

- Labels must be in **both English and French**.
- **Exception**: In areas where only one official language is used continuously for consumer transactions, the label may be in that single language.

> The **"area"** is defined as:
> - The geographic region from which a store draws most customers, or
> - The region where all consumers with the same city/town name reside.

---

### **8. Identification Number System**

A dealer may apply for a **unique identification number** (instead of their name and address) if they:

- Manufacture, process, finish, or sell consumer textile products in Canada;
- Import consumer textile articles; or
- Own and distribute such articles.

#### Application Requirements:
- Written application,
- Business name,
- Name and contact of an authorized official,
- Business address and telephone number,
- Postal address (if different),
- A fee of **$100**.

#### Use of Identification Number:
- Can replace dealer name and address **if the information is current**.
- Can be transferred to a **subsequent dealer** if the new dealer meets the same criteria and has up-to-date information.

> *Note: This provision was revoked in SOR/2018-253, s. 2 — so this is likely outdated or superseded.*

### **9. Label Placement and Visibility**

Labels must be:
- **Clearly and prominently displayed**,
- **Easily legible**,
- In **equal size and prominence**,
- **Set apart** from non-required graphic material.

> The information required by section 11(1)(a) (fibre content and dealer info) must be **separated from other graphics**.

---

### **10. Label Placement Rules by Product Type**

#### **A. Pair or Set of Articles**
- If both items have the **same fibre content**, one label applied to one item is sufficient for both.
- If contents differ, a label showing **separate fibre content** for each item must be applied to one item.

#### **B. Remnants Sold in Bundles or Packages**
- If a bundle contains remnants of the **same fibre content**, and a label shows the required information for all remnants, that label counts as a disclosure label for each item.

#### **C. Remnants Displayed with a Sign**
- A sign showing required information (in prescribed manner) **surmounting or near** the remnants counts as a disclosure label.

#### **D. Piece Goods (e.g., bolts, spools)**
- For piece goods **not sold in fixed lengths**:
  - Fibre content can be **woven into or imprinted on the selvage** at intervals not exceeding **1 metre**.
  - A label affixed to the **bolt core or spool** must be clearly visible to buyers.
  - For **narrow fabrics**, a sign near the item suffices.

> *Note: This provision was revoked in SOR/87-247, s. 8 — indicating it may no longer be in force.*

#### **E. Batts, Padding, Rope (sold by the metre)**
- Label affixed to bolt/spool or sign near the product is sufficient.

#### **F. Embroidery, Crochet, Tapestry Yarn**
- When sold to the public:
  - Label on case/stand or sign near the product counts.
- When sold between dealers:
  - Label, bill of sale, or container counts.

#### **G. Products in Wrappers, Packages, or Containers**
- Required information must be shown **on the wrapper/container** unless:
  - The product is in Schedule III, or
  - It is sold as a
