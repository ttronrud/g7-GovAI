**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, amends **Schedule I.1** of that Act to update the official designation of the responsible minister for certain federal institutions.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Authority of the Issuing Body**:
   - The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
   - This means the decision is made at the highest level of federal governance, reflecting a formal and constitutionally recognized process.

2. **Legal Basis**:
   - The amendment is authorized under **subsection 3(1.1) of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows for the modification of administrative schedules—such as those defining financial responsibilities and reporting structures—when necessary to reflect changes in government structure or ministerial responsibilities.

3. **Scope of the Amendment**:
   - The regulation modifies **Schedule I.1** of the Financial Administration Act.
   - Specifically, it **removes** the reference to the **Minister of Communications** in **Column II** (the "Responsible Minister" column) for three designated institutions listed in **Column I**:
     - The **National Archives of Canada**
     - The **National Film Board of Canada**
     - The **National Library of Canada**
   - In its place, it **substitutes** a reference to the **Secretary of State of Canada** for each of these institutions.

4. **Purpose of the Change**:
   - The change reflects a **restructuring of ministerial responsibilities** within the Canadian government.
   - The **Minister of Communications** was likely a former or obsolete portfolio, having been merged, reorganized, or rebranded over time.
   - The **Secretary of State of Canada** is now the appropriate ministerial office responsible for overseeing the operations and financial administration of these cultural and archival institutions.
   - This realignment ensures that financial reporting, oversight, and administrative accountability are properly assigned to the current responsible minister.

5. **Status of the Regulation**:
   - The regulation is **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument SI/2015-112**.
   - This indicates that the amendment was not a permanent or ongoing provision but rather a **temporary or transitional measure** that was later revoked.
   - The repeal suggests that the designation of the Secretary of State of Canada may have been superseded by a further reorganization or that the original amendment was rendered obsolete by subsequent changes in government structure or legislation.

### Implications:

- **Administrative Clarity**: The amendment aimed to ensure that financial and administrative responsibilities for these key cultural institutions were clearly assigned to the current ministerial office.
- **Reflects Government Reform**: The change reflects broader efforts in the Canadian government to streamline and modernize ministerial portfolios, particularly in the areas of communications, culture, and heritage.
- **Temporary Nature**: The fact that the regulation is repealed indicates that the change was not a permanent solution and may have been part of a transitional phase in ministerial reorganization.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a **temporary administrative update** to the Financial Administration Act, adjusting the responsible minister for three national cultural institutions from the former Minister of Communications to the Secretary of State of Canada. While the amendment sought to improve accountability and clarity in financial oversight, it was ultimately **repealed in 2015 (SI/2015-112)**, suggesting that further government restructuring has since rendered the change unnecessary or outdated. The regulation exemplifies how ministerial responsibilities evolve over time in response to political and administrative changes.
