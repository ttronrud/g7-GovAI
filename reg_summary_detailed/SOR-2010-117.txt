| **Specified Location** | A permanent establishment of a supplier or a vending machine. |
| **Participating Provinces** | Provinces that participate in the HST system (e.g., Ontario, BC, PEI). Tax rates vary by province. |

## 🚚 Application of the Rules: By Supply Type

---

### 1. **Intangible Personal Property** (e.g., software, digital content)

#### Case A: Canadian Rights Can Be Used *Primarily* in Participating Provinces
- The supply is **made in a participating province** if:
  - **Value ≤ $300 and made at a specified location in the province** with an individual present (recipient or agent), **and** the rights can be used in that province.
  - **If not**, then:
    - The supplier obtains a **"particular address"** (home or business address of the recipient).
    - This address must be **in the participating province**.
    - The rights must be usable in that province.
    - The **tax rate** in the province is the **highest** among all participating provinces where the rights can be used.

> ✅ Example: A software license sold to a user in Ontario with a home address in Ontario — taxed in Ontario at 13% (HST).

#### Case B: Canadian Rights Can Be Used *Primarily* in Non-Participating Provinces
- The supply is **made in a non-participating province**.

> ✅ Example: A digital music service used primarily in Alberta — taxed in Alberta.

#### Case C: Canadian Rights Can Be Used in *Both* Participating and Non-Participating Provinces
- The supply is **made in a particular province** if:
  - Value ≤ $300 and made at a specified location in the province with an individual present → rights usable there.
  - Otherwise:
    - Supplier obtains a **"particular address"** (most closely connected to the supply).
    - This address must be in the province.
    - Rights must be usable there.
    - The **tax rate** in that province is the **highest** among all provinces where rights are usable.

> ✅ Example: A cloud-based tool used by a business in both Ontario and BC — taxed in Ontario (highest rate: 13%) if that’s where the business address is.

#### Tie-Breaker Rule (Same Tax Rates)
- If two or more participating provinces have the **same tax rate**, the supply is made in:
  - The province where the **supplier’s business address** is most closely connected to the supply.
  - If not, the province **closest in proximity** to that address.

### 2. **Intangible Personal Property Relating to Real or Tangible Personal Property**

#### Real Property (e.g., real estate, land)
- **Made in a participating province** if:
  - The real property is **situated primarily in participating provinces**.
  - An **equal or greater proportion** is not located in another participating province.
  - If not, the tax rate in the participating province is the **highest** among those with no greater proportion in another participating province.
- **Made in a non-participating province** if the property is **not primarily in participating provinces**.

#### Tangible Personal Property (e.g., equipment, inventory)
- **Made in a participating province** if:
  - The property is **ordinarily located primarily in participating provinces**.
  - An **equal or greater proportion** is not located in another participating province.
  - If not, the tax rate in the province is the **highest** among those with no greater proportion in another province.
- **Made in a non-participating province** if the property is **not primarily located in participating provinces**.

> ⚠️ **Critical Timing Rule**:
> - If the tangible property **remains in the same province** throughout the service period:
>   - Taxed based on **location at the start** of service.
> - If the property **moves during the service**:
>   - Taxed based on **where the service is performed** (Canadian element) and **where the property is located at any time**.

### 3. **Supply of Services**

#### General Rule:
- A service is made in a province if the supplier obtains, in the ordinary course of business:
  - A recipient’s **home or business address**.
  - If multiple addresses: the one **most closely connected** to the supply.
  - If no such address: the recipient’s address **most closely connected** to the supply.

> ✅ Example: A service provider receives a business address in Quebec — service is taxed in Quebec.

#### Services with Canadian Element in Participating Provinces
- Made in a **participating province** if:
  - The **Canadian element** is performed **primarily in participating provinces**.
  - An **equal or greater proportion** is not performed in another participating province.
  - If not, the **tax rate** in the province is the **highest** among those with no greater proportion in another province.
- Made in a **non-participating province** if the Canadian element is **not primarily performed in participating provinces**.

#### Special Cases:

##### A. **Services in Relation to Real Property**
- Same rules as for intangible property:
  - If real property is primarily in participating provinces → taxed in a participating province.
  - Else → taxed in a non-participating province.

##### B. **Services in Relation to Tangible Personal Property**
- If property **remains in the same province** throughout the service:
  - Taxed based on **location at the start** of service.
- If property **moves during service**:
  - Taxed based on **where the Canadian element is performed** and **where the property is located at any time**.

> ✅ Example: A technician servicing machinery in Ontario → service is in Ontario. If machinery moves to Alberta mid-service → service is taxed in Alberta.

##### C. **Services Performed in the Presence of the Recipient** (e.g., hands-on training, installation)
- Made in a participating province if:
  - The Canadian element is performed primarily in participating provinces.
  - An equal or greater proportion is not performed elsewhere.
  - If not, the tax rate is the highest among provinces where the service is performed.
- Otherwise → taxed in a non-participating province.

> ⚠️ Excludes advisory, consulting, or professional services (covered under exemptions in Schedule IX).
