This regulation establishes a specific time limit for the application of Subsection 118(1) of the *Customs Tariff Regulations*. It clarifies the duration during which certain customs duties or tax provisions under that subsection remain in force for imported goods.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Application of Subsection 118(1):**  
   Subsection 118(1) of the *Customs Tariff Regulations* applies to any imported goods **only for a period of six years** after the date on which the goods are released from customs control.

2. **Definition of "Released":**  
   "Released" refers to the date when the goods are officially cleared by customs authorities and made available for delivery or use, typically following payment of applicable duties, taxes, or fees.

3. **Time Limit Framework:**  
   - Once the goods are released, the provisions of subsection 118(1) — which may relate to duties, assessments, or enforcement powers — are only enforceable or applicable for **six calendar years** from that release date.  
   - After this six-year period, the subsection no longer applies to those goods, effectively closing the window for enforcement or assessment of the duties or related obligations under that provision.

4. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is authorized under paragraph 118(4)(a) of the *Customs Tariff*, which grants the Minister of National Revenue (and, by extension, the Governor General in Council) the power to prescribe time limits for the operation of specific provisions of the tariff regime.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   These regulations come into force on **January 1, 1998**. This means that all imported goods released on or after that date will be subject to the six-year time limit for the application of subsection 118(1), as defined herein.

**Implications and Significance:**

- **Clarity and Predictability:**  
  The regulation provides importers and customs officials with clear and predictable timelines for when customs duties or tax obligations under subsection 118(1) may be assessed or enforced.

- **Limitation of Liability:**  
  It limits the period during which the government can pursue claims or assessments related to duties under subsection 118(1), protecting importers from indefinite or retrospective liability.

- **Administrative Efficiency:**  
  By setting a six-year deadline, the regulation streamlines customs administration and reduces the burden of ongoing audits or assessments on older shipments.

- **Consistency with International Practice:**  
  This time limit aligns with common customs practices in many jurisdictions, where a fixed period (e.g., 5–10 years) is established for the enforcement of import duties or tax obligations.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a critical administrative and legal tool to ensure that the application of subsection 118(1) of the *Customs Tariff Regulations* is time-bound, fair, and predictable. By limiting enforcement to six years after release, it balances the need for revenue collection with the protection of importers’ rights and the efficiency of customs operations. It came into effect on January 1, 1998, and remains a key component of Canada’s customs and tariff framework.
