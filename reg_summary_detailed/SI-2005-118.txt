**Detailed Summary of the Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13)**  
*Effective Date: October 14, 2005 (came into force upon the activation of Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act, 2003)*

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the **Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order**, was issued by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** under the authority granted by **Section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. It provides a formal exclusion from the mandatory official language proficiency requirements for certain individuals who are appointed to **bilingual positions**—positions requiring proficiency in both English and French.

The rationale behind this exclusion is that it is **neither practicable nor in the public interest** to require all individuals to achieve full bilingual proficiency in order to be appointed to such roles. The Commission recognizes that some individuals may face significant barriers—such as physical, mental, or learning impairments, or lack of access to language training—that would make it unreasonable or impossible to meet the required language standards within a reasonable timeframe.

This Order allows for **flexibility in appointment processes** while still upholding the principle of official language use in the federal public service, ensuring that language requirements are applied fairly and realistically.

### **Legal Authority**

- **Section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** grants the Public Service Commission the power to make orders that exclude certain individuals from the language proficiency requirements in specific circumstances.
- The Order is **approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**, confirming its validity and alignment with federal policy.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA), the foundational legislation governing public service employment, including language requirements.

2. **Agreement to Become Bilingual**  
   A written agreement where a person:
   - Agrees to attain the required level of official language proficiency (in both English and French) through public-funded language training;
   - Does so within **two years** from the later of:
     - The date the person signs the agreement of appointment to the bilingual position; or
     - The effective date of the appointment;
   - Agrees that if they fail to meet the required proficiency by the end of this two-year period, they will be:
     - Appointed or deployed on an **indeterminate basis** to a position that:
       - Matches their essential qualifications (as defined in paragraph 30(2)(a) of the PSEA);
       - Is of a **similar level and salary** as the original bilingual position.

3. **Bilingual Position**  
   A position officially designated by the **deputy head** (e.g., department head) as one in which the work requires **proficiency in both official languages** (English and French). These are typically roles involving communication, translation, or public service delivery across both language communities.

4. **Non-Imperative Appointment**  
   An appointment to a bilingual position where:
   - The position is not immediately filled by someone with full bilingual proficiency;
   - The appointment is for an **indeterminate period**;
   - At the time of appointment, the deputy head has determined that it is not necessary to have a person meeting the required language proficiency level.

5. **Unilingual Person**  
   A person who meets the required proficiency in **only one** of the two official languages (either English or French), but not both.

### **Exclusions from Paragraph 30(2)(a) of the PSEA**

Paragraph 30(2)(a) of the PSEA generally requires that a person appointed to a bilingual position must meet the required level of official language proficiency in both English and French.

This Order **excludes certain unilingual persons** from this requirement under the following conditions:

#### 1. **Agreement to Become Bilingual (for Non-Imperative Appointments)**
- A **unilingual person** who enters into a formal **agreement to become bilingual** (as defined above) is **excluded** from the operation of paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Act **regarding the language proficiency requirement** for a **non-imperative appointment** to a bilingual position.
- This means the person does not need to meet the full bilingual standard at the time of appointment, as long as they commit to training and meet the standard within two years.
- If they fail to meet the standard, they are automatically reassigned to a similar non-bilingual role with comparable pay and status.

#### 2. **Long-Term or Recurring Impairment**
- If a unilingual person has a **long-term or recurring physical, mental, or learning impairment** that makes it **unreasonable or impossible** for them to achieve the required language proficiency through training:
  - They are **excluded** from the operation of paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Act for a **non-imperative appointment** to that bilingual position.
- This exclusion is based on fairness and accommodation of individuals with disabilities or health challenges that affect language acquisition.

#### 3. **Immediate Annuity Eligibility with Irrevocable Resignation**
- If a unilingual person is **eligible for an immediate annuity** under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* within **two years** of being appointed to a non-imperative bilingual position, and:
  - Submits an **irrevocable resignation** (a formal, final resignation that cannot be withdrawn) to take effect **no later than the end of that two-year period**:
  - They are **excluded** from the operation of paragraph 30(2)(a) of the Act regarding the language proficiency requirement for that appointment.
- This provision protects individuals who may be nearing retirement and wish to exit service early, without being penalized for not meeting language standards.

### **Important Clarifications and Limitations**

- **No Exclusion from Other Language or Specialized Requirements**  
  This Order **does not exempt** individuals from:
  - Requirements related to **shorthand, typing, translation, editing, proofreading, revising, writing, or interpretation**;
  - Any **specialized or expert proficiency** needed in one or both official languages.
  - Thus, even if exempted from the general bilingual proficiency requirement, individuals must still meet technical or job-specific language standards.

- **Applicability is Limited to Non-Imperative Appointments**  
  The exclusions apply **only to appointments that are non-imperative**—i.e., where the position does not require immediate bilingual capacity.  
  If a position is **imperative** (i.e., requires a person with full bilingual proficiency), the exclusion does not apply.

- **No Automatic Exemption for All Unilinguals**  
  The Order does not exempt all unilingual individuals from language requirements. Exemptions are **conditional and narrowly defined**, based on specific agreements, impairments, or resignation plans.

---

### **Effective Date and Repeal**

- The Order **comes into force on the day that Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22) comes into force**.
- As of December 31, 2005, this Order was in force and is referenced in the *Statutory Instruments 2005, No. 122*.

### **Policy and Public Interest Rationale**

This Order reflects a **balanced approach** to official language policy:

- It maintains the **principle of bilingualism** in the federal public service.
- It ensures **fairness and accessibility** for individuals with legitimate barriers to language acquisition.
- It allows for **practical, realistic appointments** without placing undue burden on individuals or the public service system.
- It supports **workforce diversity and inclusion**, recognizing that not all individuals can or will achieve full bilingualism due to personal, health, or educational circumstances.

### **Conclusion**

The **Public Service Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order** is a targeted and equitable regulatory tool designed to:

✅ Allow individuals with valid reasons (e.g., training commitments, impairments, retirement plans) to be appointed to bilingual positions without being required to meet full official language proficiency immediately.  
✅ Ensure that language requirements are applied in a way that is **practicable and in the public interest**.  
✅ Maintain accountability and fairness by providing clear pathways (e.g., training, reassignment) for individuals who fail to meet language standards within a defined timeframe.

It represents a significant step in adapting federal employment policy to accommodate diversity, health needs, and realistic career progression—without undermining the core values of official bilingualism in Canada’s public service.
