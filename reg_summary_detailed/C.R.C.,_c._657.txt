**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Egg Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Canadian Egg Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*

---

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Canadian Egg Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*.

---

**Key Definitions:**

1. **Agency**  
   Refers to the *Canadian Egg Marketing Agency* (also referred to as the "Office" in the regulation). This body is responsible for administering and enforcing the pricing provisions under these regulations. It sets the minimum prices for eggs in interprovincial and export markets and oversees compliance.

2. **Egg**  
   Defined as "egg of a hen." This specifically refers to eggs laid by hens and excludes eggs from other animals (e.g., duck, quail, or other poultry species).

3. **Hen**  
   Defined as a hen of any class of the domestic chicken belonging to the species *Gallus domesticus*. This includes all types of domestic hens—whether laying or non-laying, and regardless of breed or class—within the standard domestic chicken species.

---

**Scope of Application:**  
These Regulations apply **only** to the **marketing of eggs** in the following contexts:
- **Interprovincial trade** (the movement and sale of eggs between provinces in Canada)
- **Export trade** (the sale or shipment of eggs outside of Canada)

They do **not** apply to:
- Domestic consumption
- Sales within a single province
- Sales to retail consumers in local markets (unless such sales are part of interprovincial or export supply chains)

---

**Core Provisions:**

1. **Minimum Selling Price (Prohibition of Underpricing)**  
   *No person shall sell or offer to sell eggs at less than the minimum price from time to time determined by the Agency.*  
   - This means that all sales of eggs in interprovincial and export markets must meet or exceed the price set by the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency.
   - The Agency has the authority to establish and periodically adjust these minimum prices based on market conditions, supply, demand, and other economic factors.
   - This provision protects producers from price suppression and ensures a stable, fair market for egg producers.

2. **Minimum Buying Price (Prohibition of Underbidding)**  
   *No person shall buy eggs at less than the minimum price from time to time determined by the Agency.*  
   - This provision prevents buyers (such as processors, distributors, or exporters) from purchasing eggs at prices below the Agency-set minimum.
   - It ensures that egg producers receive a fair and consistent price for their product, regardless of market fluctuations.
   - This protects producers from being exploited by intermediaries or large buyers who might otherwise undercut prices.

**Status and Revocation Note:**  
The regulation includes a note stating:  
> [Revoked, SOR/80-891, s. 1]

This indicates that **the regulation was officially revoked** on the date specified in *SOR/80-891* (Statutory Order 80-891), section 1.  
- *SOR* stands for "Statutory Orders of the Government of Canada."
- The revocation means that **these regulations are no longer in force** and do not apply to current egg pricing in Canada.

---

**Interpretation and Implications of Revocation:**

- The revocation suggests that the Canadian government has **replaced or superseded** this regulation with a more modern or comprehensive framework for egg pricing and market regulation.
- The current system of egg pricing in Canada likely operates under different mechanisms—potentially through market-based pricing, producer cooperatives, or other regulatory instruments—rather than centralized minimum price controls.
- The removal of these specific price controls may reflect a shift toward market-driven pricing, greater producer autonomy, or a recognition that price floors are no longer necessary or effective in the current market structure.

---

**Conclusion:**  

The *Canadian Egg Pricing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations* were designed to establish **minimum prices** for eggs in interprovincial and export markets to ensure fair pricing for producers and prevent exploitation by buyers. However, these regulations have been **revoked**, meaning they are **no longer legally enforceable**. Their original intent—protecting producers through price floors—has been superseded by current market practices or updated legislation. As such, the current egg pricing framework in Canada operates under different rules, likely based on market forces, supply chain agreements, or other regulatory mechanisms not tied to centralized minimum prices.

**Note for Stakeholders:**  
Producers, distributors, and exporters involved in the egg industry should consult current federal or provincial regulations (such as those under the *Agricultural Marketing Act* or provincial agricultural policies) to understand current pricing and market rules.
