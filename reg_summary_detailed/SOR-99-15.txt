**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Maximum Amount for Agreements with Governments Order

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Nunavut Act*, specifically **paragraph 73(2.1)(b)a**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to prescribe maximum amounts for agreements entered into with governments.

**Statutory Basis:**  
- **S.C. 1998, c. 15, s. 13(3)** – This section provides the legal framework for the issuance of the Order.  
- **S.C. 1993, c. 28** – This is the original enactment of the Nunavut Act, which establishes the foundational authority for such financial provisions.

**Key Provision:**  
The Order prescribes a **maximum amount of $15,000,000 (fifteen million Canadian dollars)** that may be used for agreements entered into between the Government of Nunavut and other Canadian governments (e.g., federal, provincial, or territorial governments).

**Purpose:**  
This regulation serves to establish a clear financial cap to ensure transparency, fiscal responsibility, and accountability in intergovernmental agreements. It defines the upper limit within which the Government of Nunavut may enter into agreements with other governments, such as joint projects, infrastructure initiatives, or policy collaborations. This helps prevent uncontrolled or excessive expenditures and ensures that such agreements are within the financial framework approved by the federal and territorial authorities.

**Scope of Application:**  
- Applies specifically to **agreements with other governments** (including federal, provincial, and territorial governments).  
- Does not extend to agreements with Indigenous communities, private entities, or non-governmental organizations unless otherwise specified.  
- The $15 million cap applies to the total value of all such agreements made during the period governed by this Order.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means that it becomes legally binding and enforceable immediately upon official publication, ensuring timely implementation of the financial framework.

**Significance:**  
This regulation is a key component of the financial governance structure of Nunavut. It reflects the principle of fiscal prudence and ensures that intergovernmental cooperation is conducted within defined financial boundaries. It also supports the Government of Nunavut’s ability to engage in strategic partnerships while maintaining fiscal accountability to the Nunavut Legislature and the broader Canadian government.

**Note on Interpretation:**  
The reference to “paragraph 73(2.1)(b)a” of the Nunavut Act indicates that this provision is part of a broader framework governing financial powers and agreements. The specific wording in the Act likely outlines conditions under which such maximum amounts may be set, including consultation requirements, approval processes, or reporting obligations—though these are not detailed in the Order itself.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a practical and enforceable financial instrument that enables the Government of Nunavut to enter into intergovernmental agreements with a maximum total value of $15 million. It enhances transparency, ensures fiscal responsibility, and supports effective collaboration with other levels of government in Nunavut’s development and governance.
