## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Cost of Borrowing (Retail Associations) Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- **Issued by**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Legal Authority**: Sections 385.14 to 385.23a and section 463b of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCA).
- **Purpose**: To establish standardized rules for calculating and disclosing the **cost of borrowing** to retail borrowers in credit agreements (loans, lines of credit, credit cards), ensuring transparency, fairness, and consumer protection.

> These regulations apply specifically to **retail credit associations** (e.g., credit unions, co-ops) and are not applicable to business loans, student loans, or loans governed by other federal or provincial legislation.

### 📌 **2. Definitions (Key Terms Used in the Regulations)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* |
| **APR** | Annual Percentage Rate — the cost of borrowing expressed as an annual rate on the principal. |
| **Borrower** | A person to whom a loan is offered or who applies for a credit card/line of credit. |
| **Credit Agreement** | Any agreement involving a loan, line of credit, or credit card. |
| **Disbursement Charge** | A fee to cover costs of arranging, documenting, insuring, or securing the loan (excluding certain charges). |
| **Hypothec** | A mortgage or lien on immovable property. |
| **Principal** | The amount borrowed; excludes interest or other borrowing costs. |
| **Public Index** | A variable interest rate published weekly in a widely circulated newspaper or media, used as a benchmark for variable rates. |

---

### 📌 **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations **apply to credit agreements** **except** when:
- The loan is for **business purposes** of the borrower;
- The borrower is **not a natural person** (e.g., a corporation or trust);
- The loan is under the *Canada Student Loans Act*;
- The loan is governed by a **provincial or federal student loan law** that requires interest or discount disclosure.

> This ensures that the rules focus on **retail consumer lending** and do not overlap with specialized or government-backed loan programs.

---

### 📌 **4. Calculation of the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**

#### ✅ For Loans (excluding credit cards/lines of credit):
The APR must reflect the **total cost of borrowing**, including interest and all other charges (e.g., administrative, insurance, appraisal), expressed as an annual rate on the principal.

**Formula**:
> APR = (Total Cost of Borrowing / Principal) × (100 / Term in Years)

Where:
- **Total Cost of Borrowing** = Sum of all interest and fees over the loan term.
- **Principal** = Average outstanding balance at the end of each period (before subtracting payments).
- **Term** = Duration of the loan in years (rounded to at least two decimal places).

#### 🔍 Key Rules for APR Calculation:
| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Rounding** | APR may be rounded to the **nearest eighth of a percent** (e.g., 5.125%). |
| **Payment Application Order** | Each payment is applied **first to accumulated cost of borrowing**, then to the outstanding principal. |
| **Time Periods** | - 1 month = 1/12 year<br>- 1 week = 1/52 year<br>- 1 day = 1/365 year |
| **Variable Rates** | The rate used must be the one **in effect on the date of calculation**. |
| **No Installments** | If no payments are made, APR is calculated assuming repayment in **one lump sum** at the end of the term. |
| **New Credit Agreements** | A loan based on an outstanding balance from a prior agreement is treated as a **new credit agreement** for APR purposes. |

#### ✅ For Credit Cards and Lines of Credit:
- If **fixed interest rate**: The APR is simply the **fixed annual interest rate**.
- If **variable interest rate**: The APR is the **rate in effect on the date of disclosure**.

> In both cases, **no additional cost of borrowing** (beyond interest) is included in the APR.

### 📌 **5. What Constitutes the "Cost of Borrowing"**

The total cost of borrowing includes:
- Interest or discount under section 385.14 of the Act;
- **Administrative charges** (e.g., fees for services, transactions);
- **Lawyer/notary fees** required by the association (but not optional);
- **Insurance charges** (excluding those for optional insurance or property title defects);
- **Broker fees** if included in the amount borrowed and paid directly by the association;
- **Appraisal, inspection, or surveying fees** for property securing the loan (if required by the association).

> These charges are **included** only if they are **incurred by the association** and are **necessary** to arrange or secure the loan.

---

### 📌 **6. What is EXCLUDED from the Cost of Borrowing**

The following **are not included** in the cost of borrowing:
- **Optional insurance** (e.g., optional coverage for the borrower’s personal assets);
- **Overdraft fees**;
- **Fees to register security interests** or obtain registry information;
- **Penalty charges** for early repayment;
- **Lawyer/notary fees** not required by the association;
- **Insurance against defects in title** (if paid by the borrower);

- **Insurance against default on a high-ratio mortgage**;
- **Tax account maintenance fees** (if optional or not required for mortgage);
- **Fees to discharge a security interest**;
- **Default charges**.

> These exclusions protect borrowers from being misled by fees that are not directly tied to the loan arrangement.

---

### 📌 **7. Disclosure Requirements**

A retail association **must provide a written disclosure statement** to the borrower **before or at the time** of entering into the credit agreement.

#### ✅ Format and Presentation Rules:
| Requirement | Details |
|----------|--------|
| **Location** | - For **part of the agreement**: Must be in a **single, consolidated section** at the beginning.<br>- For **separate statement**: Must be presented **first** in the document. |
| **Information Box** | Must contain the required information in a **standardized format** (as per Schedules 1–5). |
| **Legibility** | - Font: **Minimum 12-point**, bold for titles and numbers (rates, dates, amounts)<br>- 10-point font for other text<br>- Standard spacing and margins<br>- Dark text on light background for clarity |

> The information in the box **does not need to be repeated** elsewhere — it can be **referenced** in the rest of the document.

#### ✅ Clarity and Accuracy:
- All disclosures must be **clear, simple, and not misleading**.
- If an assumption or estimate is used (e.g., future interest rate), it must be:
  - **Reasonable**, and
  - **Clearly identified** as an assumption or estimate.

> This prevents deceptive or overly optimistic projections.

### 📌 **8. Timing of Disclosure (Initial Statement)**

The initial disclosure must be provided **on or before**:
- The **earlier of**:
  - The **first payment** (excluding disbursement charges), or
  - **Two clear business days before** the agreement is entered into — **for mortgages or hypothecs**;
  - Or **on the day of agreement** — for all other loans.

> Exceptions to the timing rule:
- If the borrower **consents** in writing or orally to receive the statement for one borrower on behalf of others;
- If the borrower obtains **independent legal advice**;
- If the agreement includes a **rescission period of at least two business days**;
- If the agreement offers **favourable early payment terms** (e.g., no penalty for early repayment).

> In such cases, the timing requirement is waived.
