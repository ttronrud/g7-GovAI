### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Purpose of the Transfer**
The regulation establishes a structural reorganization within Canada’s public service framework. It moves specific administrative and operational functions—specifically related to language training and corporate support services—from the Public Service Commission (PSC) to the Canada School of Public Service (CSPS). This reflects a broader effort to enhance the capacity of public service training and development by aligning learning and development functions under a dedicated institution.

#### 2. **Effective Date**
The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2004**. This date marks a formal transition point, after which the CSPS assumes full control and supervision of the transferred functions.

#### 3. **Functions Transferred**
The following two units are transferred:

- **Language Training Canada**:  
  This unit is responsible for providing language training programs to public servants, particularly in areas such as French language proficiency, which is critical for Canada’s bilingual policy. The transfer places this function under the CSPS to better integrate language training into broader public service learning and development initiatives.

- **Corporate Services (Integrated Services)**:  
  This unit provides administrative, operational, and support services to public servants within the Learning and Development Programs Branch. "Integrated Services" typically includes functions such as human resources support, information technology services, logistics, and program coordination. Transferring these services to CSPS aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency in delivering training programs.

These functions were previously managed under the Public Service Commission, which traditionally oversees public service administration, employment standards, and career development.

#### 4. **Excluded Functions**
Despite the transfer, certain core responsibilities of the Public Service Commission remain with the PSC, specifically those defined in the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Paragraph 5(a)**: Likely relates to the PSC’s authority to administer public service employment policies, including appointment, promotion, and disciplinary actions.
- **Section 6a**: May pertain to the regulation of public service employment conditions and collective agreements.
- **Section 8**: Likely involves the PSC’s role in managing the public service’s employment equity and diversity initiatives.
- **Section 35b**: Could relate to the PSC’s oversight of public service pensions or retirement matters.
- **Section 37c**: May involve the PSC’s responsibilities in managing public service compensation or pay structures.
- **Section 41d**: Possibly deals with the PSC’s role in enforcing public service standards or disciplinary procedures.

These exclusions ensure that the PSC retains essential regulatory and employment governance powers, preserving its foundational role in public service oversight.

### **Legal Authority**
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision enables the federal government to reassign administrative responsibilities between public service institutions, particularly when aligning functions with strategic goals such as workforce development, efficiency, and modernization.

The regulation is cited in multiple statutory instruments:
- *S.C. 1996, c. 18, s. 14*  
- *S.C. 1999, c. 31, s. 185*  
- *S.C. 1992, c. 54, s. 24*  
- *S.C. 1999, c. 31, s. 186*

These references indicate that the transfer has been formally enacted and amended over time, reflecting evolving policy priorities and institutional adjustments.

### **Strategic Implications**

- **Enhanced Focus on Learning and Development**: By placing language training and corporate services under the Canada School of Public Service, the government strengthens the institutional capacity to design, deliver, and evaluate public service training programs.
  
- **Improved Efficiency and Coordination**: Centralizing these functions under CSPS allows for better integration of training initiatives with broader public service goals, including workforce readiness, diversity, and bilingualism.

- **Preservation of Governance Integrity**: By excluding key employment and regulatory functions, the regulation ensures that the Public Service Commission continues to fulfill its role as the primary regulator of public service employment and standards.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative realignment within Canada’s public service structure. It transfers operational and developmental functions—particularly those related to training and internal support services—to the Canada School of Public Service, effective April 1, 2004. However, it preserves the Public Service Commission’s essential regulatory and employment responsibilities under specific statutory provisions. This move supports a more focused, effective, and modernized public service training ecosystem while maintaining the integrity of public service governance.
