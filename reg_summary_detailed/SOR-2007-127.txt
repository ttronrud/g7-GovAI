**Detailed Summary of the Vessel Detention Orders Review Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Vessel Detention Orders Review Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities**, under **paragraph 244(c) of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (S.C. 2001, c. 26). This provision grants the government the authority to create regulations to implement and clarify procedures related to vessel detention orders, ensuring a fair and transparent process for vessels subject to such detentions.

These regulations establish a formal, two-tiered **review process** for vessel detention orders, designed to provide a mechanism for affected parties to challenge and appeal a detention decision through a structured administrative pathway.

**Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, which provides the legal framework for the regulation of maritime activities in Canada, including the powers to detain vessels under specific conditions.
  
- **Board**: Refers to the **Marine Technical Review Board (MTRB)**, established under **Section 26 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**. The Board is an independent body responsible for reviewing technical and safety-related matters involving vessels, including the validity of detention orders.

**Review Process for Vessel Detention Orders**

The regulations outline a two-stage review process that allows the authorized representative of a vessel to challenge a detention order issued under **Section 222 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**. This process is designed to ensure that detentions are justified, lawful, and based on sound technical and safety grounds.

### Stage 1: Review by the Board’s Vice-Chair

1. **Eligibility to Apply**  
   The **authorized representative** of a vessel detained under Section 222 may apply for a review of the detention order **within 30 days** of the date the notice of the detention order was served.

2. **Assignment of Review**  
   Upon receiving the application, the **National Vice-Chair** of the Marine Technical Review Board shall assign the review to a **Vice-Chair** of the Board.

3. **Decision by Vice-Chair**  
   The Vice-Chair has the authority to:
   - **Confirm** the detention order,
   - **Rescind** (cancel) the detention order, or
   - **Vary** (modify) the detention order.

4. **Notification**  
   The Vice-Chair must **notify the authorized representative** of their decision in writing.

> *Note*: This stage is the first formal administrative review and is intended to provide a timely and technical assessment of the detention’s validity.

### Stage 2: Reconsideration by the Board’s Chair

1. **Right to Appeal**  
   Within **30 days** of receiving the Vice-Chair’s decision, the authorized representative may apply to the **Chair** of the Marine Technical Review Board for a **reconsideration** of that decision.

2. **Decision by the Chair**  
   The Chair may:
   - Confirm the decision,
   - Rescind it, or
   - Vary it.

3. **Notification**  
   The Chair must notify the authorized representative of their final decision.

**Effective Date**

These Regulations come into force on the date that **Section 2 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (Chapter 26 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001) comes into force.  
This date is **July 1, 2001**.

> *Note*: The regulations were subsequently referenced in **SI/2007-65**, which confirms that they were in force as of July 1, 2007, indicating that they have remained in effect and have been reaffirmed in subsequent legal updates.

**Purpose and Significance**

This regulatory framework serves several key functions:

- **Transparency and Accountability**: Provides a clear, structured process for vessels to contest detentions, reducing the risk of arbitrary or unjustified detentions.
- **Technical Expertise**: Leverages the Marine Technical Review Board’s specialized knowledge in maritime safety and technical standards.
- **Fairness and Due Process**: Ensures that vessel operators have a meaningful opportunity to present their case before a technically competent body.
- **Legal Compliance**: Aligns with the principles of administrative justice and due process enshrined in Canadian law.

**Conclusion**

The *Vessel Detention Orders Review Regulations* establish a two-tiered administrative review mechanism for vessels detained under Section 222 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001. By allowing authorized representatives to appeal a detention order first to a Vice-Chair of the Marine Technical Review Board, and then to the Board’s Chair, the regulations ensure that detentions are subject to technical scrutiny and procedural fairness. This promotes confidence in the regulatory system, protects the rights of vessel operators, and upholds maritime safety standards through a balanced and accountable process.

These regulations remain in force and are a critical component of Canada’s maritime regulatory framework.
