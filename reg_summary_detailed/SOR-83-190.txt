## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **uniform system of accounting** for gas pipeline companies operating in Canada. It replaces the previous *Gas Pipeline Uniform Accounting Regulations* (which were repealed by SOR/2020-50, s. 6) and introduces a new, detailed framework for how gas pipeline companies must maintain, record, and report their financial and operational data.

The primary objective is to ensure **transparency, consistency, and accountability** in the financial reporting of gas pipeline operators, enabling regulators to assess financial health, operational efficiency, and compliance with national energy policy objectives.

The regulation applies only to companies authorized by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)** — formerly the National Energy Board (NEB) — to **construct or operate a gas pipeline**.
