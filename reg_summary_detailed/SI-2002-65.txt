**Detailed Summary of the National Parks of Canada Land Rents Remission Order, No. 3 (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as *National Parks of Canada Land Rents Remission Order, No. 3*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board. It is authorized under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows for the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of land rents in the public interest.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **provide rent remission to leaseholders** of public lands located within designated national parks in Canada, specifically targeting periods when rental rates were significantly higher at the beginning of a lease term than at the end. The remission aims to alleviate financial burdens on leaseholders—particularly those in long-term or recurring lease arrangements—while maintaining the integrity and conservation goals of national parks.

### **Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada National Parks Act*, which governs the establishment, management, and operation of national parks in Canada.
- **Regulations**: Refers to the *National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)*, which provide the detailed rules and procedures for leasing and occupying public lands within national parks.
- **Remission**: The cancellation or reduction of rent owed by leaseholders under specific conditions.

### **Structure and Provisions**

#### **Section 2 – Remission for Ten-Year Leases Beginning in 2000**
- **Applies to**: Leaseholders with leasehold interests in public lands located within national parks listed in **Schedule 1** of the Canada National Parks Act.
- **Lease Period**: Ten-year lease periods beginning in **2000** (i.e., 2000–2010).
- **Condition for Remission**:
  - The rent for the land must have been **fixed in 2000** under the lease agreement and in accordance with the *National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)*.
- **Amount of Remission**:
  - Equal to the difference between:
    - The **rental rate for the first four months of the third year** of the ten-year period (i.e., April–July 2003),
    - And the **rental rate for the last four months of the final year** (i.e., April–July 2010).
  - In simpler terms: If rent was high at the start of the lease (early 2000s) and lower later on, the leaseholder receives a refund equal to the difference in those rates over a four-month window.

> 💡 **Purpose**: This provision compensates leaseholders for the **disproportionate increase in rent at the beginning of long-term leases**, which may have been due to economic or administrative factors. It ensures fairness by returning the difference between peak and declining rental rates.

#### **Section 4 – Remission for Two-Year Leases Beginning in 2002**
- **Applies to**: Leaseholders with leasehold interests in public lands within national parks listed in **Schedule 1** of the Act.
- **Lease Period**: Two-year lease periods beginning in **2002** (i.e., 2002–2004).
- **Condition for Remission**:
  - The rent must have been **fixed in 2002** (or is due to be fixed) under the applicable lease and regulations.
- **Amount of Remission**:
  - Equal to the difference between:
    - The **rental rate for the first four months of the first year** (i.e., April–July 2002),
    - And the **rental rate for the last four months of the second year** (i.e., April–July 2004).

> 💡 **Purpose**: Similar to Section 2, but applied to shorter-term leases. This remission addresses the **initial overpayment** of rent at the start of a two-year lease cycle, which may have been set at a higher rate than the rate at the end of the term.

#### **Section 6 – Special Remission for the Town of Jasper, Jasper National Park**
- **Applies to**: Leaseholders with leasehold interests in public lands within **Jasper National Park**, specifically within the **Town of Jasper**.
- **Lease Condition**:
  - The annual rent for the land must be **fixed at $1.00 per annum in 2002**, as per the **Agreement for the Establishment of Local Government in the Town of Jasper** between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Municipality of Jasper.
- **Amount of Remission**:
  - Equal to the **annual rental rate under the Regulations** for the period **April 1, 2002, to July 31, 2002**.

> 💡 **Purpose**: This is a targeted and unique provision designed to support the **local governance and economic sustainability** of the Town of Jasper. The rent of $1.00 per year was likely symbolic or administrative, and this remission effectively compensates the municipality or local leaseholders for the **full rental value** of that period, which was otherwise negligible. This recognizes the importance of local autonomy and community development within national parks.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**
- The Order is issued under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to make rent remission orders when it is in the **public interest**.
- The recommendation comes from the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** and the **Treasury Board**, indicating that the decision was made after consultation with relevant departments and stakeholders.

### **Key Principles and Impacts**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Interest** | The remission is justified as being in the public interest—supporting sustainable land use, reducing financial hardship on leaseholders, and promoting equitable access to park lands. |
| **Fairness in Rent Adjustment** | Addresses disparities in rent levels across lease terms, especially where initial rates are set high and later rates decline. |
| **Targeted Relief** | Provides relief to specific lease types (long-term, short-term, and local government) to balance conservation with economic realities. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Leverages existing lease and regulation frameworks to define eligibility and calculate remission amounts without creating new administrative burdens. |

### **Significance and Context**
- This Order reflects a **pragmatic approach to land use policy** within national parks. While national parks are protected for environmental and cultural values, the presence of private leaseholders (e.g., for tourism, recreation, or infrastructure) requires a balance between conservation and economic viability.
- The remission provisions are **not retroactive or general**—they apply only to specific lease periods and conditions, ensuring clarity and accountability.
- The inclusion of the **Town of Jasper** highlights the importance of **local government involvement** in national park management and underscores the government’s recognition of community-based development.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *National Parks of Canada Land Rents Remission Order, No. 3* is a targeted, fair, and legally sound mechanism to:
- Offset unfair rent increases at the beginning of lease terms,
- Support local communities (especially in Jasper),
- Promote economic stability for leaseholders,
- And maintain the public interest in sustainable park management.

It demonstrates how federal policy can respond to real-world economic dynamics within protected natural areas, ensuring that conservation efforts do not come at an undue financial burden on legitimate land users.
