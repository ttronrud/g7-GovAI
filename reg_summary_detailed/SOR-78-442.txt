**Detailed Summary of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Employees Regulations**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**

The *Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Employees Regulations* are formally issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Regional Economic Expansion**. This issuance is grounded in **subsection 34(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSE Act)**, which empowers the Governor General to make regulations that apply the PSE Act to specific public bodies or agencies.

This regulatory instrument is therefore a **statutory rule** designed to implement the Public Service Employment Act in a specific administrative context — namely, the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA).

---

**2. Title and Citation**

The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Employees Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such in legal and administrative references.

---

**3. Scope and Application**

The key provision of these regulations is that:

> **The provisions of the Public Service Employment Act apply to all officers and employees of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration**, **except** seasonal or term employees.

This means that the standard employment rights, obligations, and procedures outlined in the Public Service Employment Act — such as terms and conditions of employment, grievance procedures, disciplinary measures, promotion policies, and employment standards — will govern the **permanent, full-time staff** of the PFRA.

Importantly, this application **overrides** a specific exclusion in the *Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act*.

---

**4. Override of Exclusion in the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act**

The regulations explicitly state that:

> *Notwithstanding subsection 6(2) of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act*, the provisions of the Public Service Employment Act apply to all officers and employees (other than seasonal or term employees) required for the carrying out of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act.

This is a critical legal point. The *Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act* (PFRA Act) may have previously excluded certain employees from the scope of public service employment standards — for instance, by classifying them as temporary or seasonal. However, these Regulations **override that exclusion** for permanent employees.

This ensures that permanent PFRA staff are entitled to the same employment protections, rights, and responsibilities as other public service employees under the broader Public Service Employment Act.

---

**5. Exclusions**

The regulations **do not apply** to:

- **Seasonal employees**  
- **Term employees**

These individuals are excluded from the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, which may reflect their temporary or project-based nature and the need for flexibility in staffing for seasonal agricultural or environmental programs.

---

**6. Purpose and Implications**

The purpose of these regulations is to:

- Ensure **consistency and fairness** in employment standards across the federal public service.
- Provide **legal clarity** regarding the status of PFRA employees.
- Align the PFRA with broader federal public service employment principles, such as equity, transparency, and job security.
- Strengthen accountability and professional standards within the administration.

This alignment supports the federal government’s goal of creating a unified, merit-based public service, even in specialized or regional agencies like the PFRA.

---

**7. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

These regulations are legally binding and enforceable under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act. They will be applied by the PFRA administration, HR departments, and relevant oversight bodies in managing employment matters.

Compliance with these regulations is mandatory for all permanent PFRA employees and their supervisors.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration Employees Regulations* establish that permanent employees of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration are subject to the full range of employment protections and standards under the Public Service Employment Act — effectively overriding a prior exclusion in the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act. This ensures that permanent staff are treated in accordance with federal public service norms, while temporary or seasonal workers remain outside the scope of these standards. The regulations reflect a commitment to equitable, transparent, and professionally governed employment practices within a key federal agricultural and environmental agency.

*Note: These regulations are part of a broader federal effort to standardize public service employment across departments and agencies, promoting fairness, accountability, and consistency in federal employment practices.*
