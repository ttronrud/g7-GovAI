**Detailed Summary of the Deposit Type Instruments Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Deposit Type Instruments Regulations* were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific provisions in several key Canadian financial regulatory acts:

- **Bank Act**: Sections 458.3a, 459.4b, 575.1c, and 576.2d  
- **Cooperative Credit Associations Act**: Sections 385.252f and 385.28g  
- **Trust and Loan Companies Act**: Sections 443.2i and 444.3j  

These sections grant the regulatory authority to establish rules governing the issuance, disclosure, and terms of **deposit-type instruments** — financial products that function similarly to deposits, such as savings accounts, term deposits, or certain types of loans offered by financial institutions.

The regulations were originally introduced in various Statutes Canada (S.C.) amendments, including:
- S.C. 2009, c. 2, s. 271, 274, 278, 291  
- S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 37, 93, 170, 368  
- S.C. 1991, c. 45, 46, 48  

**Note**: Certain definitions and provisions were repealed in **SOR/2021-181, s. 110**, particularly the definition of “institution” — which was previously broadened to include both retail cooperatives and trust and loan companies. The current version of the regulation reflects updated, more focused definitions and requirements.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Business Day**  
   - A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday.

2. **Deposit-Type Instrument**  
   - Defined identically to the meaning in **subsection 627.01(1) of the Bank Act**.

     - A **retail association** (as defined in Section 2 of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*), or  
     - A **company** (as defined in Section 2 of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*).  
   - *Note: This definition was previously broader and has been streamlined; it now excludes other types of entities such as non-retail cooperatives or non-company entities.*

4. **Interest**  
   - Any return paid by the institution in respect of the deposit, including interest, dividends, or other income derived from the instrument.

5. **Interest Rate Benchmark**  
   - Defined as per subsection 627.01(1) of the *Bank Act*.  
   - Common benchmarks include the **prime lending rate** or **benchmark rates** like the Canadian Prime Rate, SOFR, or other reference rates used to determine variable interest rates.

### **Core Disclosure Requirements**

An institution must provide **clear, simple, and non-misleading disclosures** to individuals before or at the time of entering into an agreement to issue a deposit-type instrument.

#### **Mandatory Oral and Written Disclosure (Before Agreement)**

At or before entering into an agreement, the institution must disclose the following information:

| Disclosure Element | Details |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Fixed Interest Rate** | If applicable, the annual rate of interest must be clearly stated. |
| **Variable Interest Rate** | If variable, the institution must disclose: <br> - How the rate is determined <br> - The interest rate benchmark used (e.g., prime lending rate) <br> - The benchmark rate in effect at the time of disclosure <br> - How the investor can obtain the current rate during the investment period |
| **Charges** | All fees associated with the instrument (e.g., account maintenance, early withdrawal, issuance) must be disclosed. |
| **Interest Calculation & Payment** | When interest is calculated and when it is paid (e.g., monthly, annually). |
| **Investment Period** | Start and end dates of the term. |
| **Early Redemption** | Whether the instrument can be redeemed early, and if so, the impact on interest (e.g., penalty, reduced return). |
| **Cancellation Clause** | If the agreement allows cancellation within a specified period, the duration of that period must be disclosed. |
| **Automatic Renewal** | If a new instrument can be issued automatically after maturity without a new agreement, the institution must disclose: <br> - That renewal is possible <br> - Conditions under which renewal occurs <br> - Whether the rate is fixed or variable <br> - The investment period of the new instrument <br> - Any associated charges (issuance or cancellation) |
| **Deposit Insurance Status** | If the deposit is **not eligible** for coverage by the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**, this must be clearly stated. |

> ⚠️ **Exception for Telephonic Agreements**:  
> If the agreement is made by phone, the institution is **not required to provide written disclosure at the time of agreement**. However, it **must provide the full written disclosure after** the agreement is entered into.

> ⚠️ **Exception for Electronic or Mail Agreements**:  
> If the agreement is made electronically or by mail, the institution is **not required to provide oral disclosure**. However, **before** the agreement is entered into, the institution must provide the **telephone number of a person knowledgeable about the instrument’s terms**.

---

### **Post-Issuance Disclosure Obligations**

- **New Instrument Issuance (Under Automatic Renewal Clause)**  
  If a new instrument is issued under an agreement that allows automatic renewal (paragraph 3(1)(h)), the institution must provide the **full written disclosure** about the new instrument **without delay** after issuance.

- **Mail-Based Disclosure Timing**  
  If disclosure is sent by mail, it is considered delivered **five business days after the postmark date**.

### **Amendment Disclosure**

Before changing any terms or conditions of an existing deposit-type instrument, the institution must:
- Provide **written notice** to the investor.
- Disclose the **nature of the amendment** and its **potential impact on interest payable**.

> This ensures transparency and protects investors from unexpected changes in returns or terms.

---

### **Request for Principal and Accrued Interest**

- If a person **requests** the amount of principal and accrued interest, the institution must provide this information **without delay** on the day the request is made.

- If an institution **redeems** a deposit-type instrument before maturity:
  - It must disclose **before redemption**:
    - The amount of principal and accrued interest
    - Any penalty or charge for early redemption
    - The **net amount payable** to the investor

> This protects investors from surprise redemptions and ensures fair and transparent treatment.

---

### **Advertising Requirements**

In all **advertisements** for deposit-type instruments, the institution must:

1. Disclose **how the public may obtain information** about the instruments (e.g., website, phone number, office address).

2. If the advertisement refers to **features or interest rates**, it must also disclose:
   - The **manner in which interest is accrued**
   - Any **limitations on interest payable** (e.g., caps, minimum thresholds)
   - Whether the deposit is **not eligible for CDIC insurance**

> ⚠️ **Exception**:  
> Paragraph (2)(b) does **not apply** to institutions that are subject to **subsection 378.2(2)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* or **subsection 413.1(2)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.  
> These exceptions likely apply to certain cooperative or trust-based institutions with special regulatory status or governance structures.

---

### **Right to Cancel (Automatic Renewal Agreements)**

- A person who receives a new instrument under an agreement allowing automatic renewal (paragraph 3(1)(h)) has the right to **cancel the issuance** within **at least 10 business days** of the day the instrument is issued.

> This gives consumers a cooling-off period to review the terms before committing to a long-term instrument.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **came into force on November 1, 2011**.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The *Deposit Type Instruments Regulations* serve as a critical tool to:

- **Enhance financial transparency** for retail investors.
- **Protect consumers** from misleading or hidden terms in deposit products.
- **Ensure fair and consistent disclosure practices** across financial institutions, especially those offering term deposits, savings instruments, or automatic renewal products.
- **Promote informed decision-making** by clearly outlining interest rates, fees, cancellation rights, and insurance coverage.

By requiring institutions to disclose key terms in clear, accessible language and providing a cooling-off period for automatic renewals, the regulations align with broader consumer protection principles and financial literacy goals in Canada.
