#### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Edéhzhíe (Horn Plateau)) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**  
**Issued by:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial development) in order to **facilitate the formal establishment of Edéhzhíe as a National Wildlife Area (NWA)** under Canadian environmental and conservation law.

This action ensures that the land remains protected and preserved for ecological, cultural, and scientific purposes, particularly in support of wildlife conservation and the protection of traditional lands and values of the Indigenous communities in the region.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

#### **Geographic Area**
The Order withdraws a defined parcel of land located in the **Northwest Territories**, specifically in the **vicinity of the Horn Plateau**, which is known as **Edéhzhíe**.

The land is described in **detailed, precise geographic coordinates** using the **North American Datum of 1983 (CSRS)** and the **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)** projection system. This ensures accurate mapping and legal boundary definition.

#### **Area Size**
- The total area of the withdrawn land is approximately **14,218 square kilometers (km²)**.
- This is a vast and ecologically significant region, encompassing both terrestrial and adjacent water features.

#### **Exclusion Clause**
An important exception is made for:
- **Certificate of Title 52373 (Lot 9, Group 862, Plan 61560 C.L.S.R. LTO 1111)**, held with the **Land Registry Office in Yellowknife**.
- This parcel is **excluded** from the withdrawal and remains subject to normal disposal processes.

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**

- The withdrawal from disposal is **effective for a period of two years**, beginning on the date the Order is made.
- During this period, the land **cannot be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of** through public or private means (except as explicitly excluded below).

---

### **Exclusions Where Section 2 Does Not Apply**

Despite the general withdrawal, the Order explicitly **excludes certain mineral-related activities** from being affected by the withdrawal. These are critical for ensuring continuity in existing mineral rights and operations.

The following activities are **not impacted** by the withdrawal:

1. **Mineral Prospecting Permits**
   - A person who **held a prospecting permit before the Order came into effect** may still locate a mineral claim.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims**
   - Any mineral claim that was **already located or referred to in the permit** before the Order is made may be recorded without being affected.

3. **Leasing of Recorded Claims**
   - A person with a **recorded mineral claim** may be granted a lease under the **Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations**, provided the lease covers land within that claim.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**
   - If a significant discovery licence is issued to a holder of an **exploration licence issued before the Order**, and it covers land subject to that exploration licence, the licence is not blocked.

5. **Production Licences**
   - Production licences issued under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act to holders of:
     - A **significant discovery licence** (issued before the Order), or
     - An **exploration licence** (issued before the Order),
     and covering land subject to those licences, are **not affected**.

6. **Surface Leases**
   - A surface lease may be issued to a holder of a recorded mineral claim or interest (under mining or petroleum regulations), **if required to allow the holder to exercise rights** under the claim or interest.

7. **Renewal of Interests**
   - Renewals of mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not blocked by the withdrawal.

> ✅ **Key Point**: This exclusion ensures that **existing mineral rights and ongoing operations** are not disrupted by the conservation designation, while still protecting the land from general commercial development.

---

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

1. **Conservation and Environmental Protection**  
   - The withdrawal supports the designation of Edéhzhíe as a **National Wildlife Area**, which is protected under the **Canadian Wildlife Act** and **Environment and Climate Change Canada** policy. This protects biodiversity, migratory species, and sensitive ecosystems.

2. **Indigenous Rights and Land Stewardship**  
   - Edéhzhíe is a traditional territory of the **Edéhzhíe First Nation**, and this action respects Indigenous land use, cultural heritage, and stewardship responsibilities. The withdrawal supports the co-management and conservation goals of Indigenous communities.

3. **Legal Clarity and Predictability**  
   - By clearly defining which activities are exempt, the Order provides legal certainty for mineral operators and Indigenous stakeholders, preventing unintended disruptions to existing rights.

4. **Balancing Development and Conservation**  
   - The regulation demonstrates a balanced approach: while protecting the land from general disposal, it allows for **existing and ongoing mineral activities** to continue under established regulatory frameworks.

### **Repeal Note (Clarification)**

The Order includes a **repeal clause** stating that the withdrawal applies **only in the Northwest Territories** and **in the vicinity of the Horn Plateau**. This ensures jurisdictional clarity and prevents unintended application in other regions.

---
