**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), specifically under **paragraph (b)* of the definition "department" in section 2 of the Act. It is promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.

- **Legal Significance**: Under paragraph (b)* of section 2 of the FAA, a "department" is defined as an entity established by or under the authority of the Crown, which is responsible for carrying out public functions. By designating the Commission as a department, the government affirms that it is a formal, statutory body with administrative and financial standing under the Act.
  
- **Purpose of Designation**: This classification enables the Commission to:
  - Access and use government funds;
  - Be subject to financial administration rules (such as budgeting, accounting, and reporting);

- **Legal Significance**: The "appropriate Minister" is the official responsible for overseeing and providing administrative direction to a department or inquiry established under the FAA. This designation establishes the Prime Minister as the principal point of contact and accountability for the Commission’s operations, including financial oversight, policy alignment, and reporting.

- **Implications**:
  - The Prime Minister has authority to approve funding, directives, and administrative decisions affecting the Commission.
  - The Commission operates under the Prime Minister’s broader governmental oversight, ensuring alignment with national policy and public accountability.
  - It reflects the high-level political importance of the inquiry, given that it concerns the deployment of Canadian military forces to Somalia—a significant foreign policy and national security issue.

**4. Context and Background**  
The Commission of Inquiry into the Deployment of Canadian Forces to Somalia was established to examine the circumstances, decisions, and outcomes related to Canada’s military involvement in Somalia, particularly in the early 1990s (e.g., the 1993 Canadian military mission and the subsequent events, including the U.S.-led operation and the 1993 U.S. embassy siege in Somalia). The inquiry aimed to assess the legality, effectiveness, and appropriateness of Canada’s actions.

By designating the Commission as a department and naming the Prime Minister as the appropriate Minister, the government ensures that the inquiry is treated with the formal status and financial resources necessary to conduct a thorough and independent investigation.
