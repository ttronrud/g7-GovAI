**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Pullet Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order (SOR/80-352, 1980)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Manitoba Pullet Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order*, made on September 6, 1989, under the authority of the *Manitoba Pullet Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1980-1276) and the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, establishes the regulatory framework governing the **interprovincial and export marketing of pullets** raised in the Province of Manitoba.

This Order is a key component of Manitoba’s agricultural marketing system, designed to ensure fair, orderly, and sustainable trade in pullets — young female chickens raised specifically for egg production — by controlling who may market them outside the province and under what conditions.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Primary Authority**: Section 2 of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* grants the provincial government the power to establish marketing boards and regulate the marketing of agricultural products.
- **Specific Legislative Foundation**: Section 3 of the *Manitoba Pullet Order* (passed via Order in Council P.C. 1980-1276 on May 15, 1980) empowers the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board) to issue regulations governing the interprovincial and export marketing of pullets.
- **Enabling Legislation**: The *Natural Products Marketing Act* (referred to as the "Act") provides the legal foundation for the establishment and operation of the Commodity Board.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Natural Products Marketing Act* of Manitoba. This Act establishes the legal framework for marketing boards and their regulatory powers. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act. It is responsible for administering the rules of this Order and overseeing pullet marketing. |
| **Producer** | A person who raises pullets in Manitoba, including employees of such a person. Additionally, a producer includes: <br> - A person entitled to a share of pullets under a lease or agreement with a pullet-raising person; <br> - A person who takes possession of pullets as security for a debt. |
| **Pullet** | A female domestic chicken (*Gallus domesticus*) that is less than 20 weeks of age and raised in Manitoba specifically for the purpose of producing eggs for human consumption. |

> **Note**: The definition of "pullet" is crucial — it excludes older hens and limits eligibility to young, egg-producing females raised under specific conditions.

### **Core Provision: Authorization Requirement**

> **"No producer shall market pullets in interprovincial or export trade unless the Commodity Board authorizes the producer to do so."**

This is the central regulatory requirement of the Order and has several important implications:

1. **Marketing Restriction**:  
   - Producers **cannot sell pullets outside Manitoba** (interprovincial trade) or **export them** without **prior written authorization** from the Commodity Board.

2. **Controlled Access**:  
   - The requirement ensures that only those producers who meet certain standards (e.g., compliance with production practices, quality, traceability, or market demand) are permitted to participate in broader markets.

3. **Board Oversight**:  
   - The Commodity Board retains discretion to assess applications, determine eligibility, and issue or deny marketing authorizations. This allows the Board to maintain market stability, protect producer interests, and prevent over-supply or unfair competition.

4. **Prevention of Unauthorized Trade**:  
   - Prevents unregulated or uncoordinated sales that could undermine pricing, quality control, or the integrity of the pullet market.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The Order serves several key objectives:

- **Market Stability**: Prevents market fluctuations due to uncontrolled supply or sudden surges in interprovincial or export sales.
- **Producer Protection**: Ensures that producers are not exploited by intermediaries or foreign buyers without fair access or pricing mechanisms.
- **Quality Assurance**: By limiting who can market pullets, the Board can ensure that only high-quality, properly raised pullets enter the wider market.
- **Economic Planning**: Enables the Board to manage supply and demand, especially in relation to export opportunities or seasonal shifts.
- **Traceability and Accountability**: Facilitates tracking of pullet origins, which supports food safety, animal welfare, and compliance with export standards.

---

### **Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all pullets raised in Manitoba** that are under 20 weeks of age and raised for egg production.
- Covers **all forms of trade**:
  - Sales to other Canadian provinces.
  - Sales to foreign countries (export trade).
- Applies to **all producers**, including individuals, cooperatives, and agricultural enterprises, as well as those with rights to pullets through leases or security arrangements.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- The **Commodity Board** is responsible for:
  - Receiving and reviewing applications for marketing authorization.
  - Setting criteria for approval (e.g., production records, compliance with animal welfare standards, market capacity).
  - Issuing written authorizations.
  - Monitoring compliance with the Order.
- Violations of this provision (e.g., unauthorized marketing) may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Board or relevant authorities.

---

### **Historical Context**

- This Order was originally issued in 1980 as part of a broader effort to regulate the marketing of poultry products in Manitoba.
- The 1989 date of publication reflects a formalization or update of the regulation, possibly in response to changes in market demand, export trends, or agricultural policy.
- It reflects Manitoba’s long-standing approach to managing agricultural commodities through marketing boards — a model common in other provinces for controlling supply chains and protecting producers.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Manitoba Pullet Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that:

- Defines who qualifies as a producer and what constitutes a pullet.
- Establishes a **mandatory authorization system** for any interprovincial or export trade in Manitoba-raised pullets.
- Provides the Commodity Board with the legal authority to manage and regulate the market to ensure fairness, stability, and quality.

By requiring prior approval, the Order protects the interests of Manitoba egg producers, maintains market integrity, and supports sustainable agricultural development in the province.
