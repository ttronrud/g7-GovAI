### **Detailed Summary of the Calgary International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is officially titled the **Calgary International Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes zoning restrictions and elevation controls around Calgary International Airport to ensure aviation safety, particularly in relation to aircraft approach and takeoff paths.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several critical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers to Calgary International Airport, located near and within the city of Calgary, Alberta.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A specific geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements.  
  - *Location*: Southwest corner of the Southwest Quarter of Section 12, Township 25, Range 1, West of the 5th Meridian, Alberta.  
  - *Elevation*: Deemed to be **3,531 feet above sea level** for all purposes in these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), perpendicular to its centerline.  
  - Designed to ensure safe visibility and clearance for aircraft during approach.
  - Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.
  - Each approach surface has a **1:50 slope** (1 foot rise per 50 feet horizontal run).
  - The surface rises to a horizontal line at specified vertical and horizontal distances from the runway end.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface located above and around the airport, extending beyond the approach and transitional surfaces.  
  - Designed to provide a buffer zone for aircraft at various altitudes during flight operations.  
  - Fully described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.

- **Strip**: The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.  
  - Includes runways and associated taxiways.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surfaces.  
  - Helps define safe zones for structures near the edges of runways.  
  - Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

- All **land and underwater areas** (including public road allowances) adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport,  
  **except** those that are currently part of the airport itself.

- Specifically, the regulations cover:
  1. Lands whose outer boundaries are defined in **Part II of the Schedule** (a detailed legal description of a boundary line).
  2. Lands directly beneath the **approach surfaces**, again excluding land that is part of the airport.

> This means that any land falling within the defined perimeter (as per Part II) and under the approach surfaces is subject to strict height restrictions.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibitions)**

**No person may construct, erect, or add to any building, structure, or object** on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- The **approach surface**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surface**

> This rule ensures that no structure—whether man-made or natural—creates a hazard to aircraft during landing or takeoff by obstructing the flight path.

---

#### **5. Natural Growth Exception**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural features while maintaining safety standards.

> ⚠️ Note: Section 5 is marked as **revoked by SOR/81-168, section 1** — meaning it is no longer in effect. This raises a critical point of interpretation.

---

#### **6. Detailed Boundary Description (Part II of the Schedule)**

The outer limits of the regulated land are defined by a complex, multi-segmented legal description that traces a boundary line across several sections of land in Alberta, spanning from the southwest to the northeast. Key features include:

- Begins at the **northeast corner of the southeast quarter of Section 15**, Township 25, Range 29, West of the 4th Meridian.
- Traverses through:
  - Sections 10, 3, 34
  - Road allowances (e.g., 44th Avenue NE, Rundleville Drive)
  - Blocks and lots (e.g., Block 12, Plan 7610016; Block B, Plan 4023A.G.)
- Crosses highways (Highways 1 and 2)
- Passes through various street boundaries (e.g., 25th Street NE, 40th Ave NW)
- Ends at the **northeast corner of the southeast quarter of Section 15**, Township 25, Range 29, West of the 4th Meridian — forming a closed loop.

> This boundary defines the **geographic extent** of the regulated zone, including both land and water areas, and ensures that only land within this perimeter is subject to the height restrictions.

#### **7. Approach Surface Descriptions (Part III of the Schedule)**

Each approach surface is defined with precise geometric parameters. Below is a summary of the key specifications for each runway:

| Runway | Approach Surface Description |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **34L** | 1:50 slope; rises 1,000 ft vertically and 50,000 ft horizontally; outer end 7,600 ft from centerline |
| **34R** | 1:50 slope; rises 1,000 ft vertically and 50,000 ft horizontally; outer end 8,000 ft from centerline |
| **25** | 1:50 slope; rises 200 ft vertically and 10,000 ft horizontally; outer end 2,000 ft from centerline |
| **28** | 1:50 slope; rises 200 ft vertically and 10,000 ft horizontally; outer end 2,000 ft from centerline |
| **16L** | 1:50 slope; rises 1,000 ft vertically and 50,000 ft horizontally; outer end 8,000 ft from centerline |
| **16R** | 1:50 slope; rises 1,000 ft vertically and 50,000 ft horizontally; outer end 7,600 ft from centerline |
| **10** | 1:50 slope; rises 200 ft vertically and 10,000 ft horizontally; outer end 2,000 ft from centerline |

> These surfaces are designed to provide **sufficient visual and physical clearance** for aircraft during final approach, especially in low visibility or adverse weather conditions.

#### **8. Legal and Regulatory Implications**

- **Enforcement Authority**: The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to enforce the rules, including issuing directions for removal of overgrown vegetation.
- **Revocation Note**: The provision on natural growth (Section 5) has been **revoked** by **SOR/81-168, section 1**, indicating that current regulations do not include mandatory removal of natural growth. This may suggest a shift in policy or outdated language.
- **Zoning Purpose**: The primary objective is **aviation safety** — preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.

---

#### **9. Interpretation and Practical Impact**

- **Urban Planning**: The regulation impacts land use planning, development approvals, and building permits in areas adjacent to the airport.
- **Height Restrictions**: Developers and property owners must ensure all structures (buildings, towers, trees, antennas) remain below the specified approach, outer, and transitional surfaces.
- **Flexibility**: The inclusion of natural growth as a potential issue (though revoked) shows past attempts to manage environmental factors in aviation zones.

### **Conclusion**

The **Calgary International Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive framework for managing land use and elevation around the airport to ensure aviation safety. The regulation defines precise geometric surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) that act as **vertical boundaries** for all structures. While the rule on natural growth has been **revoked**, the core height restrictions remain in force and are critical for maintaining safe flight operations.

These regulations are essential tools for urban planners, developers, and local authorities in Calgary, ensuring that growth and development do not compromise the safety
