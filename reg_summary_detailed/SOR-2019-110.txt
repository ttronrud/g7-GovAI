**Core Purpose**  
The primary objective of this Direction is to **establish clear, enforceable obligations for air carriers** when flights experience **tarmac delays of three hours or less**. These delays occur when a flight is delayed on the ground (e.g., at the airport terminal or on the runway) due to operational issues such as weather, technical problems, or air traffic control, but not due to a flight cancellation or major disruption.

The regulation ensures that passengers are treated fairly and with due regard for their rights, especially in situations where they are waiting on the tarmac or at the gate.

**Key Provisions and Obligations**

1. **Passenger Information and Communication**  
   - Carriers must provide **timely, accurate, and clear information** to passengers about the delay, including:  
     - The reason for the delay  
     - The expected duration of the delay  
     - Any changes to the original departure or arrival times  
     - Alternative arrangements (e.g., rebooking, compensation)  
   - Information must be provided **in a language the passenger understands**, and in a timely manner (e.g., within a reasonable time after the delay begins).

2. **Passenger Assistance and Support**  
   - Carriers are required to provide **reasonable assistance** to affected passengers during the delay, including:  
     - Access to food, beverages, and rest areas  
     - Comfortable seating or space to wait  
     - Access to facilities (e.g., restrooms, Wi-Fi, charging stations)  
     - Support for special needs passengers (e.g., infants, elderly, persons with disabilities)  
   - Assistance must be provided in a **professional, respectful, and non-discriminatory manner**.

3. **Minimum Standards of Treatment**  
   - The regulation sets **minimum standards** for how passengers should be treated during tarmac delays of three hours or less. These standards are designed to ensure that passengers are not subjected to poor service, neglect, or unreasonable treatment.  
   - These standards are enforceable by the **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** and serve as a baseline for carrier conduct.

4. **Supersession of Prior Guidance**  
   - This Direction **replaces all previous guidance, correspondence, or communications** issued by the Minister or the Minister’s representatives regarding tarmac delays of three hours or less.  
   - This ensures consistency, clarity, and legal enforceability in the application of passenger rights in such cases.

- Applies to **air carriers operating in Canada** under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency.  
- Applies specifically to **tarmac delays of three hours or less**.  
- Does **not apply** to:  
  - Flight cancellations  
  - Delays caused by events beyond the carrier’s control (e.g., severe weather, security issues) — though information and assistance obligations still apply  
  - Delays exceeding three hours, which are governed by other provisions or regulations (e.g., under the CTA’s provisions on longer delays or cancellations)

---

**Enforcement and Oversight**  
- The **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** is responsible for:  
  - Monitoring compliance with this Direction  
  - Investigating complaints from passengers or third parties  
  - Taking enforcement actions if carriers fail to meet their obligations

**Significance and Impact**

- It provides clarity and consistency for both carriers and passengers, reducing ambiguity in how delays are managed.  
- It reflects a broader trend in transportation regulation toward **improving passenger experience and accountability**.  
- It supports the CTA’s mandate to ensure fair, safe, and efficient transportation services.

**Conclusion**  
The *Direction Respecting Tarmac Delays of Three Hours or Less* is a critical piece of regulatory policy that establishes clear, enforceable standards for how airlines must treat passengers during short delays on the tarmac. By mandating timely communication, meaningful assistance, and minimum treatment standards, the regulation enhances passenger trust, improves service quality, and ensures accountability for carriers. It supersedes outdated or inconsistent guidance and comes into force upon registration, making it a current and binding legal requirement under Canadian transportation law.
