**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Unemployment Insurance Rate of Premium, 1996, Order*

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Employment and Immigration** and the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **section 48.1** of the *Unemployment Insurance Act*.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority granted by **section 48.1** of the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (S.C. 1994, c. 18, s. 26). This section empowers the Governor General in Council to establish and adjust the rate of premium that employees must pay for unemployment insurance coverage, based on recommendations from the relevant ministers.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
To formally set and announce the annual rate of premium that individuals employed in *insurable employment* must pay for the year **1996**.

**Key Provision:**  
The rate of premium for the year 1996 is fixed at **2.95 per cent** of an individual’s *insurable earnings*.

- **Insurable Earnings:** This refers to the portion of an employee’s wages or salaries that are subject to unemployment insurance contributions. Typically, this includes earnings up to a specified maximum threshold (which may be defined in the Act or regulations), and excludes certain non-insurable types of income (e.g., bonuses, commissions, or income from self-employment not covered under the scheme).

- **Premium Responsibility:** The premium is paid by *persons employed in insurable employment*, meaning employees who are employed under conditions that qualify them for coverage under the Unemployment Insurance program. The employer and employee may share the cost in some jurisdictions, but in this case, the regulation specifies the rate that *persons employed* (likely referring to employees) are required to pay.

**Citation:**  
This Order may be formally cited as:  
*The Unemployment Insurance Rate of Premium, 1996, Order.*

**Effective Period:**  
The rate applies specifically to the calendar year **1996**. It is not retroactive or applicable to any year prior to or after 1996, unless a subsequent order is issued.

**Significance:**  
This regulation establishes a key financial component of the unemployment insurance system in Canada (or the relevant jurisdiction) for that year. The 2.95% rate serves as a standard for calculating employee contributions to the fund, which helps ensure that the pool of funds for unemployment benefits is adequately financed. It reflects the government’s balance between maintaining sufficient funding for unemployment support and ensuring affordability for workers and employers.

**Contextual Note:**  
This order is part of a broader framework of employment insurance policy, where periodic adjustments to premium rates are made to reflect economic conditions, inflation, and changes in the cost of providing unemployment benefits.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally establishes that in 1996, employees in insurable employment were required to pay a premium of **2.95% of their insurable earnings**. It is a foundational administrative step in the operation of the unemployment insurance system, ensuring that contributions are standardized and transparent for all participants in the workforce during that fiscal year.
