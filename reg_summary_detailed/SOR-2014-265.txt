Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under **subsection 10(3)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), which authorizes the Governor in Council (the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to declare that certain federal regulations **do not apply** in a specific province — in this case, **Nova Scotia** — if equivalent or similar provincial laws are already in force.

The specific federal regulation in question is the *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations*, which was originally enacted under **subsection 93(1)** of CEPA 1999. This regulation sets out requirements to reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from coal-fired power generation across Canada.

---

#### **2. Background and Procedural Context**
- On **June 28, 2014**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed Order** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the federal CO₂ emissions reduction regulations **would not apply in Nova Scotia**.
- The publication followed a formal process under CEPA 1999, which includes:
  - Providing notice of the proposed order.
  - Allowing the public to **file comments** or **file a notice of objection**.
  - If an objection is filed, a **board of review** may be established to assess the objection and determine whether the federal regulation should apply.

This procedural step ensures transparency, public participation, and accountability in federal regulatory decisions.

#### **3. Key Reason for Non-Application: Equivalent Provincial Legislation**
The decision to exempt Nova Scotia from the federal regulation is based on the existence of **existing and enforceable provincial laws** that are considered **equivalent** or **substantially similar** to the federal rules.

Specifically, the **Government of Nova Scotia and the federal Minister of the Environment** entered into a **written agreement on May 26, 2014**, under subsection 10(3) of CEPA 1999, confirming that:

1. **Provincial laws in Nova Scotia are equivalent** to the federal *Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations*.
   - This means that Nova Scotia already has laws in place that effectively regulate CO₂ emissions from coal-fired power plants in a manner comparable to the federal regulation — including emission limits, monitoring requirements, reporting obligations, and compliance mechanisms.

2. **Provincial laws are similar to sections 17 to 20 of the federal Act**, which deal with:
   - The **investigation of alleged offences** under environmental legislation.
   - Procedures for **filing complaints**, **conducting investigations**, and **enforcing penalties**.
   - These provisions ensure that Nova Scotia has a robust system for addressing environmental violations, comparable to the federal framework.

This equivalence satisfies the legal threshold under CEPA 1999 for exemption — the federal regulation is not needed because the province already has an effective, comparable system in place.

#### **4. The Final Order**
On the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** formally issued the **Order Declaring that the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-fired Generation of Electricity Regulations Do Not Apply in Nova Scotia**.

**Key Content of the Order:**
- The federal regulation is **not applicable** in Nova Scotia.
- This means that **coal-fired power plants in Nova Scotia are not subject to the federal CO₂ emission reduction requirements**.
- The regulation is **exempted from enforcement** in the province, even though it exists nationally.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on **July 1, 2015**.

This date marks the point at which the exemption becomes legally binding and operational in Nova Scotia.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Regulatory Exemption**: Nova Scotia is not required to adopt or enforce the federal CO₂ emission reduction rules for coal-fired power generation.
- **Provincial Autonomy**: The decision reflects the principle of **federal-provincial cooperation** and recognizes that provinces can manage environmental regulation through their own legislative frameworks, provided those frameworks are equivalent in scope and effectiveness.
- **Environmental Protection Continuity**: Despite the exemption, Nova Scotia’s existing environmental laws — particularly those related to emissions and enforcement — are assumed to provide **adequate environmental protection**.
- **Policy Flexibility**: It allows Nova Scotia to pursue its own energy policy, including decisions around coal plant operations, energy transition, and climate goals, without being constrained by federal mandates.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**
- This exemption is **not a waiver of environmental protection**, but rather a recognition of **substantive equivalence** between federal and provincial laws.
- It aligns with the broader framework of CEPA 1999, which allows for **regulatory harmonization** and **avoidance of duplication** when provinces have equivalent or similar legislation.
- The agreement between the federal and provincial governments demonstrates a **collaborative approach** to environmental governance.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation legally and formally **exempts Nova Scotia from the federal regulation on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electricity generation**, due to the presence of **equivalent and functionally similar provincial laws**. The decision is based on a formal agreement between the federal and provincial governments and follows due process, including public comment and opportunity to object. The exemption takes effect on **July 1, 2015**, and reflects a practical and legally sound approach to environmental regulation that respects provincial jurisdiction while maintaining environmental standards.
