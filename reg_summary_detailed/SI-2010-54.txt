### **Regulatory Summary**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Designating Shoreline Lands Along Great Slave Lake for Inclusion in Land Grants  

**Governing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, which grants the government the power to designate certain lands for inclusion in land grants, particularly those adjacent to water bodies.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Subject Lands:**  
   The regulation applies to lands located **within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of **Great Slave Lake**, situated in the **Northwest Territories**.

2. **Inclusion in Land Grants:**  
   Any future grant of land (whether through sale, lease, or other conveyance) that includes land within the Northwest Territories **must include** the specified shoreline strip. This means that landowners or grant recipients cannot be granted land that excludes this 100-foot buffer zone along the lake’s edge.

3. **Specific Land Reference:**  
   The regulation specifically references a defined parcel of land:  
   > *"All that portion of Lot 4, Block C, in the Northwest Territories, as that lot is shown on a plan of survey of plan number 93648 in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa, a copy of which is filed in the Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at Yellowknife under number 4172."*

   This indicates that the regulation is not only general but also **applies to a specific parcel**—Lot 4, Block C—where the 100-foot shoreline strip is to be included in any land grant involving that lot.

4. **Purpose and Intent:**  
   The inclusion of this shoreline land in land grants is likely intended to:
   - Protect **public access** and **environmental integrity** of the lake shoreline.
   - Ensure **conservation of natural resources** and **cultural or traditional use rights** by Indigenous communities.
   - Comply with federal land management policies that recognize the importance of riparian zones.
   - Prevent fragmentation or exclusion of land parcels from critical ecological or cultural areas.

5. **Legal Effect:**  
   This regulation is binding and enforceable under the Territorial Lands Act. It establishes a **mandatory inclusion clause** in all land grants involving the specified lands, ensuring consistency and legal clarity in land administration.

### **Administrative Context**

- The regulation is issued by the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, reflecting the federal government’s responsibility for land and resource management in northern Canada.
- The reference to **Canada Lands Surveys Records** and the **Land Titles Office in Yellowknife** indicates that the land description is officially recorded and legally recognized.
- The inclusion of a **plan number (93648)** and **file number (4172)** ensures traceability and legal precision in land title records.

### **Implications**

- **For Indigenous Communities:** This regulation may support the protection of traditional lands and access rights along Great Slave Lake, especially if the shoreline area holds cultural, spiritual, or subsistence significance.
- **For Developers or Landowners:** Any application for a land grant involving Lot 4, Block C, or any land adjacent to Great Slave Lake must now include the 100-foot shoreline buffer, regardless of whether the land is being granted for residential, commercial, or industrial use.
- **For Environmental Protection:** The 100-foot buffer helps preserve the ecological health of the lake’s shoreline, reducing erosion, habitat disruption, and pollution risks.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a specific, legally binding directive that ensures the **protection and inclusion of a 100-foot shoreline buffer** along Great Slave Lake—particularly within Lot 4, Block C—within any future land grant. It reflects a commitment to environmental stewardship, Indigenous land rights, and sound land administration under federal territorial law.

It serves as a practical implementation of paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act, providing clarity and consistency in how shoreline lands are treated in land transactions in the Northwest Territories.
