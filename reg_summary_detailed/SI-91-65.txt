**Detailed Summary of the Exclusion Approval Order for Certain Persons and Certain Positions (Air Traffic Control Group), 1991**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, formally titled *The Exclusion Approval Order for certain persons and certain positions (Air Traffic Control Group), 1991*, is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA). It approves the Public Service Commission’s decision to **exclude specific air traffic controller appointments**—both in training and operational roles—from the application of two key provisions of the Act:  
- **Section 10** (relating to qualifications and eligibility for appointment),  
- **Subsection 21(1)** (granting the right of appeal against appointments).

The Order applies specifically to air traffic controllers participating in two internal recruitment programs within the **Department of Transport**:
1. The **Selection by Seniority Program for Operational Training**
2. The **Transfer Down Program**

The scope is limited to the period from **May 1, 1991, to December 31, 1996**.

---

### **Background and Rationale**

The Public Service Commission determined that:
- It would **not be practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service** to apply **Section 10** of the Public Service Employment Act to appointments of air traffic controllers in training or operational roles, **except for language skills**.
- Applying Section 10 (which typically requires formal qualifications and competencies beyond language) to these appointments would create administrative burdens and undermine the efficiency and operational needs of the Department of Transport.
- The Commission also concluded that **subsections 21(1)** of the Act—normally granting individuals the right to appeal appointments—should **not apply** to certain appointments involving air traffic controllers in these programs, because:
  - The appointments were made through structured, merit-based internal programs (seniority and transfer down),
  - Appeals would disrupt operational continuity and training schedules,
  - The exclusion ensures that the selection process remains stable and predictable for the critical and safety-sensitive role of air traffic control.

This Order formalizes and approves those decisions by the Commission, allowing the exclusion of these appointments from the standard employment rules that govern eligibility and appeal rights.

### **Key Provisions and Exclusions Approved**

The Order approves five distinct exclusions, each targeting a different category of appointment and right:

#### 1. **Exclusion from Section 10 (Qualifications) – Training Positions**
> *Applies to:* Air traffic controllers participating in the **Selection by Seniority Program for Operational Training** or the **Transfer Down Program**  
> *Position type:* Training positions in the Department of Transport  
> *Timeframe:* May 1, 1991 – December 31, 1996  
> *Effect:*  
> - The requirement under Section 10 (which normally governs eligibility based on qualifications, experience, and other criteria) **does not apply** to these training appointments.  
> - This means that appointments to training positions for air traffic controllers in these programs **do not need to meet standard qualification thresholds** (beyond language skills), allowing for more flexible and expedient placement based on seniority or internal mobility.

#### 2. **Exclusion from Section 10 (Qualifications) – Operational Positions**
> *Applies to:* Air traffic controllers who have **successfully completed** their training in either the Selection by Seniority or Transfer Down Program  
> *Position type:* Operational positions in the Department of Transport  
> *Timeframe:* May 1, 1991 – December 31, 1996  
> *Effect:*  
> - Once trained and certified, these controllers are **not subject to the qualification requirements** under Section 10 (again, except for language skills).  
> - This allows the Department of Transport to appoint qualified air traffic controllers directly into operational roles without requiring additional formal qualifications or certifications beyond those already met during training.

#### 3. **Exclusion from Subsection 21(1) – Appeal Rights – Training Appointments**
> *Applies to:* Persons who, **but for this Order**, would have had the right to appeal appointments to training positions  
> *Timeframe:* May 1, 1991 – December 31, 1996  
> *Effect:*  
> - Individuals who would otherwise have been entitled to appeal appointments to training positions (under subsection 21(1)) **do not have that right**.  
> - This removes the possibility of appeal for appointments made through the Selection by Seniority or Transfer Down programs during the specified period, ensuring administrative stability and reducing delays in training placements.

#### 4. **Exclusion from Subsection 21(1) – Appeal Rights – Operational Appointments**
> *Applies to:* Persons who, **but for this Order**, would have had the right to appeal appointments to operational positions  
> *Timeframe:* May 1, 1991 – December 31, 1996  
> *Effect:*  
> - Those who would otherwise have had the right to appeal appointments to **operational roles** after successful training **do not have that right**.  
> - This supports the operational continuity of air traffic control services by preventing appeals that could delay or disrupt staffing.

#### 5. **Exclusion from Subsection 21(1) – Appeal Rights – Uncompleted or Terminated Training**
> *Applies to:* Persons who, **but for this Order**, would have had the right to appeal appointments to positions in the Department of Transport for air traffic controllers who:
> - Did **not complete** their training, or  
> - **Terminated training without completion**  
> *Timeframe:* May 1, 1991 – December 31, 1996  
> *Effect:*  
> - Even if a candidate failed to complete training, or left early, those individuals **do not have the right to appeal** their appointment or proposed appointment to any position in the Department of Transport.  
> - This prevents legal challenges and appeals that could arise from incomplete or discontinued training programs, ensuring that the system remains administratively sound and focused on completed training outcomes.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **subsection 41(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State) to approve exclusions from the operation of certain provisions of the Act when the Public Service Commission determines such exclusions are **not practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service**.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Operational Efficiency**: To ensure that the Department of Transport can staff air traffic control positions quickly and efficiently without being hampered by standard appeal or qualification requirements.
2. **Stability and Predictability**: To provide a clear, consistent pathway for air traffic controllers to move from training to operational roles through seniority or transfer programs.
3. **Safety and Continuity**: To maintain uninterrupted air traffic control operations by avoiding delays caused by appeals or qualification reviews.
4. **Internal Mobility**: To support internal promotion and transfer mechanisms (especially the Transfer Down Program), which allow experienced personnel to move into training or operational roles based on seniority or performance.
5. **Administrative Feasibility**: To avoid the administrative burden of applying broad eligibility and appeal rules to a specialized, high-stakes profession.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Applicability is time-bound**: The exclusions only apply from **May 1, 1991, to December 31, 1996**.
- **Limited to air traffic controllers**: The Order applies only to individuals in the air traffic control group.
- **Excludes only qualifications other than language skills**: Language proficiency (e.g., English, French) remains subject to standard requirements.
- **Does not apply to other public service groups or roles**: The exclusions are specific to air traffic controllers and their training/operational appointments.

### **Significance and Implications**

- This Order reflects a **special exception** to standard public service employment rules, recognizing the unique operational demands and safety-critical nature of air traffic control.
- It demonstrates how public service regulations can be adapted to meet **sector-specific needs**, especially in high-stakes, time-sensitive fields.
- It establishes a precedent for **flexible appointment and appeal rules** in specialized technical or operational roles, which may be referenced in future policy decisions.
