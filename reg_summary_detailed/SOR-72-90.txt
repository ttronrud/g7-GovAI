**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations* are a set of Canadian government regulations enacted under the authority of the Governor General in Council, based on recommendations from the Secretary of State for External Affairs and the Minister of Finance. These regulations were passed pursuant to **Vote Item 22a in Schedule B of Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**, and are designed to govern the **determination and payment of claims** by Canadian citizens against the **Government of the Socialist Republic of Romania** and its citizens.

These regulations apply specifically to claims arising from **Romanian nationalization, expropriation, administrative seizures, and other similar measures** that occurred before the signing of a key agreement between Canada and Romania in 1971. The regulations also cover claims stemming from the **Treaty of Peace with Romania (1947)**.

The regulations are formally known as the **Foreign Claims (Romania) Settlement Regulations** and are administered through the **Foreign Claims Commission (Commission)**.
