### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the **Allocation Method Order (Beef and Veal)**, was issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** under **paragraph 6.2(2)(a)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*. It **repeals the previous Allocation Method Order — Beef and Veal** dated April 19, 1995, and replaces it with a new, updated method for allocating the annual import access quantity for **beef and veal** into Canada.

The purpose of this Order is to establish a **fair, transparent, and performance-based system** for distributing limited import quotas of beef and veal — particularly those not originating from Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries — among Canadian applicants (processors, retailer-processors, and distributors).

### **2. Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Export and Import Permits Act*. |
| **Applicant** | A resident of Canada who applies for an import allocation. |
| **Beef and Veal** | Specifically defined as certain types of bovine meat classified under specific tariff items in the Customs Tariff (see Schedule). These include: <br> - Carcasses/half-carcasses (0201.10.10, 0202.10.10) <br> - Cuts with bone in (0201.20.10, 0202.20.10) <br> - Boneless cuts (0201.30.10, 0202.30.10) <br> *Excludes products from FTA countries.* |
| **Distributor** | A business that buys beef and veal and resells them; must maintain or rent a warehouse and/or trucks or purchase related services to carry on trade. *Excludes commission brokers.* |
| **FTA Country** | A country where imports of beef and veal are exempt from the tariff rate quota due to a Free Trade Agreement with Canada. |
| **Process** | Any substantial change in the appearance or nature of beef/veal (e.g., de-boning, slicing, thermal processing, preserving, dehydrating, fermenting, rendering, fractionating, defibrinating). *Excludes dressing, trimming, refrigeration, freezing, packaging, or defrosting.* |
| **Processor** | A person who processed beef and veal at their own facilities during the **12-month period ending September 30** of the prior calendar year. |
| **Retailer-Processor** | A retailer who processed beef and veal at their own facilities during the same 12-month period (ending September 30). |
| **Under-Utilization** | When an applicant uses **less than 90%** of their allocated import quantity. |

---

### **3. Allocation Method for Import Access Quantity (General Rule)**

For **each calendar year**, the total import access quantity is divided between **processors and retailer-processors** and **distributors** as follows:

| Applicant Type | Share of Import Access Quantity | Allocation Basis |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **Processors & Retailer-Processors** | **75%** | Proportional to the amount of beef and veal **not originating in an FTA country** that they processed at their own facilities during the **12-month period ending September 30** of the prior calendar year. |
| **Distributors** | **25%** | Proportional to their **imports of beef and veal not from FTA countries** during the same 12-month period. |

> ✅ This structure gives **greater access** to processors and retailers who process meat domestically — incentivizing domestic processing and reducing reliance on imported raw materials.

---

### **4. Special Provision for the 2015 Calendar Year**

Due to specific circumstances (e.g., industry disruptions or policy adjustments), the allocation method for **2015** was modified:

- Processors and retailer-processors receive **75%** of the total import access quantity, based on **one of two base periods** selected by the applicant:
  - The **16-month period ending April 30, 2003**, **prorated to a 12-month equivalent** (i.e., 12/16 of the actual period), or
  - The **12-month period from August 1, 2013, to July 31, 2014**.
- Distributors receive **25%**, based on their imports during the **base period chosen**.

> 🔍 This provision reflects a **policy shift** to allow applicants to use a more recent or relevant performance history (e.g., post-2013) rather than relying solely on the standard September 30 cutoff, possibly due to market changes or supply chain issues.

---

### **5. Utilization and Penalties for Under-Utilization**

#### **(a) Threshold for Reduction (if allocation ≥ 100,000 kg)**
- If an applicant with an allocation of **100,000 kg or more** has used **20% or less** of their allocation by **July 1** of the calendar year:
  - Their **remaining allocation is reduced by 50%** for that year.

> ⚠️ This is a **strong incentive** to use imported beef and veal promptly. It prevents waste and ensures efficient use of the limited import quota.

#### **(b) Reduction in Future Allocation Due to Under-Utilization**
- If an applicant **under-uses** their allocation (i.e., uses less than 90%):
  - Their **eligibility for the next year’s allocation is reduced** by the **percentage of the allocation not utilized**.
  - Example: If an applicant uses only 80% of a 100,000 kg allocation, their next year’s allocation is reduced by 20%.

> ✅ This creates a **performance-based mechanism** — applicants who do not use their allocation are penalized, encouraging efficient use.

#### **(c) Exception to Under-Utilization Penalty**
- If the **total unused amount is less than 9,000 kg**, the penalty under subsection (4) **does not apply**.

> 📌 This protects small-volume users from being unfairly penalized for minor under-use.

#### **(d) Returning Allocations**
- If an applicant, **on or before October 1** of a given year, **writes to the Minister** and formally returns a specified portion of their allocation:
  - That **returned portion is considered "used"** for the purposes of under-utilization calculations.

> ✅ This allows flexibility for applicants to adjust their usage plans and avoid penalties due to over-allocation or temporary storage.

## **Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Domestic Processing** | By giving processors and retailer-processors a larger share (75%), the policy encourages domestic value-added processing, supporting Canadian food industries. |
| **Ensure Efficient Use of Quotas** | Penalties for under-utilization and the 20% threshold ensure that import access is not wasted or hoarded. |
| **Support Fair Competition** | Allocation is based on actual processing or import history, not arbitrary criteria. |
| **Flexibility in Historical Data** | The 2015 exception allows applicants to use alternative performance periods, improving fairness during transitional periods. |
