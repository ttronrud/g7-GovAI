### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Disclosure of Charges Applicable to Personal Deposit Accounts**

Every trust or loan company must:

- **Disclose all charges** applicable to personal deposit accounts (e.g., savings, checking accounts) to customers and the public.

  - **Displayed and made available** at:
    - All company branches where products/services are offered,
    - All points of service,
    - On the company’s official websites offering services in Canada.

> This ensures that customers have access to fee information at every touchpoint where they interact with the company.

#### **2. Notification of New or Increased Charges (Personal Deposit Accounts)**

When a company introduces a new charge or increases an existing one for personal deposit accounts, it must notify affected customers **in advance**.

##### **For Customers Receiving Statements of Account:**
- A **written notice** must be sent to the customer **at least 30 days before** the effective date of the change.
- If the customer has written instructions to receive notices on behalf of another person, the notice must be sent to that person **at least 30 days before** the change.

  - At **all non-controlled access ATMs** (i.e., public ATMs not requiring authentication or access control),
  - Advising customers of the increase and how to obtain further details.

> This provision ensures that even customers who do not receive regular statements are adequately informed about changes in fees.

#### **4. Notification of Changes to Non-Personal Deposit Account Charges**

When a company increases a charge related to any of the services listed above, it must:

- For customers who receive statements:
  - Provide a **written notice at least 30 days before** the effective date.
- For customers who do not receive statements:
  - Display a **notice for at least 60 days** before the change at:
    - All branches,

    - On the company’s websites.

> This ensures that all customers — regardless of whether they receive statements — are given sufficient time to understand fee changes.

> **Exception:**  
> Section 6 (notification requirement) **does not apply** if a customer has **agreed in writing** to a fee that differs from what is required to be disclosed.  
> This allows for customer agreements (e.g., in a contract or waiver) that explicitly waive the need for prior notice of certain fees.

---

#### **5. Maintenance of a Public Charges List**

Each company must maintain a **public list** of:
- All charges applicable to deposit accounts,
- The **usual amount** charged for services normally provided.

This list must be:
- Kept at:
  - All branches where products/services are offered,
  - All points of service,
  - On all websites offering services in Canada.

> The list is a **centralized, accessible resource** for customers to understand typical fees.

---

#### **6. Availability of the Charges List on Request**

On request, the company must:
- Make the charges list **available for inspection during business hours** at:
  - All branches,
  - All points of service.

> This ensures transparency and gives customers the right to verify fee information directly.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Consumer Protection:**  
   To prevent surprise fees by requiring clear, timely, and accessible disclosure of charges.

2. **Transparency and Fairness:**  
   To ensure that both individual and institutional customers understand the cost of financial services.

3. **Enforcement of Accountability:**  
   By mandating advance notice of fee changes, the regulations hold financial institutions accountable for fee increases.

4. **Accessibility:**  
   The requirement to display information in physical locations (branches, points of service) and online ensures that all customers — including those without regular account statements — can access fee details.

5. **Prevention of Misinformation:**  
   The requirement to specify whether a statement includes all charges or not helps avoid misleading customers.

---

### **Key Exceptions and Limitations**

- **Customer Agreements:**  
  If a customer explicitly agrees in writing to a fee that differs from the standard disclosure, the company is **not required** to provide advance notice of that fee.  
  → This allows for flexibility in customer contracts, but only if the agreement is clearly documented.

- **Non-Applicability to Non-Personal Accounts:**  
  The regulations apply to services related to **deposit accounts**, not to lending, investment, or other non-deposit financial products.

---

### **Compliance and Enforcement**

While the regulations do not specify penalties, they are enforced through:
- The *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which gives the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (or relevant regulatory body) authority to investigate non-compliance.
- Potential administrative or financial penalties for failure to comply with disclosure requirements.

Failure to meet these obligations could result in reputational damage, consumer complaints, or regulatory action.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Disclosure of Charges (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* represent a significant step toward **financial transparency and consumer empowerment** in Canada. By mandating clear, timely, and accessible disclosure of fees related to personal and non-personal deposit account services, the regulations help ensure that customers can make informed decisions about their banking relationships.

The rules are comprehensive, covering both **routine fees** and **changes over time**, and are implemented across multiple channels — in person, at ATMs, and online — ensuring broad accessibility.

These regulations remain a foundational element of consumer financial protection in the Canadian banking sector and continue to influence modern financial disclosure standards.
