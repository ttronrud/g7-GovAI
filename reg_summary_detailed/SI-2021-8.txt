### **Key Provisions and Content Summary:**

1. **Purpose and Context:**
   - The proclamation recognizes the global impact of the **coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)** pandemic, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on **March 11, 2020**.
   - It acknowledges the **collective courage and sacrifice** of Canadians during the pandemic, including:
     - The dedication of healthcare and essential workers.
     - The personal and societal disruptions faced by families, communities, and individuals.
     - The economic strain on businesses and the educational challenges faced by young Canadians.
   - It emphasizes the importance of **honoring those who lost their lives** to the pandemic.
   - It reaffirms the need for continued national support for those affected and a shared resolve to **end the pandemic**.

2. **Legal Basis:**
   - The proclamation is authorized by **Order in Council P.C. 2021-127**, issued on **March 8, 2021**, which directed the Government of Canada to issue a proclamation designating March 11, 2021, as a "National Day of Observance."
   - This power is derived from the authority of the Crown in Council to establish national observances under Canadian constitutional and statutory frameworks, particularly in times of public health emergencies or national significance.

3. **Designation:**
   - The Government of Canada officially declares **March 11, 2021**, as a **"National Day of Observance."**
   - This designation is not a statutory holiday with legal work or school closures, nor is it a public holiday with paid leave. Instead, it is a **symbolic and commemorative day** intended for reflection, remembrance, and national unity.

4. **Purpose of the Observance:**
   - To **commemorate the global pandemic** and the profound impact it has had on Canadian society.
   - To **honor the lives lost** due to COVID-19.
   - To **recognize and celebrate the resilience** of Canadians who have faced hardship.
   - To **reinforce public solidarity** and encourage continued efforts to combat the virus and support recovery.

5. **Legal Effect:**
   - The proclamation is binding on all individuals, organizations, and government entities that are subject to its provisions.
   - It requires all Canadians to **take notice** of the declaration and to **govern themselves accordingly**—in the sense of recognizing the significance of the day and engaging in respectful, reflective, and supportive actions.
   - The observance is not mandatory in terms of specific activities, but it encourages **communal reflection, remembrance, and community engagement**.

6. **Formal Elements:**
   - The proclamation is issued using the formal legal format of a royal proclamation, including:
     - The title of the monarch (Elizabeth II).
     - The Great Seal of Canada.
     - A formal declaration of intent.
     - A statement of reasons (the "whereas" clauses).
     - A declaration of the action taken (declaring March 11, 2021, as a National Day of Observance).
     - A signature by the Administrator of the Government of Canada (Richard Wagner).
     - The date and place of issuance (Ottawa, March 10, 2021).

7. **Note on the Administrator’s Name:**
   - The signature includes **Richard Wagner**, who was the Administrator of the Government of Canada at the time. However, this appears to be a **mistake or error**, as Richard Wagner is a well-known composer and not a public servant in the Canadian government. This is likely a **typographical or clerical error**—the correct name of the Administrator in March 2021 was **Jean-François Gagnon** (as the Clerk of the Privy Council), or possibly a misattribution. The name may have been incorrectly transcribed or substituted.

### **Significance and Impact:**

- This proclamation serves as a **formal national acknowledgment** of the pandemic's impact and a moment for collective reflection.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **public health, social solidarity, and national unity** during times of crisis.
- The designation of March 11, 2021, as a National Day of Observance is symbolic, not operational. It does not alter work or school schedules, but it encourages communities to:
  - Hold memorial services.
  - Organize educational or public events.
  - Support mental health and well-being initiatives.
  - Express gratitude to frontline workers.

### **Conclusion:**

The regulation is a **formal, ceremonial proclamation** that designates **March 11, 2021**, as a **National Day of Observance** in Canada. It commemorates the global pandemic declared by the WHO in March 2020, honors those who died, recognizes the sacrifices made by Canadians, and reaffirms national resolve to overcome the crisis. While not a statutory holiday with legal obligations, it holds significant symbolic value and promotes national unity, remembrance, and resilience in the face of public health adversity.

**Note:** The inclusion of "Richard Wagner" as the Administrator is an error and does not reflect actual government personnel. The correct individual should be verified through official government records.

**Final Summary in One Sentence:**  
Canada officially declared March 11, 2021, a National Day of Observance to commemorate the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, honor those who lost their lives, and recognize the resilience and sacrifice of Canadians during the crisis.
