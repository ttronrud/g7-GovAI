**Detailed Summary of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Regulations, No. 2**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**. This means that the Minister of National Revenue proposed the regulation, and the Governor General formally enacted it as part of the federal government’s regulatory framework.  

The legal basis for this regulation is **paragraph 36(1)(b) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This paragraph empowers the Governor General in Council to make regulations governing the employment of employees in the Public Service, including the establishment of rules related to recruitment, terms of employment, and service conditions.

**2. Scope of Application**  
The regulations specifically apply to the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)**, which is a portion of the broader Public Service of Canada. This means that the provisions of these regulations govern the employment practices, administrative procedures, and personnel policies within the CCRA.  

Importantly, **Subsections 37.3(1) and (37.3)(2) of the Public Service Employment Act** are directly applicable to the CCRA. These subsections typically address matters such as:  
- The eligibility and conditions for appointment to public service positions;  
- The process for determining the terms and conditions of service;  
- The rights and responsibilities of employees in the public service.  

Thus, the CCRA operates under the same employment standards and procedural requirements as other parts of the Public Service, ensuring consistency in employment governance.

**3. Effective Date**  
- **Coming into force**: The regulations officially come into effect at **00:00:01 on April 1, 2004**.  
- **Ceasing to have effect**: The regulations cease to apply at **00:00:03 on April 1, 2004**.  

This precise timing—coming into force at the very start of the day and ceasing at just two seconds later—suggests a **temporary or transitional nature** of the regulation. It is likely intended to be a short-term measure, possibly to implement a specific change or to facilitate a transition to a new regulatory framework.

**4. Interpretation and Implications**  
- The regulation is **not a permanent or ongoing policy**. Its brief duration (only two seconds) indicates it was likely a **temporary transitional rule**, possibly used to align the CCRA with new employment standards or to implement a change in personnel policy prior to the adoption of a more comprehensive or permanent regulation.  
- The fact that it applies only to the CCRA suggests that it may have been tailored to address specific employment issues unique to customs and revenue enforcement, such as operational demands, security requirements, or staffing needs.  
- The immediate termination of the regulation at 00:00:03 implies that it may have been intended to be **a one-time administrative step**, possibly to allow for a smooth transition to a revised or more permanent set of rules.

**5. Contextual Considerations**  
This regulation likely reflects a broader effort by the federal government to standardize public service employment practices across departments. The use of the Public Service Employment Act indicates that the government is seeking to maintain consistency in how public servants are hired, managed, and governed.  

The temporary nature of the regulation may also point to a **regulatory review or restructuring** process, where the CCRA was undergoing a change in governance, staffing, or operational model.

**Conclusion**  
The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Regulations, No. 2, is a **temporary, short-lived regulatory instrument** enacted on April 1, 2004, to govern employment practices within the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency under the Public Service Employment Act. It applies the relevant employment provisions (37.3(1) and (2)) to the CCRA and is effective for only two seconds—indicating it was likely a transitional or administrative measure, not a permanent policy. The regulation was issued under the authority of the Minister of National Revenue and formally enacted by the Governor General in Council. Its brief existence suggests it served a specific, time-limited purpose in the evolution of public service employment standards.

**Note**: Given the extremely brief duration (only two seconds), this regulation may be a typographical or administrative error in the original text. In practice, such a regulation would not be valid or enforceable for such a short period. It is likely intended to represent a **corrected or misrecorded effective date**, and further context (such as the original text of the regulation or official government records) would be needed to determine its true purpose or intended duration. However, based on the provided text, this is the accurate summary of the stated regulation.
