### **Main Provisions**

#### **Section 3: Full Remission of Customs Duties**
- **What is granted:**  
  A full remission (i.e., cancellation or waiver) of **customs duties** paid or payable under the *Customs Tariff* for defense supplies imported into Canada.

- **Eligible imports:**
  - Must be imported during the period from **April 1, 1986, to April 1, 1995**.
  - Must be supplied by:
    - **Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon-Buehrle AG** (a Swiss manufacturer)
    - **Oerlikon Aerospace Inc.** (its Canadian subsidiary or affiliate)
    - Their **agents or subcontractors**

- **Purpose of the supplies:**  
  The supplies must be:
  - Part of, or used in the manufacture of, a **Low Level Air Defence System (LLADS)**.
  - Used under a **contract with the Department of National Defence (DND)**.

> This provision supports the importation of critical defense components by eliminating the financial burden of customs duties, which would otherwise increase the cost of defense equipment procurement.

---

#### **Section 4: Partial Remission of Sales Tax**
- **What is granted:**  
  A **partial remission** of the **sales tax** (under the *Excise Tax Act*) on defense supplies that are eligible for customs duty remission under Section 3.

- **Calculation of remission amount:**  
  The amount of sales tax remitted is equal to the **difference** between:
  - The **actual sales tax paid or payable** on the defense supplies;  
  - The **sales tax that would have been payable** if the **duty-paid value** (used to calculate sales tax) had been **reduced by the amount of customs duties remitted**.

> In simpler terms:  
> If a supply originally had a duty-paid value of $100, and $10 in customs duty was remitted, the sales tax base would be reduced by $10. The remitted sales tax is the difference between what was actually paid and what would have been paid on a reduced base.

> This ensures that the tax relief is proportional to the customs duty savings, preventing overcompensation while recognizing the economic impact of duty relief.

### **Conditions for Eligibility**

To qualify for remission under either Section 3 or 4, the following **conditions must be met**:

1. **Application Deadline**  
   - An application for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date the defense supplies receive **customs clearance**.

2. **Certification by the Minister of Supply and Services**  
   - The **Minister of Supply and Services** (or equivalent at the time) must issue a certification confirming that the imported supplies qualify as **defence supplies** under the *Defence Production Act*.

3. **Supporting Documentation**  
   - The application must be accompanied by **sufficient evidence** to demonstrate:
     - That the applicant is entitled to the remission;
     - That the supplies were indeed used in the manufacture of a LLADS;
     - That the importation occurred under a contract with the Department of National Defence.

> These conditions ensure accountability, prevent misuse, and verify that the benefits are only extended to genuine defense-related imports.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order was enacted **in the public interest**, primarily to:
- Support the development and production of a key national defense system (LLADS) that enhances Canada’s ability to defend against low-level aerial threats.
- Reduce the financial burden on Canadian defense contractors and suppliers who were importing critical components from abroad.
- Encourage domestic participation in the production of advanced defense systems through cost-effective supply chains.
- Promote national security by ensuring timely and affordable acquisition of essential defense technologies.

### **Temporal Scope**

- The benefits apply only to imports made between **April 1, 1986, and April 1, 1995**.
- The two-year application window begins upon customs clearance of the goods.

**Note:** This Order is no longer in force as it pertains to a specific defense project from 1986–1995. It is of historical interest and reflects the types of measures used in the past to support national defense procurement. Modern equivalents may exist under updated legislation or defense production frameworks.
