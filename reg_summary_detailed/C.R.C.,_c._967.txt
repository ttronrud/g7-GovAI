**3. Authority to Provide Insurance (Subsection 14(4) of General Adjustment Assistance Regulations)**  
Despite a general limitation in the *General Adjustment Assistance Regulations* (specifically subsection 14(8)), the **Board is authorized** to provide insurance under subsection 14(4) of those regulations — a provision typically used to support private lenders — in the following circumstances:

- The insurance covers **loans made by private lenders** to facilitate the **leasing of computer products**.
- The **products must be manufactured by Consolidated Computer Inc.**, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.
- The **maximum insurance amount** per loan is **99% of the loan amount**.
- The **aggregate total of all such insured loans** cannot exceed **$30 million**.

This provision establishes a limited, targeted insurance scheme to support private lending in the computer leasing sector, specifically for products originating from Consolidated Computer Inc.

**4. Limitation on Repayment to Private Lenders (Subsection 14(8) of General Adjustment Assistance Regulations)**  
Under normal circumstances, the *General Adjustment Assistance Regulations* (section 17) would allow the government to compensate private lenders who suffer losses due to default or early repayment demands. However, these Consolidated Computer Inc. regulations **modify that rule** to provide a more protective and capped framework.

Specifically, if a private lender **demands repayment of a loan** (covered under subsection 1(1)) **before the loan matures**, and insurance has been provided under subsection 14(8) of the General Adjustment Assistance Regulations, the amount payable by Her Majesty (i.e., the government) to that lender is **limited to the lesser of two amounts**:

1. **The amount of insurance in effect on the date of the demand**  
   → This means the government will only pay up to the level of insurance that was active at the time the lender made the repayment demand.

2. **99% of the loss incurred by the private lender**  
   → The compensation cannot exceed 99% of the actual financial loss suffered by the lender due to the early repayment demand.

This cap ensures that:
- The government is not liable for full losses (which could be substantial),
- The compensation is proportional to the risk covered by the insurance,
- There is a clear limit on the maximum financial exposure of the government to private lenders.

**Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Targeted Support**: The regulations are narrowly focused on loans used to finance leasing of computer products from Consolidated Computer Inc., reflecting a specific economic or industrial policy intent.
- **Risk Mitigation for Private Lenders**: The insurance mechanism provides a safety net for private lenders, encouraging lending in a sector that may otherwise face high risk due to uncertainty in leasing arrangements.
- **Financial Responsibility**: The 99% cap on compensation prevents unlimited liability and protects public funds.
- **Capped Aggregate Exposure**: The $30 million limit ensures that the government’s total exposure remains manageable and within a defined budgetary framework.

**Conclusion**  
The *Consolidated Computer Inc. Adjustment Assistance Regulations* establish a special, limited insurance and compensation regime to support private lending in the computer leasing market for products manufactured by Consolidated Computer Inc. While allowing private lenders to recover losses from early repayment demands, the regulations impose strict caps on both the insurance amount per loan and the government’s liability — ensuring fiscal responsibility and proportionality. This regulatory framework operates within the broader structure of the General Adjustment Assistance Regulations but introduces specific parameters tailored to the needs of a particular industry and corporate entity.
