**Detailed Summary of the Yukon Territory Fishery Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Yukon Territory Fishery Regulations* establish the legal framework governing fishing activities within the Yukon Territory, including definitions of key terms, licensing requirements, restrictions on fishing methods and locations, and catch limits. These regulations apply to all fishing activities in Canadian fisheries waters off the Yukon Territory and in the territorial waters of Yukon, **except** in designated areas protected under the *Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations* or in specific circumstances outlined by the Agreement with Indigenous groups.

The regulations are designed to balance sustainable fishery management, Indigenous rights, recreational access, and commercial interests while protecting ecosystems and ensuring fair access to fish resources.
