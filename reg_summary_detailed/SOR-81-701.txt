**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulatory Instrument Title:**  
**Tariff Item No. 9805.00.00 Exemption Order**  
*Made under the authority of tariff item 70320-1 of Schedule A to the Customs Tariff, pursuant to the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and by order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council.*

---

### **Background and Purpose**  
This regulation revokes the previously existing *Returning Residents Special Exemption Regulations, C.R.C., c. 545*, and replaces it with a new, more targeted exemption order. The purpose is to provide specific exemptions from the **six-month ownership, possession, or use requirement** under **tariff item 9805.00.00** of the Customs Tariff — which generally applies to goods imported by returning residents and restricts exemption unless such goods have been owned, possessed, or used for at least six months prior to return.

The new Order streamlines and clarifies the conditions under which certain goods may be exempt from this six-month rule, particularly for individuals returning to Canada after prolonged residence abroad.

### **Exempt Goods Under This Order**

The following categories of goods are **exempt from the six-month ownership/possession/use requirement** under tariff item 9805.00.00:

#### 1. **Alcoholic Beverages**
- Must be:
  - Owned by, in the possession of, and imported by a person who has reached the **minimum legal age** for purchasing alcohol in the province where the customs office is located.
- Example: A Canadian resident returning from abroad may bring in a bottle of wine or beer without violating the six-month rule if they were legally allowed to purchase such beverages in that province.

#### 2. **Tobacco Products**
- Must be:
  - Owned by and in the possession of the importer.
- Exemption applies regardless of how long the person has lived abroad, as long as they meet the ownership and possession criteria.

#### 3. **Vaping Products**
- Must be:
  - Owned by and in the possession of the importer.
- Includes e-cigarettes, vaporizers, and related devices.

#### 4. **Bride’s Trousseau**
- Must be:
  - Owned by, in the possession of, and imported by a **person who has recently married** or is a **bride-to-be** whose anticipated marriage occurs **within three months of their return to Canada**.
- Applies only to items used in the household of the newly married couple.
- Excludes vehicles, vessels, or aircraft.

#### 5. **Wedding Presents**
- Must be:
  - Owned by, in the possession of, and imported by the **recipient** of the gift.

- Applies to persons who:
  - Resided abroad for **at least five years immediately before returning to Canada**, and
  - Prior to returning, **owned, possessed, and used** the goods in question.
- This exemption recognizes that such individuals may have had long-term ownership and use of goods, and thus the six-month rule does not apply.

#### 7. **Replacement Goods for Lost or Destroyed Items**
- Applies when goods are acquired as **replacements** for items that were:
  - Lost, destroyed, or damaged due to **fire, theft, accident, or other unforeseen contingency**.
- Conditions for exemption:
  - The replacement goods must be:
    - Of a **similar class** and
    - Approximately of the **same value** as the original goods.
  - The replacement goods must have been:
    - Owned, possessed, and used **by the person prior to their return to Canada**.
  - At the time of accounting under **section 32 of the Customs Act**, the person must **provide evidence** that the original goods were lost or destroyed due to one of the specified contingencies (e.g., fire, theft).

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Revocation of Old Rules** | Removes outdated and potentially restrictive provisions from the previous Returning Residents Special Exemption Regulations. |
| **Targeted Exemptions** | Focuses exemptions on specific, reasonable categories (marriage-related items, personal gifts, long-term residents, replacements) rather than broad generalizations. |
| **Clarity and Accessibility** | Clearly defines terms like "bride’s trousseau" and "wedding presents" to prevent ambiguity in application. |
| **Procedural Requirement** | For replacement goods, **evidence must be submitted at the time of accounting** under section 32 of the Customs Act — ensuring accountability and preventing fraud. |
| **Geographic and Age-Based Criteria** | Alcoholic beverages and tobacco exemptions are tied to provincial laws (e.g., minimum age to buy alcohol), ensuring compliance with local regulations. |

---

### **Applicability and Scope**

- Applies to **all goods** that fall under the specified categories and are imported by individuals returning to Canada.
- The exemption is **only available if all conditions are met**.
- The Order does **not apply to commercial goods** or items imported for resale or business purposes.
- Applies to **all customs offices** across Canada, subject to provincial alcohol age rules.

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- Customs officers may require documentation or proof (e.g., receipts, photos, affidavits) to verify claims related to:
  - Ownership and possession of goods,
  - Timing of marriage or return,
  - Loss or destruction of original items,
  - Value and similarity of replacement goods.
- Violation of the conditions (e.g., failing to provide evidence for replacement goods) may result in penalties or the imposition of duties.

### **Conclusion**

This **Tariff Item No. 9805.00.00 Exemption Order** modernizes and simplifies the rules governing the importation of certain personal goods by returning residents. It provides practical, fair, and reasonable exemptions for items directly tied to personal life events (marriage, gifts), long-term residence abroad, and legitimate loss or damage. By clearly defining eligible goods and required conditions, the regulation enhances compliance, reduces administrative burden, and supports the personal and cultural needs of Canadian residents returning from international residence.

It represents a shift from a rigid, one-size-fits-all rule to a flexible, context-sensitive approach grounded in real-life circumstances.
