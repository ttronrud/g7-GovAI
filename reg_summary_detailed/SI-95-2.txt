### **2. Scope of Authority**

The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources is authorized to:

#### **(A) Establish Fees for Services or Use of Facilities**

  - **Use of facilities** (e.g., access to laboratories, testing equipment, or infrastructure) operated or managed by the Department.

- These fees are charged to **users or classes of users** — meaning the fee structure can be differentiated based on user type (e.g., industry sector, geographic location, size of operation, etc.).

  - **Licences**
  - **Permits**

### **4. Key Features of the Authorization**

- **Governor General in Council**: The formal authority to issue the regulation is exercised by the Governor General on the advice of the Treasury Board, indicating a high level of governmental oversight and accountability.
- **Treasury Board Recommendation**: The Treasury Board must recommend the issuance of such an order, ensuring that the fee structure is consistent with broader financial and administrative policies.
- **Prescriptive Power**: The Minister is empowered to issue **specific orders** (not general rules) that define:
  - The exact fee amounts.
  - The applicable user groups or classes.
  - The circumstances under which fees apply.
- **Crown Representation**: All fees are collected on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada, reinforcing the principle that these are public services and authorizations.

### **5. Implications for Stakeholders**

- **Industry Users**: Must pay fees when accessing services (e.g., environmental reviews) or obtaining permits (e.g., for mining or oil and gas projects).
- **Government Agencies and Departments**: Can use this authority to manage public infrastructure and regulatory processes more efficiently.
- **Public Accountability**: Fees are subject to oversight, and the Treasury Board’s involvement ensures that fee structures are not arbitrary or discriminatory.

### **6. Oversight and Review**

While the regulation does not explicitly state a review mechanism, the requirement that the Treasury Board recommend the order implies that:
- Fees must align with fiscal responsibility and public interest.
- There may be periodic reviews or adjustments to fees based on cost changes, inflation, or policy shifts.
