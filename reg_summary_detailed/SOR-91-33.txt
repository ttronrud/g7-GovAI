**Detailed Summary of the Amalgamations and Windings-Up Continuation (GST/HST) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Amalgamations and Windings-Up Continuation (GST/HST) Regulations* (S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12) were made under the authority of **subsection 277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act* (ETA), as recommended by the Minister of Finance and approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council.

These regulations establish a legal framework that allows **new successor corporations** to be **deemed as the same corporations** as their **predecessor amalgamated or wound-up corporations**, for specific purposes under the Excise Tax Act — particularly concerning **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** and **Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)**.

This provision ensures **tax continuity** and **legal certainty** in corporate restructuring scenarios, such as amalgamations or windings-up, where the identity of a corporation is preserved despite changes in legal structure or ownership.

### **Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Amalgamations and Windings-Up Continuation (GST/HST) Regulations*  
- **Citation**: S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12  
- **Purpose**: To define the circumstances under which a new corporation formed through amalgamation or winding-up is treated as the **legal and tax successor** to the original entity.

### **Core Principle: "Prescribed Purpose"**

Under **section 120** of the Excise Tax Act, the term *"prescribed purpose"* is defined in these regulations. For the purposes of **sections 271 and 272** of the Excise Tax Act, a "prescribed purpose" means:

> The purpose of applying any provision of the Excise Tax Act that is specifically listed in the **Schedule** to these Regulations.

This means that a successor corporation will be treated as the continuation of a predecessor corporation **only if** the purpose falls within the list of provisions set out in the Schedule.

Thus, the regulations **limit the scope** of continuity to specific tax and compliance provisions related to GST/HST, ensuring that tax treatment is not extended arbitrarily to unrelated areas.

### **Key Provisions and Their Significance**

The regulations apply across multiple sections of the Excise Tax Act, with the most relevant being those related to:

#### 1. **Continuity of Tax Status and Liability (Sections 123, 134, 148, 148.1, 149(1), 150, 156, 160, 166, 181.1, 182, 183(2), 184(2)–(7), 186(1), 194, 219, 222, 223(2), 224, 225, 225.2, 227, 228, 229, 230, 230.1, 232, 233, 237, 238, 261, 263, 263.1, 264, 265, 266, 273, 273.2, 274)**

These sections collectively define the **tax attributes and obligations** that are preserved from the predecessor corporation to the successor.

Examples include:
- **Continuity of GST/HST registration** (e.g., Section 134)
- **Preservation of input tax credits and output tax liabilities** (e.g., Section 148, 148.1)
- **Treatment of tax periods and accounting records** (e.g., Section 149(1), 150)
- **Continuation of tax exemptions and deductions** (e.g., Section 225, 225.2)
- **Transfer of tax liabilities and rights** (e.g., Section 227, 228, 229)

> For instance, if a corporation is amalgamated and continues its business operations, the successor is treated as having **all the tax positions** of the predecessor — including tax credits, exemptions, and tax periods — provided the purpose falls within the Schedule.

#### 2. **Schedule to the Regulations**

The **Schedule** is central to the regulations. It lists the **specific provisions of the Excise Tax Act** that are deemed to apply to the successor corporation.

This ensures that:
- Only **relevant and targeted tax provisions** are preserved.
- There is **clarity and consistency** in determining what constitutes a "prescribed purpose."
- The government maintains control over the scope of tax continuity.

> Example: If a predecessor corporation had a tax exemption under Section 265, and the successor is deemed to be the same corporation, then the successor may continue to claim that exemption — **provided** that the exemption is listed in the Schedule.

#### 3. **Divisions VIII and IX of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**

These divisions contain provisions related to:
- **Amalgamations** (e.g., continuity of corporate identity and tax treatment)
- **Winding-up and dissolution** (e.g., how tax obligations are transferred or discharged)

The regulations ensure that when a corporation is wound up, its successor (e.g., a new entity formed from the assets of the dissolved corporation) may still be treated as the **continuation** of the original entity for GST/HST purposes — **only if** the purpose is one of the prescribed ones.

### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

| Implication | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tax Continuity** | Successor corporations retain tax status, credits, and liabilities of the predecessor, simplifying compliance and reducing administrative burden. |
| **Avoidance of Double Taxation** | Prevents the same business from being taxed twice — once on the predecessor and again on the successor. |
| **Legal Certainty** | Provides clarity for businesses undergoing restructuring, ensuring predictable tax outcomes. |
| **Limited Scope** | Continuity is **only granted for specific provisions** listed in the Schedule — not for all aspects of the Excise Tax Act. |
| **Compliance Requirement** | The taxpayer must demonstrate that the amalgamation or winding-up falls under a prescribed purpose to claim continuity. |

### **Application Process**

To benefit from the regulations:
1. A corporation undergoes an **amalgamation** (merger) or **winding-up** (dissolution).
2. A **new successor corporation** is formed.
3. The taxpayer must show that the purpose of the transaction is one of the **prescribed purposes** listed in the Schedule.
4. The new corporation is then **deemed to be the same corporation** as the predecessor for GST/HST purposes under sections 271 and 272 of the Excise Tax Act.

### **Conclusion**

The *Amalgamations and Windings-Up Continuation (GST/HST) Regulations* provide a **structured and limited framework** for ensuring tax continuity during corporate restructurings. By defining a precise list of "prescribed purposes" — tied directly to specific sections of the Excise Tax Act — the regulations:

- Protect the integrity of the tax system  
- Ensure fairness and consistency in tax treatment  
- Support business efficiency during mergers and dissolutions  
- Prevent unintended tax consequences  

These regulations are essential tools for maintaining **tax stability** and **legal clarity** in the face of corporate change.

> **Note**: The regulations are not a blanket rule of continuity. They operate strictly within the boundaries defined in the Schedule and are subject to the conditions of the Excise Tax Act. Taxpayers and advisors must carefully assess whether a transaction qualifies under a prescribed purpose before relying on continuity.
