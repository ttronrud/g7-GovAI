**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation constitutes an official proclamation by the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, declaring the effective date of the *Second Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985*.

**Background and Context:**

- The **Statute Revision Commission** (SRC) is a body established to review and revise the Canadian statutes to improve clarity, consistency, and accessibility. Its work includes identifying obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent provisions and consolidating or amending legislation.

- The *Second Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985* was the result of this ongoing statutory revision process. It contains a series of amendments, additions, and corrections to the body of Canadian law as codified in the *Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985*.

- The Commission completed its work on this supplement and formally reported its completion in writing.

- On **October 19, 1988**, a printed copy of the Second Supplement was officially deposited in the office of the Clerk of the Parliaments. This copy was:
  - **Attested** by the Governor General (the head of state of Canada),
  - **Countersigned** by the Minister of Justice (the minister responsible for legal and legislative matters),
  - **Certified correct** by the Chairman of the Statute Revision Commission, confirming its accuracy and completeness.

This formal deposit is a necessary procedural step to validate the Supplement as an official legal document and to ensure it is recognized as part of the statutory framework.

**Legal Authority:**

The proclamation is issued under **subsection 13(2) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985 Act**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the authority to declare the coming into force of a supplement to the Revised Statutes, provided it has been properly prepared, reviewed, and deposited as required.

**Key Provision of the Regulation:**

- The Governor General in Council **declares that December 12, 1988, is the effective date** of the Second Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985.

- From that date onward, **all enactments contained in the Supplement shall take effect as law**.

- Crucially, these enactments are deemed to be **"expressly embodied in and enacted by an Act of Parliament"**, even though they are not passed through a formal legislative process. This means that, for legal purposes, the provisions in the Supplement are treated as if they were enacted by Parliament through a statute—thereby giving them full legal force, validity, and binding effect.

**Significance and Implications:**

1. **Legal Effectiveness**: The Second Supplement becomes legally binding and enforceable from December 12, 1988, without requiring a separate Act of Parliament.

2. **Statutory Consolidation**: This action reflects Canada’s commitment to maintaining a clear, up-to-date, and organized body of law. The Supplement streamlines the legal code by removing redundancies and improving coherence.

3. **Procedural Compliance**: The regulation ensures that all required steps—review, certification, and formal deposit—are met before a supplement is made effective, thereby upholding the integrity and transparency of the legislative process.

4. **Administrative Efficiency**: By using a statutory supplement mechanism, Parliament avoids the need to pass numerous individual bills to amend or update laws, which would be time-consuming and costly.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally brings into force the Second Supplement to the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, on December 12, 1988. It reflects a key function of the Statute Revision Commission and demonstrates how Canada manages its legal framework through systematic, efficient, and constitutionally sound revision processes. The provisions of the Supplement are now legally operative as if they were enacted by Parliament, ensuring continuity, clarity, and consistency in Canadian law.
