The provided text consists entirely of repeals of a specific regulation, listed multiple times with the same citation:

- **Repealed, SOR/2002-372, s. 2**  
- Repeated **29 times** with **SOR/2014-293, s. 11**

### Summary:

This text indicates that a particular regulation (originally enacted under the *Regulations of the Government of Canada*) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) in two stages:

1. **Repealed by SOR/2002-372, section 2**  
   This means the regulation was first removed from legal force in 2002 under the statutory order *SOR/2002-372*, section 2. This is a single, one-time repeal.

2. **Repealed again by SOR/2014-293, section 11**  
   The regulation was subsequently repealed a second time in 2014 under *SOR/2014-293*, section 11. This repealing order is cited 29 times in the original text—likely due to a formatting or duplication error—indicating that the repeal was applied or referenced repeatedly, but it is still only one official repeal action.

### Key Points:
- The regulation **no longer exists** in current law.
- It was originally in force, but has been **fully removed** through official legislative action.
- The multiple repetitions of the 2014 repeal are **not indicative of multiple repeals**, but rather a possible error in the original document or data entry (e.g., a typo or formatting issue).
- The repeal by *SOR/2014-293, s. 11* is the **most recent and final** legal action that removed the regulation.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. It was first repealed in 2002 and then definitively removed in 2014 under *SOR/2014-293, section 11*. The repeated citations of the 2014 repeal are likely a duplication error and do not represent additional legal actions.
