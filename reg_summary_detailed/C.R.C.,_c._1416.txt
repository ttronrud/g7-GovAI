## **Comprehensive Summary of the Canada Shipping Regulations (as referenced)**

### **1. Scope and Applicability**

These regulations are a key component of **maritime safety and navigation law in Canada**, governed under the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** ("Act"). They establish rules for vessels, pleasure crafts, ocean data acquisition systems (ODAS), and seaplanes operating in Canadian waters and on the high seas.

#### **Applicable Entities and Vessels**
The regulations apply to the following:

| Entity | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Canadian ODAS** | Any ocean data acquisition system (e.g., buoys, sensors) owned by a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, Government of Canada, provincial government, Canadian corporation, or Canadian university. |
| **Canadian Vessels** | All vessels (including exploration/exploitation vessels) located in Canadian waters, whether self-propelled or not. Applies even if engaged in oil/gas exploration under a Government license. |
| **Pleasure Craft** | Any pleasure craft licensed in Canada or primarily maintained and operated in Canada, not registered elsewhere. |
| **Foreign ODAS and Vessels** | Applies to foreign vessels and foreign ODAS operating in Canadian waters, including foreign exploration vessels under Canadian licenses. |
| **Seaplanes** | Applies to all seaplanes operating on or over Canadian waters. |

> ⚠️ **Exception**:  
> - The regulations **do not apply** to vessels or aircraft belonging to the **Canadian Forces** or **foreign military forces**, nor to any vessel under their command, control, or direction.

> 🔄 **Conflict Resolution**:  
> - If Canadian laws conflict with foreign laws applicable to a Canadian ODAS within another country, **foreign laws prevail** to the extent of inconsistency.  
> - If a **"Canadian Modifications"** rule conflicts with a standard "Rule," the **Canadian Modifications provision prevails**.  
> - If **Rule 1** conflicts with this section, **this section prevails**.

| **Mile** | International nautical mile = 1,852 meters |
| **Minister** | Minister of Transport |
| **Navigational Warning** | Urgent marine information released by DFO about hazards, works, or changes |
| **Notice to Mariners** | Monthly/annual publication from DFO with updated marine data (e.g., new hazards, depth changes) |
| **ODAS** | Ocean Data Acquisition System — any device collecting data on marine/atmospheric conditions |
| **Organization** | International Maritime Organization (IMO) |
| **Raft** | Includes booms and floating structures |
| **Route** | Area with one or two traffic directions, bounded by separation lines/zones or natural features |
| **Routing System** | System including traffic lanes, separation schemes, recommended tracks, areas to avoid, inshore zones, roundabouts, precautionary areas, deep-water routes |
| **Rule** | A numbered provision in Schedule 1 under the heading "Rule X" |
| **Seaplane** | Aircraft designed to operate on water (e.g., flying boats, amphibians) |
| **Separation Zone/Line** | Line or zone separating opposing traffic or separating a route from inshore traffic |
| **Traffic Lane** | A one-directional route within a larger route |
| **Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS)** | System that separates opposing traffic using lanes and separation zones |
| **Trawling** | Fishing by dragging nets or apparatus through water (restricts maneuverability) |

> 🔍 **Note**: The term **"ship"** is generally interpreted as **"vessel"** throughout the regulations, with exceptions in specific sections.

### **3. Regulatory Compliance and Equipment Standards**

#### **Mandatory Equipment and Proof of Compliance**
All vessels (except pleasure crafts) must carry or exhibit required lights, shapes, sound-signalling appliances, and radar reflectors.

##### **Proof of Compliance Requirements**
- Must be **on board** in a **readily accessible location** OR
- **Securely affixed** to the equipment in a **readily visible place**

##### **Language Requirements**
- If issued in a language other than **English or French**, it must be accompanied by a **translation** into one of those languages.

##### **Issuing Authorities**
Proof must be issued by one of:
1. A government party to the **International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), 1972**
2. A **classification society** recognized by such a government as capable of verifying compliance with standards in Section 6
3. An **independent testing establishment** recognized by the Minister or a government party to COLREGs

##### **Standards Required**
All equipment must meet standards in **Schedule 1 and its annexes**.

##### **Canadian-Approved Standards (if issued in Canada)**
If a light, shape, or sound signal is certified in Canada, it must meet **one of the following**:
- **Transport Canada TP 1861** (Navigation Lights, Shapes, Sound Signals) — as amended
- **Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standard 1104** — marine navigation lights (excluding sections 1.1, 1.2, 5.2, 38.2 and references to U.S. inland rules)
- **ABYC Standard A-16** — for vessels <20 meters (excluding section 16.5 and references to U.S. inland rules)
- **Any other standard** determined by the Minister to be **equivalent or safer** than the above

> ⚠️ **Exemption for Older Vessels**
> - Vessels with lights installed **before July 15, 1981 (≥20m)** or **June 1, 1984 (<20m)** may **exempt** from these regulations **if**:

### **4. Navigation and Safety Requirements**

#### **General Navigation Principles**
- Every vessel must:
  - Maintain a **proper look-out** using sight, hearing, and all available means (e.g., radar)
  - Proceed at a **safe speed** to allow for effective collision avoidance and stopping within safe distances

#### **Factors in Determining Safe Speed**
All vessels must consider:
- Visibility (fog, mist, snow, rain)
- Traffic density (especially fishing vessels)
- Vessel’s **maneuverability** (stopping distance, turning ability)
- Background lighting (shore lights, backscatter)
- Wind, sea, current, and proximity to hazards
- Draught relative to water depth

> 🔍 **Vessels with Radar** must also consider:
- Radar efficiency, range scale limitations
- Sea state, weather, interference
- Inability to detect small vessels, ice, or floating objects
- Movement and number of vessels detected
- Radar’s ability to improve visibility and range estimation

#### **Special Conditions in Canadian Waters**
In roadsteads, harbors,
