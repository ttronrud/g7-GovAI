**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 13 – Beef and Veal for Personal Use (Canada, 1994)**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, specifically:

- **Section 6.2(1)**: Provides the authority for the Secretary of State for External Affairs to establish an *import access quantity* for certain goods, including beef and veal.
- **Section 8.3(3)**: Grants the Secretary of State the power to issue a *General Import Permit* for the importation of specific goods under defined conditions.

The regulation was enacted on **December 29, 1994**, in Ottawa, Ontario, by **André Ouellet**, Secretary of State for External Affairs.

It was issued in the context of Canada’s obligations under the **World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement**, particularly in relation to the implementation of **GATT 1994 (Chapter 47 of the Statutes of Canada, 1994)**, specifically:

- **Section 106**: Concerns the importation of goods under specific permits.
- **Section 109**: Relates to the conditions under which import permits may be issued.

> Note: This permit was later **repealed** by **SOR/97-45, section 2**, indicating it is no longer in force as of 1997.

### **2. Purpose of the Permit**

The primary purpose of this General Import Permit is to **authorize the personal importation of beef and veal into Canada** for **private consumption**, with strict limitations on quantity, origin, and type of product.

---

### **3. Scope of the Permit**

#### **a) Definition of "Beef and Veal"**
Beef and veal are defined as:
- **Cuts of meat** from bovine animals (cattle), including:
  - Fresh, chilled, or frozen meat
  - With bone in
  - Classified under specific tariff items or headings in the **Customs Tariff** (Schedule to the Customs Tariff)
- **Boneless meat**:
  - Fresh, chilled, or frozen
  - Classified under specific tariff items or headings

#### **b) Classification under the Customs Tariff**
The permitted goods must fall under one of the following tariff classifications:

| Type of Meat | Tariff Item or Heading |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Bone-in cuts** |  
- 0201.20.10 or 0202.20.10  
- Heading 98.04 or 98.26  
| **Boneless cuts** |  
- 0201.30.10 or 0202.30.10  
- Heading 98.04 or 98.26 |

> These classifications are found in the **List of Tariff Provisions** attached to the Customs Tariff.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Origin (Prohibited Sources)**

The permit **explicitly excludes** any beef or veal that originates from:

- **Chile**
- **Countries under CUSMA** (Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement)
- **EU countries**
- **Other CETA beneficiaries** (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement countries)
- **CUKTCA beneficiaries** (Canada-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement countries)

> This means that **only beef and veal from non-designated countries** are eligible for import under this permit.

> This restriction reflects trade policy and sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) safeguards, ensuring that only meat from countries not subject to certain international trade agreements is allowed under this personal-use exemption.

---

### **5. Import Quantity Limit**

- Each individual may import **no more than 10 kilograms (kg) in net weight per importation**.
- This limit applies to **each individual import event**.
- The import must be for **personal use** and for the **importer and their household** only.

> This restriction ensures that the permit does not facilitate large-scale commercial importation but is intended for private, household consumption.

---

### **6. Reporting Requirements**

Any goods imported under this permit must be reported to customs in the prescribed form, which must include one of the following statements:

- In English:  
  **"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 13 — Beef and Veal for Personal Use"**

- In French:  
  **"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d'importation no 13 — Boeuf et veau pour usage personnel"**

> This ensures transparency and compliance with Canadian customs and trade regulations.

### **8. Historical and Policy Context**

- This permit was issued during a period of **increasing international trade liberalization** under WTO rules.
- It reflects Canada’s effort to **balance trade openness** with **national food safety and public health concerns**.
- The exclusion of meat from major trade partners (like the EU and the U.S.) may have been due to:
  - Differences in animal health standards
  - Sanitary regulations
  - Public health concerns related to disease transmission (e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE)
- The 1997 repeal suggests that the policy was **replaced or superseded** by more modern, comprehensive import regulations, likely due to changes in trade agreements or food safety standards.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **limited, personal-use import exemption** for beef and veal in Canada, with strict controls on origin, quantity, and product type. While it was a significant step in allowing private importation of meat, it was **short-lived and ultimately repealed** in 1997. It serves as a historical example of how Canada used import permits to manage trade access under WTO obligations while protecting public health and food safety standards.

> **Note**: This permit is **no longer in effect**. Current import regulations for beef and veal in Canada are governed by updated food safety laws, customs procedures, and international trade agreements (such as CUSMA, CETA, and the WTO framework).
