### Detailed Summary of the Regulatory Status

#### 1. **Repeal of Section 509(a) of SOR/2013-211**
- The provision referenced — **section 509(a)** of **SOR/2013-211** — has been **repealed** (officially removed from force).
- SOR/2013-211 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued in 2013, likely related to **Ontario’s regulatory framework** in a sector such as health, safety, or environmental management (exact context depends on the instrument).
- The repeated mention of "Repealed, SOR/2013-211, par. 509(a)" confirms that this specific clause is no longer in effect.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The repetition of this citation suggests either a formatting or data error — it is not a regulation itself, but rather a list of status markers indicating that the provision was removed.

#### 2. **Revocation of Earlier Instruments**
- **SOR/84-597, s. 1** — Section 1 of this 1984 Statutory Rule has been revoked.
- **SOR/82-779, s. 2 and s. 4** — Sections 2 and 4 of this 1982 Statutory Rule have also been revoked.

> These revocations indicate that earlier rules or provisions (possibly outdated or superseded by newer legislation) have been formally canceled.

#### 3. **Legal Implications**
- A **repealed or revoked regulation** is **no longer legally enforceable**.
- Any legal, administrative, or operational action based on the repealed section (e.g., 509(a)) is **invalid** and cannot be used as a basis for compliance, enforcement, or interpretation.
- The repeal or revocation typically occurs when:
  - A new regulation replaces the old one.
  - The old regulation is found to be obsolete, inconsistent with current law, or redundant.
  - A legislative review or amendment removes outdated provisions.

#### 4. **Why This Matters**
- Regulatory compliance relies on up-to-date, active rules.
- If a business, organization, or individual relies on a repealed section (e.g., 509(a)), they must refer to **current, active regulations** to ensure legal validity.
- This repeal may reflect a broader **modernization or consolidation** of Ontario’s regulatory framework.

### Conclusion

> **There is no active regulation in the provided text.**  
> The content is a **list of status indicators** showing that:
> - **Section 509(a) of SOR/2013-211 has been repealed** (removed from law),
> - And **sections 1, 2, and 4 of SOR/84-597 and SOR/82-779 have been revoked** (also removed from law).

These actions mean that the referenced provisions are **no longer valid or enforceable** under Ontario law. Any legal or operational reliance on them is **invalid** and must be replaced with current, active regulations.

### Recommendation
To understand the **actual content** of the repealed section (509(a)), one would need to:
- Access the **full text of SOR/2013-211** prior to repeal (available through the Ontario Government’s official legislation database),
- Search for **the original text of section 509(a)**,
- Determine what subject area it governed (e.g., licensing, safety, environmental standards, etc.).

Without the original text, a detailed summary of the regulation’s content cannot be provided — only its **status** and **legal consequences**.

✅ **Final Status**:  
**Repealed / Revoked — Not in force. No current legal effect.**
