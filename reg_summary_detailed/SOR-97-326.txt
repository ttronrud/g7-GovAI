**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Exempting Goods of Chile from Anti-Dumping Measures**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 14(2)a of the Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**. This provision allows the Canadian government to exempt certain imported goods from anti-dumping duties when specific trade agreements or conditions are met.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **exempt goods originating in Chile** from the application of **anti-dumping measures** under Canadian trade law. This exemption is granted to support and strengthen the **Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)** by ensuring that Chilean goods benefit from preferential tariff treatment and are not subject to unfair trade practices such as dumping.

---

**Scope of Exempted Goods:**

- The exemption applies to **goods of Chile** that:
  - Qualify as **originating goods** under the **CCFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**; and
  - Are entitled to the **benefit of the Chile Tariff** under the **CCFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**.

> *Definition of "originating goods":* Goods that meet the origin criteria set out in the CCFTA Rules of Origin, meaning they are produced in Chile using Chilean materials and labor, and meet the required percentage thresholds (e.g., value-added content) to be considered "originating" for tariff purposes.

---

**Conditions for Exemption:**

The exemption is effective as of the **earlier of two dates**:

1. **The date when the tariff rate for all goods covered by the relevant subheading becomes free** under:
   - The **Customs Tariff** for goods of Chile that are originating goods; **and**
   - The **Arancel Aduanero (Chilean Customs Tariff)** for goods of Canada that are originating goods.

   → This means the exemption takes effect when the tariff is fully eliminated (i.e., "free") for those goods under both the Canadian and Chilean tariff systems for originating goods.

2. **January 1, 2003**.

> This provides a **ceiling date** for the exemption, ensuring that even if the tariff is not yet free, the exemption will not last beyond January 1, 2003.

---

**Effective Date of the Regulation:**

These regulations come into force on the **day on which Section 89 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1997, c. 14)** comes into force.

> Section 89 of the Implementation Act is the legal basis for implementing the CCFTA and includes provisions related to the elimination of anti-dumping measures for qualifying Chilean goods. The regulation is thus tied to the broader implementation timeline of the CCFTA.

---

**Historical Context and Reference:**

- The regulation was issued on **July 5, 1997** (as noted in SI/97-86), which is the date of the original implementation of the CCFTA.
- It reflects the **initial phase of the CCFTA’s enforcement**, where anti-dumping measures were suspended or eliminated for goods from Chile to promote fair trade and economic integration.

---

**Key Implications:**

- **No anti-dumping duties** are imposed on Chilean goods that meet the origin requirements under the CCFTA.
- This promotes **fair competition** between Canadian and Chilean producers by preventing the imposition of duties that could distort market conditions.
- It supports **trade liberalization** and strengthens the economic relationship between Canada and Chile.
- The exemption is **conditional** on the goods being "originating" — meaning only goods meeting the origin rules are protected.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a key component of Canada’s implementation of the **Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement**. It ensures that **Chilean goods that meet origin criteria are exempt from anti-dumping duties**, effective as of the earlier of the date when the tariff becomes free under both Canadian and Chilean systems or **January 1, 2003**. The regulation supports the goals of the CCFTA by promoting fair trade, reducing trade barriers, and encouraging economic cooperation between Canada and Chile.

> **Note:** The regulation is no longer in force as of January 1, 2003, or when the tariff rates were no longer free, depending on the specific goods and subheadings. It may have been superseded by later amendments or new regulations under the CCFTA framework.
