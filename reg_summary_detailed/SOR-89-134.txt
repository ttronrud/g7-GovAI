The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules Order (SOR) /2017-84**, which was published on January 1, 2017.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. It no longer exists in force.
- **Repeal Date**: The repeal took effect on January 1, 2017, as part of the official statutory rules order SOR/2017-84.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of the regulation was specifically repealed.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they are outdated, redundant, inconsistent with new legislation, or when a more modern or comprehensive regulation has replaced them. In this case, the original regulation (which is not otherwise described in your input) was deemed obsolete or superseded by newer provisions.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on the jurisdiction), through the Statutory Rules Order system, which is used to formally amend or remove rules and regulations.

### Important Notes:
- Since the regulation is **fully repealed**, it does not apply to any current legal or operational context.
- There is **no content** provided for the original regulation (e.g., no definition, rules, or enforcement provisions), so a detailed summary of its former content cannot be offered.
- The repeated entries suggest a formatting or data entry error — likely a duplication of the same repeal notice.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect** and was officially **repealed on January 1, 2017**, under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. Without the original text of the regulation, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or provisions cannot be provided. To understand what the regulation previously addressed, one would need to consult archival records or the original version prior to repeal.

If you have access to the original regulation or can provide its title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain trades"), I can assist in reconstructing a meaningful summary based on historical or contextual data.
