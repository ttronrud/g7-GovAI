**Detailed Summary of the CPAFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**
The *CPAFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish tariff preference rules for goods traded under a free trade agreement.

- **Statutory Basis**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1): Provides the legal framework for the regulation’s creation.  
  - S.C. 1997, c. 36: Refers to the foundational legislation (likely the *Customs Tariff Act*) that supports the regulatory framework.

These regulations are part of the implementation of the **Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement (CPAFTA)**, which was signed on **May 14, 2010**.

### **2. Definition of "Originating Goods"**
In these regulations, the term **"originating"** refers to goods that qualify as originating within the territory of a **Party** (either Canada or Panama) under the **Rules of Origin** specified in **Chapter Three** of the CPAFTA.

- **Purpose**:  
  The rules of origin determine whether a product is considered "originating" — meaning it has been sufficiently transformed or processed in a Party’s territory to qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the free trade agreement.
- **Key Implication**:  
  Only goods that meet the origin criteria can benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs when traded between Canada and Panama.

### **3. Tariff Preference for Goods Exported from Panama to Canada**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, goods exported from Panama are eligible for the **Panama Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff treatment) if they meet one of the following two conditions:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipment to Canada (No Third Country Involvement)**
If goods are shipped directly from Panama to Canada **without passing through another country**, they qualify for preferential treatment if:
- They are transported under a **through bill of lading**, OR  
- They are shipped without a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that clearly shows:
  - The full **shipping route**  
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada

> *Note*: This provision ensures transparency and traceability of the shipment path, even in the absence of a formal through bill of lading.

#### **Condition 2: Shipment Through a Third Country**
If goods are shipped from Panama to Canada **via a third country**, they may still qualify for preferential treatment if:
- The importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Shows the **full shipping route** and all **points of shipment and transhipment** before entry into Canada  
  - AND  
  - A **copy of the customs control documents** that confirm the goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the third country

> *Purpose of the customs control documentation*:  
> This requirement ensures that the goods did not undergo unauthorized processing, re-export, or removal from customs supervision — which could disqualify them from being considered "originating."

### **4. Effective Date and Registration Requirements**

- **Initial Effective Date**:  
  The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 42 of the Canada–Panama Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 26 of the Statutes of Canada, 2012) comes into force.

- **Alternative Effective Date (if registered later)**:  
  If the regulations are **registered (published) after** the initial effective date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely manner, consistent with the legislative schedule, while allowing for administrative delays in the official registration process.

### **5. Additional Notes and Context**

- **Regulation in Force as of April 1, 2013**:  
  The regulations were officially in force as of **April 1, 2013**, as noted in **SI/2013-16** (Statutory Instrument 2013-16). This date reflects the final implementation timeline after publication and registration.

- **Policy Objective**:  
  The regulations are designed to:
  - Promote trade between Canada and Panama  
  - Encourage the production and export of goods from Panama that meet specific origin criteria  
  - Ensure compliance with the rules of origin and customs procedures  
  - Strengthen economic ties under the CPAFTA framework

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CPAFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* establish a clear and enforceable framework for determining when goods from Panama qualify for preferential tariff treatment when imported into Canada. The rules emphasize **transparency**, **traceability**, and **compliance** with customs requirements. By defining both direct and indirect shipment pathways and requiring documentary evidence, the regulations ensure that only genuinely originating goods benefit from tariff preferences, thereby protecting the integrity of the free trade agreement.

These provisions support Canada’s broader trade policy goals, including strengthening economic partnerships with key international partners like Panama, while maintaining compliance with international trade rules and customs oversight.
