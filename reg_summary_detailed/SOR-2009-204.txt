**Detailed Summary of the *Micronutrient Initiative Divestiture Regulations***  
*(S.C. 2003, c. 22, par. 225(z.19); R.S. c. P-36; R.S. c. F-11)*

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
The *Micronutrient Initiative Divestiture Regulations* are a regulatory instrument issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**. The regulations are authorized under two key statutes:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**: This grants the Treasury Board the power to make regulations that clarify or apply the superannuation rules for certain individuals who transition from public service employment to employment with a non-public entity.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: This provides the authority to issue regulations governing the administration of public service benefits and related matters.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **address the superannuation status and benefits of individuals who were previously employed in the public service but transitioned to employment with The Micronutrient Initiative (MNI)** — a non-governmental organization — under a specific agreement dated **December 1, 2001**.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply **only to individuals** who:

- Were **deemed to have ceased being employed in the public service** on **December 1, 2001**, due to their employment with The Micronutrient Initiative;
- Were **employed by The Micronutrient Initiative** after that date;
- Were **previously employed in the public service** and thus fell under the scope of the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> **Key Clarification**:  
> The regulations **do not apply** to individuals who **become re-employed by The Micronutrient Initiative** after leaving public service. This means the rules only govern the initial transition from public service to MNI, not subsequent re-employment.

### **3. Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **(a) Application of Sections 13 and 13.01 of the Public Service Superannuation Act**
- These sections govern **pension entitlements** (e.g., retirement pensions, pensionable service, age at retirement).
- For individuals covered by these regulations, **Sections 13 and 13.01 apply only from the date they cease to be employed by The Micronutrient Initiative**.
- This means that **pension rights and calculations** (such as pensionable service and retirement age) are **not retroactively applied** to the period of employment with MNI.
- The individual is treated as having **ceased public service employment** on December 1, 2001, and the pension rules begin to apply from that point forward.

#### **(b) Death Benefits for Survivors and Children**
If a person dies while employed by The Micronutrient Initiative, their **survivors and children** are entitled to one of the following benefits — **as if the individual had been employed in the public service**:

1. **The death benefit under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA** — a lump-sum payment to the surviving spouse or dependents.
2. **The allowances under subsection 13(3) of the PSSA** — such as dependent benefits or other family-related allowances.

> This ensures that **family members receive public service-level benefits** even though the individual was not formally employed in the public service during their time with MNI.

#### **(c) Deemed Cessation of Public Service Employment**
- Under **subsection 26(2) of the PSSA**, a person is **deemed to have ceased being employed in the public service** on the day they **cease to be employed by The Micronutrient Initiative**.
- This is a critical legal designation that triggers the application of public service superannuation rules and affects pension, leave, and other benefits.

#### **(d) One-Year Period for Leave and Return to Work (Section 10(5))**
- The one-year period referred to in **paragraph (a) of subsection 10(5) of the PSSA** (which relates to the right to return to public service employment or to take certain types of leave) **begins on the day the individual ceases to be employed by The Micronutrient Initiative**.
- This means that the individual has a one-year window from December 1, 2001 (or the relevant cessation date) to potentially return to public service employment or access certain transitional benefits.

#### **(e) Pensionable Service During Transition Period**
- For the purposes of **Sections 13 and 13.01 of the PSSA**, **pensionable service includes**:
  - The period that **begins on the day the person ceases to be employed in the public service** (i.e., December 1, 2001);
  - And **ends on the day they cease to be employed by The Micronutrient Initiative**.
- This means that **the time spent working with MNI is counted as pensionable service**, even though the individual was not employed in the public service. This is a significant benefit for pension calculations.

#### **(f) Age at Retirement**
- The **age of the individual when they cease to be employed in the public service** is defined as their **age on the day they cease to be employed by The Micronutrient Initiative**.
- This ensures that retirement age calculations (e.g., for early retirement or pension eligibility) are based on the actual date of transition, not the date of original public service employment.

#### **(g) Classification as a "Group 1 Contributor"**
- A person covered by these regulations is considered a **Group 1 contributor** under the PSSA.
- Group 1 contributors are typically those who are **employed in the public service** or have **public service-related employment** (such as those in the federal public service or certain affiliated organizations).
- This classification determines how pension contributions, benefits, and eligibility are assessed under the Act.

### **4. Effective Date**
The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the federal government. This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal publication and registration.

---

### **5. Background and Context**
- The **International Development Research Centre (IDRC)** and **The Micronutrient Initiative (MNI)** entered into an agreement on **December 1, 2001**, under which MNI became a recipient of public funding and operated as a non-governmental organization with a public service connection.
- The transition of certain public service employees to MNI created a **legal and administrative gap** in the application of public service superannuation rules.
- These regulations were introduced to **resolve that gap**, ensuring that:
  - Pension rights are properly calculated;
  - Death benefits are available to dependents;
  - Transition periods are clearly defined;
  - The public service superannuation framework is respected even when employees work in affiliated or non-governmental roles.
