### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The *Retransmission Royalties Criteria Regulations* establish the specific criteria that the *Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)* — more accurately, the *Board* (which in this context refers to the Copyright Board or a similar statutory body empowered under the Copyright Act) — must consider when determining a fair and equitable method for calculating royalties for the retransmission of distant signals (primarily U.S. broadcast signals) into Canada.

These regulations were developed to ensure that Canadian broadcasters and retransmitters pay royalties to Canadian copyright holders (such as television and radio producers) when retransmitting U.S. broadcast content, thereby protecting the rights of Canadian content creators and maintaining a balanced, fair, and transparent royalty system.

### **Key Criteria for Determining Royalties**

The Board must take into account the following **three primary criteria** when establishing a royalty determination mechanism under paragraph 70.63(1)(a) of the *Copyright Act*:

---

#### **1. Royalties Paid for the Retransmission of Distant Signals in the United States**

- The Board must examine the **existing retransmission royalty regime in the United States**, particularly how U.S. law and practice determine compensation for the retransmission of U.S. broadcast signals (e.g., via cable, satellite, or direct-to-home services).
- This includes reviewing the **structure, rates, and mechanisms** used in U.S. retransmission agreements, such as:
  - Whether royalties are based on subscriber fees, per-channel fees, or other metrics.
  - How the fees are distributed among rights holders (e.g., networks, producers, broadcasters).
- The purpose is to provide a **benchmark** for what constitutes a fair and equitable royalty structure in a comparable jurisdiction, ensuring that Canada’s system is not significantly less favorable than that of the U.S.

> *Rationale:* This ensures that Canada’s royalty system is aligned with international standards and avoids creating a system that is unduly burdensome or inconsistent with global practices.

---

#### **2. Effects of the Broadcasting Act and Its Regulations on the Retransmission of Distant Signals in Canada**

- The Board must assess how **Canadian broadcasting legislation** — specifically the *Broadcasting Act* and its associated regulations — impacts the retransmission of distant signals (i.e., U.S. broadcasts) into Canada.
- This includes evaluating:
  - Licensing requirements for retransmission (e.g., whether a license is required for retransmitting U.S. signals).
  - Restrictions or obligations imposed on Canadian broadcasters or cable/satellite providers.
  - The role of the CRTC in regulating access to U.S. signals and the potential for market distortion.
- The Board must consider how these legal and regulatory frameworks influence the **availability, accessibility, and commercial viability** of distant signal retransmission in Canada.

> *Rationale:* This ensures that the royalty system operates within the legal and policy framework that governs Canadian broadcasting, and that it accounts for the unique domestic regulatory environment.

---

#### **3. Written Agreements Between Collecting Bodies and Retransmitters in Canada**

- The Board must consider **all written agreements** that have been reached between:
  - **Collecting bodies** (such as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission’s designated collecting societies or other rights management organizations),
  - And **retransmitters** (e.g., cable companies, satellite providers, or digital platforms).
- These agreements must:
  - Be **substantially complete** and submitted to the Board in their entirety.
  - Specify **royalty rates**, payment mechanisms, terms, and conditions related to the retransmission of distant signals.
- The Board must evaluate the **practicality, fairness, and equity** of these existing agreements as a reference point for establishing a new or revised royalty system.

> *Rationale:* This provides a real-world, market-based foundation for royalty determination. It ensures that the final royalty structure reflects actual industry practices and negotiations, promoting consistency and transparency.

---

### **Key Principles Underlying the Regulations**

- **Fairness and Equitability:** The primary goal is to establish a royalty system that is both fair to copyright holders and equitable to retransmitters.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** By requiring the Board to consider U.S. practices, Canadian regulations, and actual industry agreements, the process is made transparent and grounded in observable, verifiable data.
- **International Alignment:** The inclusion of U.S. royalty practices ensures that Canada’s system is not isolated and is aligned with international norms, especially given the cross-border nature of broadcast content.
- **Practicality and Market Reality:** The emphasis on existing agreements ensures that the final royalty structure is not theoretical but based on real-world commercial arrangements.

---

### **Application and Enforcement**

- The Board is required to apply these criteria in a **systematic and objective manner** when developing a new or revised royalty formula.
- The regulations do not prescribe a specific royalty rate or formula but rather **set out the guiding principles** to be used in the development process.
- The final royalty determination will be subject to public consultation, transparency, and potential review by the Minister or the CRTC, depending on the jurisdictional context.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- These regulations were a key step in addressing the **cross-border retransmission of U.S. broadcast content** in Canada, a long-standing issue in media policy.
- They helped resolve disputes over whether Canadian broadcasters or cable companies should pay royalties for airing U.S. signals, especially in the context of growing satellite and cable penetration.
- The framework laid the foundation for the later development of the **Canadian Retransmission Royalty System**, which was eventually implemented in the 1990s and remains in force today, with periodic reviews.

### **Conclusion**

The *Retransmission Royalties Criteria Regulations* provide a clear, structured, and balanced approach for determining fair and equitable royalty payments for the retransmission of distant signals in Canada. By incorporating international benchmarks (U.S. practices), domestic regulatory impacts, and real-world industry agreements, the regulations ensure that the royalty system is both legally sound and commercially viable. This framework remains a foundational element in Canadian copyright policy related to international broadcast content.
