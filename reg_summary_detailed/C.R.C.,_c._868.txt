### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

The Fitness and Amateur Sport Regulations are enacted under the authority of the *Fitness and Amateur Sport Act*. Their primary purpose is to define and clarify key terms—specifically "amateur sport" and "fitness"—to ensure consistent interpretation and application of the Act in policy, governance, and practice related to recreational, fitness-oriented, and non-professional sporting activities.

These Regulations provide legal definitions that form the foundation for administrative decisions, eligibility criteria, funding allocations, and the protection of individuals involved in amateur sport and fitness initiatives.

### **2. Definition of "Amateur Sport"**

**Definition:**  
*Amateur sport* means **any athletic activity when engaged in solely for recreation, fitness, or pleasure and not as a means of livelihood**.

**Key Elements of the Definition:**

- **Primary Motivation:** The activity must be pursued for personal enjoyment, physical well-being, or social engagement—not for financial gain.
- **Exclusion of Livelihood:** Participation is not permitted if the individual is engaged in the activity to earn a living, such as through professional contracts, salaries, sponsorships, or income derived directly from competition or performance.
- **Scope:** Applies to all forms of athletic activity, including but not limited to:
  - Team sports (e.g., football, basketball, rugby)
  - Individual sports (e.g., swimming, running, tennis)
  - Outdoor and endurance activities (e.g., hiking, cycling, martial arts)
  - Competitive or non-competitive events, as long as they are not conducted for financial reward.

**Implications:**

- Individuals participating in amateur sport are protected from commercial exploitation or performance-based compensation.
- Organizations offering amateur sports programs, such as schools, community clubs, or youth leagues, can operate under the framework of amateurism without needing to restrict participation due to financial incentives.
- The definition helps distinguish amateur sport from professional sport, which is governed by separate rules and regulations, often involving contracts, endorsements, and licensing.

### **3. Definition of "Fitness"**

**Definition:**  
*Fitness* means **the state in which a person is able to function at his physical and mental optimum**.

**Key Elements of the Definition:**

- **Physical Optimum:** Refers to an individual's ability to perform daily physical tasks efficiently and safely, including strength, endurance, flexibility, balance, and cardiovascular health.
- **Mental Optimum:** Encompasses cognitive function, emotional well-being, stress resilience, concentration, and overall psychological health.
- **Holistic View:** The term integrates both physical and mental aspects, recognizing that true fitness is not solely about physical performance but also about overall well-being and functional capacity.

**Implications:**

- The definition supports a broad and inclusive approach to health promotion, encouraging participation in diverse physical and mental activities.
- It supports public health initiatives, school programs, workplace wellness, and community-based fitness interventions that aim to improve general quality of life.
- Provides a basis for setting standards in fitness assessments, training programs, and health monitoring, especially in youth development and aging populations.

### **4. Legal and Practical Significance**

- **Clarity for Stakeholders:** These definitions help clarify the boundaries between amateur and professional participation, which is crucial for eligibility in funding, insurance, and governance.
- **Protection of Individuals:** The emphasis on non-commercial participation safeguards individuals from undue pressure, exploitation, or the loss of personal autonomy due to financial incentives.
- **Policy Development:** The definitions support the development of inclusive policies that promote accessible, equitable, and sustainable participation in sport and fitness for all age groups and backgrounds.
- **Alignment with Broader Public Health Goals:** By defining fitness as a holistic state of physical and mental well-being, the Regulations align with national and international public health objectives, such as those outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on physical activity and mental health.

### **5. Limitations and Interpretation**

- The Regulations do not define "recreation," "fitness," or "pleasure" in detail, leaving room for interpretation based on context and common understanding.
- The term "means of livelihood" is broad and may require case-by-case assessment. For example, a person who trains in a sport to earn a living through coaching or event management may not qualify as an amateur participant.
- The Regulations do not prohibit individuals from engaging in amateur sport while also having a part-time job or side income—only that the sport itself must not be a primary source of income.

### **Conclusion**

The *Fitness and Amateur Sport Regulations* establish clear, foundational definitions that are essential for the effective implementation of the *Fitness and Amateur Sport Act*. By defining "amateur sport" as activity pursued for recreation, fitness, or pleasure without financial gain, and by defining "fitness" as a state of physical and mental optimum, the Regulations promote equitable access, protect participants from commercialization, and support public health and well-being objectives. These definitions serve as a cornerstone for policy, program design, and legal interpretation across sports, education, and community health sectors.
