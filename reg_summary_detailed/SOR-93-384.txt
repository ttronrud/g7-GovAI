---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation was issued by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs** of Canada, pursuant to **subsection 4(1) of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act** (*FMI Act*), to **revise and replace** an earlier order dated **December 15, 1992**, which had granted privileges and immunities to certain members of the administrative and technical staff of the U.S. Embassy in Canada and their families.

The primary objective of this Order is to **extend specific privileges and immunities**—those granted under the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*—to members of the **administrative and technical staff** of the U.S. Embassy in Canada, **as well as their families**, provided they meet certain conditions.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Revocation of Prior Order**
- The Order **revokes** the previous *Administrative and Technical Staff of the Embassy of the United States of America Privileges and Immunities Order* dated December 15, 1992.
- It replaces it with a **new, updated Order** that extends privileges and immunities under the *FMI Act* to the specified personnel.

#### **2. Scope of Privileges and Immunities**
- The privileges and immunities granted under **Section 3 of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act** (which typically apply to diplomatic agents) are now extended to:
  - Members of the **administrative and technical staff** of the U.S. Embassy in Canada.
  - The **members of their families** who are part of their household.

> **Note**: This extension applies **only to privileges and immunities other than duty and tax relief**.  
> - *Duty relief* (e.g., exemption from certain duties or charges) and *tax relief* (e.g., exemption from income tax) are **not included** in this extension.

#### **3. Exclusions**
- The privileges and immunities **do not extend** to:
  - Staff members who are **nationals or permanent residents of Canada**.
  - Family members of such individuals who are part of their household.

> This exclusion is significant because it ensures that Canadian citizens or permanent residents do not receive the same benefits as non-Canadian nationals, thereby maintaining Canada’s sovereignty and control over its own citizens and residents.

#### **4. Citation and Legal Status**
- The Order may be cited as:  
  **"The Administrative and Technical Staff of the Embassy of the United States and Families Privileges and Immunities Order"**  
- It is **not published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**, which may indicate it was issued internally or as a supplementary administrative order, though it remains legally binding.

### **Legal Basis**
- The Order is authorized under **subsection 4(1) of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act**.
- This provision empowers the Secretary of State to grant privileges and immunities to personnel of foreign missions, including non-diplomatic staff, under specific conditions.

### **Implications and Significance**

1. **Recognition of Non-Diplomatic Staff**  
   - While diplomatic agents traditionally enjoy full diplomatic privileges, this Order recognizes the importance of administrative and technical staff in foreign missions and grants them **limited but meaningful immunities and protections** in Canada—such as protection from arrest, immunity from civil liability, and freedom from certain legal proceedings—**as long as they are not Canadian nationals or permanent residents**.

2. **Family Inclusion**  
   - The inclusion of **family members** in the scope of privileges acknowledges the practical realities of diplomatic life, where staff often live and work in Canada with their families.

3. **Exclusion of Canadian Nationals/Residents**  
   - The exclusion ensures that **Canadian citizens and permanent residents** are not treated as foreign nationals in terms of privileges, preserving Canada’s legal and diplomatic boundaries.

4. **Limited Scope**  
   - The Order **does not extend** to tax or duty exemptions, which remain under separate legal frameworks and are typically not granted to non-diplomatic staff.

5. **Diplomatic Practice and International Norms**  
   - This regulation aligns with international practices where host countries may extend certain immunities to technical and administrative staff to facilitate smooth operations of embassies. However, it does so with clear limits and conditions to avoid overreach.

### **Effective Date and Issuance**
- **Issued**: July 14, 1993  
- **Issued by**: PERRIN BEATTY, Secretary of State for External Affairs  
- **Location**: Ottawa, Canada

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a formal and legally binding framework that extends **limited privileges and immunities**—excluding duty and tax relief—to the **administrative and technical staff of the U.S. Embassy in Canada** and their **non-Canadian family members** living in Canada. It replaces an older order, reflects evolving diplomatic practices, and maintains Canada’s legal sovereignty by excluding Canadian nationals and permanent residents from these benefits.

It is a **practical and balanced measure** that supports diplomatic operations while respecting Canadian legal and constitutional principles.
