- **Prescribe a formal Oath of Secrecy** that must be taken by certain RCMP officers.
- Ensure that individuals in key roles within the RCMP uphold **strict confidentiality** regarding sensitive information, particularly in matters involving national security, law enforcement operations, and personal privacy.
