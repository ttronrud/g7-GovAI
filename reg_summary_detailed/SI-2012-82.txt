**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This action is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, which grants the government the power to designate certain land parcels—particularly those adjacent to water bodies—for inclusion in land grants, often to protect Indigenous rights, ensure public access, or preserve environmental and cultural significance.

Specifically, paragraph 13(b) allows for the inclusion of land that is within a specified distance of the **ordinary high water mark** of a shoreline, particularly when such land is relevant to Indigenous communities or land use rights. The regulation applies to land along **Great Slave Lake**, a major body of water in the Northwest Territories.

**Geographic Scope and Description of Land:**

The regulation pertains to **specific lots** located in the **City of Yellowknife**, in the **Northwest Territories**:

- **Lots 11, 12, 13, and 14**
- **Block D**

These lots are defined by their location on the **plan of survey number 86234**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** maintained in Ottawa. This survey plan serves as the official legal and topographical reference for the boundaries of the lots.

A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in Yellowknife under **file number 3750**. This ensures that the land description is officially recorded and accessible for legal and administrative purposes.

**Key Provision:**

Any portion of these lots that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of **Great Slave Lake** shall be **included in any future grant** of those lands.

This means that:

- Even if a land grant is made for only part of the lots (e.g., due to zoning, development, or ownership transfer), any parcel that falls within the 100-foot zone from the high water mark must be **automatically included** in the grant.
- This inclusion is not optional; it is mandatory under this regulation.

**Purpose and Implications:**

1. **Environmental and Cultural Protection**:  
   The 100-foot buffer zone is likely intended to protect sensitive shoreline areas, including potential ecological zones, traditional use areas, or cultural sites of Indigenous communities. By requiring inclusion of this land in grants, the regulation helps safeguard against unauthorized development or encroachment.

2. **Legal Clarity and Consistency**:  
   The regulation provides a clear, standardized rule for land grants involving shoreline areas, reducing ambiguity in land title transfers and ensuring that all land adjacent to the water is accounted for.

3. **Indigenous and Community Rights Consideration**:  
   Given that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development recommended this regulation, it reflects a recognition of Indigenous land use and stewardship, particularly in areas with historical or ongoing traditional use.

4. **Land Administration and Survey Accuracy**:  
   The reliance on a formal survey plan (No. 86234) and official land records ensures that the boundaries are legally defined and enforceable, minimizing disputes over land ownership or inclusion.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a mandatory inclusion of shoreline land within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** of Great Slave Lake—specifically within **Lots 11, 12, 13, and 14, Block D** in Yellowknife—into any future land grant. It is issued under the Territorial Lands Act, reflecting both administrative efficiency and the protection of environmental, cultural, and Indigenous interests. The regulation ensures that such land is not excluded from grants, thereby promoting equitable land management and protecting the integrity of the shoreline zone.
