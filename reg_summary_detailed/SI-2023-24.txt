### **Regulatory Background and Legal Context**

This regulation, published under **SOR/2019-82** (Statutory Instrument 2019-82), constitutes a formal **extension of the application of Section 14d of the Citizenship Act** of Canada. The Citizenship Act (R.S., c. C-29) governs the rules and procedures related to Canadian citizenship, including the rights and obligations of citizens and the conditions under which individuals may be naturalized or otherwise acquire citizenship.

Section 14d of the Citizenship Act specifically addresses **the requirement for a person to have lived in Canada for a certain period before being eligible to apply for citizenship**, and more broadly, it relates to the **conditions under which individuals may be considered for citizenship based on their residency and integration into Canadian society**.

### **Initial Extension (Original Order)**

- On **July 31, 2019**, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued an order (under **subsection 28.1(1)b** of the Citizenship Act) extending the application of **Section 14d** for a period of **five years**, with the extension **ending on July 31, 2024**.

> This initial extension was intended to provide continuity in the implementation of Section 14d’s requirements during a transitional period, allowing the government to assess its impact and make adjustments as needed.

---

### **Provision for Further Extension**

- Under **subsection 28.1(2)b** of the Citizenship Act, the Minister is authorized to **extend the application of Section 14d for up to five additional years before the expiry of each current extension period**.

> This provision gives the Minister discretion to renew the application of Section 14d if necessary, provided that the extension does not exceed five years at a time.

### **Current Extension (Effective as of June 27, 2023)**

- On **June 27, 2023**, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued a new order under **subsection 28.1(2)b** of the Citizenship Act, extending the application of **Section 14d** for another **five-year period**.

- The new extension **commences from the date of the order (June 27, 2023)** and **ends on July 31, 2027**.

> This extension ensures that the provisions of Section 14d remain in force and operational through to **2027**, providing stability and predictability for individuals applying for citizenship, as well as for immigration officers and legal advisors.

### **Purpose and Implications of the Extension**

1. **Stability in Citizenship Procedures**  
   The extension ensures that the residency and integration requirements under Section 14d remain consistent, reducing uncertainty for applicants and immigration officials.

2. **Policy Continuity**  
   The government maintains a policy framework that emphasizes the importance of residency and integration before granting citizenship, which supports national cohesion and social integration.

3. **Flexibility for Future Review**  
   The five-year extension allows the Minister to monitor the effectiveness of the provisions, evaluate outcomes, and potentially adjust them in the future based on demographic, social, or policy developments.

4. **Legal and Administrative Clarity**  
   By clearly defining the timeline of the extension, the regulation provides legal certainty for applicants, legal practitioners, and administrative bodies.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation confirms that **Section 14d of the Citizenship Act remains in force from June 27, 2023, until July 31, 2027**, under the authority granted by subsection 28.1(2)b of the Act. It is a continuation of a prior five-year extension (2019–2024) and reflects the government’s ongoing commitment to maintaining consistent standards for citizenship eligibility based on residency and integration.

The extension is not automatic or indefinite—it is subject to review and potential renewal only under the same conditions, with a maximum of five years per extension. The Minister retains discretion to decide whether to extend the provision beyond 2027, but only if it is done before the current period expires.
