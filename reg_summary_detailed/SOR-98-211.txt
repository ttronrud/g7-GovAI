The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of certain regulations under statutory orders:

- **SOR/2012-262, s. 3** (Statutory Order 2012-262, section 3)
- **SOR/2004-273, s. 11** (Statutory Order 2004-273, section 11)

These references indicate that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by legislative action.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Entry:**
The text does not contain the actual content or text of a regulation. Instead, it lists multiple instances (repeated 14 times) of repeals. This suggests that the regulation being referenced was previously listed in a regulatory document or legal database and was officially removed from force by a government statutory order.

**2. Repeal by SOR/2012-262, s. 3:**
- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument or Statutory Order*.
- **SOR/2012-262** is a Statutory Order issued in 2012, specifically numbered 262.
- **Section 3** of that order contains the provisions that repeal certain prior regulations.
- The repeated references to this section indicate that multiple regulations were repealed under this section, including the one in question.

**3. Repeal by SOR/2004-273, s. 11:**
- This earlier order (from 2004) also contained a provision (section 11) that repealed a prior regulation.
- The fact that this is listed separately suggests that the regulation may have been previously repealed in 2004 and then again in 2012, or that the 2012 repeal was broader or more definitive.

**4. Legal Implications:**
- A regulation that has been **repealed** is no longer in force and is not enforceable.
- Any legal obligations, administrative procedures, or compliance requirements tied to that regulation are now null and void.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Modernize outdated rules
  - Align with new legislation
  - Remove conflicting or redundant provisions
  - Reflect changes in policy or administrative structure

**5. Contextual Notes:**
- The repetition of the same repeal references (e.g., “[Repealed, SOR/2012-262, s. 3]” appearing 14 times) likely reflects a data entry or database error, or a formatting issue in the original source. It does not imply that the regulation was repealed multiple times or that there were multiple versions.
- The regulation itself is not described in the text — only its repeal status is noted.

### Conclusion:
The provided information **does not contain a detailed summary of a regulation**, but rather a list indicating that a particular regulation (or set of regulations) has been **repealed** by **SOR/2012-262, section 3** and possibly earlier by **SOR/2004-273, section 11**. Since the actual content of the regulation is missing, a detailed summary of its provisions, purpose, or scope cannot be provided.

👉 **Final Answer Summary:**
The regulation referenced has been officially repealed and is no longer in force. It was repealed by Statutory Order 2012-262, section 3, and possibly earlier by Statutory Order 2004-273, section 11. The repeated references in the text are likely due to formatting or data duplication. Without the original regulation’s text, no detailed content, purpose, or operational details can be summarized. The repeal means the regulation is legally invalid and no longer applicable.
