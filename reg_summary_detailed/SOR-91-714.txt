**Detailed Summary of the Petro-Canada Limited Pension Protection Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The *Petro-Canada Limited Pension Protection Regulations* were issued on **November 29, 1991**, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of State (Finance and Privatization)** and the **President of the Treasury Board**.

These regulations were made under **Section 17 of the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act** (*S.C. 1991, c. 10*), which provides a framework for ensuring pension protection for employees of Petro-Canada Limited during and after the company’s transition from a public service entity to a privatized corporation.

The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Petro-Canada Limited Pension Protection Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

### **Applicability of Existing Pension Laws**

The regulations establish that the **Public Service Superannuation Act** and the **Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act**, along with their associated regulations, generally apply to employees of Petro-Canada Limited who make an election under **paragraph 17(1)(d)** of the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act.

> This means that most pension rights and benefits are governed by the standard public service pension regimes — unless specifically modified or excluded by Sections 3 and 4 of these regulations.

### **Key Adaptations to Public Service Pension Acts**

To align pension rights for employees transitioning from the Public Service to Petro-Canada Limited, the regulations adapt key provisions of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA) and the *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act* (SRBA). These adaptations ensure continuity and fairness in pension entitlements during the transition period.

---

#### **1. Adaptation of Subparagraphs 10(9)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

- **Original Provision**: These subparagraphs define the "year in which a person ceased to be employed in the Public Service" for pension purposes.
- **Adaptation**:
  - The "year in which a person ceased to be employed in the Public Service" is **redefined** to mean the **year in which the person ceased to be employed by Petro-Canada Limited**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures consistency in pension calculations when an employee leaves Petro-Canada. It prevents discrepancies arising from a person ceasing public service employment at a different time than their departure from Petro-Canada.

---

#### **2. Adaptation of Sections 12 and 13 of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

These sections govern pensionable service, retirement benefits, and the calculation of pension entitlements.

##### **a. Pensionable Service and Employment Periods**
- **Adaptation**:
  - The **number of years of pensionable service** and any **period of employment** includes:
    - All service or employment with Petro-Canada Limited during the period:
      - Beginning on the day the person ceased to be employed in the Public Service  
      - And ending on the day **immediately before** the day they ceased to be employed by Petro-Canada Limited.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that time spent working at Petro-Canada after leaving the Public Service is counted toward pension entitlements. It prevents the loss of pensionable service due to a gap in employment status.

##### **b. Retirement Date for Pension Calculations**
- **Adaptation**:
  - Except for the purpose of **subsection 12(4)** of the PSSA (which may have a different rule), the **day on which a person ceased to be employed in the Public Service** is **redefined** as the **day they ceased to be employed by Petro-Canada Limited**.

> **Purpose**: This aligns the retirement date used in pension calculations with the actual end of employment at Petro-Canada, avoiding confusion or inconsistencies when comparing public service and private sector employment timelines.

---

#### **3. Adaptation of Subsection 4(5) and Subparagraphs 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act**

These provisions relate to retirement years and contribution periods for the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Account (SRBA), which provides additional retirement benefits.

##### **a. Subsection 4(5): Retirement Year or Month**
- **Original Provision**: Defines retirement year/month based on actual retirement date.
- **Adaptation**:
  - The **retirement year or month** of a person is **1991 or July 1991**, as applicable.

> **Purpose**: This establishes a fixed retirement reference point for pension calculations. It likely reflects the timing of Petro-Canada's privatization or the effective date of the regulations. By setting a uniform retirement date, it simplifies pension calculations and ensures consistency across employee groups.

##### **b. Subparagraphs 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii): Year of Ceasing Contributions**
- **Original Provision**: Defines the year in which a person ceased contributing to the SRBA based on their public service employment end date.
- **Adaptation**:
  - The **year in which a person ceased to contribute** to the SRBA is the **year in which they ceased to be employed by Petro-Canada Limited**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that contribution periods under the SRBA are tied directly to employment at Petro-Canada, not to earlier public service employment. This avoids misalignment and ensures accurate tracking of contribution history.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **came into force** (or were **deemed to have come into force**) on **November 29, 1991**.

> This coincides with the timing of Petro-Canada’s privatization process and the enactment of the Public Participation Act, making it a critical date for pension entitlements and administrative processing.

---

### **Exclusions and Exceptions**

- The above adaptations **do not apply** to certain specific provisions in the Public Service Superannuation Act and the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act, as explicitly excluded in **Sections 3 and 4** of the regulations.
- These exceptions are not detailed in the provided text, but they suggest that some aspects of pension rules (e.g., specific benefit formulas, early retirement rules, or special cases) remain governed by the original public service legislation.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Ensure Pension Continuity**: To prevent pension rights from being lost or distorted due to the transition of Petro-Canada from a public service entity to a private corporation.
2. **Clarify Employment End Dates**: To align retirement and service periods with actual employment at Petro-Canada, not with earlier public service employment.
3. **Simplify Administration**: By setting fixed dates (e.g., 1991 or July 1991), the regulations reduce complexity in calculating retirement benefits and contribution periods.
4. **Protect Employee Interests**: To safeguard employees’ pension entitlements during a period of organizational change and privatization.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Petro-Canada Limited Pension Protection Regulations* serve as a critical transitional mechanism to ensure that employees of Petro-Canada Limited are treated fairly and consistently under public service pension laws during and after the company’s privatization. By adapting key provisions of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and the *Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act*, the regulations:

- Count Petro-Canada employment as pensionable service,
- Align retirement dates with actual employment end dates,
- Fix key retirement reference points (1991 or July 1991),
- Prevent loss of pension benefits due to employment transitions.

These measures were essential in maintaining employee trust and financial stability during a major shift in the ownership and structure of Petro-Canada.
