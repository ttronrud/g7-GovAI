**Summary:**

This regulation formally transfers administrative control and supervision of a specific component of the federal public administration from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Department of Industry**.

Specifically, the portion of the federal public administration within the Privy Council Office known as the **National Science Advisor Secretariat (NSAS)** is being transferred. The NSAS is a key advisory body that provides science-based policy recommendations to the federal government, typically on issues involving scientific research, technological innovation, and evidence-based decision-making.

Under this transfer:

- **Control and supervision** of the National Science Advisor Secretariat are relocated from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Industry.
- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reorganization of public service functions and the reallocation of responsibilities between federal departments and offices.
- The change takes effect on **May 8, 2006**.

**Key Implications:**

1. **Shift in Policy Focus:**  
   By moving the NSAS to the Department of Industry, the federal government signals a strategic alignment between science policy and economic development. The Department of Industry is responsible for fostering innovation, supporting research and development, and promoting industrial competitiveness. This transfer ensures that science advice is more directly integrated into policies related to technology, innovation, and economic growth.

2. **Enhanced Integration of Science and Industry Policy:**  
   The National Science Advisor Secretariat will now operate under a department with a clear mandate to support industry and innovation. This facilitates better coordination between scientific research and practical applications in the private sector, potentially improving the translation of scientific findings into economic and industrial outcomes.

3. **Administrative Reorganization:**  
   The transfer reflects broader efforts to streamline federal public service structures, reduce duplication, and improve efficiency. It also demonstrates a move toward functional accountability—placing science advisory functions in a department that can more effectively manage and evaluate their impact on economic policy.

4. **Continuity of Advisory Role:**  
   While the administrative home of the NSAS changes, the core function of providing independent, expert scientific advice to government remains unchanged. The Secretariat will continue to operate with its established mandate, though now under the oversight and operational framework of the Department of Industry.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to transfer control of public service functions between departments or offices. This provision allows for flexibility in reorganizing federal government operations in response to evolving policy needs.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization within Canada’s federal public service. It strengthens the link between scientific expertise and industrial policy by formally assigning the National Science Advisor Secretariat to the Department of Industry. This move enhances the government’s capacity to use science as a driver of innovation and economic development, ensuring that scientific advice is better aligned with national economic priorities. The transfer is both administratively sound and strategically aligned with Canada’s goals in science, technology, and industrial competitiveness.
