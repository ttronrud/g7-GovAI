**Detailed Summary of the Charitable Food Donations Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**
This regulation, known as the *Charitable Food Donations Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Remission Order*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**. This section provides the legal authority to make orders related to the remission (exemption) of duties under special import measures.

The Order is designed to support charitable causes by allowing certain food donations from non-residents of Canada to be exempt from anti-dumping and countervailing duties that would otherwise apply.

---

### **2. Scope of the Regulation – Definition of "Food"**
- The term **"food"** is defined as **food for human consumption**.
- This definition **excludes**:
  - Alcoholic beverages
  - Spirits
- Thus, the exemption applies only to edible food products intended for human consumption, not to drinks or other non-food items.

---

### **3. Key Provision – Duty Remission**
- **Remission of duties** is granted for all **anti-dumping and countervailing duties** imposed under the *Special Import Measures Act* (SIMA) on food that is:
  - Donated by a **non-resident of Canada** to a **registered charity** in Canada.
- The charity must be a **registered charity** as defined under **subsection 248(1) of the Income Tax Act**. This ensures that only legitimate, tax-exempt charitable organizations are eligible.

---

### **4. Conditions for Eligibility and Remission**
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

| Condition | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Import Date** | The food must be imported into Canada **on or after the date the Order comes into force**. This establishes a clear start date for the exemption. |
| **2. Importer Requirement** | The **registered charity** must be the **importer** of the food. This means the charity must formally take responsibility for bringing the food into Canada. |
| **3. Charitable Purpose** | The food must be intended for **charitable distribution within Canada**. It cannot be used for commercial or private purposes. |
| **4. No Sale in Canada** | The food must **not be sold or marketed for commercial gain** in Canada. The purpose must remain strictly charitable. |
| **5. Timely Claim Submission** | A formal **claim for remission** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date the food is accounted for under **section 32 of the Customs Act**. This ensures accountability and timely processing. |

---

### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette. This provides immediate effect upon official publication, allowing eligible donors and charities to begin complying with the rules from that date.

---

### **6. Purpose and Rationale**
The primary objectives of this regulation are:
- To encourage international charitable food donations to Canada by reducing administrative and financial barriers.
- To support food security and humanitarian efforts through charitable distribution.
- To ensure that the tax and duty system does not create undue burdens on legitimate charitable activities involving food donations from abroad.

By exempting such donations from anti-dumping and countervailing duties—commonly imposed to protect domestic industries—the government promotes social welfare and international cooperation in the area of food aid.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The exemption does **not apply** to:
  - Alcoholic beverages or spirits.
  - Food intended for sale or resale in Canada.
  - Donations made to non-registered charities.
  - Food imported before the Order's effective date.
- The requirement for a claim to be filed within two years ensures that the government maintains oversight and audit capability.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for receiving and processing claims for remission.
- Compliance with the conditions (especially the charitable use and non-sale clause) is critical to avoid denial of remission.
- The regulation is enforceable under the framework of the *Customs Tariff Act* and the *Income Tax Act*, with potential penalties for false or misleading claims.

---

### **Conclusion**
This Order represents a targeted policy intervention to support charitable food distribution in Canada. It provides a clear, legally grounded pathway for non-resident food donations to be exempt from anti-dumping and countervailing duties, provided they meet strict conditions related to charitable use, import timing, and proper documentation. It balances the need to protect domestic industries with the broader social objective of promoting food access and humanitarian aid.

This regulation remains in force as of its registration in 1997 and continues to serve as a key tool in Canada’s charitable food assistance framework.
