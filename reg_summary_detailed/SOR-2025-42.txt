### **4. Scope and Application of Privileges and Immunities**

The Order grants distinct sets of privileges and immunities depending on the status of the individual or entity involved. These are applied **only to the extent necessary for the exercise of their official functions** in relation to the G7 meetings.

#### **A. Representatives of Foreign States**

Foreign government representatives participating in G7 meetings (e.g., ministers, ambassadors) are granted the following privileges and immunities under **Articles 11, 12, and 14–16 of the UN Convention**:

- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., civil or criminal proceedings) in Canada for acts performed in the course of their official duties.
- **Immunity from search, seizure, or arrest** during official functions.
- **Exemption from taxation** on income derived from official duties.
- **Freedom of movement** and **exemption from certain administrative requirements** (e.g., visas, entry restrictions).
- **Protection of official communications** (e.g., confidentiality of correspondence).

> *Note*: These privileges are limited to actions directly related to the G7 meetings and are not extended to personal or private activities.

#### **B. Heads of International Organizations and Senior Officials**

Heads of international organizations (e.g., UN Secretary-General, World Bank CEO), along with their **alternates and other senior officials**, are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic agents** under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR)**.

These include:
- Immunity from criminal and civil jurisdiction in Canada.
- Protection of official communications.
- Exemption from certain taxes and duties.
- Freedom of movement and access to premises.
- Protection from interference with official functions.

> *Note*: This is a **direct comparison** to the VCDR, which is the standard international framework for diplomatic immunity. This ensures that senior international officials are treated with the same level of protection as diplomats.

#### **C. Other Officials of International Organizations**

Lower-level officials (e.g., staff, coordinators, technical personnel) who are not heads or senior officials are granted privileges and immunities under **Section 18 of Article V of the UN Convention**.

These include:
- Immunity from legal proceedings for acts performed in the course of their official duties.
- Protection of personal property and communications.
- Limited immunity from arrest or detention.

> *Note*: These protections are narrower than those for diplomatic agents or heads, but still sufficient to allow officials to perform their roles without disruption.

#### **D. Experts Performing Missions for International Organizations**

Experts (e.g., technical advisors, consultants, researchers) who are engaged to support international organizations during G7 meetings are granted the privileges and immunities under **Article VI of the UN Convention**.

These include:
- Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction for acts performed in the course of their expert duties.
- Protection of personal and professional information.
- Exemption from certain administrative and procedural requirements.

> *Note*: This provision ensures that technical and specialized personnel can operate effectively and securely during high-level meetings.
