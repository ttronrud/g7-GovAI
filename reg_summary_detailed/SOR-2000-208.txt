### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Repeal Status**
- The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**.
- It was formally **repealed** on the date specified in the statutory instrument: **SOR/2015-145**, which came into effect on **April 1, 2015** (as per standard publication dates for such instruments in Canada).
- The repeal is specifically attributed to **Section 51** of that instrument.

#### 2. **What Does "Repealed" Mean?**
- A repealed regulation is **no longer legally binding or enforceable**.
- It has been **superseded or replaced** by a newer, more current regulation or policy.
- The repeal may have occurred due to:
  - Obsolescence (outdated or no longer relevant)
  - Legislative modernization
  - Inconsistency with current law
  - Redundancy or overlap with other regulations
  - A decision by the government to streamline or simplify the regulatory framework

#### 3. **SOR/2015-145 – Context**
- SOR/2015-145 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued under the authority of the Canadian government (typically by a federal department or agency).
- Statutory Instruments are a form of secondary legislation used to implement or amend primary legislation.
- The specific content of SOR/2015-145 is not provided in your query, but based on the repealing section (s. 51), it likely involved amendments or changes to a prior regulation—possibly related to **environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or public health**—depending on the original subject matter of the repealed provision.

#### 4. **Implications of Repeal**

- Entities (such as businesses, government agencies, or individuals) must now comply with **current, active regulations** that replaced or succeeded the repealed one.
- Legal proceedings or compliance audits referencing the repealed section may be invalid or require reinterpretation.

#### 5. **Why Multiple Repeats?**
- The repetition of the same line appears to be a formatting or data-entry error.
- In official databases or legal documents, such repetitions may occur due to technical issues or incomplete data processing.
- However, in legal terms, **only one instance of repeal is necessary** to nullify a regulation—so the repetition does not add legal weight or meaning.
