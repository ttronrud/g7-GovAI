### **3. Timing of Transmission and Receipt**

#### **When is an electronic document deemed sent?**
- **Different systems:** When it enters an electronic system **outside the control** of the Minister or Commission.
- **Same system:** When it becomes **capable of being retrieved and processed** by the recipient.

#### **When is it deemed received by the recipient?**
- On the date and time it enters their designated electronic system and becomes retrievable/processable.
- **Exception:** If the recipient notifies the Minister or Commission within a **reasonable period** that the document cannot be retrieved or processed — then it is not deemed received.

#### **When is it deemed received by the Minister or Commission?**
- On the date and time indicated by the **Minister’s or Commission’s designated electronic system** for receiving such documents.

> 📌 *If the document cannot be retrieved or processed by the Minister/Commission, it is deemed not received.*

#### **For same transmission:**
- All documents or information sent in the same transmission are deemed received at the **same time**.

---

### **4. Proof of Date and Time**

Proof of transmission or receipt may be established using any of the following:
- Transmission slip
- Acknowledgment of receipt
- Metadata (e.g., timestamps, sender/receiver info)
- Any other equivalent electronic record

> ✅ *These records must clearly indicate the date and time of sending or receiving.*

---

### **5. Requirements for Electronic Signatures**

Every electronic signature must:
1. **Reliably link** the identity of the signatory to the document or information.
2. **Indicate the signatory’s intention** regarding the document (e.g., approval, consent, agreement).

#### **Standard of Reliability Must Consider:**
- The **purpose** of the signature (e.g., legal enforceability, administrative use)
- The **method used** to verify the signatory’s identity
- The **ability to verify**:
  - Whether the signature or document has been altered **after signing**
  - The **link between the signature and the document**

> 🔐 *The reliability standard is not one-size-fits-all — it is context-specific and must be justified based on the document’s function.*

---

### **6. Conversion of Documents and Information**

#### **General Rule:**
- Any document or information (including metadata) may be converted.

#### **Mandatory Requirements for Conversion:**
- Must be completed **without compromising legal value**.
- Must preserve the **original content, structure, and context**.

#### **Required Conversion Records Must Include:**
1. **Reference to original format** (e.g., PDF, Word, scanned image)
2. **Steps taken during conversion**, including:
   - Description of tools or software used
   - Guarantees offered by the conversion product regarding integrity
3. **Quality control details** (if relevant to integrity)
4. **Details of any prior conversions**

#### **Retention of Conversion Records:**
- Must be **retained throughout the required retention period**
- Must be **attached directly or by reference** to the resulting electronic document or storage medium

> ⚖️ *Important: Even if the original document is destroyed, a converted document that follows these rules remains admissible in legal proceedings — **admissibility is not challenged solely on the basis of format change**.*

---

### **7. Retention of Electronic Documents**

An electronic document or information may be retained in electronic form **if**:

#### **(a) Creation, Sending, or Receipt:**
- For **non-electronic documents**: Retained in a format that **does not alter content**
- For **electronic documents**: Retained in:
  - The original format, or
  - A format that **accurately represents** the original

#### **(b) Usability and Readability:**
- The content and metadata must be **readable/perceivable** for future reference.

#### **(c) Integrity Maintenance:**
- The format and medium must provide a **reliable means** of maintaining integrity from the moment of creation/sending/receiving until the end of the retention period — **excluding normal changes** (e.g., updates, formatting adjustments in display or transmission).

> 📝 *Integrity includes protection against unauthorized alterations, and must be verifiable at any point during the retention period.*

---

### **8. Integrity of Electronic Documents**

#### **What is "Integrity"?**
- The document and its metadata must remain **unchanged** (except for normal, authorized changes) from creation to end of retention.

#### **How is Integrity Assessed?**
- Based on:
  - Security measures applied (e.g., encryption, access controls)
  - Security and reliability of the electronic system used for creation, transmission, receipt, or storage

#### **Integrity is Maintained If:**
- It is **possible to verify** that the document and metadata have not been altered
- Even if the document has been:
  - Fragmented
  - Compressed
  - Stored temporarily to improve transmission efficiency

> ✅ *Integrity is preserved even if the document is not in its original format — as long as the content and metadata remain authentic and unmodified.*

---

### **9. Legal Value and Use of Electronic Documents**

An electronic document or information that maintains integrity has:
- **The same legal value** as the original (physical or non-electronic version)
- **Can be used in place of** the original document
- Is **not invalid or unenforceable** simply because it is in electronic format

> 📜 *This affirms the legal standing of electronic records under Canadian law, especially in administrative and judicial contexts.*

---

### **10. Alteration of Electronic Documents**

#### **General Rule:**
- **No person may alter** an electronic document or its metadata created, sent, or received by the Minister or Commission — **unless authorized**.

#### **Authorized Alterations:**
- Permitted only if:
  - The details of the alteration are **recorded in an unalterable record**
  - The record must include:
    - Date and time of alteration
    - Name of the person making the change

> 🔒 *This ensures transparency, accountability, and auditability of any changes.*

---

### **11. Destruction of Electronic Records**

When the retention period ends:
- The document may be **destroyed**, subject to the requirements of **Section 12 of the Library and Archives of Canada Act** (which governs access and destruction of government records).

#### **Required Destruction Records (Audit Log):**
Must include:
1. The **electronic document or information** to be destroyed
2. **Date and time** of creation, sending, or receipt (if generated and retained)
3. **Name of person who authorized destruction**
4. **Date and time of destruction**

> 📂 *Destruction must be properly documented to ensure accountability and compliance with public records laws.*
