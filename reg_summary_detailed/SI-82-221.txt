**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Revocation of Designation of Place of Inspection and Sale and Designation of a New Place of Inspection and Sale under the Statutory Instruments Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
P. M. Pitfield, Clerk of the Privy Council

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraphs 24(a) and 25(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, which empower the Clerk of the Privy Council to revoke or amend designations related to the inspection and sale of statutory instruments.

---

**Background Context:**  
The original regulation, **SI/80-179**, dated **November 12, 1980**, designated a specific location as the official place where registered statutory instruments (those made under the Statutory Instruments Act) could be inspected or copies obtained. This designation was intended to ensure public access to official government instruments.

However, by **October 26, 1982**, the Clerk of the Privy Council determined that the original designated location (as referenced in SI/80-179) was no longer suitable or effective for public access, and therefore, it was revoked.

**Key Actions in the Regulation:**

1. **Revocation of Prior Designation:**  
   The regulation formally **revokes SI/80-179**, which had designated a previous location as the official place for public inspection and copying of statutory instruments.

2. **New Designation:**  
   The Clerk of the Privy Council **designates a new location** as the official place where:
   - Any statutory instrument registered under **Section 6 or Section 32** of the Statutory Instruments Act  
   - That is **not precluded** from inspection or copying by other regulations or Acts of Parliament  
   may be inspected or copies obtained.

3. **Specific Location:**  
   The new designated place is:  
   **Room 418, Blackburn Building, 85 Sparks Street, Ottawa, Ontario.**

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The new designation takes effect on **November 1, 1982**.

---

**Scope and Applicability:**  
- The designation applies to **all statutory instruments** registered under Sections 6 or 32 of the Statutory Instruments Act.  
- Instruments that are **explicitly excluded** by other regulations or by Acts of Parliament (e.g., those requiring restricted access or confidentiality) are **not subject** to this designation.  
- The public is entitled to inspect and obtain copies of such instruments at the designated location, subject to any applicable restrictions or rules.

**Purpose and Significance:**  
This regulation ensures that the public has consistent, accessible, and centralized access to official government instruments. By relocating the inspection and copying facility to Room 418 in the Blackburn Building, the government improves accessibility, possibly due to better infrastructure, increased space, or improved public service delivery. It also reflects administrative updates to support transparency and accountability in the legislative process.

---

**Legal Authority and Procedure:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority granted by the **Statutory Instruments Act**, specifically:
- **Paragraph 24(a):** Power to revoke or amend designations of places of inspection and sale.  
- **Paragraph 25(a):** Power to designate new places of inspection and sale.

This procedural compliance ensures that the change is lawful, transparent, and within the established framework of the Act.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal administrative update to improve public access to statutory instruments. It removes the previous designation (SI/80-179) and establishes a new, current, and accessible location—Room 418, Blackburn Building, Ottawa—where citizens and stakeholders can inspect and obtain copies of registered statutory instruments, provided they are not otherwise restricted by law.

This action supports the principle of transparency and public access to government regulations, a cornerstone of democratic governance.
