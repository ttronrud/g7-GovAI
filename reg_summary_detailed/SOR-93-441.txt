### **Regulatory Framework and Key Provisions**

#### **1. Initial Credit (Within 10 Working Days of Coming Into Force)**

The Federal Minister (Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources) must credit the NSORA with the following **initial lump sum** within 10 working days of the regulations coming into force:

- The **aggregate** of:
  - Amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(ii)** of the Act (likely related to royalties or production-based payments).
  - Amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(iv)** of the Act (likely related to certain fees or charges).

> This initial credit covers the period from the date the Act came into force until the end of the second month before the regulations were enacted.

---

#### **2. Monthly Credits (Within 10 Working Days After Month-End)**

Each month, the Federal Minister must credit the NSORA with the **aggregate** of:

- Amounts under **subparagraphs 219(2)(a)(ii)** and **(a)(iv)** of the Act, **assessed, reassessed, or received** during that month.

> This ensures ongoing, monthly revenue recognition based on production and fees.

---

#### **3. Credit for "Section 219(2)(a)(i)" Amounts – Initial Period (10 Working Days)**

An initial credit is made within 10 working days of the regulations coming into force for:

- The **aggregate** of amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(i)** (likely referring to a specific type of royalty or payment) collected during the period from the Act’s commencement to the end of the second month before the regulations came into force.

> This reflects a one-time, historical adjustment for early revenue collected.

---

#### **4. Monthly Credit for "Section 219(2)(a)(i)" Amounts (Within 2 Working Days After 10th Day of Month)**

Each month, the Federal Minister must credit the NSORA with the **aggregate** of amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(i)** that were **paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund** during the **previous month**.

> This credit is made **within two working days after the 10th day of each month**, ensuring a prompt and regular flow of funds.

---

#### **5. One-Time Credit for "Section 219(2)(a)(v)" Amounts (Within 10 Working Days of Coming Into Force)**

The Federal Minister must credit the NSORA with the **aggregate** of amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(v)** of the Act — a specific category of revenue — **within 10 working days of the regulations coming into force**.

> This is a one-time credit, not recurring, and applies only to amounts collected during a defined initial period.

---

#### **6. Credit for "Section 219(2)(a)(iii)" Amounts – From Board Deposits**

The Federal Minister must credit the NSORA with the **aggregate** of amounts under **subparagraph 219(2)(a)(iii)** (likely related to certain offshore development or licensing fees) that were **collected and deposited by the Board** (the Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board) during the period:

- From the date the **provincial government and the Board entered into an agreement** under **section 100 of the Act**, to the day **immediately before** the regulations came into force.

> **Timing of Credit**:
> - If the Federal Minister receives a **notice from the Board** prior to the regulations coming into force stating the deposit details, the credit must be made **within 10 working days** of the regulations coming into force.
> - If no such notice is received before the regulations come into force, the credit must be made **within two working days** after the Federal Minister receives the notice.

> This provision ensures that all deposits made by the Board during the agreement period are accounted for and transferred to the provincial account.

---

#### **7. Monthly Credit for "Section 219(2)(a)(iii)" Amounts – Upon Receipt of Board Notice**

Whenever the Board makes a deposit under **subsection 101(2)** of the Act (a specific deposit mechanism), the Federal Minister must credit the NSORA within **two working days of receiving the notice** stating the deposit details.

> This ensures real-time responsiveness to Board deposits and prevents delays in revenue recognition.

---

#### **8. Payment of Credited Amounts to Her Majesty in Right of Nova Scotia**

The Federal Minister is required to **disburse** the credited amounts to the provincial government (Her Majesty in right of Nova Scotia) in the following ways:

- **For credits under sections 3 or 5** (which include the monthly credits under subsections 219(2)(a)(ii) and (iv), and the initial credits):
  - The payment must be made **not later than the last working day of each month** in which a credit is made.

- **For credits under sections 4 or 6** (which include the credits under 219(2)(a)(i) and 219(2)(a)(v)):
  - The payment must be made **within three working days** after the credit is made.

> This creates a **tiered payment schedule**:
> - Monthly payments (for regular credits) are made by the end of the month.
> - For certain types of credits (e.g., initial or specific categories), payments are made more quickly (within 3 working days) to ensure timely provincial access to funds.

| **Revenue Segregation** | Funds are transferred to a dedicated *Offshore Revenue Account*, separate from general revenues, protecting provincial access to offshore petroleum income. |
| **Monthly Cycles** | The system operates on a monthly basis, allowing for consistent revenue forecasting and budgeting by Nova Scotia. |
| **Historical and Current Coverage** | Includes both historical (initial) and ongoing revenue streams, ensuring equity in revenue distribution. |

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations are made under **subsection 219(2)** and **paragraph 221(b)** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*.
- This authority allows the federal government to administer and distribute offshore petroleum revenues in accordance with the Accord, while respecting provincial rights to share in these revenues.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Nova Scotia Offshore Revenue Account Regulations* establish a **clear, structured, and timely process** for the collection and distribution of offshore petroleum revenues between the federal and provincial governments. By defining precise timelines for:

- Crediting specific revenue categories (based on production, fees, or deposits),
- Receiving and acting on notices from the Board,
- And disbursing funds to Nova Scotia,

these regulations ensure **financial accountability, predictability, and fairness** in the sharing of offshore oil and gas revenues. They are a critical component of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord, reinforcing the economic partnership between the two jurisdictions.
