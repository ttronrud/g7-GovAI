Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the **Low-Materiality Fees Regulations**, enacted under the *Service Fees Act* (S.C. 2017, c. 20, s. 451), as amended and in force as of May 1, 2019 (SI/2019-20).

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Low-Materiality Fees Regulations**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish criteria for identifying **"low-materiality fees"** — fees that are deemed to have minimal financial significance to federal government revenue. The purpose is to:
- Improve transparency and accountability in fee structures.
- Reduce administrative burden on federal departments by exempting certain small fees from detailed reporting and oversight requirements.
- Promote cost-effectiveness in fee management while ensuring compliance with fiscal responsibility principles.

The regulations are made under **paragraph 22(2)(a)** of the *Service Fees Act*, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Service Fees Act*.
- **Report**: A formal report submitted under **subsection 20(1)** of the Act, which details annual revenue generated from a particular fee.

> These reports are critical for assessing whether a fee meets the threshold for being classified as low-materiality.

---

### **3. What Constitutes a Low-Materiality Fee?**

A fee is considered a **low-materiality fee** if it meets **any one** of the following conditions:

#### ✅ Condition A: Less than $51
Any fee **under $51** is automatically classified as a low-materiality fee.

#### ✅ Condition B: $51 or more but less than $151 — with specific criteria
A fee between **$51 and $151** qualifies as low-materiality **only if**:
1. The **three most recent reports** (prior to the start of the current fiscal year) show **no more than $500,000 in annual revenue** from that fee.
2. The fee has been **adjusted since the last report**, and the same revenue cap ($500,000) applies.
3. **No three consecutive reports** have shown more than $500,000 in annual revenue.
4. The fee has **never reached $151 or more** since these regulations came into force, nor has it been listed in **Schedule 2**.
5. The fee was previously classified as low-materiality under paragraph (a), (i) to (iii), or (c), and has **not ceased** to be so under section 3.

> This condition is designed to prevent fees from being reclassified as high-materiality due to minor fluctuations or temporary spikes in revenue.

#### ✅ Condition C: Fees Listed in Schedule 1
All fees **explicitly listed in Schedule 1** are automatically considered low-materiality fees — regardless of their amount — **unless otherwise excluded**.

> This list includes numerous operational, administrative, and service-related fees across federal departments and agencies.

---

### **4. Exclusions from Low-Materiality Status**

The following fees are **exempt** from being classified as low-materiality fees:

- **Fees determined by formula** (e.g., based on usage, volume, or performance metrics).
- **Fees listed in Schedule 2** — which includes fees that are considered high-materiality or subject to special scrutiny.

> These exclusions ensure that fees with dynamic or revenue-generating potential (like those tied to usage) are not automatically exempted.

---

### **5. When a Low-Materiality Fee Ceases to Be One**

A fee **ceases to be low-materiality** on any of the following dates:

| Trigger | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fee increased to $151 or more** | The moment the fee reaches or exceeds $151. |
| **Third consecutive report exceeds $500,000** | If the fee is between $51 and $151, and **three consecutive reports** show **more than $500,000** in annual revenue. |
| **Adjustment increases fee to $51–$151**, but revenue exceeds $500,000 | After an adjustment, if the three most recent reports show revenue over $500,000. |
| **Added to Schedule 2** | Once a fee is moved into Schedule 2 (high-materiality list), it loses low-materiality status. |
| **Removed from Schedule 1** | If a fee is removed from Schedule 1 and: <br> - Is $151 or more, OR <br> - Is $51–$151 and three recent reports show >$500,000 in revenue. |

> These triggers ensure that fees that grow in revenue or are reclassified are promptly brought under stricter oversight.

> ⚠️ Note: These rules **do not apply** to fees listed in **Schedule 1** — they remain low-materiality regardless of revenue trends.

### **6. Factors Considered in Amending Schedules**

When the President of the Treasury Board amends **Schedules 1 or 2**, they must take into account:

1. **The amount of the fee** (e.g., whether it is rising or falling).
2. **Context of the fee** — including who pays it and what service it supports (e.g., public access, administrative processing).
3. **Annual revenue from the fee** — based on the **three most recent reports**.
4. **Inaccuracies in fee descriptions** — including outdated or incorrect fee details in the schedules due to prior amendments.

> This ensures that changes to the fee classification are **transparent, evidence-based, and context-sensitive**.

---

### **7. Exception to the $51–$151 Rule (Critical Provision)**

Despite the general rule, **a fee between $51 and $151 is NOT considered low-materiality** if:

- During the **one-year period before the regulations came into force**, a report or public document (e.g., published on a federal website) showed that:
  - The fee generated **more than $500,000 in annual revenue**.

> This is a **critical safeguard** to prevent fees with significant revenue streams from being incorrectly classified as low-materiality.

> Example: If a fee was generating $600,000 in revenue in 2016, it would be excluded from low-materiality status even if it’s below $151, because of the prior revenue spike.

### **8. Schedule 1 – List of Fees Automatically Classified as Low-Materiality**

---

### **9. Repealed Provision**
> The provision in brackets at the end:  
> **[Repealed, SOR/2024-154, s. 8]**  
> Indicates that a specific fee entry (likely related to steamship inspection) has been **officially removed** by a subsequent regulatory amendment.

> This reflects ongoing updates to the fee structure and oversight.

---

### **10. Effective Date and Registration Rules**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day that **section 22 of the Service Fees Act** (as amended by section 451 of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1*) comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered later**, they come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures timely implementation while allowing for administrative processing.
