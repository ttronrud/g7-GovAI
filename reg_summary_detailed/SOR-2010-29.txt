**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010-1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**, as recommended by the **Minister of Industry** and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**. It constitutes a temporary exemption from certain provisions of the Radiocommunication Act, specifically:

- **Subsection 4(1)** – which generally prohibits the installation, operation, or possession of radio apparatus that interferes with or obstructs radiocommunications.
- **Paragraph 9(1)(b)** – which prohibits the intentional interference with or obstruction of radiocommunications.

The exemption is granted for **security, safety, and international relations** purposes, reflecting the need for flexibility in exceptional circumstances where lawful interference with radio communications may be necessary to protect national interests.

---

### **2. Scope and Duration**

- **Effective Period**:  
  The exemption is valid from **February 12, 2010**, to **March 1, 2010** (a period of approximately 19 days).

- **Applicable Jurisdiction**:  
  The exemption applies **only within a specific geographic area in British Columbia**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following coordinates:

  1. 50°09′ N latitude and 123°11′ W longitude  
  2. 50°09′ N latitude and 122°56′ W longitude  
  3. 49°06′ N latitude and 122°38′ W longitude  
  4. 49°06′ N latitude and 123°21′ W longitude  

  This area represents a defined region in central British Columbia, likely encompassing parts of the interior near the Fraser River valley or surrounding areas, and is intended to be limited to prevent unnecessary interference beyond the required operational scope.

---

### **3. Who Is Exempt?**

- The exemption applies to **Her Majesty in Right of Canada**, as represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- The RCMP is authorized to carry out the interference or obstruction of radiocommunications **within the specified geographic boundaries** and time frame.

> Note: The exemption does **not** extend to private individuals, commercial entities, or other government agencies unless they are acting under the direction or authority of the RCMP in this specific context.

---

### **4. Conditions for Exemption**

The exemption is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

#### **A. For Subsection 4(1) of the Act (Interference/Obstruction of Radiocommunication):**
- The radio apparatus must be installed, operated, or possessed **only for the purpose of interfering with or obstructing a radiocommunication** in accordance with **subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The interference must be conducted **for one of the following legitimate purposes**:
  - **Security**
  - **Safety**
  - **International relations**

#### **B. For Paragraph 9(1)(b) of the Act (Interference with Radiocommunication):**
- The interference must be carried out **for the purposes of security, safety, or international relations**.

> These purposes are interpreted broadly but must be directly related to national or public interest, such as protecting critical infrastructure, preventing terrorism, or managing cross-border communication during emergencies.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization**

A key requirement under this Order is the **principle of proportionality and minimization**:

- Every reasonable effort must be made to:
  - **Confine** the interference to the **smallest possible physical area**,
  - Limit the **number of frequencies** affected,
  - Reduce the **duration** of the interference.

This ensures that the measure is targeted, necessary, and avoids unnecessary disruption to civilian or commercial radio services.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The Order is **subject to sections 3 and 4** of the Radiocommunication Act, which typically govern the conditions under which exemptions can be granted and the need for justification or review.
- The **RCMP** is responsible for implementing and enforcing the exemption within the defined time and geographic boundaries.
- Any unauthorized use of the exemption or interference outside the prescribed scope would be a violation of the Act and could lead to legal consequences.

---

### **7. Entry into Force**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette), which typically occurs shortly after it is issued and approved.

---

### **8. Key Objectives and Implications**

- **National Security**: Allows the RCMP to take action in situations where radio interference is required to prevent threats (e.g., jamming signals used in terrorist activities or espionage).
- **Public Safety**: Enables emergency or law enforcement responses where communication interference is needed to protect lives or property (e.g., during natural disasters or active threats).
- **International Relations**: Supports Canada’s ability to manage or respond to foreign communication interference in diplomatic or border-related scenarios.
- **Balanced Approach**: The Order balances the need for operational flexibility with the protection of lawful radio communications by imposing strict limitations on scope, duration, and purpose.

---

### **Conclusion**

This **Exemption Order No. 2010-1** is a **temporary, narrowly scoped authorization** allowing the RCMP to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications in a defined area of British Columbia during a short period (February 12–March 1, 2010), solely for purposes of **security, safety, or international relations**. It reflects a precautionary and lawful approach to national security, ensuring that such actions are:

- **Necessary**
- **Proportional**
- **Targeted**
- **Justified**

It underscores the importance of regulatory oversight and the principle that interference with radio communications—while permitted in exceptional circumstances—is not to be used lightly or broadly.

> **Note**: This Order is **not a permanent or general authorization**. It is a one-time, time-limited exemption and does not establish a precedent for future use without further legislative or regulatory review.
