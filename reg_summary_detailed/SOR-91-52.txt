Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the **Federal Sales Tax Inventory Rebate Regulations**, enacted on December 18, 1990, under the authority of the *Excise Tax Act*.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Federal Sales Tax Inventory Rebate Regulations**

### **1. Legal Authority**
- The regulations are made by the **Minister of Finance** under:
  - **Subsection 59(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act*
  - **Section 120*** of the *Excise Tax Act*  
- These regulations are formally titled:  
  **"Federal Sales Tax Inventory Rebate Regulations"**  
- Citation: **S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12**

> This means the government has the legal power to establish rules for a rebate on inventory taxes for certain businesses, specifically to offset the tax burden on goods held in inventory before they are sold.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, the primary legislation governing excise taxes in Canada. |
| **Computer carrier media** | Physical storage devices (e.g., floppy disks, CDs, USB drives) that store instructions or data. Excludes sound/image recordings, integrated circuits, or semiconductors. |
| **Software products** | Includes computer carrier media *and* the instructions/data stored on them. Excludes physical devices like chips or audio/video recordings. |

> These definitions are critical because they determine which items qualify for the rebate and how their value is calculated.

### **3. Prescribed Tax Factors (for Subsection 120(5) of the Excise Tax Act)**

The "prescribed tax factor" is a percentage used to calculate the rebate amount for different classes of goods. These factors were set as of **December 31, 1990**, and apply to the tax rate that would have been applied to those goods at that time.

| Class of Goods | Prescribed Tax Factor |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Goods in **Schedule IV** of the Act | 5.6% |
| **Unleaded gasoline** | Rate applicable under Part VI of the Act on December 31, 1990 |
| **Diesel fuel** | Rate applicable under Part VI of the Act on December 31, 1990 |
| **Propane** | 1.4% |
| **Mobile homes and modular building units** | 2.8% |
| **Motor vehicles designed for highway use** | 11.1% |
| **Software products** | 8.1% |
| **All other goods** | 8.1% |

> ⚠️ **Note**: For gasoline and diesel fuel, the tax rate is not a fixed percentage—it is based on the actual rate in force on December 31, 1990, as defined in Part VI of the Excise Tax Act. This ensures the rebate reflects the real tax rate in effect at the time of regulation.

### **4. General Formula for Rebate Calculation**

For **each class of goods**, the rebate amount is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{Rebate} = \sum (\text{Tax Factor} \times \text{Value of Inventory in that Class})
$$

#### **Breakdown by Goods Class**:

| Class | Value Basis |
|------|-------------|
| **Gasoline or diesel fuel** | Number of **litres** in inventory × prescribed tax factor |
| **Software products** | **Total value of the carrier media** (excluding value of instructions/data) <br> OR: $5 × number of carrier media (whichever is greater) |
| **All other goods (non-used, non-fuel, non-software)** | Total value of goods in class (excluding used goods) <br> As if it were determined at the beginning of January 1, 1991, for income tax purposes |

> This means that the value of inventory is assessed using the **income tax valuation method**—a standard method used in determining business income under the *Income Tax Act*.

> For software, the value is not the full value of the software (instructions/data), but only the **physical media**. Alternatively, a simplified formula ($5 × number of units) may be used, and the higher of the two values applies.

### **5. Special Provision: Optional Simplified Formula (for Small Inventories)**

A business may **choose to use a simplified rebate formula** **only if**:

✅ The business held **goods included in Part V of Schedule III** (e.g., certain consumer goods) at the beginning of **January 1, 1991**, for taxable supply (i.e., sale to others in the ordinary course of business).

✅ The **aggregate of two values** does **not exceed $70,000**:

1. **Total value of inventory** (excluding gasoline, diesel fuel, and used goods)  
2. **Total value of goods** (excluding gasoline, diesel fuel, and used goods) that would be inventory **if they were tax-paid goods**

> Both values are calculated using the **income tax method** (i.e., how a business would value its inventory for income tax purposes).

#### **Rebate under this simplified formula**:

$$
\text{Rebate} = (\text{Litres of gasoline} \times \text{Gasoline tax factor}) + (\text{Litres of diesel} \times \text{Diesel tax factor}) + (2.5\% \times \text{Aggregate of (1) and (2)})
$$

> This provision is **designed to benefit small businesses** with relatively low inventory values. It reduces administrative complexity and provides a more accessible rebate path.

### **6. Key Objectives & Purpose of the Regulations**

1. **Tax Relief for Businesses**  
   - Provides a rebate to businesses that hold inventory subject to excise tax, reducing the effective tax burden.

2. **Encourages Business Activity**  
   - By reducing the cost of holding inventory, the government aims to encourage investment and sales, especially in high-tax goods like gasoline, software, and vehicles.

3. **Fairness in Tax Treatment**  
   - Recognizes that businesses holding goods in inventory are not directly selling them—so they should not bear the full excise tax burden.

4. **Simplified Valuation for Small Businesses**  
   - The optional formula reduces compliance burden for small businesses with low-value inventories.

5. **Alignment with Income Tax Rules**  
   - The valuation method used for most goods aligns with how businesses compute taxable income under the *Income Tax Act*, ensuring consistency and fairness.

---

### **7. Important Notes & Limitations**

- **Used goods are excluded** from the calculation in all cases.
- The **tax factor for software is 8.1%**, same as other goods, which reflects its status as a digital product with a unique storage form.
- The **simplified formula applies only to specific goods** (Part V of Schedule III) and only when the aggregate inventory value is ≤ $70,000.
- The **gasoline and diesel tax factors are dynamic**—they are based on the rates in effect on December 31, 1990, not current rates.
- The **rebate is not a refund of tax already paid**—it is a credit against future tax liability or a direct rebate based on inventory value.

### **8. Practical Implications for Businesses**

| Business Type | Relevance |
|-------------|----------|
| **Gasoline retailers** | Can claim a rebate based on volume of gasoline in inventory. |
| **Software distributors** | Can claim a rebate based on number of physical media units (or value of media). |
| **Auto dealers** | May qualify for a rebate on motor vehicles (11.1% tax factor). |
| **Mobile home builders** | Eligible for 2.8% rebate on inventory. |
| **Small retailers** | May use the simplified formula if inventory value is under $70,000. |

> Businesses must:
- Determine the **value of inventory** at the beginning of January 1, 1991.
- Classify goods correctly under the applicable schedule.
- Apply the correct tax factor.
- Decide whether to use the standard or simplified formula.

### **9. Historical Context (1990)**

These regulations were introduced during a period of reform in Canada’s excise tax system. The goal was to:
- Improve fairness in how excise taxes are applied to businesses.
- Reduce the financial burden on businesses that hold inventory.
- Promote economic activity by making inventory more affordable.

> Note: These regulations were specific to **1990** and are **no longer in force** in their original form. Canada has since modernized its excise tax regime, and the **Federal Sales Tax Inventory Rebate** is no longer administered under this framework. However, the principles of inventory tax relief remain relevant in modern tax policy.

## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

The *Federal Sales Tax Inventory Rebate Regulations* (1990) allow eligible businesses to claim a rebate on the excise tax applied to goods held in inventory, based on a prescribed tax factor per product class. For gasoline and diesel, the rebate is based on volume; for software, on the value of physical media; for other goods, on market value as used in income tax calculations. A simplified formula allows small businesses with low-value inventory (under $70,000) to claim
