## 2. 💰 **Definition of Insurable Earnings**

### ✅ What is included in insurable earnings?
The total insurable earnings of an insured person from insurable employment consist of:
- All amounts (wholly or partly pecuniary) received or enjoyed by the employee from their employer for services rendered, **including**:
  - Base wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions
  - Any **gratuities** required to be declared under provincial income tax laws

### ⚠️ Exclusions from insurable earnings:
The following are **not** included in insurable earnings and therefore do not trigger EI premiums:
1. **Non-cash benefits** (e.g., meals, transportation), **except**:
   - The value of **board or lodging** provided during a pay period **if** cash remuneration is also paid.
2. **Income excluded under Income Tax Act**:
   - Paragraphs 6(1)(a) or (b) or subsections 6(6) or (16) of the *Income Tax Act*
3. **Retiring allowances**
4. **Supplements to worker’s compensation** paid by the employer to increase compensation from a provincial authority
5. **Supplements to wage loss indemnities** paid under a plan by a party other than the employer
6. **Supplemental unemployment benefits** under a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (as defined in section 37(2) of the EI Regulations)
7. **Payments to cover waiting periods** under section 13 of the Act — **only if** they meet criteria in section 38 of the EI Regulations
8. **Payments to increase provincial benefits** — **only if**:
   - The total (payment + provincial benefit) does **not exceed** the employee’s normal weekly earnings from that employer
   - And **does not reduce** accumulated leave credits (sick, vacation), severance pay, or other accrued benefits

> 🚫 **No employee premium is payable** on earnings from excluded employment.

## 3. 💳 **Premium Calculation and Deduction**

### ✅ Formula for employee premium:
The employee’s premium to be deducted from insurable earnings is the **greater of**:
- **$0.01** (minimum)
- The product of **insurable earnings × premium rate for the year**

> Example: If an employee earns $1,000/month and the premium rate is 1.5%, the premium = $1,000 × 0.015 = $15.00 → rounded to the nearest cent.

### 🔁 Rounding Rule:
- If the product results in a **fraction of a cent**, it is rounded to the **nearest whole cent**.
- If equidistant between two cents, **round up** (to the higher cent).

### ⚠️ Cap on employee premium:
- An employee’s premium **shall not exceed** the premium that would apply to **maximum insurable earnings**.

> This prevents overpayment and ensures fairness, especially for high-income earners.

## 4. 📅 **Premium Remittance Deadlines**

Employers must remit both **employee and employer premiums** to the **Receiver General** by specific deadlines based on their size and historical payment patterns.
