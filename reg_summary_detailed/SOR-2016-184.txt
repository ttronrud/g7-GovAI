**Detailed Summary of the Pacifiers Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Pacifiers Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish specific safety requirements for pacifiers in Canada. These regulations were introduced to protect infants and young children from foreseeable hazards associated with pacifier use, including choking, ingestion, strangulation, and exposure to toxic substances.

The regulations came into force on the day of registration and are administered by the **Minister of Health**, acting on the recommendation of the Governor in Council.

---

### **Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Pacifier"** is defined as:
  - A device with a **nipple** intended for use in a baby’s mouth.
  - Includes **similar products** that are designed for oral use by infants.

This broad definition ensures that all devices functionally equivalent to traditional pacifiers are covered under the regulation.

---

### **Toxic Substances and Chemical Safety**

- Any pacifier containing a **toxic substance** must comply with **section 25 of the Toys Regulations**, which sets limits on hazardous chemicals (e.g., lead, phthalates, flame retardants).
- **Specific chemical limit**:  
  - The pacifier must contain **no more than 10 µg/kg of total volatile N-nitrosamines**.  
  - This level is determined through **dichloromethane extraction**, a standardized laboratory method to detect and quantify these carcinogenic compounds.

> *Rationale*: N-nitrosamines are known carcinogens; limiting their presence reduces long-term health risks to infants who may ingest or inhale them.

### **Physical Safety Requirements**

To prevent injury due to foreseeable use, pacifiers must be free from components that could cause:

1. **Obstruction of the pharyngeal orifice** (blockage of the back of the throat)  
2. **Strangulation**  
3. **Ingestion or aspiration** (choking or breathing in) of the pacifier or any part  
4. **Wounding** (cuts or injuries)

These hazards are evaluated based on realistic, everyday conditions of use.

---

### **Structural Integrity and Design Requirements**

#### 1. **Nipple Attachment to Guard**
- The **nipple must be securely attached** to the guard.
- The attachment must be such that when:
  - The nipple is **centered over the opening** in the template shown in **Schedule 1**, and
  - A force of **9.8 N (newtons)** is applied **axially** (along the axis of the nipple),
- The **guard must not pass through** the opening in the template.

> *Purpose*: Prevents the nipple from detaching and becoming a choking hazard.

#### 2. **Nipple Retention During Testing (Schedule 2)**
- When tested according to **Schedule 2**, the **nipple must remain attached** to the guard under stress.
- Any part that separates from the pacifier must:
  - **Not fit entirely** into the **small parts cylinder** (as defined in Schedule 3) in its **non-compressed state**.

> *Purpose*: Prevents small, detachable parts from becoming choking hazards for infants.

#### 3. **Cord or Loop Restrictions**
- Any **loop of cord or material** attached to the pacifier must have a **circumference of no more than 356 mm**.
- This prevents the loop from becoming a strangulation risk if the infant grasps it.

> *Note*: This applies to any flexible or looped element (e.g., a cord or string used for hanging or attaching to a caregiver’s clothing).

#### 4. **Ring or Handle Design**
- Any **ring or handle** must be:
  - **Hinged**, **collapsible**, or **flexible**.
- This prevents rigid parts from becoming a choking or entanglement hazard.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that if a ring or handle breaks or is pulled, it does not become a sharp or rigid object that could injure a child.

### **Prohibited Marketing and Labeling**

- **No direct or indirect references** to:
  - The **Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, or
  - These **Pacifiers Regulations**
  may appear:
  - On the pacifier itself,
  - In accompanying packaging, or
  - In advertisements.

> *Rationale*: Prevents misleading or confusing claims that could lead consumers to believe a product is compliant with safety standards when it may not be.

- **No representations** in advertising or labeling about:
  - The **use** of the pacifier, or
  - **Modifications** (e.g., altering the nipple or guard) that would result in the pacifier **failing to meet any requirement** of these regulations.

> *Purpose*: Prevents false claims that could encourage unsafe modifications or usage.

---

### **Testing Methodology for Structural Integrity**

A rigorous, repeatable testing protocol is required to verify compliance. The procedure includes the following steps:

1. **Force Application to Ring or Handle**  
   - **Step (a)**: Hold the nipple fixed and apply **44.5 ± 1.0 N** force in the **plane of the nipple axis** at a rate of **4.5 ± 1.0 N/s**, then maintain it for **10 ± 0.5 seconds**.  
   - **Step (b)**: Hold the guard fixed and apply **44.5 ± 1.0 N** force **perpendicular** to the nipple axis at the same rate and duration.  
   - **Step (c)**: Repeat step (b) with force applied to the nipple.

2. **Boiling Water Test**  
   - Immerse the pacifier in **boiling water (100°C)** for **10 ± 0.5 minutes**.  
   - Remove and allow to cool in air at **21 ± 5°C** for **15 ± 0.5 minutes**.

3. **Repeat Testing**  
   - Repeat steps (a) to (c) **once more** after the boiling water exposure.  
   - Repeat steps (d) and (e) (i.e., boiling and cooling) **nine times total**.

> *Purpose*:  
> - Tests durability under repeated stress and exposure to heat.  
> - Ensures that the pacifier maintains structural integrity over time and under conditions that simulate real-world use (e.g., washing, handling, or exposure to high temperatures).  
> - Prevents degradation that could lead to detachment or failure during use.

### **Repeal Clause**

- The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that these rules are **not intended to replace or supersede** other existing legislation, but rather to **specifically regulate pacifiers** under the CCPSA framework.

---

### **Key Objectives and Public Health Impact**

The Pacifiers Regulations aim to:

- **Reduce infant injury and mortality** from choking, strangulation, and ingestion.
- **Minimize exposure** to harmful chemicals, particularly carcinogenic N-nitrosamines.
- Ensure **product durability and safe design** through standardized testing.
- Prevent **misleading marketing** that could compromise consumer safety.

These measures align with global best practices in child product safety and reflect Canada’s commitment to protecting vulnerable populations—particularly infants and young children.

### **Conclusion**

The *Pacifiers Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)* provide a comprehensive, science-based framework for the safety of pacifiers in Canada. By setting strict limits on toxic substances, mandating robust structural design, and establishing rigorous testing protocols, the regulations ensure that pacifiers are safe for infants to use. The restrictions on labeling and marketing further protect consumers from misinformation and unsafe practices.

These regulations remain a key component of Canada’s consumer product safety system and are regularly reviewed in light of new scientific evidence and technological developments.
