### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a clear and enforceable time limit for determining whether goods exported to Canada from one country are considered to have been shipped directly or are instead deemed to have been transshipped through an intermediate country. This rule is critical for customs classification, tariff application, and compliance with trade regulations.

Specifically, the regulation addresses a key issue in international trade: when goods are exported from a country (e.g., the United States) and transhipped (i.e., transferred) in an intermediate country (e.g., the United Kingdom or Germany), how long can they remain in that intermediate country before they are no longer considered to have been shipped directly to Canada?

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Definition of "Temporary Storage"**
The regulation defines the concept of "temporary storage" as the period during which goods are held in an intermediate country after being exported from a country other than Canada. This storage is intended to allow for logistical, commercial, or operational reasons (such as customs clearance, repair, or reassembly), but it must be temporary and not constitute a permanent or extended stay.

#### 2. **Six-Month Threshold**
Under paragraph 18(1)(d) of the Customs Tariff, goods are deemed **not to have been shipped directly** to Canada from their country of origin if they remain in temporary storage in an intermediate country for **more than six months**.

- If the goods are stored in the intermediate country for **six months or less**, they are still considered to have been shipped directly to Canada from the original exporting country.
- If the storage period **exceeds six months**, the goods are **deemed not to have been shipped directly** to Canada. This has significant implications for customs valuation, tariff classification, and duty obligations.

#### 3. **Application to Transshipment**
The rule applies specifically to goods that:
- Are **exported to Canada** from a country other than Canada (e.g., from the United States to Canada),
- Are **transhipped** (transferred or rerouted) in an intermediate country (e.g., the goods are sent from the U.S. to a warehouse in the UK, then onward to Canada),
- Remain in the intermediate country for longer than six months.

This means that if a shipment is held in an intermediate country for over six months, it is treated as having been shipped from that intermediate country rather than from the original exporting country — even if the original destination was Canada.

### **Legal and Regulatory Context**

- The regulation is grounded in **section 18(2)** of the *Customs Tariff*, which grants the Minister of National Revenue the authority to prescribe rules related to the shipment of goods.
- It implements a rule set in the broader framework of **customs valuation and origin determination**. Determining whether goods are shipped directly or transshipped is essential for:
  - Applying the correct tariff rates,
  - Avoiding duties on goods that should be considered as originating from a different country,
  - Ensuring compliance with international trade agreements and rules of origin.

### **Practical Implications**

1. **For Importers and Traders:**
   - Importers must carefully monitor the duration of goods' stay in intermediate countries.
   - If goods remain in storage beyond six months, they may be subject to different customs treatment — potentially being classified as imported from the intermediate country, which could result in higher duties or different tariff classifications.

2. **For Customs Authorities:**
   - The regulation provides a clear, objective benchmark (six months) for determining whether a shipment qualifies as a direct shipment or a transshipment.
   - It helps prevent abuse of the direct shipment rule by allowing for a reasonable time frame to ensure goods are not being held in an intermediate country indefinitely.

3. **For International Trade:**
   - The rule supports the integrity of Canada’s trade policy by ensuring that goods are not being artificially reclassified to avoid tariffs or duties.
   - It also promotes transparency and consistency in customs procedures across international trade flows.

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- The regulation does **not** apply to goods that are shipped directly to Canada without any intermediate stop.
- It does **not** cover goods that are re-exported or moved to a different destination.
- There is **no explicit exception** for goods held for humanitarian, emergency, or logistical reasons — such as during natural disasters or supply chain disruptions — unless such exceptions are later introduced by amendment.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Temporary Storage Period Regulations* establish a clear six-month cutoff for determining whether goods are considered to have been shipped directly to Canada from a foreign country. Once goods remain in temporary storage in an intermediate country for more than six months, they are deemed not to have been shipped directly — effectively shifting their origin to the intermediate country. This rule strengthens customs control, ensures fair application of tariffs, and provides clarity for businesses engaged in international trade.

These regulations, effective January 1, 1988, remain a foundational tool in Canada’s customs policy for managing transshipment and origin determination.
