**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Pest Control Products Act and the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the federal government to reassign certain powers, duties, and functions between federal departments and ministers, typically to improve administrative efficiency, align responsibilities with policy priorities, or reflect changes in government structure.

**Key Provision:**  
On **April 1, 1995**, the powers, duties, and functions previously held by the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** under two specific Acts are formally transferred to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare**.

**Acts Involved:**  
1. **Pest Control Products Act** – This legislation governs the regulation of pest control products (such as pesticides) in Canada. It establishes the framework for the approval, licensing, registration, and monitoring of pest control products to ensure they are safe and effective for use in agriculture, public health, and environmental protection. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food had previously been responsible for overseeing compliance, enforcement, and regulatory oversight under this Act.

2. **Pesticide Residue Compensation Act** – This Act provides a legal framework for compensating individuals or entities who suffer economic or health-related losses due to pesticide residues in food or feed. It outlines the procedures for claims, compensation, and the responsibilities of the regulatory authority in managing such claims.

**Nature of the Transfer:**  
The transfer is not a change in policy or scope of activity, but a **reassignment of administrative responsibility**. The Minister of National Health and Welfare will now assume full responsibility for:

- The regulatory oversight of pest control products (including registration, review, and enforcement) under the Pest Control Products Act.
- The administration and management of claims and compensation processes under the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act.

**Rationale (Implied):**  
The transfer reflects a broader government strategy to consolidate responsibilities related to food safety, public health, and environmental protection under the jurisdiction of the Minister of National Health and Welfare. This realignment likely aimed to:

- Strengthen coordination between health, safety, and environmental protection measures.
- Improve the consistency and effectiveness of pesticide regulation in light of public health concerns.
- Align regulatory functions with the growing emphasis on food safety and consumer protection.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 1995**.

**Significance:**  
This regulation marks a significant shift in federal ministerial responsibilities. It demonstrates how the Canadian government reorganizes its public service to better respond to evolving policy needs—particularly in areas where public health and environmental safety intersect. It also reflects the increasing integration of health and environmental regulation in the 1990s.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally transfers regulatory authority over pest control products and pesticide residue compensation from the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to the Minister of National Health and Welfare, effective April 1, 1995. The move enhances the health and safety focus of pesticide regulation and ensures that compensation processes are managed within a broader public health framework. The transfer is legally sound and grounded in the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, underscoring the flexibility and adaptability of Canada’s federal administrative structure.
