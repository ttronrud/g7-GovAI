**Detailed Summary of the *Electronic Documents (Insurance and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were made under the authority of the **Insurance Companies Act (Act)**, specifically:

- **Section 1021(1)a**: Enables the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to issue regulations concerning electronic documents.
- **Sections 1035b, 1037b, 1038b, 1040b, 1044b, and 1045b** of the Act: Provide the legal framework for the use, transmission, and receipt of electronic documents by insurance companies and insurance holding companies.

The regulations were originally introduced in **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 364 and s. 367**, and are further referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 47** (the original Insurance Companies Act).

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to **modernize and standardize the use of electronic documents** in the insurance sector. It allows for the **electronic transmission of notices, documents, and other required information** to policyholders, regulators, and other stakeholders, while ensuring **clarity, transparency, and compliance** with legal requirements.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

#### **1. Definition of "Prescribed Notices, Documents, or Information"**
- Under **section 1035 of the Act**, the term refers to the notices, documents, or information specified in **sections 86 to 139 of the Insurance Companies Act**.
- These include, but are not limited to, policy documents, notices of changes, claims forms, and regulatory communications.

#### **2. Clarity and Simplicity in Electronic Communication**
- Any electronic document or information provided by the **originator** (e.g., an insurance company) or their representative must be:
  - **Clear**
  - **Simple**
  - **Not misleading**
- This ensures that recipients, especially those who may not be tech-savvy, can understand the content without confusion.

#### **3. Electronic Document Availability via Public Websites (Exemption from Direct Delivery)**
- **Paragraph 1037(1)(b)** of the Act allows an electronic document to **not be sent directly** to a designated information system if:
  1. It is **posted on or made available through a generally accessible electronic source** (e.g., a publicly accessible website), and  
  2. The **addressee is given written notice** (in paper or electronic form) of the document’s availability and its location.
- This provision promotes accessibility and reduces administrative burden when information is widely available.

> **Note**: This exemption does **not apply** to notices, documents, or information referred to in **section 8** of the Act (which may involve urgent or sensitive matters requiring direct delivery).

#### **4. Consent to Receive Electronic Documents**
- Addressees (e.g., policyholders or regulators) may **consent** to receive electronic documents in one of three ways:
  - **In writing** (paper or electronic)
  - **Orally**
- However, **before giving written consent**, the originator must provide the addressee with the following **mandatory disclosures**:
  - The addressee may **revoke consent at any time**.
  - The addressee is **responsible for informing the originator** of any changes to the designated information system or contact details.
  - The originator will **retain the electronic document** for the period specified in the notice, and the addressee is responsible for **retaining a copy** of the document.
  - The **effective date** of consent must be clearly stated.

> **Note**: This requirement was **repealed by SOR/2020-47, s. 34**, meaning it no longer applies as of the date of repeal.

#### **5. Requirements for Written Consent**
- If consent is given **in writing**, it must include:
  - The **name of the information system** designated by the addressee for receiving documents.
  - A **list** (in paper or electronic form) of the specific notices, documents, or information covered by the consent.

#### **6. Oral Consent and Follow-Up**
- If consent is given **orally**, the originator must:
  - Provide the addressee with a **written confirmation** of the disclosures outlined in subsection (2) (above).
  - Confirm the information related to the designated system and consent terms.
- **Exception**: If consent is given for a **one-time basis**, the mandatory disclosures in subsection (2) **do not apply**.

#### **7. Revocation of Consent**
- Addressees may revoke their consent **in writing, electronically, or orally**.
- Upon revocation, the originator must provide the addressee with a **written confirmation** specifying:
  - The date when the revocation takes effect.

> **Note**: This revocation process was also **repealed by SOR/2020-47, s. 35**, so it no longer applies as of the repeal date.

#### **8. Concurrent Delivery to Multiple Addressees**
- Under **paragraphs 1038(b) and 1040(b)** of the Act, when a notice or document must be sent to **several addressees**, it must be delivered **concurrently** (i.e., at the same time to all), not individually or sequentially.

#### **9. Designated Information Systems**
- If a notice or document is required to be sent to a **specific physical location**, it may instead be sent electronically to an **information system designated by the addressee**.
- This allows flexibility in how recipients receive information, as long as the designated system is clearly identified and accessible.

#### **10. When an Electronic Document is Considered "Provided"**
An electronic document is deemed to have been **provided** to an addressee when:
- It **leaves the information system** under the control of the originator or their representative, **or**
- It is **posted on or made available through the secure website** of the originator.

> This establishes a clear legal benchmark for when transmission is complete, ensuring regulatory compliance.

#### **11. Requirement to Mail a Paper Copy (Section 9)**
- For documents required under **section 9** of the Act (e.g., certain policy or notice communications), the originator must **mail a paper copy** to the addressee’s recorded address **if there is reason to believe** the addressee may not have received the electronic version.
- This ensures that individuals who may lack access to digital tools or who are at risk of missing electronic communications are not left out.

> **Important**: This provision **does not affect** the timing of when the electronic document is considered provided under section 9.

#### **12. When an Electronic Document is Considered "Received"**
An electronic document is considered **received** when:
- It **enters the designated information system** of the addressee,  
- It is **posted on or made available through the secure website** of the originator, or  
- The **notice in paragraph 4(1)(b)** (the notice of availability) is received by the addressee.

> This defines the point at which the recipient is legally deemed to have received the information.

#### **13. Electronic Signatures**
- A **signature under section 1044 of the Act** may be an **electronic signature**.
- It must consist of **one or more letters, characters, numbers, or other symbols in digital form** that are:
  - Incorporated in, attached to, or associated with the electronic document.

> This recognizes digital signatures as legally valid for compliance and authentication purposes.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations came into force on **June 1, 2011**.

---

### **Important Repeal Notes**

- The provisions regarding **consent disclosure** (subsection 2) and **revocation of consent** (subsection 4) were **repealed by SOR/2020-47, sections 34 and 35**.
- As of the repeal date, those specific requirements are **no longer in effect**.
- This means that:
  - There is **no longer a mandatory requirement** to inform addressees about revocability or their responsibility to notify changes to contact details.
  - The requirement to provide written confirmation of consent or revocation has been removed.

> **Implication**: The regulations now operate under a more streamlined, less prescriptive model for consent, potentially reducing administrative burden on insurers.
