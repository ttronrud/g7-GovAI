The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-96, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Notice**: It was repealed under **Statutory Instrument 2016-96, section 1**.
- **SOR/2016-96**: This refers to the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* for the year 2016, specifically the 96th regulation issued that year. Such instruments are used in Ontario to amend or repeal existing laws or regulations.
- **Section 1 of SOR/2016-96** is the legal provision that formally removes the referenced regulation from force.
- **Number of Repeats**: The entry is listed 13 times, which appears to be a formatting or data input error—repetition does not indicate multiple regulations or provisions but rather emphasizes the repealing action.

### Implication:
- The regulation previously in effect is **no longer valid or enforceable**.
- Any legal or administrative reference to this regulation must now be updated or replaced with a current, active provision.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative or regulatory modernization effort, such as streamlining rules, eliminating outdated provisions, or consolidating regulatory frameworks.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** to summarize, as the entire entry indicates that the regulation has been **fully repealed** by SOR/2016-96, s. 1. Therefore, the summary is that **the regulation no longer exists** and should not be referenced in current legal or operational contexts.

> ✅ Final Note: This is a common occurrence in regulatory updates—older rules are removed to ensure clarity, efficiency, and compliance with current law. Always verify current regulations through official sources such as the Ontario Government’s legislation website or the Statutes of Ontario.
