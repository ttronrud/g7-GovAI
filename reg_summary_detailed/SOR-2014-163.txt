### **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Implementing United Nations Resolutions on the Central African Republic**  
*(R.S., c. U-2 – "Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolutions on the Central African Republic")*

#### **Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations are a direct implementation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions adopted in 2013–2014 in response to the deteriorating security situation in the **Central African Republic (CAR)**. The key resolutions referenced are:

- **UNSCR 2127 (2013)** – December 5, 2013  
- **UNSCR 2134 (2014)** – January 28, 2014  
- **UNSCR 2149 (2014)** – April 10, 2014  

These resolutions established measures to:
- Prevent the flow of weapons and mercenaries into the CAR;
- Prohibit support for armed groups and military activities;
- Strengthen international efforts to stabilize the CAR through humanitarian and security mechanisms.

Under **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**, the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government of Canada) has the authority to adopt regulations to implement these UNSC measures. This legislation was enacted on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, and it forms part of Canada’s international obligations under the UN Charter.
