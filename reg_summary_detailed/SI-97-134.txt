---

## 4. Reciprocal Rights and Obligations (Article IV)

### 🔁 Reciprocal Eligibility:
Any person who is or has been subject to the legislation of either country is **eligible for benefits from the other country under the same conditions as a citizen of that country**.

> 🚫 **No reduction or cancellation** of benefits simply because the person resides in the other country.

### 🏠 Where Benefits Are Paid:
- If a person is subject to both Canadian and Greek legislation, benefits are paid in a **third country** (e.g., where the person is residing).
- **Exception**: If the person is working in one country, they are subject only to the legislation of that country.

### 📌 Work-Based Rules:

## 5. Creditable Periods and Totalizing Rules (Article IX)

This section is central to the agreement — it allows for **accumulation of periods** from both countries to meet eligibility requirements.

### 📝 Totalizing Principles:

| Benefit | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Old Age Security (OAS)** | A period of residence in Greece **after the age of eligibility** is counted as a period of residence in Canada — **for the person and their spouse/dependants** (if not employed in Greece). |
| **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** | A calendar year with **at least 75 days** of creditable periods in Greece counts as a full creditable year. |
| **Greek Legislation** | A calendar year of CPP contributions = **300 days** of creditable periods in Greece. A CPP month (not part of a CPP year) = **25 days** of creditable periods in Greece. |

> 💡 These rules allow individuals to build creditable periods across borders, especially useful for those who have lived or worked in both countries.

### ⚖️ If Not Entitled Due to Inadequate Periods:
- Totalize all creditable periods from both countries (non-overlapping).
- If still insufficient, consider periods from a **third country** with which both nations have reciprocal social security agreements.

> ❌ **Exception**: If total creditable periods are **less than one year**, and no right to a benefit exists under either country’s law, the country **does not have to pay** under this agreement.

## 6. Benefit Calculations (Article X)

### A. OAS Pension (Paid Outside Canada)
- Must have **totalized residence periods equal to or exceeding** the minimum required by Canadian OAS law.
- **Spouse’s allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)** are paid **only to the extent permitted** by OAS law.

### B. CPP Pension (Paid Outside Canada)
- **Earnings-related portion**: Based **only** on pensionable earnings under CPP.
- **Flat-rate portion**: Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Flat-rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Contributions made under CPP}}{\text{Minimum qualifying period}}\right)
  $$
  - Maximum ratio = **1 (100%)**

> ✅ This ensures fairness and prevents overpayment.

### C. Greek Benefits (For Canadians)
- The Greek institution calculates a **theoretical benefit** as if the person had completed their Canadian creditable periods under Greek law.
- If the theoretical amount is **less than the minimum Greek benefit**, the **minimum benefit** is applied.
- If the benefit is **not dependent on length**, the theoretical amount is used.
- The **partial benefit** is then calculated based on:
  $$
  \text{Partial Benefit} = \left(\frac{\text{Greek creditable periods}}{\text{Total creditable periods (including Canadian)}}\right) \times \text{Theoretical amount}
  $$
- **Profession-specific benefits**:
  - Creditable periods under CPP in the same profession/employment are counted.
  - If not sufficient, fall back to general system.

> 📌 This ensures Canadians can access Greek pensions even if they don’t meet full Greek requirements.

## 7. Administrative and Information Cooperation (Article XV)

### ✅ Obligations:
- Competent authorities must:
  - **Share necessary information** for benefit determination or payment.
  - **Lend good offices** and assist each other in assessing entitlements (as if it were their own legislation).
  - **Notify each
