The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-51, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2015-51**, specifically **Section 1** of that instrument.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: While the exact date is not explicitly stated in the provided text, Statutory Instrument (SOR) 2015-51 was published in 2015 and generally came into force on or shortly after publication. The repeal would have taken effect on the date specified in the instrument, which is typically included in the official notice.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation (which is no longer in force) was likely a rule or provision under a broader statute, possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—though the specific subject matter is not provided in the text.
- **Reason for Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred due to:
  - The regulation being outdated or obsolete.
  - Being superseded by a newer, more comprehensive or relevant regulation.
  - Legislative review or modernization efforts.
  - A decision by the government to streamline or simplify regulatory frameworks.

### Key Implications:

- **No Current Legal Effect**: As of the date of repeal, the regulation no longer has any legal force or applicability.
- **No Further Enforcement**: Any actions or obligations previously derived from the regulation are no longer enforceable.
- **Legal Research Note**: When researching or applying Canadian law, this repeal must be acknowledged to avoid citing a no-longer-valid provision.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does not contain the original regulation’s content, only its status. Therefore, the **summary is limited to the fact that the regulation was formally repealed by SOR/2015-51, s. 1**. Without access to the original regulation or its context (e.g., the parent statute or subject area), a detailed description of its provisions or purpose cannot be provided.

👉 **Recommendation**: To understand the original scope and intent of the repealed regulation, one should consult the full text of SOR/2015-51, particularly Section 1, or the parent statute under which it was issued (e.g., the *Fisheries Act*, *Health of Animals Act*, or another relevant legislation).

In short:  
**This is a notice of repeal — the regulation has been officially canceled and is no longer in effect.**
