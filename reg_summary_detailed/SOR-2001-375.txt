**Detailed Summary of the Complaint Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Complaint Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were made under the authority of **Section 531a of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**, as recommended by the **Minister of Finance** and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**.

These regulations are part of a broader regulatory framework designed to ensure transparency, consumer protection, and accountability in the operations of trust and loan companies in Canada. Specifically, they establish the **prescribed procedures and mechanisms** through which consumers can access and submit complaints related to financial arrangements involving trust and loan companies.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Define the prescribed information** that must be made available to consumers regarding how they can file a complaint.
2. **Specify the designated contact points** (both physical and digital) through which consumers may reach the regulatory agency.
3. **Outline the acceptable formats** in which complaint-related information must be provided to consumers — ensuring clarity, accessibility, and compliance with consumer protection obligations.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Prescribed Information for Complaints (Under Subsections 441(4) and 442(1) of the TLC Act)**

The regulations specify that, for the purposes of **subsection 441(4)** and **subsection 442(1)** of the Trust and Loan Companies Act, the **prescribed information** includes:

> Consumers must be informed that they may contact the **Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)** — the regulatory body overseeing trust and loan companies — in one of the following two ways:

- **In person or by mail** at the FCAC office:  
  **427 Laurier Avenue West, 6th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1R 1B9**

- **Online** via the FCAC’s official website:  
  **www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca**

This ensures that consumers have **multiple, accessible, and reliable channels** to report concerns or file complaints about financial products or services offered by trust and loan companies.

#### **2. Prescribed Manner of Providing Complaint-Related Information (Under Subsection 442(1))**

The regulations further clarify that the information required under the Act — specifically, information about how to file a complaint — must be provided in one of the following formats:

- **In a brochure**, **statement of account**, or **written statement** that includes:
  - Other required disclosures under the TLC Act, particularly those related to:
    - An **arrangement** referred to in **subsection 438(3)** of the Act (e.g., credit or loan agreements)
    - A **payment, credit, or charge card**
    - The **cost of borrowing**
    - Any **other obligation** of the company under a **consumer provision** of the Act

> These disclosures must be clearly presented and accessible to the consumer to ensure informed decision-making and transparency.

- **Or, in a separate document** (e.g., a standalone complaint guide or policy notice)

This provision ensures that **complaint procedures are not hidden or buried** in complex financial documents but are clearly visible and accessible to consumers at the point of engagement.

### **Regulatory Context and Repeal Note**

- The regulation was originally enacted under **S.C. 1991, c. 45** and later referenced in **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 569**.
- A key note in the text states: **[Repealed, SOR/2009-58, s. 1]**  
  This indicates that the regulation was **repealed or replaced** by **SOR/2009-58, section 1**, which came into force in 2009.

> **Important Implication**:  
> The current version of the *Complaint Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* as presented is **no longer in force**. The repeal means that the specific provisions outlined above — particularly those related to the format and delivery of complaint information — have been **superseded by updated regulations**.

This reflects a broader trend in Canadian financial regulation to modernize and streamline consumer protection mechanisms, especially with the digital transformation of financial services.
