**Detailed Summary of the Cinematographic Works (Right to Remuneration) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Cinematographic Works (Right to Remuneration) Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under specific provisions of the *Copyright Act*:

- **Subsection 17(3)a** of the Copyright Act: Grants the Minister of Industry the authority to establish regulations concerning the rights of performers in cinematographic works.
- **Subsection 62(1)b** of the Copyright Act: Provides for the establishment of rules to ensure performers receive remuneration for their performances in certain types of cinematographic works.

These regulations were enacted to implement the rights of performers in Canadian film and video productions, particularly in relation to the **right to remuneration** when their performances are used in broadcasting or other public dissemination contexts.

### **Regulatory Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Define which **cinematographic works** qualify for the **right to remuneration** under Section 17 of the *Copyright Act*.
- Ensure that performers are fairly compensated when their performances are used in **Canadian television or radio programming**, especially in cases where the production of the work is supported by Canadian government funding or recognized as a Canadian program.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

1. **Canadian government film agency**  
   - Refers to any **federal or provincial agency** that is actively involved in the **development and production** of cinematographic works (e.g., Telefilm Canada, the Canadian Film or Video Production Fund, or provincial film boards).  
   - These agencies are key stakeholders in the Canadian film ecosystem and are recognized as official supports for Canadian content.

2. **Canadian program**  
   - Defined in several related regulatory frameworks:
     - *Pay Television Regulations, 1990* (subsection 2(1))
     - *Specialty Services Regulations, 1990* (section 2)
     - *Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987* (section 2)  
   - A "Canadian program" is a program produced in Canada, with substantial Canadian content, and typically meets criteria such as:
     - Being produced by Canadian entities
     - Featuring Canadian talent and language
     - Being broadcast on Canadian television platforms (e.g., CBC, CTV, or specialty channels)
   - This definition ensures that only content meeting national standards qualifies for remuneration protections.

### **Prescribed Cinematographic Works**

The regulations specify which cinematographic works are **prescribed** for the purposes of **Section 17 of the Copyright Act**, which grants performers the right to receive remuneration when their performances are used in broadcasting or other public distribution.

A cinematographic work qualifies if **any one** of the following three conditions is met:

1. **Issuance of a Canadian Film or Video Production Certificate**  
   - The work must have been approved by the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** under the *Income Tax Act*.  
   - This certificate confirms that the production qualifies as a Canadian film or video under tax incentive programs and is a formal recognition of its Canadian origin and eligibility for public funding.

2. **Recognition as a Canadian Program**  
   - The work must be officially recognized as a **Canadian program** by the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)**.  
   - This recognition is a key regulatory benchmark, ensuring that only content meeting Canadian content standards is eligible for performer remuneration.

3. **Funding from a Canadian Government Film Agency**  
   - The work must have received **production funding** from:
     - **Telefilm Canada** (the primary federal agency)
     - Or **any other Canadian government film agency** (e.g., provincial film development bodies such as Ontario Film Development Corporation or Quebec’s Office du cinéma)  
   - This criterion ensures that productions supported by public funds are protected under performer rights.

### **Effective Date**

This date aligns with the implementation of a new legal regime designed to modernize and strengthen the rights of performers in Canadian film and television.

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Legal Protection for Performers**: These regulations ensure that performers (actors, dancers, musicians, etc.) who contribute to Canadian film and video productions are entitled to **remuneration** when their performances are used in Canadian broadcasting, such as on television or in online streaming platforms.
- **Support for Canadian Content**: By linking performer rights to Canadian government funding and CRTC recognition, the regulations promote the development of high-quality, locally produced content.
- **Alignment with National Policy**: The regulations reflect broader government goals to support the Canadian creative industries and ensure fair compensation for artists and creators.
- **Clarity and Enforcement**: By clearly defining qualifying works and using established regulatory definitions (e.g., CRTC, Telefilm Canada), the rules provide a clear and enforceable framework for broadcasters and distributors.

### **Conclusion**

The *Cinematographic Works (Right to Remuneration) Regulations* establish a clear and enforceable framework for ensuring that performers in Canadian film and video productions receive fair compensation when their performances are used in Canadian media. By linking eligibility to government certification, CRTC recognition, and public funding, the regulations support both the rights of performers and the sustainability of Canada’s national film and television industry. These rules are a critical component of Canada’s broader copyright and cultural policy, reinforcing the value of Canadian creative content and the artists who produce it.
