Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the regulation you provided:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Ministers’ Regional Office Program  
**Legal Authority:** Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  
**Applicable Statute:** R.S., c. P-34 (Public Service Act)  
**Issuing Body:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Effective Date:** As published in the Canada Gazette (implied by the statutory citation)  

---

**Summary of the Provision:**

Under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) has transferred, as of the date of the regulation, the **control and supervision** of a specific component within the federal public administration — namely, the **Ministers’ Regional Office Program (MROP)** — from the **Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)** to the **Privy Council Office (PCO)**.

**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

1. **Subject of Transfer:**  
   The Ministers’ Regional Office Program (MROP) — a federal initiative designed to support ministers by providing regional office services. These offices are typically established to enhance ministerial access to regional communities, improve policy implementation, and strengthen government engagement with local populations.

2. **Original Jurisdiction:**  
   Prior to this transfer, the MROP was under the administrative control and supervision of the Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS), a department historically responsible for infrastructure, public works, and government services delivery.

3. **New Jurisdiction:**  
   The program is now placed under the **Privy Council Office**, which serves as the central administrative office for the federal government, providing support to the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This includes managing the operations of the Cabinet, coordinating interdepartmental policy, and overseeing key government programs and services that support the executive branch.

4. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer involves **control and supervision**, not ownership or funding. This means that the Privy Council Office now has responsibility for:
   - Strategic direction
   - Policy oversight
   - Administrative management
   - Performance monitoring
   - Reporting to the Prime Minister and Cabinet

   The actual day-to-day operations of the regional offices may remain largely unchanged, but decision-making authority and oversight now reside with the Privy Council Office.

5. **Rationale (Implied):**  
   This realignment reflects a broader government effort to:
   - Strengthen the executive branch’s capacity to manage ministerial support functions.
   - Improve coordination between the Prime Minister’s office and individual ministers.
   - Enhance accountability and responsiveness in ministerial operations.
   - Centralize key administrative functions that support the functioning of the Cabinet.

6. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reorganization of public service functions and the transfer of responsibilities between departments, particularly when such a transfer serves the public interest and enhances government efficiency.

---

**Implications:**

- **For Ministers:** Ministers now receive support through a program that is more directly aligned with the executive leadership structure, potentially improving responsiveness and coordination.
- **For the Privy Council Office:** The PCO gains a key administrative function that strengthens its role as a central hub for ministerial support and policy delivery.
- **For Public Service Governance:** The move may streamline accountability, reduce bureaucratic duplication, and improve transparency in ministerial operations.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. By transferring the control and supervision of the Ministers’ Regional Office Program from the Department of Public Works and Government Services to the Privy Council Office, the government enhances the executive branch’s capacity to support ministers at the regional level, ensuring greater coordination, efficiency, and alignment with national policy priorities.
