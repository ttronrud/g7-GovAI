## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Heavy-duty Vehicle and Engine Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Enactment Background**

- These regulations were **proposed** by the Minister of the Environment on **April 14, 2012**, and published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, under **subsection 332(1)a** of CEPA 1999.
- The proposal was followed by a **public comment period**, during which stakeholders (e.g., industry, environmental groups) were invited to:
  - Submit written comments or
  - File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** to assess the regulations.
- Based on the recommendations of the Minister and following **sections 160 and 162 of CEPA 1999**, the **Governor in Council** formally enacted the regulations.

> ✅ This process ensures regulatory transparency, public participation, and adherence to CEPA’s environmental protection mandate.

### 🔍 **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- **Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** from heavy-duty vehicles and engines in Canada.
- Establish **emission standards** for key pollutants, including:
  - **Carbon dioxide (CO₂)**
  - **Methane (CH₄)**
  - **Nitrous oxide (N₂O)**
- Promote **technology innovation** and **emission control improvements** through performance-based standards.
- Align Canadian standards with **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** standards, particularly through reference to the **Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)**.
