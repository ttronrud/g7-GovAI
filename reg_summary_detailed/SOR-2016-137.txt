## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations**

### 🔍 **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

- **Enabling Legislation**:  
  These regulations are made under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA)*, which allows the Governor in Council to regulate substances that deplete the ozone layer.

- **Legal Process**:
  - The **Minister of the Environment** published a **proposed regulation** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 21, 2015**.
  - A public comment period was opened, allowing stakeholders to submit **comments or objections**.
  - The **National Advisory Committee** was consulted under section 6c and subsection 93(3) of CEPA.
  - The **Governor in Council** concluded, under subsection 93(4), that the proposed regulations do **not conflict** with other federal environmental laws and provide **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment.

> ✅ Therefore, the regulations were formally adopted and published on **March 21, 2015**, as the final version.

| **HBFC** | Hydrobromofluorocarbon (contains bromine, highly ozone-depleting) |
| **Critical Use** | Use of methyl bromide as defined in **Decision IX/6** of the Montreal Protocol (e.g., for pest control in agriculture) |
| **Emergency Use** | Up to 20 tonnes of methyl bromide used in response to an emergency, per Decision IX/6 |
| **Essential Use** | Use of methyl bromide outside labs, as defined in **Decision IV/25** of the Montreal Protocol |
| **Feedstock** | A substance whose molecular structure is altered during chemical manufacturing |
| **Foaming Agent** | Chemical added to plastic to form gas cells (used in foam insulation) |
| **Plastic Foam** | Foam plastic with reduced density due to foaming agent |
| **Laboratory or Analytical Use** | Use approved by the Parties under a Decision |
| **Party** | Nation that has ratified the Montreal Protocol |
| **Recovered / Recycled / Reclaimed** | Definitions of substance recovery and reuse: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• **Recovered** | Collected after use |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• **Recycled** | Cleaned and reused (e.g., for equipment recharge) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• **Reclaimed** | Processed (via filtering, distillation, etc.) to meet industry reuse standards |

### 🎯 **3. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives are:

1. **Implement Canada’s obligations under the Montreal Protocol** on substances that deplete the ozone layer.
2. **Regulate ozone-depleting substances (ODS)** and **products containing or designed to contain** them.
3. **Set rules for halocarbon alternatives** (e.g., HFCs, HCFCs) as replacements for ODS.
4. **Ensure safe handling, use, and disposal** of ODS to protect human health and the environment.

### 📂 **4. Scope of Application**

#### ✅ **Applies to**:
- Substances (including isomers) listed in **Schedule 1**, specifically on the **List of Toxic Substances** under CEPA.
- **Products** that contain or are designed to contain these substances.

#### ❌ **Does NOT Apply to**:
1. **Incidental byproducts**:
   - Substances produced accidentally during manufacturing of non-regulated substances.
   - Substances present incidentally in mixtures, products, or equipment.

2. **Small quantities left in containers**:
   - Residue in a container after emptying, **not exceeding 10% of the container’s total capacity** (by weight).

3. **Substances in transit**:
   - Moving through Canada (from outside Canada to outside Canada, or vice versa) **if**:
     - Destination is known on entry/exit date.
     - The substance is **not stored**, **repackaged**, **sorted**, **altered**, or **sold** during transit.

4. **Automobiles in transit**:
   - Vehicles moving through Canada from abroad to abroad.

| **Importing** regulated substances | Prohibited without a permit |
| **Manufacturing** regulated substances | Prohibited entirely |
| **Manufacturing products** containing ODS | Prohibited |
| **Using or selling** ODS | Only permitted under specific conditions |
