**Detailed Summary of the "Certain Emergency Response Benefits Remission Order"**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**, as recommended by the **Treasury Board** and the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**. It is made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, indicating that it is a federal government policy decision authorized under the Financial Administration Act, which governs the financial management and accountability of the federal government.

The Order is designed to provide **remission (forgiveness or repayment relief)** of certain emergency benefits that were mistakenly paid to individuals who were not eligible — specifically, in cases where such payments were made during a period when the individual would have otherwise been eligible for the **Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- **Correct a financial error** in the payment of emergency benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Provide relief** to individuals who received income support or employment insurance emergency benefits during a period when they were **not eligible**, but who **would have been eligible** for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).
- Ensure that **no undue financial burden** is placed on students or young people who were inadvertently penalized due to administrative or eligibility errors during the emergency response period.

### **3. Eligibility Criteria – Two Separate Groups**

The Order applies to two distinct categories of individuals, each with specific eligibility requirements:

---

#### **Group 1: Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) Recipients**

**Eligibility Conditions:**
1. **Received a CERB payment** for a **four-week period** during which they were **not eligible** for the benefit.
2. The individual **repaid or is to repay** the CERB payment under **subsection 12(1) of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act**.
3. During that four-week period, the individual **would have been eligible** for a **Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)** if they had not received the CERB.
4. The individual **did not actually receive** a CESB for that period.
5. The individual **applied for the CERB** for that period **not later than September 30, 2020**.
6. The individual files a **return of income** under the **Income Tax Act** for **both the 2019 and 2020 taxation years**, **not later than December 31, 2022**.
7. The individual **applies for remission** in the **form and manner specified by the Minister of Employment and Social Development**.

**Remission Amount:**
- The amount to be remitted is **equal to the amount of the CERB payment** received during the four-week period in question.

> This provision targets individuals who received CERB due to an error (e.g., incorrect eligibility) but who would have qualified for CESB instead.

---

#### **Group 2: Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI-ERB) Recipients**

**Eligibility Conditions:**
1. Received an **Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI-ERB)** for a **two-week period** during which they were **not eligible**.
2. Under **section 43** of the *Employment Insurance Act*, the person has **repaid or is to repay** the benefit, or under **section 44**, has **returned or is to return** the benefit.
3. During a **four-week period** that includes **at least one week** from the two-week EI-ERB period, the person **would have been eligible** for a CESB if they had not received the EI-ERB during any week in that four-week period.
4. The person **did not receive** a CESB for that four-week period.
5. The person applied for the EI-ERB **not later than September 30, 2020**.
6. The person files a **return of income** under the *Income Tax Act* for **both 2019 and 2020**, **not later than December 31, 2022**.
7. The person applies for remission in the **form and manner specified by the Canada Employment Insurance Commission**.

**Remission Amount:**
- The amount to be remitted is **equal to the amount of the EI-ERB** that was repaid, is to be repaid, returned, or is to be returned, for the weeks included in the qualifying four-week period.

> This provision applies to individuals who received EI emergency benefits during a short period when they were ineligible, and who would have qualified for CESB had they not received the EI benefit.

---

### **4. Cap on Remission Amount**

A critical limitation is imposed to prevent overpayment or excessive remission:

> **The total remission amount for any four-week period cannot exceed the amount of the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)** that the person would have received during that period **if they had applied for CESB** and **had not received any income support or EI emergency response benefit** during that time.

This ensures that:
- The remission does not go beyond what the individual would have earned under the CESB program.
- The government is not providing financial advantages beyond what was originally intended.
- The benefit is proportionate and fair.

---

### **5. Timing and Implementation**

- **Effective Date:** The Order comes into force on the **day it is made** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- **Deadline for Income Returns:** Individuals must file income tax returns for **2019 and 2020** by **December 31, 2022**.
- **Application Deadline:** Individuals must apply for remission **in the form and manner specified** by the relevant minister (Employment and Social Development for CERB; Employment Insurance Commission for EI-ERB).
- **Application Process:** The process is formalized and requires submission to the appropriate government department, with strict compliance on form, timing, and documentation.

### **6. Key Principles Underlying the Order**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Error Correction** | Addresses a situation where a person received an emergency benefit (CERB or EI-ERB) when they were not eligible, but would have been eligible for CESB. |
| **Fairness and Proportionality** | The remission is capped at the value of the CESB, ensuring no overcompensation. |
| **Timeliness** | Requires applications to be submitted within a reasonable timeframe (by Dec 31, 2022), reflecting the urgency of the original emergency. |
| **Eligibility-Based Design** | Only individuals who were eligible for CESB but not for the emergency benefit are eligible — ensuring targeted relief. |
| **Administrative Accountability** | Requires filing of income returns, reinforcing compliance and tax accountability. |

### **7. Implications and Significance**

- **Supports Student Populations:** The Order recognizes that students and young people were disproportionately affected during the pandemic and may have been inadvertently penalized due to eligibility rules.
- **Promotes Equity:** By allowing remission in cases where a student would have qualified for CESB, the government promotes fairness in emergency benefit distribution.
- **Administrative Clarity:** The regulation provides clear, structured eligibility criteria, reducing ambiguity and enabling consistent processing.
- **Fiscal Responsibility:** The cap on remission ensures that the government does not incur unnecessary financial losses.

---

### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**

  - Received emergency benefits after September 30, 2020.
  - Did not meet the CESB eligibility criteria during the relevant period.
  - Failed to file income returns by December 31, 2022.
  - Did not apply for remission in the prescribed form and manner.
- The remission **does not extend** to other emergency benefits or programs outside the scope of CERB, EI-ERB, or CESB.

### **Conclusion**

This **Certain Emergency Response Benefits Remission Order** is a targeted, equitable, and administratively sound policy designed to correct financial errors made during the early stages of the pandemic. It provides relief to individuals who received emergency income support when they were not eligible, but who would have qualified for the Canada Emergency Student Benefit. By capping remission at the value of the CESB and requiring timely compliance with tax and application requirements, the Order balances fairness, fiscal responsibility, and administrative feasibility.

It reflects the government’s commitment to **correcting unintended consequences** of emergency programs and ensuring that vulnerable populations — particularly students — are not unfairly penalized due to administrative or eligibility oversights.
