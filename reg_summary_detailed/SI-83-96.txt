**Detailed Summary of the Meat Inspection Overtime Inspection Fees Remission Order**

---

**1. Issuance and Authority**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury Board**. This authority is derived from **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General to make orders in Council to adjust or remit fees under the financial administration framework, particularly when there is a need to manage or reduce financial burdens on stakeholders.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., reduce or cancel) a portion of certain fees** that are charged or payable for **overtime inspection services** under the **Meat Inspection Regulations**. These inspections are conducted by government inspectors to ensure meat products meet health, safety, and quality standards before being sold or distributed.

The remission is intended to **alleviate financial burdens** on meat processors, producers, or other entities that are required to pay fees for these inspections—especially when the cost of overtime inspections exceeds what is considered reasonable or necessary under the prevailing regulatory framework.

---

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies specifically to fees under:  
- **Subsection 80(1)** of the *Meat Inspection Regulations*  
- **Subsection 81(1)** of the *Meat Inspection Regulations*  

These subsections govern the fees payable for **overtime inspection services**—that is, inspections conducted beyond regular working hours (e.g., during emergencies, processing peaks, or unexpected situations). The fees are typically charged to ensure that inspection services remain adequately funded.

---

**4. Basis for the Remission Amount**  
The amount of the remission is calculated as the **difference between two sets of prescribed fees**:

- The **higher fee** established by **Order in Council P.C. 1982-1710**, dated **10 June 1982**  
- The **lower fee** established by **Order in Council P.C. 1982-3169**, dated **21 October 1982**

Thus, the remission amount is the **difference between these two fee levels**. This means that the entity paying the overtime inspection fee will have the portion of the fee that exceeds the 1982-3169 rate **reduced or waived**—effectively refunding the difference.

For example:  
- If the 1982-1710 fee was $100 and the 1982-3169 fee is $70, then a remission of $30 will be granted per applicable overtime inspection.

**6. Regulatory Context**

- Improve the **economic viability** of meat processing operations  
- Ensure **fairness and transparency** in fee structures  
- Maintain **public health and safety standards** through consistent inspection practices  

It reflects a policy of **fee rationalization**—adjusting fees to reflect current economic conditions and administrative costs, while preventing undue financial strain on industry participants.

**7. Key Implications**  
- **Beneficiaries**: Meat processors, slaughterhouses, and other entities that incur overtime inspection fees.  
- **Impact**: Reduces the cost of compliance with meat safety regulations.  
- **Duration**: The Order remains in effect until amended, revoked, or superseded by a subsequent regulation.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a targeted, cost-reduction measure designed to ease the financial burden on meat industry operators by remitting a portion of overtime inspection fees. It is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a balance between regulatory oversight and economic feasibility. By aligning inspection fees with updated cost structures, the Order supports both public health standards and the sustainability of the meat processing sector in Canada.
