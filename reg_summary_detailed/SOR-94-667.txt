**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations* (S.C. 1993, c. 38)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations* were enacted under the authority of **Section 22 of the Telecommunications Act** by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology. These regulations establish a comprehensive framework governing **ownership and control of Canadian telecommunications common carriers**, with a primary focus on **ensuring Canadian national interest and control** over critical telecommunications infrastructure.

The regulations define key terms, establish thresholds for non-Canadian ownership, outline procedures for determining beneficial ownership, and provide mechanisms for compliance and reporting. Their overarching goal is to **prevent foreign control** of Canadian telecommunications companies while allowing for legitimate investment and operational flexibility.

## **Definition of "Canadian" (for Regulatory Purposes)**

A "Canadian" is defined broadly to include:
- Citizens of Canada who are **ordinarily resident** in Canada.
- Permanent residents who have been **ordinarily resident in Canada for ≤1 year** after becoming eligible for citizenship.
- Canadian government entities (federal, provincial, local) and their agencies.
- Corporations without share capital where majority of directors/officers are appointed by:
  - Federal/provincial statutes or regulations.
  - Governor in Council, Lieutenant Governor in Council, or a Crown minister.
- Entities that qualify under the following categories:
  - Qualified Corporation
  - Qualified Trust
  - Qualified Mutual Insurance Company

## **Beneficial Ownership Determination Rules**

To determine whether voting shares are beneficially owned or controlled by a Canadian, the following **rules apply**:

### 1. **Inclusion of Voting Shares in Determination**
Shares may be included in the calculation of Canadian ownership **without further proof** if:
- **(a)** Registered in the name of a shareholder (not a depository), whose latest address is in Canada.
- **(b)** Held by a **depository** with head office in Canada, who has filed an affidavit within the **12 months prior** to the determination stating:
  - The number of shares held on behalf of the person/entity.
  - That the person/entity’s latest address is in Canada.
- **(c)** A shareholder has filed an affidavit within the 12 months stating they are a Canadian.

> These provisions allow for **practical, administratively feasible** determination of ownership while reducing the burden on corporations.

---

### 2. **Exclusion of Shares When Doubt Exists**
If directors have **information indicating** that a shareholder (registered or through a depository) is **not a Canadian**, they **must not include** those shares in the determination **until**:
- They receive a valid **affidavit or declaration** confirming the beneficial owner is a Canadian and remains so under the regulations.

> This creates a **due diligence requirement** and prevents overstatement of Canadian ownership.

---

## **Temporary Qualification Periods (Post-Implementation)**

During the **first six months** after the regulations come into force:

- Any corporation that **does not have actual knowledge** that non-Canadians beneficially own or control **more than 33⅓%** of its voting shares is **automatically considered a "qualified corporation"** for that period.
- Similarly, any corporation under subsection 17(4) that does **not have knowledge** of non-Canadian ownership exceeding the authorized threshold is deemed to **satisfy ownership criteria** for that period.

> This transitional rule provides **stability and flexibility** during implementation.

---

## **Loss of Qualified Corporation Status**

If a corporation that previously filed an affidavit declaring itself a qualified corporation:
- Acquires knowledge that **Canadian shareholders own less than 66⅔%** of voting shares,
- And **no more than 5%** of the ownership drops below 66⅔% during the next 12 months,
- Then it remains a **qualified corporation for 12 months** from the date of knowledge.

> This **12-month grace period** allows time for corrective action without immediate penalties.

**Conditions for continuation**:
- The drop in Canadian ownership must not exceed 5% at any time.
- The corporation must **notify the Canadian carrier in writing** upon becoming aware of the change.

> If the corporation **loses qualification**, it must also **notify the carrier in writing** immediately.

---

## **Director’s Authority to Request Information**

Directors of a Canadian carrier may, with **board authorization**, make a written request to various parties for affidavits or declarations to assess eligibility under **Section 16 of the Act** (which governs ownership eligibility).

### Parties to whom a request may be made:

| Party | Required Information |
|------|------------------------|
| **Shareholder** (direct holder) | Identity of beneficial owner, whether Canadian, date of registration/acquisition, other relevant info; if confidentiality prevents disclosure, state whether owner is or is not Canadian. |
| **Shareholder of a parent company** | Same as above, but for shares in a parent entity. |
| **Trustee** (of a trust that holds shares) | Identity of each trustee, beneficial interest of each beneficiary, whether each is Canadian, date of acquisition, confidentiality statement. |
| **Mutual Insurance Company** | Head office location, board members, which are Canadians, date of acquisition. |
| **Partnership** | Identity of each partner, which are Canadians, beneficial interest, date of acquisition, confidentiality statement. |
| **Pension Fund Society** | Head office, board members, which are Canadians, date of acquisition. |
| **Depository** | Identity and address of each person/entity on whose behalf it holds shares, number of shares, whether each is Canadian, date of transfer, confidentiality statement. |
| **Intermediary** | Identity and address of each person/entity on whose behalf it holds shares, number of shares, whether Canadian, date of transfer, confidentiality statement. |

> Directors may request **any or all** of the above information, and may rely on **affidavits or declarations** even if confidentiality prevents full disclosure.

> The **purpose** is to determine whether the carrier meets the ownership criteria under Section 16 of the Act.
