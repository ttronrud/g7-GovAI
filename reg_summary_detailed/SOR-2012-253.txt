## 💳 Fee Structure and Application

### 1. **General Rule (Section 2)**
Every person requesting a service listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** must pay the corresponding fee in **Column 2**.

> Example: A request for a new passport triggers a fee based on the service type, delivery location, and validity period.

---

### 2. **Replacement of Lost or Stolen Documents (Section 3)**
- If a person requests to replace a **lost or stolen passport or travel document**, they are **deemed to have requested service item 14**.
- The **fee for item 14 applies in addition** to any applicable fee from items 1–6, 9, or 10.

> 🔍 This ensures that replacement services are priced separately and fairly, reflecting the administrative burden involved.

---

### 3. **Extended Hours Service Fees (Item 8)**
If a government office must open **outside normal business hours** to fulfill a request (e.g., for urgent travel), the person must pay an **additional fee** set out in **item 8 of the schedule**.

---

### 4. **Fee Increase for Passport Retention (Section 4)**
When a person requests a passport replacement **and also wishes to retain their original valid passport** during processing:
- The applicable fee is **increased by $45**.

- For a **child under 16 years of age** or a **mentally incompetent person living in an institution abroad**.
- For the **issuance of an emergency travel document** to return a Canadian citizen who has been deported.

> ✅ These exemptions reflect humanitarian and public interest considerations.

---

### 6. **Humanitarian Travel Exemption (Section 6)**  
If a person requests a service (e.g., passport) to travel **outside Canada** in support of a humanitarian operation (e.g., disaster relief, conflict response):
- The **fees under paragraphs 7(a) and (b)** and **item 8** are waived **if**:
  - The person provides an **official document** from an **appropriate authority** (e.g., UN, Red Cross, NGO) confirming participation in the operation.

## 🔁 Fee Adjustment Mechanism (Sections 4–7)

Fees are adjusted annually to reflect **cost changes** incurred by the government in delivering services.

### A. **Adjustment for Domestic Mail/Courier Services (Subsection 4)**  
Applies to fees for sending passports **within Canada**.

#### Formula:
$$
\text{Adjustment} = \left( \frac{C_{\text{ref}} - C_{\text{prev}}}{N_{\text{ref}} - N_{\text{prev}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{N_{\text{ref}}}{N_{\text{prev}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{E_{\text{ref}} - E_{\text{prev}}}{N_{\text{ref}} - N_{\text{prev}}} \right) + \text{adjustment from other bodies}
$$

Where:
- $ C_{\text{ref}} $: External cost (in constant dollars) to send documents by mail/courier in the **reference year**
- $ N_{\text{ref}} $: Number of documents sent in the reference year
- $ C_{\text{prev}} $: Cost in the year **before** the reference year
- $ N_{\text{prev}} $: Number of documents sent in the prior year
- $ E_{\text{ref}} $: Cost to other government bodies (e.g., DFAIT) for passport delivery
- $ E_{\text{prev}} $: Same cost in prior year
- $ N_{\text{ref}}^{(other)} $: Passports issued via other bodies in the reference year
- $ N_{\text{prev}}^{(other)} $: Same in prior year
- $ A $: Cumulative adjustments since base year (adjusted for subsection 4)

#### Key Rules:
- **No adjustment** if the result is between **–$1 and +$1** (after rounding).
- If a fraction of a dollar results, it is **rounded up to the nearest dollar**.
- All adjustments are applied **proportionally** to other fees.

---

### B. **Adjustment for International Mail/Courier Services (Subsection 6)**  
Applies to fees for sending passports **outside Canada**.

#### Formula:
$$
\text{Adjustment} = \left( \frac{C_{\text{ref, intl}} - C_{\text{prev, intl}}}{N_{\text{ref, intl}} - N_{\text{prev, intl}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{N_{\text{ref, intl}}}{N_{\text{prev, intl}}} \right) \times \left( \frac{E_{\text{ref, DFAIT}} - E_{\text{prev, DFAIT}}}{N_{\text{ref, DFAIT}} - N_{\text{prev, DFAIT}}} \right) + \text{adjustment from other bodies}
$$

Where:
- $ C_{\text{ref, intl}} $: Cost to send passports abroad (in constant dollars)
- $ N_{\text{ref, intl}} $: Number of documents sent abroad
- $ E_{\text{ref, DFAIT}} $: Cost to DFAIT for international delivery
- $ E_{\text{prev, DFAIT}} $: Cost in prior year
- $ N_{\text{ref, DFAIT}} $: Passports issued via DFAIT in reference year
- $ N_{\text{prev, DFAIT}} $: Same in prior year

#### Key Rules:
- **No adjustment** if the result is between **–$3 and +$3**.
- Rounded up to nearest dollar if fractional.
- Adjustments are **proportional** to other fees.

### C. **Proportional Adjustments to Other Fees (Section 7)**  
When the base fee (1(a)(i) or 1(b)(i)) is adjusted, the following fees are **automatically adjusted**:

| Fee | Adjustment Rule |
|-----|------------------|
| 1(a)(ii) & Item 5 | Set to **70%** of the adjusted 1(a)(i) fee |
| 2(a) & Item 6 | Set to **60%** of the adjusted 1(a)(ii) fee |
| Item 3 | Adjusted by **same amount** as 1(a)(i) |
| Item 4 | Set to **60%** of the adjusted Item 3 fee |

> ⚠️ This ensures a **systematic and consistent** fee structure across services.

### D. **Constant Dollars Adjustment (Section 8)**
