**Detailed Summary of the Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**

The *Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Regulations* are formally adopted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (here, *News of the North*) to allow public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input.

The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **August 12 and 19, 1995**, and in two successive issues of the *News of the North* on **July 24 and 31, 1995**. This provided interested parties—including landowners, local communities, aviation stakeholders, and the public—with a meaningful opportunity to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the Governor in Council, acting on the Minister’s recommendation, **officially enacted** the regulations on **August 19, 1995**.

### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10  
- These regulations are binding and apply to all land within the designated airport zone.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Fort Resolution Airport, located near Fort Resolution in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a datum for measuring elevation and distances. Located on the centerline of runway 12–30, 632.45 meters from the threshold of runway 12. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip. They define safe zones for aircraft during approach and landing. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation above the ARP, designed to protect the airport from visual obstructions in the surrounding area. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing surface, including the runway, designated for take-off and landing in a specific direction. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes that extend from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, connecting them to the outer surface. |

---

### **4. Elevation Datum**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is established at **159.7 meters above sea level**.  
- All measurements and height restrictions in the regulations are referenced from this point.

---

### **5. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Fort Resolution Airport, including:

- Public road allowances
- Private land
- Any land within the designated boundary

This land is **specifically described in Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulations, which outlines the geographic boundaries.

---

### **6. Height Restrictions**

#### **Prohibition on Structures**
No person may:

- Erect or construct a building, structure, or object  
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object  

**if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of the object:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This ensures that aircraft can safely approach, land, and take off without being visually or physically obstructed by tall structures or natural features.

---

### **7. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a requirement for the **owner or lessee** of the land to **remove the excess growth**.

> This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural landscapes while still maintaining aviation safety standards.

### **8. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**  
- Located on the centerline of runway 12–30  
- 632.45 meters from the threshold of runway 12  
- Serves as the origin point for all elevation and distance measurements

#### **B. Approach Surfaces**  
Two distinct approach surfaces, one for each runway end:

1. **Runway 12 Approach (normal end)**  
   - Inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 40 meters horizontally**  
   - Extends to an imaginary horizontal line:
     - 3,000 meters horizontally from the end of the strip
     - 525 meters from the centerline of the strip
     - 75 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip

2. **Runway 30 Approach (displaced threshold)**  
   - Inclined plane rising at the same 1:40 ratio  
   - Extends 3,000 meters horizontally from the **displaced threshold** (not at the end of the runway)  
   - Outer ends of the horizontal line are 525 meters from the centerline  
   - 75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach phases by ensuring no obstructions exist within the required visual range.

#### **C. Outer Surface**  
- An **imaginary plane** at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**  
- Extends to the outer boundary of the regulated area  
- **Exception**: Where the outer surface would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to ensure practicality and safety

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any object in the broader area surrounding the airport.

#### **D. Transitional Surfaces**  
- Inclined planes rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally**  
- Extend from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces  
- Rise until they intersect with the outer surface  
- Ensure a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer zone

> These surfaces prevent abrupt changes in height and help maintain visual clarity for pilots during approach and departure.

#### **E. Outer Boundary of Regulated Land**  
- A **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the Airport Reference Point (ARP)  
- Defines the total geographic area subject to the zoning regulations  
- All land within this circle is subject to the height restrictions

---

### **9. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing visual obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
- To **protect the operational integrity** of Fort Resolution Airport, which serves both regional and remote communities.
- To provide **clear, measurable, and enforceable standards** for land use in the vicinity of the airport.
- To balance **aviation safety** with **local land use and natural development**, through provisions for natural growth management.

---

### **10. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excess vegetation
  - Issue enforcement notices or penalties (implied through the regulatory framework)
- The regulations are enforceable by federal authorities, and violations may result in legal action or corrective measures.

---

### **11. Supporting Documentation**

- The regulations are based on **Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3041**, dated **February 7, 1995**, which provides the official spatial and design basis for the zoning boundaries and surfaces.
- All surfaces, boundaries, and elevations are illustrated in this plan and referenced in the schedule.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Fort Resolution Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for land use around Fort Resolution Airport. By defining clear elevation limits—through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces—the regulations ensure that aircraft can operate safely in all phases of flight. The inclusion of provisions for natural growth reflects a balanced approach to environmental and aviation safety. These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s national aviation infrastructure management system, particularly in remote northern regions where visual clarity and safe operations are essential.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:
- Height limits are defined by three key surfaces (approach, transitional, outer).
- All land within a 4,000-meter radius from the ARP is regulated.
- Natural growth over height limits can be removed by the Minister.
- The ARP is at 159.7 m above sea level.
- Regulations are based on a formal zoning plan and published with public consultation.

This regulation exemplifies how federal aviation policy integrates technical precision with community and environmental considerations in remote northern Canada.
