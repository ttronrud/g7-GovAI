**Detailed Summary of the CUKTCA Tariff Preference Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**

The *CUKTCA Tariff Preference Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Customs Tariff* and implemented by His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, provide specific rules governing the application of tariff preferences under the **Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA)**. These regulations establish conditions under which products originating in CUKTCA beneficiary countries may be exempt from certain tariffs when imported into Canada.

The regulations are designed to ensure that goods that meet the criteria of "originating" under the CUKTCA are eligible for preferential tariff treatment, particularly in the context of shipments from the United Kingdom to Canada.

---

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### 1. **Definition of "Originating"**
- The term **"originating"** is defined consistently with its meaning under the **Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA)**.
- This ensures legal and regulatory alignment with the agreement’s framework, which determines whether a product qualifies as originating based on production processes, value-added content, and compliance with specific rules of origin.

> *Purpose:* To maintain consistency in determining eligibility for tariff preferences across both jurisdictions.

---

#### 2. **Eligibility for United Kingdom Tariff Preference**
Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, **originating products exported from a CUKTCA beneficiary** (such as the United Kingdom) are entitled to the benefit of the **United Kingdom tariff** when shipped to Canada — provided certain conditions are met.

This means that eligible goods from CUKTCA member countries can enter Canada with reduced or zero tariffs, depending on the tariff schedule.

---

#### 3. **Conditions for Tariff Preference (Shipment Requirements)**

To qualify for the preferential tariff treatment, the shipment must meet **one of the following two conditions**:

---

##### **Condition A: No Third-Country Transit (Direct Shipment)**  
The product is shipped **directly from a CUKTCA beneficiary country to Canada**, without passing through any country that is **not a CUKTCA beneficiary**.

- This includes:
  - Shipments via a **through bill of lading** (a single document that covers the entire journey).
  - Or, **without a through bill of lading**, if the importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that:
    - Clearly shows the **shipping route**.
    - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada.

> *Purpose:* To prevent circumvention of origin rules by using third countries to avoid tariff preference eligibility.

---

##### **Condition B: Transit Through a Non-Beneficiary Country**  
If the product **passes through a country that is not a CUKTCA beneficiary**, the importer must provide **additional documentation** to prove the product’s eligibility.

Specifically, the importer must:
1. Provide, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** showing:
   - The **shipping route**.
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** before entry into Canada.
2. Provide a **copy of the customs control documents** that confirm:
   - The products **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the non-beneficiary country.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that goods do not undergo processing or re-exportation in non-partner countries that could alter their origin status or allow for tariff evasion.

> *Note:* The requirement for customs control documentation is critical — it verifies that the goods were not freely released or re-exported, which could undermine the "originating" status.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 37 of the Canada–United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 2021) comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> *Note:* The regulations were officially in force on **April 1, 2021**, as referenced in SI/2021-14.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations are made under **paragraph 16(2)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, which authorizes the Government of Canada to issue rules for the application of tariff preferences under international trade agreements.
- The Minister of Finance recommends the regulations, and the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council formally enacts them.

### **Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Trade Continuity** | Ensures stable and predictable trade flows between Canada and the UK, especially in the aftermath of Brexit, by preserving tariff advantages. |
| **Prevent Tariff Evasion** | Requires detailed documentation to prevent goods from being routed through non-beneficiary countries to avoid preferential treatment. |
| **Simplify Compliance** | Provides clear, structured conditions for importers to follow when shipping originating goods from the UK to Canada. |
| **Support Economic Integration** | Encourages continued trade between Canada and the UK by maintaining access to preferential tariff rates. |

---

### **Practical Implications for Importers and Customs Officers**

- **Importers** must:
  - Verify that goods are "originating" under the CUKTCA.
  - Maintain accurate records of shipping routes and transhipment points.
  - Prepare and retain documentation (e.g., bills of lading, shipping manifests, customs declarations) to demonstrate compliance.
- **Customs Officers** may request:
  - Evidence of the shipping route and transhipment points.
  - Copies of customs control documents (e.g., import/export licenses, customs clearance records) if transit through a non-beneficiary country occurs.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *CUKTCA Tariff Preference Regulations* establish a clear, enforceable framework for determining when goods from the United Kingdom (and other CUKTCA beneficiary countries) can benefit from preferential tariff treatment upon entry into Canada. By requiring transparency in shipping routes and customs control, the regulations protect the integrity of the trade agreement while supporting legitimate trade between Canada and the UK.

These rules are essential for maintaining the economic benefits of the CUKTCA in a post-Brexit environment and ensure that tariff preferences are applied fairly and consistently.
