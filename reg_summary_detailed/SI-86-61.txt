**Detailed Summary of the Pet Food for Testing Remission Order**

---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*Pet Food for Testing Remission Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Section 17 of the *Financial Administration Act*  
**Citation:** S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4  
**Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to promote scientific and veterinary research in the field of animal nutrition and palatability by enabling the importation of pet food for testing purposes without the burden of customs duties and sales tax. The remission of these taxes supports the public interest by facilitating the development and improvement of pet food products that meet nutritional and dietary standards for animals.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **Section 2: Remission of Customs Duties**
- **What is remitted?**  
  Customs duties paid or payable under the *Customs Tariff* on pet food imported specifically for testing its **palatability and nutritional adequacy** on animals are remitted (i.e., waived or forgiven).

- **Eligible Goods:**  
  Pet food imported solely for the purpose of conducting scientific or veterinary testing related to:
  - Palatability (e.g., how appealing the food is to animals)
  - Nutritional adequacy (e.g., whether the food meets required nutritional standards)

- **Condition:**  
  The import must be for legitimate testing purposes and not for commercial distribution or resale.

#### **Section 3: Remission of Sales Tax**
- **What is remitted?**  
  Sales tax (under the *Excise Tax Act*) paid or payable on the imported pet food is also remitted — **but only in a calculated amount**.

- **Calculation Method:**  
  The amount of sales tax remitted is equal to the **difference** between:
  1. The sales tax actually paid or payable on the goods **before** remission; and  
  2. The sales tax that would have been payable **if the duty-paid value** (used to calculate sales tax) had been reduced by the amount of the customs duty remitted.

  In simpler terms:
  > *Sales tax remitted = (Original sales tax) – (Sales tax based on lower duty-paid value after customs duty is waived)*

  This ensures that the tax relief is proportional to the customs duty reduction and avoids over-benefiting the importer.

#### **Section 4: Conditions and Timeliness**
- A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue**:
  - **Within two years** of the date of importation of the goods.
- Failure to submit a claim within this timeframe results in the loss of eligibility for remission.

### **Key Implications and Public Interest Rationale**

1. **Support for Research and Development:**  
   Allows pet food manufacturers, veterinary institutions, and research organizations to conduct necessary trials without incurring significant import costs.

2. **Promotion of Animal Welfare:**  
   Ensures that pet food products are safe, nutritious, and appealing, which contributes to better animal health and well-being.

3. **Fiscal Neutrality:**  
   The sales tax remission is not a blanket exemption. It is calculated to reflect the actual reduction in the duty-paid value, ensuring that the government still collects appropriate tax revenue in a fair and proportional manner.

4. **Administrative Clarity:**  
   The two-year deadline provides a clear and enforceable timeframe for claim submission, ensuring accountability and reducing potential misuse of the provision.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Pet food imported for commercial sale or distribution.
  - Any goods not used exclusively for testing palatability or nutritional adequacy.
  - Goods imported for non-testing purposes (e.g., retail, resale, or general consumption).

- The remission is **not available retroactively** — claims must be made within two years of importation.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for receiving and processing claims.
- The government retains the authority to verify that the goods were indeed imported for testing and that the conditions of the Order were met.

### **Conclusion**

The *Pet Food for Testing Remission Order* is a targeted, reasonable, and well-structured fiscal policy designed to support scientific advancement in animal nutrition while maintaining fiscal responsibility. By selectively waiving customs duties and proportionally adjusting sales tax, it balances public interest in research and innovation with the need to ensure fair and equitable tax collection.

This regulation reflects a pragmatic approach to taxation — one that recognizes the value of non-commercial, public-interest research while ensuring compliance with financial administration principles.
