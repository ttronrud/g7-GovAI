Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which establishes a **General Import Permit (No. 100 — Eligible Agricultural Goods)** under the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA), issued by the Secretary of State for External Affairs on December 29, 1994.

## 📝 **Detailed Summary of the General Import Permit No. 100 – Eligible Agricultural Goods**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Basis and Effective Date**
- **Authority**: The permit is issued under **subsection 8(1.1)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA).
- **Effective Date**: It becomes effective on the **later of two dates**:
  1. The date on which **Section 74** of *An Act to implement the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization* (WTO Agreement), **chapter 47 of the Statutes of Canada, 1994**, comes into force.
  2. The date on which **subsection 108(1)** of the same Act comes into force.
- This ensures alignment with Canada’s WTO obligations and the implementation of international trade rules.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This permit was **repealed** by **SOR/97-48, s. 2** (1997), and **SOR/96-58, s. 2** (1996) for certain provisions. However, the summary reflects the original text as issued in 1994.

### 🔹 **2. Definition of "Eligible Agricultural Goods"**
The term **"eligible agricultural goods"** refers to specific agricultural products listed in the **Schedule** attached to the permit. These are the only goods authorized for import under this general permit.

The list includes:
- Poultry (live birds, eggs, meat, offal, fat, sausages)
- Bovine and swine products (meat, cuts, carcasses)
- Dairy products (milk, cream, butter substitutes, whey, etc.)
- Prepared food items derived from these commodities

Each product is defined by:
- **Species** (e.g., *Gallus domesticus* for poultry)
- **Weight or size limits** (e.g., live broilers ≤ 185 g)
- **Tariff classification numbers** (e.g., 0105.11.22, 0207.11.92) from the *Customs Tariff* schedule
- **Specific exclusions or conditions** (e.g., origin restrictions)

---

### 🔹 **3. Scope of Authorization**
- **Who Can Import?** Any **resident of Canada** may import eligible agricultural goods into Canada from **any country**.
- **No Requirement for Individual Permits**: This is a **general permit**, meaning no individual import permit is required under section 8 of the EIPA for these goods — **except** where otherwise restricted.

> ❌ **Key Restriction**: A resident **may not** import eligible agricultural goods under this permit **if** they are also importing the same goods under a permit issued under **section 8.3** of the EIPA. This prevents overlap and ensures compliance with priority-based or special-purpose permits.

---

### 🔹 **4. Accounting and Documentation Requirements**
- If the imported goods are required to be **accounted for** under **section 32(1), (3), or (5)** of the *Customs Act*, the importer must:
  - Include the following statement on the accounting form:
    > “Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 100 — Eligible Agricultural Goods”  
    > or  
    > “Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 100 — Marchandises agricoles admissibles”

> ✅ This ensures traceability and compliance with customs procedures.

---

### 🔹 **5. Exclusion Provisions (Critical Limitations)**

#### ❌ **Exclusion During Force of General Permit No. 20**
- The permit **does not authorize** the importation of goods listed in **items 68 to 98 of the schedule** during the period when **General Import Permit No. 20 — Wheat and Wheat Products and Barley and Barley Products** is in force.
- This is a **temporary restriction** to avoid duplication or conflict with a more specific permit for grains and cereals.

> 📌 **Exception**: 
> - This exclusion **does not apply** to eligible agricultural goods listed in items 68–98 that were **already imported** but:
>   - Were **not accounted for** under section 5 of Permit No. 20
>   - Were **not placed in a bonded warehouse** under section 5 of Permit No. 20
> 
> → These goods are **still permitted** under this general permit, even if they were previously imported without proper documentation.

> 💡 This exception allows for **backfilling or correction** of past non-compliant imports.
