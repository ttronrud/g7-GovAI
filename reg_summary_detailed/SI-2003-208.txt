**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Department of International Trade

**Date of Effect:** December 12, 2003

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision grants the Governor General the power to reassign control and supervision of public service departments or functions between ministers, based on recommendations from the Prime Minister.

**Key Provision:**  
The **control and supervision** of the **Department of International Trade** — a portion of the federal public service — is being **transferred** from the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** to the newly designated **Minister for International Trade**.

**Designation of the New Minister:**  
The individual receiving the transfer will be styled the **Minister of International Trade**. This formal title reflects the new ministerial responsibility and the department’s repositioning within the government structure.

**Scope of Transfer:**  
The transfer applies specifically to the **Department of International Trade**, including its administrative functions, personnel, policies, programs, and operational responsibilities. The Minister of International Trade will now have full **control and supervision** over this department, including the authority to direct policy, manage budgets, and oversee implementation of trade-related initiatives.

**Purpose and Implication:**  
This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of government responsibilities to better align with the evolving nature of Canada’s international economic engagement. By moving trade-related functions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (which traditionally handles diplomatic and foreign policy matters) to a dedicated Minister of International Trade, the government aims to:

- Strengthen the focus on trade policy, negotiation, and economic development;
- Improve coordination and efficiency in trade-related decision-making;
- Enhance the government’s capacity to respond to global trade trends and market dynamics.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. All administrative, operational, and policy responsibilities of the Department of International Trade will be transferred to the new Minister of International Trade from that date onward.

**Note on Public Service Structure:**  
This regulation is part of a broader public service restructuring initiative under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which allows for the reorganization of ministerial responsibilities to improve governance, accountability, and policy effectiveness.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally establishes the Minister of International Trade as the head of the Department of International Trade, transferring its control and supervision from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It represents a significant shift in ministerial responsibility, emphasizing the importance of trade policy as a distinct and central component of Canada’s foreign and economic engagement. The change is both administrative and strategic, intended to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of Canada’s international trade operations.
