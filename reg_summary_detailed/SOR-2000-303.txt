## 🔍 Section 1: Criteria for Determining Whether a Pardon Would Bring Justice into Disrepute

Under **paragraph 4.1(3)(d)** of the *Criminal Records Act*, the **Pardon Board** must assess whether granting a pardon would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Board may consider the following factors:

### 1. **Threat to Safety or Security of Canada**
- If the offence posed a threat to national security or public safety.

### 2. **Offence Against the Administration of Law and Justice**
- Must be an offence prosecuted by **indictment** (i.e., a serious criminal charge) under **Part IV of the Criminal Code** (e.g., fraud, corruption, obstruction of justice).

### 3. **Serious Personal Injury Offence**
- As defined in **section 752 of the Criminal Code**, such as offences involving physical harm, assault, or injury resulting in death or long-term disability.

### 4. **Offence Motivated by Bias, Prejudice, or Hate**
- Based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or similar grounds — particularly relevant in hate crimes.

### 5. **Service Offences**
- Specifically defined in:
  - **Sections 73 to 82 of the National Defence Act** (e.g., misconduct by military personnel), where the applicant received a **life sentence**.
  - **Section 130 of the National Defence Act** (offences involving misuse of authority or duty), **if** it also falls under any of the following:
    - (a) to (d) or (f) to (h) of this section (i.e., includes bias, violence, harm to children/vulnerable persons, fraud, etc.)

### 6. **Serious Physical or Psychological Injury to Another Person**
- Offences that caused significant harm to individuals, whether physical or mental.

### 7. **Fraudulent Transactions Relating to Contracts and Trade (Part X of the Criminal Code)**
- Applies if **any** of the following conditions are met:
  - The value of the fraud exceeds **$1 million**;
  - The fraud adversely affected or threatened the **stability of the Canadian economy, financial system, or investor confidence**;
  - The fraud involved a **large number of victims**;
  - The offender exploited their **high public reputation**;
  - The offence involved **cruelty or harm to children or vulnerable persons**;
  - The applicant has a **criminal record outside Canada** for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would have been prosecuted by indictment;
  - The applicant demonstrates a **pattern of criminal activity** (as defined in subsections 462.37(2.04) and (2.05) of the Criminal Code) or a **pattern of increasing gravity** of offences.

> This section is particularly significant as it establishes **strict thresholds** for pardons in cases involving financial fraud, economic harm, or systemic harm — even if a pardon is granted.

## 🔍 Section 2: Requirements for Written Consent to Verification of Criminal Records

This section applies to **applications for paid or volunteer positions** involving **children or vulnerable persons**.

### ✅ What Must Be Included in the Consent Form?

A written consent must contain the following information:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Identification of the Applicant** | Full name, sex, date of birth, place of birth, current address, and **all previous addresses within the last five years**. |
| **Name of the Organization/Person Responsible for Child/Vulnerable Person Well-being** | Must clearly identify the entity (e.g., school board, foster care agency, shelter). |

| **Details of the Children or Vulnerable Persons** | Must include specifics about the individuals involved (e.g., age, condition, care setting). |

### ✅ Understanding of Consequences of Consent

The applicant must **explicitly understand and agree** that:

1. **If a conviction for a sexual offence (listed in the Schedule to the Act) is found**, even if a pardon has been granted:
   - The **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** will provide the **record to the Minister (Solicitor General)**.
2. The **Minister may disclose** all or part of that record to a **police force or authorized body**.
3. The **police force or body will disclose** the information to the applicant.
4. **With written consent**, the information may also be disclosed to the **organization or person who requested the verification**.

> This ensures that **pardon status does not erase the record** for the purposes of background checks in sensitive roles.

### ✅ Form Reference
- The consent may be submitted in **Form 1 of the Schedule**.

## 🔍 Section 3: Consent for Disclosure of Information to a Third Party (for Positions)

This applies to a **different type of consent** — where the applicant wants to allow a police force or authorized body to **disclose information** obtained from a search to a third party (e.g., employer or agency).

### ✅ Required Elements in Consent

Must include:
- The same identification details as in Section 2 (full name, sex, DOB, place of birth, address, previous addresses).
- A statement that the applicant understands:
  - Even if a pardon has been granted or issued for a sexual offence listed in the Schedule,
  - The **information will be disclosed** to the **person or organization** to whom the applicant is applying — **by a police force or authorized body**.

> This is distinct from Form 1: it allows **disclosure to the hiring organization**, not just to the applicant.

### ✅ Form Reference
- This consent may be completed in **Form 2 of the Schedule**.

## 🔍 Section 4: Factors the Minister Must Consider When Authorizing Disclosure

When deciding whether to authorize disclosure of a conviction record (even after pardon), the Minister must consider:

| Factor | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Nature of the Offences** | Includes whether the offence involved violence, harm to children/vulnerable persons, or breach of trust. |
| **Relevance to the Purpose of Disclosure** | The offences must be directly relevant to the position or inquiry. |
| **Time Since Offence** | How long ago the offence occurred — longer periods may weigh in favour of disclosure. |
| **Age of the Applicant at Time of Offence** | Younger age may be considered in context of maturity and development. |
| **Sentences Imposed** | The severity of the sentence (e.g., life imprisonment, long-term prison) is a key factor. |
