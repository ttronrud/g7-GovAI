The provided text consists entirely of **repeal notices** indicating that various provisions of former regulations have been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or abolished). There is **no active regulation** being summarized — instead, the list reflects the **historical removal** of specific sections from prior statutes or regulations.

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Content**
- The entries are **repeal citations**, each referencing a specific section (section number) of a previous regulation or statute that has been officially removed.
- The format follows:  
  `[Repealed, SOR/XXXX-XX, s.XX]`  
  where:
  - **SOR** = Statutory Instrument or Order (in the context of Canadian federal regulation)
  - **XXXX-XX** = the year and number of the statutory instrument (e.g., SOR/2007-86 is the 86th Statutory Instrument of 2007)
  - **s.XX** = the section number of the provision that was repealed

#### 2. **Key Repealed Provisions**
The list includes references to the repeal of multiple sections from various statutory instruments, including:

| Statutory Instrument | Section(s) Repealed |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| SOR/2007-86 | Sections 206 (repeated 23 times), and also sections 4, 14, 16, 22 |
| SOR/95-352 | Sections 4, 14, 16, 22 |
| SOR/2004-28 | Sections 1 and 2 |
| SOR/2002-425 | Section 9 |

> Note: SOR/95-352 is a 1995 Statutory Instrument (likely related to the *Canada Labour Code* or similar employment regulation).  
> SOR/2007-86 is a 2007 Statutory Instrument, likely amending or replacing prior rules, possibly in the area of employment standards, workplace safety, or labor rights.

#### 3. **Interpretation of Repeal**
- The repeated citation of **SOR/2007-86, s. 206** suggests that this particular section was a focal point of reform or consolidation — possibly a rule that was deemed outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with new legislation.
- The repeal of **multiple sections** from SOR/95-352 (e.g., s. 4, 14, 16, 22) indicates that a significant portion of an older regulatory framework was replaced or modernized.
- The repeal of **SOR/2004-28, s.1 and s.2** and **SOR/2002-425, s.9** shows that earlier provisions were also removed, likely as part of a broader legislative update.

#### 4. **Contextual Background (Inferred)**
- These repeals likely occurred as part of a **regulatory modernization initiative** under the federal government.
- The focus on labor standards, employment, or workplace regulations is suggested by the nature of the instruments (e.g., SOR/95-352 relates to employment standards).
- The repeal of section 206 of SOR/2007-86 may have been due to:
  - Inconsistency with new employment standards
  - Obsolescence due to changes in labor laws
  - Overlap with other regulations
  - Policy shift or administrative streamlining

#### 5. **Significance**
- This list **does not contain any active regulation**.
- It serves as a **historical record** of how certain rules have been removed over time.
- It reflects the dynamic nature of regulatory frameworks — where outdated or ineffective provisions are periodically reviewed and removed.
