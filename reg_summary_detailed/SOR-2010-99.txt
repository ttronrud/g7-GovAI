### **4. Special Rules for Tax Calculation on Supplies After April 6, 2010 (but Before May 1, 2010)**

This section applies when a **taxable supply** (not zero-rated) is made to a **non-consumer** (e.g., a business) and the **consideration (payment)** becomes due or is paid **between April 6, 2010, and May 1, 2010**, and a **portion of that payment relates to services or periods after June 2010**.

#### 📌 General Rule:
- The **total tax** under subsection 165(2) of the Act is calculated at **10%** on the portion attributable to the period **after June 2010**.
- However, for **collection purposes**, the registrant **deems the tax to have been calculated at 8%**.
- The **difference** between the 10% total tax and the 8% "tax collectible" is **paid by the recipient** to the government.

> 🔍 This creates a **"tax adjustment"** mechanism to ensure compliance with the transition to the HST system.

#### ✅ Exceptions (Where the Rule Does Not Apply)

| Type of Supply | Exception Condition |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Transportation Services** | If the transportation is part of a **continuous journey** that began **before July 1, 2010** |
| **Freight Transportation** | If the **shipper transferred possession** to the first carrier **before July 1, 2010** |
| **Other Services** | If **all or substantially all** of the service was performed **before July 1, 2010** |

> These exceptions ensure that supplies fully completed before the transition date are not subject to retroactive HST adjustments.
