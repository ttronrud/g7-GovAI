The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2012-24, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2012-24*, specifically **Section 5** of that instrument.
- **Meaning of Repeal**: This means that the regulation in question no longer exists in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the enactment of SI 2012-24, which is a piece of secondary (or delegated) legislation introduced by a government department to amend or replace existing laws.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect as part of the provisions of SI 2012-24, which was issued in 2012. The exact date of coming into force would be specified in the instrument itself, but it is generally assumed to be the date of publication or the date stated in the SI.
- **No Content Provided**: The actual text or content of the original regulation is not included in your query, so no detailed explanation of its provisions, purpose, or scope can be given. The repeated entries suggest that the regulation may have been referenced multiple times in a document or list, but its substance is missing.

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, rules, or requirements previously derived from this regulation are now **no longer applicable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must refer to the current, valid legislation that replaces it (if any), or to other provisions that remain in force.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative reform, such as streamlining regulations, correcting errors, or aligning with updated policy objectives.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect** and has been **formally repealed** by **SI 2012-24, section 5**. Without the original text of the regulation, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or application cannot be provided. To understand the full context, one would need to consult the original regulation or the full text of SI 2012-24.
