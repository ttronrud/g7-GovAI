The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules Order (SOR) 2017-84**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. It no longer exists in force.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal became effective as part of **SOR/2017-84**, which was issued on **March 29, 2017**.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that order specifically revoked the regulation.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the regulation was outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or administrative policies. Repealing a regulation helps maintain a clear, current legal framework by removing obsolete or conflicting provisions.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest that this regulation may have been referenced multiple times in a document or database, but it has no active content or provisions remaining.
- SOR/2017-84 (Statutory Rules Order 2017-84) is a government document that amends or revokes various regulations under the authority of the federal government (typically in Canada, under the Department of Justice or a relevant ministry).
- Without the original text of the regulation being repealed, we cannot determine its prior scope or content. However, the fact that it was repealed under Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 implies it was a relatively minor or non-essential rule, possibly related to administrative procedures, licensing, or compliance.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in your query **has been formally repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. Its removal was part of a broader legislative update aimed at streamlining or modernizing the regulatory framework. There is no current legal authority or enforceable provision derived from this regulation.

If you need to know the **original content** of the repealed regulation, you would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the official government publication (e.g., the Canada Gazette or the legislation database) prior to SOR/2017-84.
