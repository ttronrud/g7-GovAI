Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, presented in clear, structured language for ease of understanding:

### **Detailed Summary of the Residential Detectors Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Health**.
- It is enacted under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, which empowers the Minister to establish standards and regulations for consumer products to ensure safety.
- This regulation specifically governs **residential fire detectors** and components of residential fire alarm systems.

#### **2. Compliance Requirements**
- **Residential Detectors**:  
  Any residential fire detector listed in **Column 1 of the regulatory table** must comply with the **standard specified in Column 2** of the table.  
  - This compliance is **absolute** — it takes precedence over any other applicable standards (even if those standards are more lenient or otherwise referenced in other regulations).
- **Components of Residential Fire Alarm Systems**:  
  Any component of a residential fire alarm system listed in **Column 1** of the table must also comply with the **standard in Column 2**, again **without regard to any other standard**.

> This means that manufacturers, importers, or distributors of these products must ensure their devices meet the specific, designated standard listed in the table — and cannot rely on alternative or less stringent standards.

#### **3. Language Requirements for Consumer Information**
- All **consumer-facing information** required by these regulations — including:
  - Labels on the product
  - Instructions provided to consumers (e.g., user manuals, installation guides)
- Must be provided in **both English and French**.
- This reflects Canada’s official languages policy and ensures accessibility for all Canadian consumers, regardless of language.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette* (the official publication of federal laws).
- This means they become legally enforceable immediately upon publication, without a specified delay.

#### **5. Repeal Clause**
- The regulation includes a **"Repeal" clause**, indicating that any previous regulations or provisions that were superseded by this one are no longer in force.
- This ensures that the current standard is the **most up-to-date and authoritative** for residential fire detectors and system components.

### **Key Implications and Purpose**
- **Public Safety Focus**: The regulation ensures that residential fire detectors and alarm system components meet minimum safety performance standards to protect lives and property.
- **Clarity and Enforcement**: By specifying a single, enforceable standard and eliminating reliance on other standards, the regulation reduces ambiguity and strengthens regulatory consistency.
- **Consumer Protection**: Mandatory bilingual labeling ensures that all Canadian households — especially in Francophone regions — can understand how to use and maintain these life-saving devices.

### **Conclusion**
The *Residential Detectors Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish clear, enforceable safety standards for residential fire detectors and their components in Canada. They require strict compliance with specified performance standards, mandate bilingual consumer information, and take effect upon registration. These measures are designed to enhance fire safety in homes and ensure that all Canadians have access to clear, accurate information about fire detection devices.
