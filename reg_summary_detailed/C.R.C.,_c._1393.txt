**Detailed Summary of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are formally titled:  
**"Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Regulations"**  
They are cited as such and serve as the administrative framework governing pension rights, contributions, service recognition, and benefits for members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

---

### **2. Definitions and Key Terms**

#### **Act**
- Refers to the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the pension scheme. All provisions in these regulations are interpreted in relation to this Act.

#### **a(f) Ultimate and a(f) and a(m) Ultimate Tables**
- These are specific mortality tables used in actuarial calculations to determine pension benefits.
- Source: *"Mortality of Annuitants 1900–1920"*, published by the Institute of Actuaries and The Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland (1924).
- Used to calculate life expectancy and pension payouts based on age and service history.

#### **Authorized Advisor**
- A person who is:
  - A member of the RCMP,
  - An employee of the federal public service, or
  - A person retained by the Minister for the purposes of the Act.
- These individuals may provide guidance or advice on pension-related matters under the Act.

#### **Commissioner**
- Defined as per subsection 2(1) of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act*.
- Refers to the head of the RCMP, responsible for administrative and operational leadership.

#### **Valuation Day**
- The date on which the *transfer value* (i.e., the amount owed or due under the pension scheme) is officially transferred from one account to another (e.g., from a service pension to a retirement fund).

#### **Full-Time Employee / Full-Time Member**
- **Full-time employee**: As defined in subsection 3(2) of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations* — someone employed for a full-time schedule (typically 35–40 hours per week).
- **Full-time member**: A member of the RCMP engaged in the normal number of hours of work per week for members of the Force.

#### **Part-Time Employee / Part-Time Member**
- **Part-time employee**: Defined under the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations* — someone employed for fewer than full-time hours.
- **Part-time member**: A member of the RCMP working on average **not fewer than** the number of hours set by subsection 5.2(1), but **not** a full-time member. This ensures minimum work expectations are met.

> **Note**: The definition of part-time hours is critical for determining pensionable service and contribution obligations.

---

### **3. Active Service (for pension eligibility)**
Under subsection 3(1) of the Act, "active service" includes:
1. Service in any component of the **naval, army, or air forces of Canada** while on active service, as placed by the Governor in Council under the *Militia Act*.
2. Service in other components of Her Majesty’s forces (excluding those specified in paragraph 1) while serving in a **theatre of war**.

> **Note**: This provision recognizes military service in wartime as qualifying for pension eligibility, even if not in the Canadian Forces.

---

### **4. Veterans’ Hospital**
- Refers to any facility where a person received **in-patient or out-patient treatment** authorized by:
  - Department of Veterans Affairs,
  - Department of Pensions and National Health,
  - Department of Soldiers’ Civil Re-establishment.
- This definition supports eligibility for certain benefits tied to military or veteran health services.

---

### **5. Service in the Force – Police Officer Definition**
- A "police officer" for pension purposes is defined as any person considered a police officer under **paragraph (b) of the definition of "public safety occupation"** in *subsection 8500(1) of the Income Tax Regulations*.
- This ensures consistency with broader federal definitions of public safety roles.

---

### **6. Designation of Members**
- Every member of the RCMP **not holding a rank above the Director General of Security and Intelligence** is automatically designated as a member of the Force for the purposes of **Part I of the Act**.
- This ensures broad coverage and inclusion in the pension scheme.

> **Note**: This clause was **repealed in 2012** (SOR/2012-124, s.3), so it no longer applies.

---

### **7. Period of Service Less Than 90 Days**
- A period of service under 90 days in a fiscal year **does not count** as pensionable service, **unless**:
  - It falls under clause 6(b)(ii)(A), (F), or section 24 of the Act.
  - The service **immediately precedes** the day the member becomes a contributor.
  - It is part of a **continuous period of service of at least 90 days** that spans two fiscal years.

> This prevents short-term or temporary assignments from being counted, but allows exceptions for transitional or qualifying service.

---

### **8. Age 71 and Contribution Relief**
- **Despite Section 5 of the Act**, a person who reaches **71 years of age after October 30, 1998** is **not required to contribute** to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Fund for any service after **December 31 of the year they turn 71**.
- **Consequence**: No further contributions are required after that date.

> This is a significant benefit for older members, allowing them to retire without contributing further.

---

### **9. Pensionable Service After Ceasing Contributions**
- **Despite Section 6 of the Act**, a person **cannot count any service after they cease to be required to contribute** as pensionable service.
- They also **cannot elect to count** such service as pensionable after that date.

> This prevents retroactive or post-contribution service from being included in pension calculations.

---

### **10. Retirement Month and Year (Adaptation of Paragraph 39(3)(a))**
- For a recipient (except those specified in paragraph (b)):
  - **Retirement month** = the month in which the person **ceases to be required to contribute**.
  - **Retirement year** = the year in which that month occurs.

> This aligns retirement timing directly with the end of contribution obligations.

---

### **11. Weekly Hours for Full-Time Service**
- For the purposes of the Act:
  - **Full-time member**: 12 hours per week (as per subsection 5(6)).
  - **Part-time member**: Hours are determined under the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations*, specifically subsection 3(2).

> This establishes a standard for full-time work (12 hours/week) and allows flexibility for part-time roles.

---

### **12. Weekly Average Hours for Part-Time Members**
The weekly average hours for a part-time member are calculated as follows:

| Scenario | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Same hours every week | Total weekly hours |
| Regular work cycle | Total assigned hours during cycle ÷ number of weeks in cycle |
| No regular cycle | Total assigned hours during a **13-week period** ÷ 13 |

> This ensures fair treatment of part-time members with variable schedules.

---

### **13. Pay for Part-Time Members**
- The **pay** of a part-time member is determined based on the **weekly average of hours worked**.
- This ensures that pension benefits reflect actual earnings, not just full-time equivalents.

---

### **14. Election to Count Part-Time Service as Pensionable (Subsection 8(3))**
A contributor who has been a part-time member or employee may:
- Elect to **pay contributions** for any part of a period during which they were part-time.
- Starting with the **most recent part** of service, they can count that time as pensionable.

> This allows flexibility for members who transitioned from part-time to full-time status.

---

### **15. Adjustments for Specific Election Clauses (6(b)(ii)(C), (D), (E), (G))**
If a contributor makes an election under these clauses:
- The amount they would have been required to contribute **if they had been full-time** during that period is calculated.
- The amount is **adjusted** to reflect what they would have paid had they been full-time.
- This includes interest on the unpaid amount.

> This compensates part-time members for lost contribution opportunities.

---

### **16. Adjustment for Full-Time Equivalent Pay (Clause 6(b)(ii)(N))**
For contributors making an election under clause 6(b)(ii)(N):
- The amount to be paid is based on:
  - Pay **if the person had been a full-time member** on the day of the election.
  - If working in multiple positions, pay is determined under **section 5.92** (which handles concurrent positions).
- The calculation uses:
  - Weekly average hours worked
  - Full-time hours (standard)

> This ensures fair treatment when part-time members are working across multiple roles.

---

### **17. Election under Clause 6(b)(ii)(K) – Interest and Pay Calculation**
- For contributors who made an election under clause 6(b)(ii)(K) and were part-time during service:
  - The amount is calculated as if they had been full-time.
  - If part-time, the pay is what would have been authorized for a full-time member.
  - Includes interest on the unpaid amount.

> This provides a
