### **Detailed Summary of the Information Processing Activities (Banks and Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Bank Act**:

- **Subsection 410(3)a** – Applies to domestic banks.
- **Subsection 539(3)b** – Applies to authorized foreign banks.

The regulations are part of **Statutes of Canada, 2001, Chapter 9 (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**, specifically:
- **Section 100(2)** and **Section 139(3)** of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* (FCACA), which enabled the amendment of the Bank Act to modernize information processing rules.

These regulations came into force on **October 24, 2001**, when the relevant provisions of the Bank Act (paragraphs 410(3)(a)–(c) and 539(3)(a)–(c)) were enacted under the FCACA.

#### **2. Definitions**

Key definitions used throughout the regulations:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing banking operations in Canada.
- **Information Processing Activity (IPA)**:
  - For a **bank**: Any activity listed in **subparagraphs 410(1)(c)(i) to (iv)** of the Bank Act.
  - For an **authorized foreign bank**: Any activity listed in **subparagraphs 539(1)(b.1)(i) to (iv)** of the Bank Act.
  - These generally involve processing financial data such as transactions, account postings, payments, and reporting.

- **Specified Circumstances**:
  An IPA is considered to fall under "specified circumstances" if **any one** of the following applies:
  1. The IPA is related to **generating, recording, or reporting on postings to accounts**.
  2. The IPA was **first carried out by the bank for internal use** and is an **integral part of its banking operations**.
  3. The IPA involves **payments from and deposits to accounts** and was carried out by the bank **before December 1, 1980**.

These "specified circumstances" are critical because they determine when a bank or foreign bank is **exempt from requiring prior written approval** from the Minister of Finance.

#### **3. Exemptions from Ministerial Approval**

A bank or authorized foreign bank is **exempt from obtaining prior written approval** from the Minister for certain information processing activities **if** the activity falls under one of the following categories and conditions:
