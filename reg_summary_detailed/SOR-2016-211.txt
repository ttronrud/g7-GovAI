### **Detailed Summary of the Emergency Order for the Protection of the Western Chorus Frog (Great Lakes / St. Lawrence — Canadian Shield Population)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

This **Emergency Order** was issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically:

- **Section 80** of SARA: Authorizes the Minister of the Environment to designate critical habitat for species at risk.
- **Subsection 97(2)** of SARA: Enables the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister) to issue emergency orders to protect species at risk when they face imminent threats to recovery.

The primary purpose of this order is to **protect the Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata)** — specifically the **Great Lakes / St. Lawrence — Canadian Shield population** — from activities that could further endanger its survival and recovery.

The Minister of the Environment has determined that this population faces **imminent threats**, necessitating immediate protective measures.

#### **2. Designated Critical Habitat**

The Order identifies specific **land parcels** in the **province of Quebec**, within the **Laprairie registration division**, as **critical habitat** necessary for the recovery of the Western Chorus Frog.

These areas are legally defined as **habitat essential for the species' survival**, in accordance with **paragraph 80(4)(c)** of SARA.

The critical habitat includes:

- A total of **69 individual lots** (with specific lot numbers listed in the schedule).
- Additionally, two **specific parcels** (Parcel 1 and Parcel 2) within those lots are described in detail by precise **boundaries and directions**.

> **Key Lot Examples:**
> - Lot 1,914,106  
> - Lot 1,914,411  
> - Lot 2,095,404  
> - Lot 2,268,355  
> - Lot 2,863,808 to 2,863,811  
> - Lot 3,381,764  
> - Lot 3,446,835  
> - Lot 3,907,045 to 3,967,066  
> - Lot 4,110,197 to 4,110,199  
> - Lot 4,541,898  
> - Lot 4,779,821  
> - Lot 4,802,030 to 4,802,083  
> - Lot 5,221,618 to 5,221,649  
> - Lot 5,233,110  
> - Lot 5,246,329 to 5,246,333  
> - Lot 5,491,534 to 5,491,541  
> - Lot 5,491,747  
> - Lot 5,495,139 to 5,495,140  
> - Lot 5,596,744  
> - Lot 5,615,311 to 5,615,312  
> - Lot 5,788,699  
> - Lot 5,798,686

> **Parcel Descriptions:**
> - **Parcel 1**: A portion of **Lot 4,802,622**, bounded by multiple adjacent lots and measured in specific directions and distances (e.g., 22.54 m at 56°53′12″). Area: **5,502.6 m²**.
> - **Parcel 2**: A portion of **Lot 1,914,130**, bounded by directional measurements from the west corner of Lot 4,802,622.

These parcels represent **critical habitat** due to their ecological significance — likely including breeding ponds, moist forest understories, and connectivity for frog movement.

#### **3. Prohibited Activities in the Designated Areas**

Within the designated critical habitat, the following activities are **strictly prohibited**:

| Prohibited Activity | Explanation |
|--------------------|-----------|
| **Remove, compact, or plow soil** | Prevents soil disturbance that can degrade breeding sites and alter microhabitats. |
| **Remove, prune, damage, destroy, or introduce vegetation** (trees, shrubs, plants) | Protects plant cover essential for shelter, moisture retention, and food sources. |
| **Drain or flood the ground** | Maintains natural hydrology critical for frog breeding and survival. |
| **Alter surface water** (flow rate, volume, direction) | Preserves natural water dynamics needed for breeding and larval development. |
| **Install or construct infrastructure** (roads, buildings, etc.) | Prevents physical barriers and habitat fragmentation. |
| **Perform maintenance on infrastructure** | Even routine work is restricted to avoid cumulative impacts. |
| **Operate motor vehicles, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), or snowmobiles** | Except on **roads or paved paths** — to reduce noise, vibration, and habitat disruption. |
| **Install or construct barriers** that impede frog movement, dispersal, or migration | Prevents fragmentation of populations and isolation of breeding sites. |
| **Deposit, discharge, dump, or immerse any material** (snow, gravel, sand, soil, greywater, pool water) | Avoids pollution and soil contamination that harms frogs and their environment. |
| **Use or apply pest control products or fertilizers** | Prevents chemical exposure that can poison frogs, larvae, or their food sources. |

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> The prohibitions **do not apply** to activities related to **public safety or health** that are **authorized under provincial law** (e.g., emergency response, firefighting, medical services).

#### **4. Legal Consequences of Violation**

- Any **contravention of the prohibitions** (specifically subsection 2(1) of the Order) is considered an **offence** under **section 97 of the Species at Risk Act**.
- Violators may face **legal penalties**, including fines and/or prosecution, to enforce compliance with the Order.

---

#### **5. Effective Date and Legal Status**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (not published in the Canada Gazette).
- For the purposes of the **Statutory Instruments Act**, the Order applies **immediately upon issuance**, before publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

> 🔁 **Note**: This Order **replaces or repeals any previous conflicting regulations** related to the Western Chorus Frog in the specified area.

---

#### **6. Ecological and Conservation Significance**

The Western Chorus Frog is a **species at risk** in Canada, and this population in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Canadian Shield region is particularly vulnerable due to:

- Habitat loss from land development
- Climate change affecting moisture and temperature
- Pesticide and fertilizer runoff
- Fragmentation of wetlands and forested areas
- Invasive species and predation

By protecting this critical habitat, the Order aims to:

- Preserve breeding sites and moist microhabitats
- Maintain connectivity between populations
- Support population recovery through natural processes
- Ensure long-term survival of the species

### ✅ Conclusion

This Emergency Order is a **critical conservation tool** designed to halt immediate threats to the Western Chorus Frog population in a key region of Quebec. By legally restricting human activities in specific, ecologically sensitive areas, it provides a strong legal framework to protect the frog’s habitat, preserve natural processes, and support long-term recovery. It reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation under the Species at Risk Act and underscores the importance of protecting vulnerable species in the face of environmental threats.

This Order serves as both a **protection measure** and a **foundation for future recovery planning** for the Western Chorus Frog.
