**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Specifying the Minimum Amount of Grain to Be Moved  

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 116.2(2)a of the Canada Transportation Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) to establish minimum transportation obligations for certain railways, particularly in the context of ensuring the efficient movement of agricultural commodities—specifically grain.

**Issuing Body:**  
- **Governor General in Council** (on the recommendation of):  
  - The **Minister of Transport**  
  - The **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**

**Regulatory Reference:**  
- **S.C. 2014, c. 8, s. 6** (Statutory Citation for the 2014 enactment)  
- **S.C. 1996, c. 10** (Reference to prior statutory framework or related provisions)

**Scope and Objective:**  
The purpose of this Order is to establish a **minimum weekly volume of grain transportation** that must be carried out by two of Canada’s largest rail carriers during a defined period. The objective is to support the agricultural economy by ensuring reliable and sufficient grain transport capacity during a critical time—specifically, a key harvest and export season.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Applicable Entities:**  
   - The **Canadian National Railway Company (CN)**  
   - The **Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP)**  

2. **Time Period:**  
   - Begins: **August 3, 2014**  
   - Ends: **November 29, 2014**  
   - Total duration: Approximately 10 weeks (from mid-August to late November)

3. **Minimum Grain Volume Requirement:**  
   - Each railway company must move **at least 536,250 metric tonnes (t) of grain per week** during the specified period.  
   - This is a **weekly minimum**, not a total volume over the entire period.

4. **Definition of a Week:**  
   - A "week" is defined as beginning on a **Sunday** and ending on the following **Saturday**.  
   - This standardization ensures consistency in measuring and monitoring compliance across the period.

5. **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
   - The obligation applies directly to the **movement of grain**, which is a key agricultural commodity.  
   - The regulation is enforceable under the Canada Transportation Act, which gives regulatory authority to ensure that critical transportation services are maintained, especially when they support national food supply chains and agricultural markets.

6. **Effective Date:**  
   - The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).  
   - This ensures that the obligation begins immediately upon legal recognition.

**Context and Rationale:**  
- The regulation was likely introduced during a period of significant grain production and export demand in Canada, particularly in the Prairie provinces (e.g., Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba).  
- By setting a minimum volume, the government aims to:
  - Prevent rail capacity shortages during peak harvest seasons.
  - Ensure that farmers and agri-businesses have reliable access to transportation infrastructure.
  - Maintain national food security and support the competitiveness of Canadian agriculture in international markets.

**Limitations and Considerations:**  
- The regulation does not specify the types of grain (e.g., wheat, barley, canola) or the exact routes, though grain movement is generally understood to include major agricultural commodities.
- It does not mandate the *source* or *destination* of the grain, only the *volume* and *transportation obligation*.
- The requirement is binding on the two major rail companies, and failure to meet the weekly minimum could lead to regulatory or financial consequences, though specific penalties are not detailed in this summary.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a targeted, short-term regulatory measure designed to ensure the reliable movement of grain across Canada during a critical agricultural season. By setting a clear, measurable weekly minimum of 536,250 tonnes for CN and CP, the federal government reinforces the role of railways in supporting the agricultural sector, particularly in times of high demand. It reflects a collaborative approach between transport and agriculture ministries to balance infrastructure needs with economic productivity.

**Note:** This regulation is not a permanent or ongoing policy but a specific, time-bound measure tied to seasonal agricultural needs.
