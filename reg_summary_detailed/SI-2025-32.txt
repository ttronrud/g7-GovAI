### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Transfer of Authority**  
   The powers, duties, and functions previously exercised by the Minister of State (Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario) are **transferred to the Minister of Industry**.  
   This includes all responsibilities associated with the oversight, management, and policy direction of FEDAO.

2. **Legal Basis**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.  
   This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign ministerial responsibilities within the federal government to improve efficiency, accountability, or policy coherence.

3. **Agency Involved**  
   The **Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FEDAO)** is a federal agency established to promote economic development in Southern Ontario. It supports small and medium-sized enterprises, provides funding, and facilitates business growth in the region.

4. **Purpose of the Transfer**  
   The transfer aims to:
   - Align FEDAO’s responsibilities more closely with broader economic development priorities under the **Ministry of Industry**.
   - Improve coordination between economic development initiatives and industrial policy.
   - Streamline decision-making by placing FEDAO’s oversight under a ministry with a broader mandate for industrial and economic growth.

5. **Effect of the Transfer**  
   - The **Minister of Industry** now assumes full responsibility for:
     - Policy development related to FEDAO.
     - Approving funding and programs administered by FEDAO.
     - Oversight of FEDAO’s operations and performance.
     - Reporting on FEDAO’s activities to Parliament and the government.
   - The former Minister of State (FEDAO) no longer exercises any direct authority over FEDAO’s operations.

6. **No Change to the Agency**  
   The structure, operations, and mandate of FEDAO remain unchanged. The transfer only affects the **ministerial oversight** and accountability of the agency.

7. **Legal Framework**  
   The regulation is cited as **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** and is incorporated into the *Regulations of the Public Service* under *R.S., c. P-34*, which govern the administrative structure and responsibilities of federal departments and ministers.

### **Implications**

- **Administrative Efficiency:** By placing FEDAO under the Minister of Industry, the government enhances alignment between regional economic development and national industrial policy.
- **Accountability:** The Minister of Industry is now directly accountable to Parliament for FEDAO’s performance and outcomes.
- **Policy Integration:** Economic development initiatives in Southern Ontario are now better integrated into the federal government’s industrial strategy.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a strategic reallocation of ministerial responsibilities within the federal government. It transfers the oversight of the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario from a Minister of State to the Minister of Industry, enhancing policy coherence and administrative efficiency. The agency itself remains operational, but its governance and strategic direction are now under the purview of the Ministry of Industry.

This change reflects a broader trend in federal governance to consolidate responsibilities under ministries with more comprehensive mandates, particularly in economic development and industrial policy.
