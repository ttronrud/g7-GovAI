**Detailed Summary of the CRTC Tariff Regulations (Effective 20 July 1979, with Certain Provisions Effective 1 July 1980)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued these regulations under:
- **Section 17** of the *Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act*, which empowers the CRTC to rescind outdated tariff rules.
- **Subsection 14(2)** and specific sections of the *Railway Act* (sections 270, 320(3), 320(6), and 321(5)), which authorize the creation of new tariff standards for telecommunications companies.

These regulations replace **Tariff Circular 3 (1959)** and establish modern, transparent, and standardized requirements for how telecommunications companies in Canada must construct, file, and publish their tariffs.

The primary objectives are:
- To ensure **clarity, consistency, and accessibility** of tariff information.
- To promote **public accountability and transparency** in pricing and service terms.
- To support **regulatory oversight** by the CRTC and enable fair competition and consumer protection.
