*Certain Unauthorized Payments in Respect of Travel Expenses and Other Expenses, Allowances and Benefits (Canadian Forces) Remission Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a formal **remission (forgiveness or reimbursement)** of unauthorized payments made to members of the Canadian Forces (CF) for various travel, separation, and personal expenses during specific time periods. The remission is granted because the collection of these debts was deemed **unreasonable and unjust**, particularly given that the payments were not properly authorized under applicable instructions or policy.

The goal is to **rectify past financial errors**, restore fairness to affected beneficiaries, and ensure compliance with financial administration principles, while also acknowledging that some payments were made in error or outside of established authority.
