**Detailed Summary of the NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence (CCASCOE) Rights, Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **sections 4a and 5a of the *Privileges and Immunities (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) Act*** (S.C. 2023, c. 26, s. 266; R.S., c. P-24).  
This means that the Order is formally enacted by the federal government of Canada to grant specific rights, privileges, and immunities to the **NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence (CCASCOE)**, in accordance with international treaty obligations and Canadian law.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Recognize and legally establish the **legal capacity of the CCASCOE as a corporation**.
- Grant it the **necessary privileges and immunities** to carry out its mission effectively.
- Provide **protection for international personnel** and related institutions under international agreements, particularly those related to NATO and climate-security cooperation.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
- **CCASCOE (NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence):**  
  Refers to the specialized center established under NATO to address the intersection of climate change and security issues. It is a multinational initiative focused on enhancing understanding, preparedness, and policy development related to climate-related security threats.

- **International Personnel:**  
  Personnel assigned to the CCASCOE by **NATO member states other than Canada**. This excludes Canadian personnel who are not directly assigned by Canada.

---

### **4. Legal Capacity of the CCASCOE**
The CCASCOE is granted **corporate legal capacity**, meaning it can:
- Enter into contracts,
- Hold property,
- Sue and be sued in its own name,
- Conduct legal and administrative activities as a distinct entity.

This corporate status enables the CCASCOE to function independently and efficiently in international and domestic operations.

---

### **5. Privileges and Immunities of the CCASCOE**
The CCASCOE is granted privileges and immunities **to the extent required to perform its functions**, as specified in:
- **Articles 8 and 12 of the Paris Protocol** (the *Protocol on the Status of the Centre of Excellence in the Field of Climate Change and Security*, 2021, formally known as the Paris Protocol).

These include:
- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., lawsuits) in Canada, when necessary to conduct its mission.
- **Freedom from taxation or duties** on income, property, or operations related to its functions.
- **Freedom from interference** in its operations by Canadian authorities.
- **Immunity of its property and assets** from seizure or attachment.

> *Note:* These privileges are not absolute and are limited to what is strictly necessary for the CCASCOE to fulfill its mandate in the field of climate change and security.

---

### **6. Inviolability of Archives and Documents**
In accordance with **Article 13 of the Paris Protocol**, the **archives, records, and official documents** of the CCASCOE are:
- Protected from seizure, inspection, or disclosure.
- Inviolable by Canadian authorities, including law enforcement or courts.

This ensures that sensitive operational, research, and policy data can be preserved and accessed without fear of unauthorized access or interference.

---

### **7. Privileges and Immunities of International Personnel**
International personnel (non-Canadian staff assigned by other NATO members) are granted the following:
- **Privileges and immunities as set out in paragraph 1 of Article 7 of the Paris Protocol**, which typically includes:
  - Immunity from criminal and civil jurisdiction in Canada.
  - Protection from arrest or detention.
  - Freedom from taxation (in relation to their duties and income).
- **Additional immunities under Article 8 of the Paris Protocol**, specifically **paragraphs 5 to 10 of Article XI of the London Agreement of 1951** (the *Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces*). These include:
  - Immunity from taxation.
  - Immunity from arrest or detention.
  - Protection from interference in their official duties.
  - Exemption from certain laws and regulations that would otherwise apply to foreign military personnel.

> These protections are only applied **to the extent required to perform their functions** — meaning they are not absolute and are subject to reasonable limits.

---

### **8. Extended Privileges for Certain Military Personnel**
Personnel of:
- **Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE)** or
- **Allied Headquarters**, as defined in Articles 1(b) and (c) of the Paris Protocol,
- Or other **international military headquarters or organizations established under the North Atlantic Treaty**

are also granted the **same privileges and immunities** as described above, **to the extent required** for their functions.

This ensures consistency in legal treatment across NATO structures, including those related to military and security operations.

---

### **9. Application of Canadian Laws**
- **Article 6 of the Paris Protocol** applies to all **indemnity claims** (i.e., claims for damages or compensation) made by or against the CCASCOE or its personnel in Canada.  
  This means that the CCASCOE and its personnel are **not liable for indemnity claims** arising from their official duties, unless otherwise agreed or required by law.

- **Sections 15, 17, and 19 of the *Visiting Forces Act*** apply to the CCASCOE, with **any necessary adaptations** to reflect its nature as a climate-security center rather than a traditional military installation.  
  These sections typically cover:
  - The rights of foreign forces to enter and operate in Canada.
  - Protection from interference with their activities.
  - Exemption from certain taxes and regulations.
  - Procedures for entry, exit, and supervision.

> The adaptation ensures that the CCASCOE can operate smoothly within Canada’s legal framework while respecting its international status.

---

### **10. Limitations and Exclusions**
- **No exemption from Canadian taxes** applies to **Canadian citizens**, whether they reside in Canada or are ordinarily resident there.  
  This means that **Canadian nationals** are **fully liable** for all taxes and duties imposed by Canadian law — including income, property, and other taxes — regardless of their involvement with the CCASCOE.

> This is a critical safeguard to ensure that Canadian citizens remain subject to domestic tax obligations, unlike international personnel or the CCASCOE itself.

---

### **11. Effective Date**
The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada.  
This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal publication and recognition in the Canadian legal system.

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a significant step in recognizing the **strategic importance of climate change in national and international security**. By granting the CCASCOE and its international personnel appropriate legal protections and immunities, Canada affirms its commitment to multilateral cooperation, supports NATO’s mission, and enables the development of effective climate-security policies. However, the provisions are carefully balanced — ensuring that Canadian citizens remain subject to domestic tax laws and that protections are limited to what is necessary for operational effectiveness.

This Order reflects Canada’s evolving role in global environmental and security governance.
