### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972* of Saskatchewan (Loi). This foundational legislation establishes the legal framework for hog marketing in the province.

- **Assembly Yard**: A designated premises where producers can deliver their hogs for temporary holding, processing, or distribution before slaughter. These serve as central hubs in the hog supply chain.

- **Assembly Yard Operator**: The individual or entity (owner or operator) responsible for managing an assembly yard. This includes those who manage operations, storage, and distribution of hogs.

- **Commission**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission*, established under the Natural Products Marketing Act and operating according to the *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*. The Commission is responsible for overseeing compliance, ensuring transparency, and regulating hog marketing practices.

- **Hog**: Any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced within Saskatchewan. This includes all stages of the pig from birth to slaughter.

- **Plan**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the rules, objectives, and mechanisms for managing hog marketing, including pricing, quotas, and market access.

- **Processor**: Any individual or business engaged in the processing of hogs (e.g., slaughter, rendering, or manufacturing using hogs). This includes those involved in transforming hogs into meat products or other by-products.

- **Producer**: A broad category that includes:
  - Persons directly involved in producing or feeding hogs and making them available for slaughter;
  - Employers of such persons;
  - Individuals who have a contractual right (e.g., via lease or agreement) to a share of hogs produced by another;
  - Individuals who take possession of hogs as security for a debt (e.g., in a loan agreement).

- **Small Processor**: A processor that, in the prior calendar year, processed **less than 2% of all hogs slaughtered in Saskatchewan**, as reported by the **Department of Agriculture of Canada**. This classification is used to identify smaller operations that may have different reporting obligations than larger processors.

- The **marketing of hogs** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada);
- Persons and property located **within the Province of Saskatchewan**.

### **4. Recordkeeping and Reporting Obligations**

#### **General Requirement for All Hog Marketing Participants**
Every person engaged in the marketing of hogs must:
- **Keep complete and accurate books and records** of all marketing activities related to hogs (e.g., sales, purchases, quantities, prices, dates, and parties involved);
- **Retain these records for at least three years** from the date of the transaction.

#### **Inspection and Access Rights**
- Any **member or authorized representative of the Commission** may:
  - **Request** the production of books and records;

#### **Duty to Permit Inspection**

Every **small processor** must submit a **weekly statement** to the Commission containing the following information:

   - Name, address, and **farm registration number** of every producer from whom the processor purchased hogs.

2. **Producer or Consumer Information (for custom processing)**:
   - Name, address, and (where applicable) farm registration number of:

3. **Hog Details**:

4. **Pricing Information**:

Every operator of an **assembly yard who conducts auctions of sows** must submit a **weekly statement** indicating:
- The **number of sows sold** at each auction.
