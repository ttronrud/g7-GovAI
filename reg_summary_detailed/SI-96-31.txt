Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulation Summary:**

Title: Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Pension Advice Section

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision empowers the federal government to reorganize the public service by transferring control and supervision of certain departments or sections between different government departments or agencies.

**Subject of the Transfer:**  
The **Pension Advice Section** within the **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)**.

**Scope of the Transfer:**  
The control and supervision of the Pension Advice Section are being transferred from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to the **Department of National Revenue (DNR)**.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 1996**.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
This regulatory action reflects a strategic reallocation of responsibilities within the Canadian public service to improve administrative efficiency, ensure consistency in pension-related policy implementation, and align the functions of the Pension Advice Section with the broader mandate of the Department of National Revenue. 

The Pension Advice Section is responsible for providing guidance and advice on pension-related matters, including the administration and interpretation of pension regulations, compliance with pension laws, and support to financial institutions and individuals regarding pension plans. By transferring this function to the Department of National Revenue, the government likely aimed to strengthen the coordination of tax and retirement policy, as pension advice often intersects with income tax and retirement income regulations — areas within the core jurisdiction of the DNR.

**Key Observations:**  
- This is a functional transfer, not a reorganization of personnel or a change in legal status.  
- The transfer involves only control and supervision, not the physical relocation or reassignment of staff (unless otherwise specified).  
- The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) continues to oversee financial institutions, but the specific advisory function related to pensions is now under the jurisdiction of the DNR.  
- The move underscores a broader trend in federal government restructuring to consolidate expertise in areas where financial, tax, and retirement policy overlap.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally transfers the administrative oversight and supervisory authority of the Pension Advice Section from OSFI to the Department of National Revenue, effective April 1, 1996, under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The change is intended to enhance coordination between pension policy and tax administration, ensuring a more cohesive and effective public service response to retirement-related financial matters.
