### **6. Divisional Applications**

#### **When Can a Divisional Application Be Filed?**
A divisional application may be filed **only if**:
- The design in question was **disclosed in the original application** on:
  - The **filing date** (for non-divisional original applications), or
  - The **date the original application was received** (for divisional original applications), and
  - In the **earliest original application in the series**, on its **filing date**.

> ✅ This ensures that no new design is introduced after the original filing.

#### **Mandatory Statement**
- The application **must contain a statement** identifying the corresponding original application.
- This statement must be submitted **within three months** of the date the Minister receives the divisional application.

#### **Separate Application Status**
- A divisional application is a **separate application**:
  - With its own **filing date**
  - With its own **fee structure**
  - With its own **examination and registration process**

#### **Filing Deadline**
- Must be filed **within two years** of:
  - The filing date of the original application (if not a divisional application), or

#### **Exception: Re-filing After Objection**
- If:
  1. The Minister sends a **refusal report** under subsection 22(2) stating the original application fails to meet the requirements;
  2. The applicant **amends the original application** to remove the design in question;
  3. The divisional application is filed **within six months of the amendment**,
- Then the divisional application is **not subject to the two-year rule**.

> ⚠️ This exception applies **only to non-Hague applications** and **does not apply to Hague applications or divisionals from them**.
