**Detailed Summary of the Permits Authorizing an Activity Affecting Listed Wildlife Species Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

These regulations are issued under **subsection 73(10)a and (11)c of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, a federal Canadian law designed to protect wildlife species at risk and their critical habitats. The regulations were developed following consultations between the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, as required by subsection 73(10)a of SARA.

- **Enactment Date**: June 17, 2013  
- **Legal Citation**:  
  - S.C. 2005, c. 2, s. 23  
  - S.C. 2002, c. 29  
  - S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 163(3)  

These provisions establish the procedural framework for issuing permits that allow certain activities to proceed in areas where listed wildlife species, their critical habitats, or individual residences are present.

---

### **Key Provisions and Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that any activity impacting a **listed wildlife species**, its **critical habitat**, or the **residences of its individuals** undergoes a rigorous assessment to determine whether it can proceed without undue harm to the species' survival.

This is achieved through a structured permitting process that emphasizes **scientific evaluation**, **impact minimization**, and **environmental accountability**.

### **1. Application Requirements**

Any individual or entity seeking a permit under **Section 73 of SARA** must submit a formal application to the **competent minister** (typically the Minister of the Environment, or a designated agency).

#### Required Elements of the Application:
The application must include the following information:

1. **Demonstration of Applicability of SARA Paragraphs 73(2)(a) to (c)**  
   - The applicant must show that one or more of the following conditions applies to the proposed activity:
     - (a) The activity may result in the **destruction, degradation, or disturbance** of the species’ critical habitat.
     - (b) The activity may **directly or indirectly harm** the species.
     - (c) The activity may **interfere with the species’ reproduction, migration, or survival**.

2. **Consideration of Reasonable Alternatives**  
   - The applicant must demonstrate that all **reasonable alternatives** to the proposed activity have been evaluated.
   - The applicant must show that the **best available solution** has been adopted to reduce harm to the species.

3. **Mitigation Measures**  
   - The applicant must provide evidence that **all feasible measures** will be implemented to minimize the impact of the activity on:
     - The species itself,
     - Its critical habitat, and
     - The residences of its individuals.

4. **Description of Potential Impacts**  
   - A detailed description of:
     - The **changes** the activity may cause to the species, its habitat, or residences,
     - The **possible effects** of those changes,
     - And the **significance** of those effects (e.g., whether impacts are likely to be severe, irreversible, or cumulative).

> These requirements ensure that permit applications are not only technically complete but also grounded in ecological science and environmental responsibility.

### **2. Ministerial Process and Timelines**

#### **Notification of Receipt**
- Upon receiving a complete application, the **competent minister must notify the applicant in writing** confirming receipt.

#### **Decision Timeline (Standard Case)**
- Under normal circumstances, the minister must either:
  - **Issue a permit**, or  
  - **Refuse the permit**,  
  within **90 days** of receiving the application.

> This 90-day period is a strict deadline designed to promote timely decision-making while allowing for thorough review.

#### **Suspension of the 90-Day Deadline**
The 90-day timeline is **suspended** if the application is **incomplete or lacks sufficient information**.

- The suspension begins on the day the minister sends a written notice stating that the information provided is **insufficient** to make a decision.
- It ends on the day the minister receives **all missing information**.

> This allows for a fair and transparent process where applicants are given an opportunity to correct deficiencies without facing penalties for incomplete submissions.

---

### **3. Exceptions to the 90-Day Deadline**

The 90-day timeline does **not apply** in the following circumstances:

1. **Additional Consultations Required**  
   - If further consultations are needed, especially those required under **subsections 73(4) and (5)** of SARA (e.g., with Indigenous communities, scientific experts, or other stakeholders).

2. **Legislative or Treaty Obligations**  
   - If another **Act of Parliament** (other than SARA) or a **land claims agreement** requires that a decision be made prior to issuing or refusing a permit.

3. **Failure to Meet Prior Permit Conditions**  
   - If the applicant has previously received a permit under Section 73, but has **not met the terms and conditions** of that permit.

4. **Request or Agreement to Extend the Timeline**  
   - If the applicant **requests or agrees in writing** that the 90-day deadline does not apply.

5. **Modification of the Activity**  
   - If the nature or scope of the activity described in the original application is **changed before a final decision is made**.

> These exceptions recognize that environmental decisions often involve complex, dynamic, or legally sensitive situations that require additional time or input.

---

### **4. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in these regulations, the underlying framework of SARA implies that:
- Permits are **conditional** and subject to compliance.
- Failure to adhere to the conditions of a permit may result in enforcement actions, including permit revocation or penalties.
- The minister retains authority to **monitor and enforce** compliance with the conditions of any issued permit.

---

### **5. Regulatory Effectiveness and Enforcement**

- These regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- They provide a **clear, standardized process** for assessing and approving activities that may affect species at risk.
- The regulations promote **transparency, accountability, and environmental protection** by requiring detailed impact assessments and mitigation plans.

### **Summary of Key Principles**

| Principle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Precautionary Approach** | Requires evaluation of all reasonable alternatives and potential impacts before approval. |
| **Scientific Rigor** | Demands detailed, evidence-based information on impacts and mitigation. |
| **Timely Decision-Making** | A 90-day deadline ensures efficiency, with exceptions for valid delays. |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Encourages consultations, especially under SARA subsections 73(4) and (5). |
| **Legal Accountability** | Ensures decisions are legally sound and consistent with federal environmental law. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Permits Authorizing an Activity Affecting Listed Wildlife Species Regulations* establish a robust, transparent, and science-based permitting system under the *Species at Risk Act*. By requiring comprehensive impact assessments, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation strategies, the regulations aim to balance economic development with the conservation of biodiversity. The inclusion of time extensions and consultation provisions ensures flexibility without compromising environmental protection.

These regulations are a critical tool in Canada’s national strategy to prevent the extinction of at-risk species and to ensure that human activities do not undermine the long-term survival of Canada’s natural heritage.
