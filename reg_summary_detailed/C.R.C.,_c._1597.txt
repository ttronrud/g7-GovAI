**Detailed Summary of the *Visiting Forces Attachment and Serving Together Regulations***

---

### **Regulation Title**  
*Visiting Forces Attachment and Serving Together Regulations*  
These Regulations may be cited as the **Visiting Forces Attachment and Serving Together Regulations**.

---

### **Applicable Legal Framework**  
- The Regulations are made under the authority of the **Visiting Forces Act (the "Act")**, specifically **Part VI** of that Act.  
- The term "**Act**" in these Regulations refers to the *Visiting Forces Act*, and all references to "Part VI" pertain to the provisions governing the temporary attachment of members of foreign armed forces to the Canadian Forces and vice versa.

---

### **Core Purpose of the Regulations**  
To establish the legal framework for the **temporary attachment of members of the Canadian Forces to foreign armed forces** and the **reciprocal attachment of foreign military personnel to the Canadian Forces**, ensuring that such attachments are governed by clear rules of service, duty, and rights—while respecting the sovereignty and operational needs of both parties.

Additionally, the Regulations define when two armed forces are considered to be **"serving together"**, which has implications for jurisdiction, command, and legal treatment under Canadian law.

## **Key Provisions – Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Canadian Forces Members Attached to Foreign Armed Forces**

Every member of the **Canadian Forces** (CF) shall, **unless otherwise directed by the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)**, be placed at the disposal of the **service authorities** of any country where **Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act has been declared applicable**.

This means that Canadian military personnel may be temporarily attached to a foreign armed force under the following conditions:

- On the **staff of or attending** a school or training unit of that foreign force.
- On the **staff of or as a patient in** a hospital or convalescent establishment operated by that foreign force.
- **Appointed to or detailed for duty** in:
  - A ship, vessel, formation, unit, detachment, or establishment.
  - Or in **transit** or **awaiting passage** in any ship, vessel, or other conveyance.
- All of the above must be part of or under the **control of an armed force of that country**, whether serving **within or outside** that country.

> ✅ *This provision enables Canadian Forces personnel to participate in joint operations, training, or support roles abroad in a temporary capacity.*

> ⚠️ *The CDS may override this rule if it is deemed necessary for operational, strategic, or security reasons.*

---

### **2. Foreign Military Personnel Attached to the Canadian Forces**

Similarly, members of an armed force from a country where **Part VI of the Act is applicable** may be placed at the disposal of the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government) by the **service authorities of that country** for temporary attachment to the **Canadian Forces**.

Under these circumstances:

- The foreign military member shall be considered **temporarily attached to the Canadian Forces** for the duration of their assignment.
- The attachment applies whether they are serving **within or outside Canada**.
- The conditions for attachment are the same as for Canadian personnel:
  - On the staff of or attending a school/training unit.
  - On the staff of or as a patient in a hospital or convalescent establishment.
  - Appointed to or detailed for duty in:
    - A formation, station, unit, or detachment.
    - Or in transit or awaiting passage in any ship, vessel, or conveyance.
  - All must be under the **control of the Canadian Forces**.

> ✅ *This ensures reciprocity—foreign service members can serve temporarily with Canadian forces in joint operations, training, or support roles.*

> ⚠️ *Service authorities of the foreign country may provide directions that differ from the default rules (e.g., duration, duties), if they so choose.*

---

### **3. Application of Canadian Laws to Attached Foreign Personnel**

- The **statutes relating to the Canadian Forces** (e.g., the *Canadian Forces Act*, *Service Regulations*, etc.) shall generally **apply to foreign personnel temporarily attached to the Canadian Forces**.
- **Exception**:  
  → Any provision of Canadian law that relates to:
  - **Superannuation** (retirement benefits),
  - **Pensions**, or  
  - **Veterans benefits**  
  shall **not apply** to such foreign members.

> 🔍 *This is a critical limitation: foreign personnel attached to the Canadian Forces are not entitled to Canadian retirement or veteran benefits, even if they serve under Canadian command.*

> 📝 *This reflects a principle of reciprocity and practicality—foreign personnel are not expected to bear the full financial obligations of Canadian civilian or military pension systems.*

---

### **4. "Serving Together" – Definition and Legal Implication**

When **any component, unit, or element** of the Canadian Forces is serving in the **same place** or **in company** (i.e., together in the same location or formation) with **any part of a foreign armed force** to which Part VI of the Act applies:

> ✅ That component/unit is **deemed to be "serving together"** with that foreign force.

#### Implications of "Serving Together":
- This designation triggers the **applicability of Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act**.
- It allows for the **application of certain rights and responsibilities** under the Act, such as:
  - Protection of personnel during service.
  - Jurisdiction and command structures.
  - Treatment under military law.
- It also establishes a legal basis for **mutual recognition** of service and status during joint operations.

> 📌 *This provision is essential for operational clarity in multinational environments—e.g., joint exercises, peacekeeping missions, or joint deployments.*
