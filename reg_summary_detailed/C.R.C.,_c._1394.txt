The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-76, s. 22]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2016-76, section 22**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed**. It no longer exists in force.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-76, section 22**, which is a statutory instrument (a regulation made under the authority of a federal act) published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on June 24, 2016.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2016-76, which is generally the date of publication unless otherwise stated. In this case, it would be June 24, 2016.

However, **no specific details about the original content or subject matter** of the regulation are provided in the text you shared — only that it was repealed.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason for repeal is not stated in the provided text, common reasons include:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer applies to current practices).
  - Inconsistency with newer legislation.
  - Duplication or overlap with other regulations.

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is **not included** in your input, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., definitions, requirements, penalties) cannot be provided.
- The repeated entries suggest a formatting or data-entry error — likely unintentional duplication — and do not represent multiple distinct regulations.
