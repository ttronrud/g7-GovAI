**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument:**
The regulation, issued on **February 21, 2017**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**, pursuant to **section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, constitutes a formal re-application and re-exclusion of certain provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to specific positions within the **Office of the Governor General’s Secretary**.

This instrument is a **continuation and clarification** of prior decisions made under the PSEA, particularly regarding the application of employment standards to specific public service positions.

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Original Exclusion (P.C. 2010-1113b):**  
   In 2010, an **Order in Council (P.C. 2010-1113b)** excluded certain positions — specifically those designated by **position numbers 00025450 to 00025460** — in the **Office of the Governor General’s Secretary** from the application of the Public Service Employment Act.  
   These positions were excluded due to unique operational, structural, or constitutional considerations related to the role of the Governor General’s Office.

2. **Re-Application of the Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 12 and 13):**  
   Initially, the Act was re-applied to those positions — meaning the full scope of the PSEA was to be applied to them — but this was reversed by the 2010 Order.  
   The 2017 regulation **reinstates the re-application** of the PSEA to these positions, effectively **removing the exclusion** that had been in place since 2010.

3. **Subsequent Exclusion (S.C. 2014, c. 2, s. 55):**  
   In 2014, the **Public Service Commission (PSC)**, under the authority of section 20(1) of the PSEA, made a decision to **exclude** the same positions (00025450 to 00025460) from the application of the PSEA.  
   This decision was based on a determination that it was **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service** to apply certain provisions of the Act to these roles.  
   The exclusion was justified on grounds of **operational necessity, unique responsibilities, and the nature of the Governor General’s office** as a constitutional and ceremonial institution.

4. **Consultation Requirement:**  
   The PSC had, pursuant to **section 20(2)** of the PSEA, consulted with the employer (the Office of the Governor General) before making the exclusion. This demonstrates due process and transparency in the decision-making.

### **Key Provisions of the 2017 Regulation**

The regulation contains two main components:

#### **1. Re-Application of the Public Service Employment Act**
- The provisions of the PSEA are **re-applied** to the positions designated by **position numbers 00025450 to 00025460** and to the **persons occupying those positions**.
- This means that these individuals are now subject to the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act, including:
  - Employment standards (e.g., terms and conditions of service, pay, promotion, leave, termination)
  - Rights and obligations of employees and employers
  - Disciplinary procedures
  - Grievance and appeal processes
  - Fair employment practices

> This re-application effectively **reinstates the legal framework of the PSEA** for these roles, reversing the 2010 exclusion.

#### **2. Continued Exclusion of Specific Provisions**
Despite the re-application, the regulation **excludes certain provisions of the PSEA** from applying to these positions.  
These provisions are **not subject to the Act**, even though the rest of the Act applies.

The excluded sections and definitions include:

| Category | Specific Provisions Excluded |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Definitions** | - "Commission" (subsection 2(1))<br> - "Public service" (subsection 2(1)) |
| **Employment Rights and Protections** | - Sections 17 to 21<br> - Sections 54 and 55<br> - Sections 68 to 72<br> - Subsection 111(1)(c) |
| **Employment Relations** | - Sections 112 to 116<br> - Section 118 |
| **Leave and Benefits** | - Sections 120 to 122 |
| **Termination and Dismissal** | - Section 134 and Section 135 |

> **Important Note**: The exclusion of the definitions of "Commission" and "public service" means that the legal status of these roles is not fully aligned with the general public service framework. This may affect how these roles are interpreted in legal or administrative contexts.

### **Legal Authority and Process**

- The regulation is issued under **section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act**, which empowers the Public Service Commission to:
  - Apply or exclude provisions of the Act to specific positions
  - Consult with the employer before making such decisions
- The **Governor General in Council** acts on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, reflecting the administrative and policy framework of the federal government.
- The decision was made after a formal **consultation process** with the employer (the Office of the Governor General), ensuring transparency and stakeholder input.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The dual nature of this regulation — both re-applying and selectively excluding provisions — reflects a **nuanced balance** between:

- **Ensuring fairness and accountability** in public service employment (via re-application of the PSEA)
- **Preserving the unique constitutional and ceremonial functions** of the Governor General’s Office (via targeted exclusions)

This approach allows:
- The employees in these positions to benefit from the protections and standards of the PSEA (except where explicitly excluded)
- The Office of the Governor General to maintain operational flexibility and independence in its governance and staffing

---

### **Implications**

1. **For Employees in Positions 00025450–00025460:**
   - They are now subject to the general employment rules of the PSEA, including:
     - Right to fair treatment in hiring, promotion, and termination
     - Access to grievance and appeal mechanisms
     - Protection against discrimination
   - However, they are **not covered** by key provisions such as:
     - Specific leave entitlements (e.g., parental, sick, or personal leave)
     - Certain disciplinary procedures (e.g., under sections 111(1)(c))
     - Specific protections related to employment contracts or job security

2. **For the Office of the Governor General:**
   - Gains greater administrative and operational autonomy in managing these roles
   - Maintains a level of discretion that is consistent with the constitutional role of the Governor General

3. **For Public Service Governance:**
   - Demonstrates the government’s commitment to **transparency, accountability, and equity** in public service employment
   - Shows that even in sensitive or ceremonial roles, employment standards can be applied — with appropriate exceptions for functional necessity

---

### **Conclusion**

This 2017 regulation is a **significant policy and legal development** in the administration of public service employment in Canada. It:

- **Re-activates** the application of the Public Service Employment Act to a group of positions previously excluded due to unique institutional functions
- **Preserves necessary exceptions** to protect the integrity and operational independence of the Governor General’s Office
- Reflects a **deliberate and balanced approach** to employment law, recognizing both the need for standardization and the importance of constitutional and ceremonial roles

It serves as a model for how public service employment laws can be applied flexibly while maintaining fairness, transparency, and respect for institutional roles.
