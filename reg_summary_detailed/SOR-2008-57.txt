Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

### **Corporate Interrelationships (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**  
*Made under the Bank Act, pursuant to sections 72.1a, 716.1b, and subsection 978(1)c*  
*Effective: March 8, 2008 (SI/2008-33)*

---

## **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes specific **conditions and procedures** governing the issuance and transfer of **"delivery shares"** by banks or bank holding companies to their **subsidiaries** in connection with acquisitions under **sections 72.1 and 716.1 of the Bank Act**. The primary objective is to:

- Prevent **unauthorized or opaque corporate interrelationships** between banks, bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries.
- Ensure **transparency and fairness** in share transactions involving banks and their affiliates.
- Prevent **tax avoidance or evasion** by structuring share transfers in a way that avoids residency-based tax implications under Canadian income tax law.
- Maintain **financial stability and regulatory integrity** by ensuring that such intercompany transactions are legitimate, transparent, and properly documented.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing financial institutions in Canada. |
| **Delivery Shares** | Shares issued by a bank or a bank holding company to a **particular subsidiary** specifically for the purpose of an acquisition under **section 72.1(1)** (for banks) or **section 716.1(1)** (for bank holding companies). These shares are not held by the subsidiary for long-term investment but are intended to be transferred immediately. |
| **Particular Subsidiary** | A subsidiary body corporate that is specifically named in section 72.1(1) or 716.1(1) of the Bank Act — i.e., a direct or indirect subsidiary of the bank or bank holding company involved in the transaction. |

---

## **3. Prescribed Conditions for Acquisition of Delivery Shares (Sections 72.1(1) and 716.1(1))**

These conditions must be satisfied **before** a bank or bank holding company issues delivery shares to a particular subsidiary:

1. **Fair Market Value Consideration**  
   The consideration (payment) received by the bank or bank holding company for the delivery shares must be **equal to the fair market value** of those shares at the time of issuance.

2. **Widely Held and Actively Traded Class of Shares**  
   The class of shares to which the delivery shares belong must be:
   - **Widely held**, and  
   - Actively traded on **one of the following Canadian stock exchanges**:
     - Canadian Venture Exchange (CVE)
     - Montreal Exchange (MX)
     - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)

   This ensures that the share price is transparent, observable, and not artificially manipulated.

3. **Sole Purpose of Transfer**  
   The **only purpose** of the acquisition by the particular subsidiary of the delivery shares is to **transfer them immediately** to the shareholders of **another body corporate**.  
   → No retention, investment, or long-term holding is permitted.

4. **Arm’s Length Transactions Prior to Acquisition**  
   Immediately before the acquisition of delivery shares by the particular subsidiary:
   - The **other body corporate** (the recipient of the shares) and its **shareholders** must deal with:
     - The bank or bank holding company, and  
     - The particular subsidiary  
     **at arm’s length**, as determined under the *Income Tax Act*.

   This ensures that the transaction is commercially reasonable and not influenced by related-party favoritism.

5. **Non-Residency Requirement**  
   Immediately before the acquisition:
   - The **particular subsidiary** and the **other body corporate** must **not be resident in Canada** for the purposes of the *Income Tax Act*.  
   → This avoids Canadian tax exposure on the transaction.

---

## **4. Prescribed Conditions for the Post-Acquisition Transfer (Sections 72.1(2) and 716.1(2))**

These conditions apply **after** the subsidiary acquires the delivery shares:

1. **No Beneficial Interest Acquired by the Subsidiary**  
   The particular subsidiary must **not acquire a beneficial interest** in the delivery shares as a result of the acquisition.  
   → The beneficial ownership must pass directly to the **shareholders of the other body corporate**.

2. **Immediate Transfer to Shareholders**  
   The acquisition must be **followed immediately** by a transfer of the delivery shares to the **shareholders of the other body corporate**.

3. **Non-Residency After Transfer**  
   Immediately **after** the transfer:
   - The **particular subsidiary** and the **other body corporate** must **not be resident in Canada** for income tax purposes.

4. **Post-Transfer Subsidiary Relationship**  
   After the transfer, the **other body corporate must become a subsidiary** of the particular subsidiary.  
   → This creates a formal corporate structure where the original recipient (the "other body") becomes a subsidiary of the subsidiary that received the shares.

> ⚠️ This creates a **reverse ownership structure** — the entity that originally received shares from the bank becomes a subsidiary of the entity that acquired the shares from the bank.

## **5. Required Actions When Conditions Are Breached (Section 72.1(3) and 716.1(3))**

If **any of the conditions in sections 2 or 3 are not met or cease to be met**, the bank or bank holding company must take the following actions **within 30 days**:

1. **Cancel the Delivery Shares**  
   - The delivery shares must be canceled.  
   - If the bank’s by-laws limit the number of authorized shares, the shares may be **restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares** (i.e., not issued but still available for future issuance).

2. **Return Consideration to the Particular Subsidiary**  
   - The consideration (payment) received by the bank or bank holding company must be **returned** to the particular subsidiary.

3. **Cancel Entry in Stated Capital Account**  
   - The entry reflecting the consideration in the bank’s or bank holding company’s **stated capital account** must be canceled.

> These steps ensure **accountability**, **transparency**, and **reversibility** of transactions that fail to meet regulatory or tax compliance standards.

---

## **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on:
- The day that **Section 9 of the *Act to Amend the Law Governing Financial Institutions and to Provide for Related and Consequential Matters*** (S.C. 2007, c. 6) comes into force, **or**
- If later, on the day the regulations are **registered** with the Government of Canada.

> The regulations were officially registered and came into force on **March 8, 2008** (as noted in SI/2008-33).

## **7. Key Regulatory and Tax Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
