**Detailed Summary of the *Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Regulations* (S.C. 2002, c. 25)**  
*Effective Date: December 18, 2002; Came into Force: January 1, 2003*

---

### **Overview**
These regulations implement **Section 35** of the *Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 25), establishing detailed procedures for the export and import of rough diamonds in Canada. The primary objective is to ensure **transparency, traceability, and compliance** with the **Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS)**—an international initiative aimed at preventing the trade of conflict diamonds.

The regulations establish a formalized system for issuing **Canadian Certificates**, tracking shipments, verifying origins, and maintaining records, all to uphold the integrity of Canada’s rough diamond trade and support global efforts to eliminate conflict diamonds.

---

## **Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act*.
- **Harmonized System (HS)**: The international commodity classification system used in customs tariffs to classify goods.
- **Shipment**: One or more containers of rough diamonds transported together for export or import.

Each issued Canadian Certificate must include:

1. Name and address of:
   - Exporter
   - Recipient (to whom diamonds are being shipped)

2. Name of the participant to which the diamonds are being shipped

3. Mass of rough diamonds (in carats)

4. Value of the rough diamonds (in U.S. dollars)

5. Harmonized System (HS) code for classification

6. Number of containers and seal number for each container

7. Date of issue and date of expiry

  *"The rough diamonds in this shipment have been handled in accordance with the provisions of the Kimberley Process international certification scheme for rough diamonds."*  
  *(French version included)*
- A **unique serial number**
- The **signature** of the Minister or an authorized officer under Section 6 of the Act

---

## **Validity of the Canadian Certificate**

- Valid for **60 days from the date of issue**.

- *Exception*: Section 12 of the Act may allow for extensions under specific circumstances (not detailed in this regulation).

> This short validity period ensures timely processing and reduces the risk of diamonds being diverted into illicit channels.

## **Export Reporting (Subsection 13(1) of the Act)**

An exporter must:
1. Complete a **formal export report** (as fixed by the Minister), including:
   - Name of exporter and recipient
   - Serial number of the Canadian Certificate
   - Date of export
2. **Sign** the report to attest to the accuracy of the information.
3. **Present** the completed report to a customs officer **at the time of export**.
4. **Send it to the Minister** by mail, courier, or hand-delivery **within seven days** of export.

> This creates a verifiable audit trail for all exports.

An importer must:
1. Present the **accompanying Kimberley Process Certificate** to a customs officer upon import.
2. **Send a copy of the certificate** to the Minister within **seven days** after import (by mail, courier, or hand delivery).

> This ensures that all imported diamonds are traceable and compliant with international standards.

## **Container Requirements**

- Containers used for the export or import of rough diamonds must be **constructed so that they cannot be opened without showing visible evidence of tampering or opening**.
- This ensures **tamper-evident integrity** and prevents unauthorized access or diversion.

> **Sealing Requirements**:
- A container must be sealed with a **seal bearing a seal number listed on the Canadian Certificate**.
- The container must **bear the serial number of the Canadian Certificate**.

> These physical safeguards are critical to verifying the authenticity and origin of the diamonds throughout the supply chain.

## **Recordkeeping Requirements (3-Year Retention)**

Exporters and importers must maintain records for **three years** after the date of the transaction. Records must include:

| Scenario | Required Records |
|--------|------------------|
| **Mined in Canada** | - Daily total mill feed (for the calendar year of mining)<br>- Daily total rough diamond recovery (same year)<br>- Record of any mass changes due to handling (same year) |
| **Extracted from mineral concentrates (in Canada)** | - Mass of rough diamonds extracted from concentrates |
| **Purchased or obtained by exporter or importer** | - Copy of purchase order, invoice, or similar document |
| **Polished and facetted by importer after import** | - Loss of diamond material during polishing/facetting<br>- Mass of recovered polished diamonds<br>- Mass of remaining rough diamonds |

> These records provide a transparent and auditable trail of the diamond’s journey, supporting accountability and compliance with the KPCS.

---

## **Forfeiture and Disposition of Forfeited Diamonds**

### **Rough Diamonds Forfeited Under the Act**
- If the Minister determines that a forfeited rough diamond **will not re-enter the international rough diamond trade**, the Minister must **dispose of it** in accordance with the *Surplus Crown Assets Act*.
- If the Minister **does not dispose of** the diamond within a reasonable time, the Minister must **destroy** it.

> This prevents the re-entry of illicit or untraceable diamonds into the market.

### **Other Items Forfeited**
- Any non-diamond items forfeited under the Act must also be disposed of under the *Surplus Crown Assets Act*.

> This ensures consistent handling of forfeited assets, maintaining public accountability.

---

## **Public Notification of Disposition**

- Upon disposal of any forfeited item (rough diamond or otherwise), the Minister must:
  - Publish **notice of the date and manner of disposition** in **Part I of the Canada Gazette**.

> This enhances transparency and public awareness of how forfeited assets are managed.

---

## **Effective Date and Enforcement**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 35 of the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act** (S.C. 2002, c. 25) comes into force.
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2003 (as noted in SI/2003-3)

> This ensures alignment with the broader legislative framework and allows time for industry stakeholders to adapt.
