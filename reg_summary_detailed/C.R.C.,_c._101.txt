**Detailed Summary of the Penticton Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Penticton Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and height restrictions for land adjacent to and in the vicinity of **Penticton Airport**, located in the city of Penticton, British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Penticton Airport**, located in Penticton, BC. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 1,114 feet above sea level** (even if not precisely measured at that point). |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport (1,000 feet wide) specifically designated for takeoff and landing in a given direction. The primary strip referenced is **Runway 16–34**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the ends of the runway strip. At the **strip ends**, it extends **500 feet** on each side of the centerline. At the **outer ends**, it extends **2,000 feet** on each side, measured **horizontally 10,000 feet from the strip ends**, and at an elevation **200 feet above the strip end elevations**. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane centered on and located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point (1,114 feet)**. This surface forms the baseline for height restrictions across much of the airport’s surrounding area. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane that rises from the **outer lateral limits** of the strip and its approach surface, extending upward and outward until it intersects with the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. The slope is **1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally** (a 1:7 gradient). |

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to **all lands**, including public road allowances, located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Penticton Airport**. The exact boundaries of these lands are **specifically described in Part II of the Schedule** and are **based on detailed survey plans**.

The primary governing document for boundary delineation is **Plan E.890**, dated **July 23, 1963**, held in the **Department of Transport at Ottawa**. This plan includes:
- A **yellow outline** showing the **horizontal surface**.
- A **blue outline** showing the **approach surfaces** (for Runway 16–34).
- A **red outline** showing the **transitional surfaces**.

Thus, the regulations apply only to land **within or under** the following zones:
1. The **horizontal surface** (yellow on Plan E.890).
2. Either of the **approach surfaces** (blue on Plan E.890).
3. Any of the **transitional surfaces** (red on Plan E.890).

### **4. Height Restrictions**

A core principle of these regulations is the **prohibition of structures exceeding certain elevation limits**. No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object **if the highest point of that structure exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

#### **(a) Horizontal Surface**
- A large, complex polygonal boundary that begins at the **southeastern corner of Skaha Lake**, follows a series of bearings and boundaries through several roads and parcels (e.g., Skaha Lake Road, Parcel 1CR, Scott Avenue, Argyle Street, Burnaby Avenue, etc.), and ultimately returns to the starting point.
- This surface is **150 feet above the airport reference point (1,114 feet)**, meaning the **maximum allowable height** for any structure is **1,264 feet above sea level** at any point within its boundary.
- **Exception**: The portion of the horizontal surface within the **Penticton Indian Reserve No. 1 (Plan B.C. 117 C.L.S.R.)**, specifically **Parcel E** on Plan M.284, is **exempt** from this restriction and is shown in **yellow** on Plan E.890.

#### **(b) Approach Surfaces**
- Two approach surfaces extend from each end of **Runway 16–34**:
  - **500 feet wide** on each side at the **strip ends**.
  - **2,000 feet wide** on each side at the **outer ends**, which are **200 feet above the strip end elevations**.
  - The outer ends are measured **10,000 feet horizontally from the strip ends**.
- These surfaces are **exempt** from the horizontal surface rule and apply only to land directly adjacent to the runway ends.
- **Exception**: All lands within the **Penticton Indian Reserve No. 1** are **excluded** from these approach surface restrictions and are shown in **blue** on Plan E.890.

#### **(c) Transitional Surfaces**
- These surfaces rise from the **outer edges of the strip and approach surfaces** at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal).
- They extend upward and outward until they meet the horizontal surface or another transitional surface.
- These surfaces are **exempt** for land within the **Penticton Indian Reserve No. 1**, shown in **red** on Plan E.890.

---

### **5. Regulatory Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **ensure aviation safety** by:
- Preventing obstructions to aircraft during **takeoff, landing, and approach**.
- Maintaining clear visibility and unimpeded flight paths.
- Establishing a **consistent, measurable, and enforceable height limit** for structures near the airport.

By defining the **horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces**, the regulations create a **geometrically precise buffer zone** that protects the airport’s operational integrity.

---

### **6. Exemptions**

- **Penticton Indian Reserve No. 1 (Plan B.C. 117 C.L.S.R.)**:
  - All height restrictions (horizontal, approach, and transitional surfaces) **do not apply** to land within this reserve.
  - This reflects **land-use agreements**, **indigenous rights**, or **cultural significance** of the area.
  - The exemption is clearly marked on Plan E.890 using **yellow (horizontal), blue (approach), and red (transitional)** outlines.

---

### **7. Legal and Enforcement Framework**

- The regulations are **binding on all landowners and developers** within the specified boundaries.
- Violations (e.g., constructing a building above the allowed height) constitute **illegal development** and may result in **enforcement actions**, including **removal of structures** or **fines**.
- The **Department of Transport (or its successor agency)** is responsible for maintaining the official records and enforcement.

### **8. Summary of Key Boundaries (Simplified)**

| Feature | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|
| **Horizontal Surface** | 150 ft above ARP (1,114 ft = 1,264 ft ASL); a large polygon starting at Skaha Lake, following roads and parcel boundaries, returning to start; excludes Parcel E in Penticton Indian Reserve. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | 500 ft wide at ends of Runway 16–34; 2,000 ft wide at outer ends (200 ft above strip ends); 10,000 ft horizontal reach; excluded from Penticton Indian Reserve. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | 1:7 slope from strip edges; extend to meet horizontal surface; excluded from Penticton Indian Reserve. |
| **Reference Point** | Intersection of Runway 16–34 centerline with its 34 end; 4,000 ft northward; then 500 ft east to a point at 1,114 ft ASL. |

### **9. Conclusion**

The **Penticton Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive and technically detailed set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** by limiting building heights near the airport. They establish **three distinct elevation zones**—horizontal, approach, and transitional—each with precise geometric definitions derived from survey plans. The regulations apply to all land within or under these zones, with a **notable exemption** for the **Penticton Indian Reserve No. 1**, reflecting both practical and legal considerations.

These regulations are **critical for urban planning, development control, and aviation safety**, and their enforcement ensures that the airport remains safe and operational under all weather and flight conditions.

> **Note**: The reference to the *Minister* being **revoked** (SOR/93-401, s. 2) indicates that the original ministerial authority under which these regulations were issued has been superseded or replaced. However, the substantive content of the zoning rules remains in effect as a standalone regulation.
