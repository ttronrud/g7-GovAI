#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all broadcasting undertakings** **except**:
- Campus, community, Indigenous, or student broadcasting undertakings;
- Broadcasting undertakings operated by the **CRTC (Corporation)**;
- Independent corporations (as defined in the *Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility to Hold Broadcasting Licences)*), which derive **no revenue from air time sales**.

> This means that only commercial broadcasters (excluding certain non-commercial or exempt entities) are subject to the fee structure.

---

#### **4. Designation of Primary Undertaking in a Group**

- Each **broadcasting ownership group** must designate **one broadcasting undertaking** that has the **highest fee revenue** among its members.
- This designated undertaking is responsible for ensuring the **group complies with sections 4 to 7** of the regulations (which cover fee obligations, reporting, and compliance).

---

#### **5. Fee Return Requirements**

- **Deadline**: Every broadcasting ownership group whose fee revenue exceeds the **exemption level** must file a **fee return** with the CRTC **by November 30** of each year.
- The return must cover the **return year** beginning **September 1** of the year immediately preceding the filing year (e.g., a return filed in November 2024 covers the return year from September 1, 2023, to August 31, 2024).
- The return must include consolidated fee revenue data for the entire ownership group.

> **Note**: For the fiscal years **2024–2025** and **2025–2026**, the calculation of fee revenues for online undertakings will follow the conditions set out in **Broadcasting Order CRTC 2023–332**, specifically **Paragraph 4**, which governs the verification and validation of fee returns for online services.

---

#### **6. Payment of Broadcasting Fees**

- Broadcasting fees are **paid annually**, no later than **30 days after the date on the invoice issued by the CRTC**.
- If fees become overdue, **interest and administrative charges** apply as per the *Interest and Administrative Charges Regulations*.

---

#### **7. Calculation of Annual Broadcasting Fees**

The total annual fee is composed of two components:

##### **(a) Initial Amount (Base Fee)**  
Calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Initial Amount} = \left( \text{Fee Revenue} - \text{Exemption Level} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Total Aggregate Fee Revenue (above exemption level)} - \text{Aggregate Exemption Level}}{\text{Total Aggregate Fee Revenue (above exemption level)} - \text{Aggregate Exemption Level}} \right) \times \text{Estimated Total Regulatory Costs}
\]

> This component reflects the **proportion of the group’s fee revenue** above the exemption level, relative to the total revenue of all groups above the exemption level, multiplied by the estimated regulatory costs.

##### **(b) Annual Adjustment Amount**  
Calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Annual Adjustment Amount} = \left( \text{Fee Revenue} - \text{Exemption Level} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Total Aggregate Fee Revenue (above exemption level)} - \text{Aggregate Exemption Level}}{\text{Total Aggregate Fee Revenue (above exemption level)} - \text{Aggregate Exemption Level}} \right) \times \left( \text{Actual Total Regulatory Costs} - \text{Estimated Total Regulatory Costs} \right)
\]

> This adjusts the base fee **based on actual vs. estimated regulatory costs** for the fiscal year.  
> - If actual costs are **higher**, the fee increases.  
> - If actual costs are **lower**, the fee decreases.  
> - This ensures fees reflect real operational costs.

> **Important**: Any adjustment is **charged or credited in the next year’s invoice**. There is **no reimbursement** possible from the Commission.

#### **8. Estimating and Reporting Regulatory Costs**

- **Estimated total regulatory costs** are derived from the CRTC’s **expenditure plan** published in **Part III of the Government of Canada’s Estimates**.
- These costs include:
  1. Costs of the CRTC’s **broadcasting activities**;
  2. The **share of administrative costs** attributable to broadcasting activities;
  3. Any other costs used to determine the **net cost of operating the CRTC’s broadcasting program**, **excluding spectrum regulation costs**.

- The CRTC is required to **publish annually** the estimated total regulatory costs in a **notice in the Canada Gazette, Part I**.

- **Actual total regulatory costs** are calculated using actual financial data and are used to compute the annual adjustment amount.

---

#### **9. Transition and Repeal of Former Regulations**

- The **Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997 (SOR 97-144)** are **repealed**.
- For **fiscal years 2024–2025 and 2025–2026**, the following transitional provisions apply:
  - Fee revenue data from the former regulations (under section 5) will be **consolidated into the group-level fee revenue** under the new rules.
  - The calculation of **annual adjustment amounts** and **estimated/actual regulatory costs** will follow the **former regulations’ formulas** (specifically **subsection 8(2)** and **section 9**) to ensure continuity and stability during the transition.

#### **10. Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fairness & Proportionality** | The exemption level protects smaller broadcasters (especially those with revenue under $2 million) from disproportionate fees. |
| **Cost Recovery Mechanism** | Fees are directly linked to actual and projected regulatory costs, ensuring the CRTC is adequately funded. |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | Public disclosure of estimated and actual regulatory costs enhances transparency. |
| **Modernization** | Includes digital services (audiobooks, podcasts, video games) and online undertakings, reflecting the evolution of media consumption. |
| **Stability & Predictability** | The use of formulas ensures consistent, rule-based fee calculations without arbitrary changes. |

#### **11. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Non-compliance with filing deadlines or fee payment obligations may result in penalties, including interest and administrative charges.
- The CRTC retains authority to verify fee returns
