  The Agency’s powers apply exclusively to **eggs from domestic hens**, regardless of where they are produced in Canada.

- **Geographic Scope**:  
  The Agency may exercise its powers over eggs produced **anywhere in Canada**, including interprovincial and export trade.

---

## **3. Head Office Location**

- The **head office** of the Agency is located in the **National Capital Region**, as defined in the Schedule to the *National Capital Act*.

---

## **4. Marketing Plan (Part II of the Schedule)**

The Agency is empowered to implement a comprehensive **marketing plan**, which governs the allocation, pricing, and movement of eggs. Key elements include:

### **Definition of Key Terms**
- **Marketing**: Includes selling, buying, pricing, assembling, packing, processing, transporting, storing, and reselling eggs (in whole or processed form).
- **Quota**: The number of dozens of eggs an egg producer is entitled to market in interprovincial or export trade (or have marketed on their behalf) during a specified period.
- **Quota System**: A system under which the Agency assigns quotas to producers to control the volume of eggs marketed in interprovincial and export channels.

---

## **5. Quota System Rules**

The Agency must establish a **quota system** to ensure that total egg marketing (both under assigned quotas and anticipated unassigned marketing) aligns with a fixed annual target set in the Plan.

### **Core Principles of Quota Assignment**
- The total number of dozens of eggs marketed in a province (through Agency quotas, provincial boards, or unassigned marketing) must **equal the target set in Section 3 of the Plan** for that province.
- This target is derived from a table specifying:
  - Column I: Province
  - Column II: Target number of dozens
  - Column III: Percentage of total production

> Example: For a province, the target is a percentage of total national egg output, based on historical production and market demand.

### **Prohibitions on Quota Changes**
- **No increase** in total marketing capacity (interprovincial/export + intraprovincial) beyond the Plan target **unless** the Agency considers:
  - Comparative advantage of production
  - Market size variations
  - Failures by producers to market their quota
  - Feasibility of increased production
  - Transportation costs between production and market areas

- **No decrease** in total marketing capacity for **New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland** unless the Agency can justify the reduction and ensure that the remaining provinces reduce their marketing capacity **proportionately**.

- **No decrease** in total marketing capacity for **other provinces** unless a **unanimous consent** of all Agency members is obtained.

> **Exception**: The **Northwest Territories** is excluded from the prohibition on decreasing quotas (Subsection 4(3) does not apply).

---

## **6. Northwest Territories Quota Specifics**

- The Agency has determined that the total number of dozens of eggs produced in the Northwest Territories and authorized for marketing (interprovincial, export, or intraprovincial) over a 12-month period shall equal **2,725,500 dozens**.

- **Exception Period (1999)**:  
  From the date of enactment until December 31, 1999, the number of dozens authorized is calculated as:  
  **(Number of days in the period) × 7,467** (a daily average).

- **No increase** in marketing beyond 2,725,500 dozens unless the Agency considers:
  - Comparative advantage
  - Market variation
  - Production feasibility
  - Transportation costs  
  (Criteria listed in paragraphs (1)(c) to (g))

- **No decrease** below 2,725,500 dozens **without unanimous consent** of the Agency members.

- **No order or regulation** may be made under subsections (1), (3), or (6) unless the Agency determines that **market size has changed significantly**.

---

## **7. Producer Obligations and Egg Availability**

- Each producer to whom a quota is assigned must **make available to the Agency or its agent** all eggs produced in excess of their quota.
- The price at which these excess eggs are made available **must not exceed** the difference between:
  - The price the Agency realizes from selling the eggs
  - The Agency’s marketing expenses related to those sales

- The Agency may require producers to make available eggs **in accordance with their quota**, if the province’s equivalent Board or Commodity Board already enforces such a requirement.

---

## **8. Marketing and Pooling of Receipts**

- The Agency may **market eggs individually or collectively**.
- It may **pool receipts** from marketing and **deduct its own expenses** (e.g., transportation, promotion, administrative costs) before distributing any proceeds to producers.

---

## **9. Licensing of Egg Marketers**

- The Agency may establish a **licensing system** for individuals or businesses engaged in interprovincial or export egg marketing.
- The system may require **fees** per license.
- Licenses must include a condition that licensees **comply with all Agency orders and regulations**.

---

## **10. Levies and Charges**

- The Agency may impose **levies or charges** on producers or marketers, grouped by category (e.g., small farms, large processors).
- Levies must be set at levels sufficient to cover:
  - Administrative and marketing expenses
  - Creation of reserves
  - Losses from egg sales or disposal
  - Equalization or adjustment payments among producers
  - Other essential costs
- The Agency may **collect levies** through a Commodity Board with its **concurrence**.

---

## **11. Price Protection and Market Fairness**

- The Agency must **prevent any person from marketing eggs in a province at a price lower than**:
  1. The price charged for equivalent eggs in the **same province or region** at the same time
  2. **Reasonable transportation costs** incurred to deliver the eggs to the market

> This ensures fair competition and protects producers from price dumping.

---

## **12. Cooperation with Provincial Boards and Commodity Boards**

The Agency is required to **promote high levels of cooperation** with provincial bodies (e.g., Newfoundland Egg Marketing Board, Ontario Egg Producers, etc.).

Specific obligations include:
- **Sharing records, minutes, and decisions** with relevant Boards or Commodity Boards.
- **Allowing designated officers** from Boards to attend Agency meetings when matters of concern arise.
- **Providing advance notice** of any proposed order or regulation that may affect a Board’s operations.

---

## **13. Review and Adaptation of the Marketing Plan**

- The Agency must hold **annual meetings** to review:
  - The marketing plan
  - Any orders or regulations implemented
- A meeting must be held **at least once per year** and **as often as requested** by at least **two provincial Boards or Commodity Boards**.
- The purpose is to assess whether **modifications are needed** to support the Agency’s objectives (e.g., market stability, producer support, fair pricing).

---

## **Key Objectives and Policy Goals**

1. **Market Stability**: Prevent oversupply and price volatility by controlling the volume of eggs marketed.
2. **Fair Pricing**: Ensure that eggs are not sold below fair market value in a given region.
3. **Producer Support**: Provide a structured system that ensures producers
