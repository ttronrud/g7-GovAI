**Detailed Summary of the *Pesticide Residue Compensation Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **Pesticide Residue Compensation Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations implement and provide detailed procedural and substantive rules under the **Pesticide Residue Compensation Act (the "Act")**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Pesticide Residue Compensation Act* (Loi), which establishes the legal framework for compensating farmers whose agricultural products suffer financial loss due to pesticide residues in food.

- **"Applicant"**: Defined as a **farmer who submits a formal application** for compensation under Section 3 of the Act. This individual must be directly affected by pesticide residue in their agricultural product.

- **"Certificate of Designation"**: A formal document issued by the **Deputy Minister of Agriculture** to designate an inspector. This certificate must include:
  - The inspector’s full name;
  - The date of designation;
  - The inspector’s signature and photograph;
  - A statement confirming that the named individual is authorized to act as an inspector under the Act.

> *Purpose*: Ensures accountability, transparency, and official validation of inspector appointments.

### **3. Requirements for a Compensation Application**

Every application for compensation due to pesticide residue must contain the following information:

1. **Name and address** of the applicant (the farmer).
2. **Date of submission** of the application.
3. **Name of the agricultural product** involved (e.g., apples, wheat, milk).
4. **Place where the product is usually sold** (to determine market value).
5. **Place where the product was produced** (to verify Canadian origin).
6. **Date and identification** of the official notice stating that the sale of the product would violate the *Food and Drugs Act* or its associated regulations.  
   > *This notice is critical* — it serves as the trigger for the loss and establishes the timeline of the incident.
7. **Kind, quantity, and stage of production or marketing** of the product (e.g., harvested, processed, packaged).
8. **Steps taken by the applicant** to reduce the loss (e.g., removing affected batches, selling at discounted prices).
9. **Steps taken to pursue legal action** against:
   - The pesticide manufacturer;
   - Any person whose actions or omissions contributed to the presence of pesticide residue.
10. **Any other information** the Minister may reasonably require to assess the claim.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency, completeness, and factual basis for evaluating claims. The application must demonstrate both the financial impact and the applicant’s efforts to mitigate the loss.

---

### **4. Maximum Compensation Amount**

- The Minister may pay compensation to the applicant **up to 80% of the monetary value** of the affected agricultural product.
- The **monetary value** is determined in accordance with **Section 5** of the Act (not included in this summary but referenced).

> *Note*: This cap ensures that compensation is proportionate and does not exceed a reasonable threshold based on the loss.

---

### **5. Determination of Monetary Value**

The value of the agricultural product is assessed differently depending on its **stage of readiness for sale**:

#### **(a) Product Ready for Sale**
If the product is ready for sale at the usual place of sale:
- The monetary value is deemed to be the **market value** it would have had **if sold at the usual place on the date of the official notice** (as referenced in paragraph 3(f)).

> *Example*: A farmer sells 100 kg of strawberries at a local market. On the day the notice was issued, the market price was $5/kg. The value is $500 (100 × $5).

#### **(b) Product at Incomplete Stage of Production or Marketing**
If the product is **not yet ready for sale**:
- The value is calculated as:
  > **Market value (if ready and sold on the notice date)**  
  > **minus**  
  > **An assessed reduction** due to the incomplete stage of production or marketing.

> *Example*: A batch of milk is being processed but not yet packaged. The market value of packaged milk on the notice date is $200. The Minister assesses that processing is 30% incomplete, so a 30% reduction is applied → $140.

> *Assessment Authority*: The Minister or a person designated by him (e.g., a technical expert or valuation officer) determines the appropriate reduction.

> *Purpose*: Prevents overcompensation for products that are still in development or processing, which have lower market value than finished goods.

---

### **6. Requirement for Canadian Production**

- **No compensation will be paid** unless the Minister is satisfied that:
  > The agricultural product was **produced in Canada**.

> *Rationale*: Ensures that only Canadian farmers who are directly impacted by pesticide residue in their domestically produced goods receive compensation. This protects the integrity of the compensation scheme and prevents claims from foreign producers.

---

### **7. Minister’s Discretion on Loss Reduction Measures**

- The Minister **shall not** take any action to reduce the loss (e.g., destroy or remove contaminated products) **if**:
  - The **cost of such action** (including labor, disposal, etc.)  
  - **Plus the compensation** that would be paid under Section 4  
  > **Exceeds** the compensation that would be paid if no such action were taken.

> *In other words*:  
> If removing or mitigating the loss would cost more than the compensation offered, the Minister will **not** intervene.  
> This rule promotes cost-effectiveness and prevents unnecessary public or taxpayer-funded expenditures.

> *Example*: If destroying 100 kg of contaminated produce costs $10,000, and the compensation is only $8,000, the Minister will not initiate destruction because the total cost exceeds the benefit.

### **Summary of Key Principles**

| Principle | Description |

| **Compensation Cap** | Maximum of 80% of the product’s market value. |
| **Market Value Determination** | Based on what the product would have sold for on the notice date, adjusted for incomplete production. |

### **Overall Objective**
These regulations aim to:
- Provide **fair and timely compensation** to Canadian farmers whose agricultural products are rendered unsellable due to pesticide residues.

They balance the need for financial support with fiscal responsibility, legal accountability, and adherence to food safety laws.
