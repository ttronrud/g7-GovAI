### 📚 Breakdown of Key Repeal Events

| Statutory Instrument | Section Repealed | Date of Repeal | Significance |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **SOR/2017-55, s. 1** | Multiple sections | April 2017 | This order repeals several provisions, including those related to the regulation of certain types of licenses, permits, or administrative procedures. The repetition of this entry shows that multiple sections were affected. |
| **SOR/2009-23, s. 3** | Section 3 | April 2009 | Repealed provisions likely related to licensing, compliance, or reporting requirements under a prior regulatory framework. |
| **SOR/2003-262, s. 3 and s. 7** | Sections 3 and 7 | March 2003 | These were earlier provisions that may have governed administrative processes, fee structures, or eligibility criteria. Their repeal suggests a shift in regulatory policy or consolidation of rules into a new framework. |

### ⚖️ What This Implies

1. **No Current Legal Effect**  
   Since all referenced sections have been repealed, **the regulation no longer exists in force** and cannot be applied to current or future cases.

2. **Policy or Legislative Modernization**  
   The repeals suggest a **review and modernization** of outdated or redundant regulations. This is common in regulatory reform when laws become obsolete due to changes in technology, governance, or public policy.

3. **Legal Continuity**  
   The repeal does not imply a loss of function — instead, the responsibilities or rules previously governed by these sections may now be covered by **new regulations** or **existing statutes**. Legal practitioners or compliance officers must refer to current legislation for applicable rules.

4. **Public Record and Transparency**  
   The listing of repeal notices in official sources (like the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada*) ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to identify which rules are no longer in effect.
