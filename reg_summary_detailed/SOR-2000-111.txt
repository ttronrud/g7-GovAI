### Summary:

---

### Detailed Breakdown:

#### 1. **SOR/2011-318, s. 806 – Repealed**
- This section was part of a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2011, which is a form of secondary legislation used to implement or amend primary laws.
- Section 806 was **repealed** (officially cancelled) by **SOR/2011-318, s. 806 itself**, meaning it was formally removed from legal effect.
- The repealing amendment likely aimed to:
  - Remove outdated or redundant rules
  - Align the legislation with updated policy or legal frameworks
  - Simplify or modernize regulatory language
- Since it is repeated 30+ times in the list, this confirms that the repeal was a significant and formally enacted change, not a typo or error.

#### 2. **SOR/2006-340, s. 4 – Repealed**
- This section was part of a 2006 Statutory Instrument (No. 340).
- It was also **repealed**, likely in a later amendment (possibly in SOR/2011-318 or another subsequent instrument).
- The repeal of Section 4 of SOR/2006-340 suggests that:
  - The original provision was no longer needed
  - It may have been inconsistent with new legislation or policy
  - It may have been superseded by more current or comprehensive rules

---

### Legal Significance of Repeal:
- **Repeal means the provision is no longer enforceable or legally binding.**
- Any legal action, compliance requirement, or interpretation based on these sections is now **invalid or obsolete**.
- Regulatory bodies, courts, and government departments must refer to **current, active legislation** instead.

### Conclusion:
> **This list does not represent an active regulation.**  
> It is a record of **repealed provisions** — specifically, **Section 806 of SOR/2011-318** and **Section 4 of SOR/2006-340** — which have been officially cancelled and are no longer in force.  
> As such, **no detailed summary of the regulation itself is possible**, because the regulation no longer exists in law.
