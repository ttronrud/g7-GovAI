Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **Background and Purpose**
The regulation addresses the **cost recovery mechanism** for advance income tax rulings issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Historically, under the previous Order in Council (P.C. 1983-653), the cost of providing such rulings was not clearly assigned to the recipient. This created ambiguity in financial accountability and administrative efficiency.

The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board) has concluded that it is **fair and appropriate** that the **cost of providing a service**—specifically, an advance income tax ruling—should be **borne by the person to whom the ruling is provided**. This reflects a principle of cost recovery and ensures that taxpayers or entities requesting rulings are financially accountable for the administrative effort involved.

#### **Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision grants the Governor in Council the authority to:
- Revise or revoke existing orders in council,
- Authorize the Minister of National Revenue to prescribe fees for services provided under federal programs, including tax rulings.

This authority enables the government to establish a transparent and financially sustainable system for managing the provision of tax advisory services.

#### **Key Action Taken**
The regulation:
1. **Revokes** the previous Order in Council:
   - **P.C. 1983-653**, dated March 3, 1983,
   - And the corresponding **Statutory Instrument (SI/83-62)** published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, page 1168*.

   These earlier instruments had established a framework for the issuance of advance income tax rulings but **did not explicitly assign the cost of providing the service to the recipient**. Their revocation removes outdated or ambiguous provisions.

2. **Authorizes the Minister of National Revenue** to:
   - Issue a new **prescriptive order** (by regulation),
   - That specifies a **fee to be paid by a person** who receives an advance income tax ruling.

This new authority allows the Minister to:
- Set a **reasonable and consistent fee** based on the complexity, time, and resources required to provide the ruling,
- Ensure that the fee is **transparent, equitable, and recoverable** from the requestor,
- Align with modern administrative practices and financial accountability standards.

---

#### **Implications and Effects**
- **Financial Accountability**: Taxpayers or entities requesting advance income tax rulings will now be required to pay a fee for the service, reflecting the actual cost of processing and delivering the ruling.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: The CRA can operate more efficiently by having a clear revenue stream for processing rulings, reducing financial burdens on the government.
- **Clarity and Transparency**: The regulation provides a clear legal basis for fee-setting, reducing potential disputes or legal challenges over cost recovery.
- **Alignment with Public Finance Principles**: This move supports broader fiscal responsibility and ensures that public services are funded through user fees when appropriate.

---

#### **Scope of the Provision**
- Applies to **requests for advance income tax rulings**.
- The fee applies to **individuals or entities** who receive such a ruling.
- The fee is **not a tax**, but a **service charge** for administrative processing.
- The Minister of National Revenue will determine the amount, method, and conditions under which the fee is applied, subject to public notice and consultation (as required under the Financial Administration Act).

---

#### **Conclusion**
This regulation marks a significant shift in the administrative model for advance income tax rulings. By revoking outdated provisions and empowering the Minister of National Revenue to prescribe a service fee, the government establishes a **modern, accountable, and financially sustainable system** for delivering tax advice. It ensures that the cost of providing a service is borne by the person receiving it—thereby promoting fairness, efficiency, and fiscal responsibility in Canada’s tax administration.

---

### **In Simple Terms:**
> The government is removing an old rule that didn’t charge people for advance tax rulings. Now, anyone who asks for a tax ruling will have to pay a fee for the service. This fee covers the cost of providing the ruling, and the tax minister will decide how much to charge. This makes the system fairer and more efficient.
