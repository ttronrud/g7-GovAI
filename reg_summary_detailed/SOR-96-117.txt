### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Oil and Gas Geophysical Operations Regulations**

The **Canada Oil and Gas Geophysical Operations Regulations** (the "Regulations") were made under **section 14 of the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA)**, following a public consultation period. These Regulations provide a comprehensive framework governing the **planning, authorization, conduct, and safety** of geophysical operations related to oil and gas exploration in Canada — both onshore and offshore.

---

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

The Regulations are designed to:
- Ensure the **safe and environmentally responsible** conduct of geophysical operations.
- Protect **public safety, property, and the environment**.
- Regulate the use of **seismic energy sources**, including explosives, air guns, and electrical systems.
- Establish clear **procedures for permitting, operations, and emergency response**.

These Regulations apply to **any geophysical operation** conducted in areas subject to the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*, including both **onshore** (land-based) and **offshore** (marine-based) operations.

---

## **2. Key Definitions**

The Regulations define key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Geophysical Operation** | Any indirect measurement or investigation of the earth's subsurface to locate oil/gas, assess seabed conditions, or evaluate pipeline routes. Includes seismic, resistivity, gravimetric, magnetic, electrical, and geochemical surveys. *Excludes velocity or vertical seismic surveys not involving walkaway methods.* |
| **Seismic Survey** | Uses acoustic waves generated by an energy source (e.g., air gun, explosive, or electrical charge) that travel through the earth, reflect off layers, and are recorded. |
| **Shotpoint** | The surface location where a seismic energy source is placed. |
| **Geophysical Crew** | Personnel engaged in the actual survey work; excludes members of the vessel/platform complement. |
| **Complement** | All persons on a vessel or platform whose primary duties involve operating the vessel or platform. |
| **Operator** | The person who holds a geophysical operation authorization. |
| **Participant** | A party to a participation agreement in a shared survey. |
| **Participation Survey** | A survey where an operator and one or more participants jointly acquire and share data. |
| **Non-Exclusive Survey** | A survey where data are sold to the public in whole or part. |
| **Explosive** | As defined in the *Explosives Act*. |
| **Seismic Energy Source** | Any device used to generate acoustic waves (e.g., air gun, gas exploder, electrical charge). |

## **3. Authorization Process**

### **Application Requirements**
- Any person may apply for a **geophysical operation authorization** by submitting **three copies of a completed application form** to the **Chief Conservation Officer**.
- Applications must be submitted **at least**:
  - **30 days before** the planned start date for **onshore** operations.
  - **90 days before** the start date if **chemical explosives** are planned (offshore or onshore).
  - **30 days before** the start date if **non-explosive** sources (e.g., air guns, electrical) are used.

### **Extensions and Modifications**
- To extend the duration of an authorized operation:
  - Submit application **at least 15 days before** the end of the current period or the new planned start date (if modified).
- For any modification (other than duration):
  - Submit application **at least 15 days before** the operation begins or the start of the modified operation.

### **Notification Requirements**
- Upon **commencement, termination, or cancellation**, the operator must **notify the Chief Conservation Officer in writing** immediately.

---

## **4. Posting of Authorization**

- The operator must **post a copy of the authorization**:
  - On the **vessel, platform, or aircraft** (offshore), or
  - At the **field location** (onshore) in a **conspicuous place**.

---

## **5. Environmental and Property Safeguards**

- Operators must take **all reasonable measures** to prevent damage to property during operations.
- In case of a **fire** resulting from a geophysical operation:
  - The operator must take **safe and reasonable steps** to control, extinguish, and minimize risks to people, property, or the environment.

---

## **6. Waste Management**

All refuse from operations must be handled as follows:
- **Fuel, oil, oily materials, or lubricants** must be collected in a **closed system**.
- **Oil or oily waste** not burned on-site must be transported in a **suitable container** to a **land-based waste disposal facility**.
- **Combustible material burned on vessels/platforms** must be done with precautions to prevent endangering personnel or the vessel.

---

## **7. Offshore Operations – Air Gun Safety Requirements**

When using **air guns** (common in marine seismic surveys), operators must ensure:

1. **Maintenance & Condition**:
   - Components kept clean (no dirt, oil, grease).
   - Regular inspection of air vessels, manifolds, lines, and compressors for wear or abrasion.
   - Defective parts replaced promptly.

2. **Compliance with Specifications**:
   - All fittings, valves, hoses, and electrical lines must meet the **manufacturer’s specifications**.

3. **Pressure Management**:
   - Maintain **as low pressure as possible** but sufficient to keep the air gun seated.
   - **No firing risk** from accidental discharge.

4. **Pre-Test Procedures**:
   - **No maintenance** on air guns until:
     - Air pressure is fully bled off.
     - The shuttle can be moved freely with a wooden tool (proof of depressurization).
   - **One air gun only** tested at a time.

5. **Test-Firing Protocol**:
   - A **siren must sound** to alert personnel within an **8-meter radius**.
   - Area must be **clear of unauthorized persons**.
   - High-pressure hoses secured with **safety chains** to prevent whipping.
   - Air pressure must be **below 500 psi**.
   - **Person in charge** must be informed of the test.

6. **Prohibited Activities**:
   - **No test-firing** while divers are within **1,500 meters** of the air gun.
   - **No test-firing** without **prior approval from the Chief Safety Officer**.
