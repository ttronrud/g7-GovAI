**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Accrued Interest from the Federal Share of the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan Account to the Province of Manitoba

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
On the recommendation of:  
- The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food  
- The Treasury Board  

**Legal Basis:**  
Subsection 23(2.1) of the *Financial Administration Act*  

**Purpose:**  
To transfer to the Province of Manitoba any interest that has accrued on the federal share of the *Gross Revenue Insurance Plan (GRIP) Account* up to and including March 31, 2002.

**Key Details:**

1. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The regulation authorizes the transfer of interest—specifically, interest that has accumulated over time on the federal portion of the GRIP Account—directly to the Province of Manitoba. This interest is not a principal amount but rather the financial return (income) generated on the federal contribution to the account.

2. **Time Period Covered:**  
   The interest in question is all interest that accrued from the inception of the federal share of the GRIP Account up to and including **March 31, 2002**. This date marks the end of a specific fiscal or accounting period and may be significant due to policy, funding, or administrative reasons.

3. **Account Involved:**  
   The *Gross Revenue Insurance Plan (GRIP) Account* is a federal-provincial partnership program designed to provide insurance coverage to farmers and agricultural producers against losses due to poor crop yields or other revenue-related risks. The federal government contributes to this account, and the interest earned on that contribution is typically shared with participating provinces.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under *subsection 23(2.1) of the Financial Administration Act*, which permits the Governor General in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to remit funds to provinces under certain conditions, particularly when it is deemed to be in the public interest. This provision allows for the redistribution of interest or other financial returns from federal accounts to provincial governments for the benefit of public services.

5. **Reason for Transfer (Public Interest):**  
   The regulation explicitly states that the transfer is being made "in the public interest." This implies that the federal government believes that returning the interest to Manitoba will benefit the province—potentially through improved agricultural support, enhanced rural development, or greater financial stability for farmers and rural communities.

6. **Implication for Manitoba:**  
   Manitoba receives a direct financial benefit in the form of interest income previously held by the federal government. This strengthens the province’s access to funds for agricultural programs, insurance support, or other public purposes tied to rural and agricultural economies.

7. **No New Funding or Ongoing Obligations:**  
   This is a one-time transfer of interest, not a new funding commitment or ongoing financial obligation. It does not alter the structure of the GRIP program or the future federal contributions to the account.

8. **Administrative Process:**  
   The transfer is carried out through a formal regulatory instrument issued by the Governor General in Council, following the recommendations of both the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (who oversees agricultural policy and programs) and the Treasury Board (which oversees federal financial administration and fiscal policy).

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a fiscal adjustment under federal-provincial financial cooperation. It transfers interest income from the federal share of the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan to the Province of Manitoba, effective as of March 31, 2002. The move is grounded in statutory authority and justified on the grounds of public interest, particularly in supporting Manitoba’s agricultural sector and rural communities. It reflects a commitment to equitable sharing of financial returns from federal investments in provincial programs.
