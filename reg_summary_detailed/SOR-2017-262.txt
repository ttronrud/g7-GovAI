**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulatory instrument is a **Critical Habitat Order** issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk. The Order was made by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** on **November 30, 2017**, and came into force upon registration.

The legal basis for this Order is rooted in **Section 58** of SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29), specifically:

- **Section 58(1)**: Defines the scope of critical habitat protection — it applies to the critical habitat of a listed species.
- **Section 58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat for a species listed as endangered.
- **Section 58(5)**: Provides the Minister with the power to issue an Order to define and designate the critical habitat of a species.

The Order is issued pursuant to these provisions, affirming the government’s obligation to identify and protect the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the North Atlantic Right Whale.

### **2. Species at Risk**

The species in question is the **North Atlantic Right Whale (*Eubalaena glacialis*)**, which is:

- **Legally listed as "endangered"** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Species at Risk Act**.
- One of the most endangered marine mammals in the world, with a population that has declined significantly due to threats such as ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and climate change impacts.

---

### **3. Recovery Strategy and Public Registry**

- A **formal recovery strategy** for the North Atlantic Right Whale was developed and approved by the Government of Canada.
- This strategy identifies the **critical habitat** — the specific areas required for the species’ survival and recovery — and has been **published in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access.
- The inclusion in the Public Registry means the critical habitat designation is officially recognized and accessible to stakeholders, researchers, and the public.

### **4. Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Section 58(2)b)**

A key procedural point in the Order is that:

> *"No portion of the critical habitat of that species that is specified in the annexed Order is in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of that Act."*

This clause is significant because:

- **Section 58(2)b** of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are:
  - Located in a **prohibited area** (such as a national park, wildlife reserve, or other protected area) **unless** the designation is consistent with the purpose of those areas.
- By affirming that **none of the designated critical habitat falls within such a prohibited area**, the Minister ensures that the Order does not conflict with existing protected designations.
- This confirms that the designation is lawful and does not infringe upon existing land or marine use restrictions.

### **5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally designate and legally protect** the specific geographic areas that are essential for the North Atlantic Right Whale’s survival and recovery.
- These areas are where the whales must be to:
  - Breed,
  - Feed,
  - Calve,
  - Move seasonally,
  - And otherwise carry out essential life processes.

By legally defining these areas, the Order:

- **Provides legal protection** against activities that could degrade or destroy the habitat.
- **Requires federal and provincial agencies** to consult with the Minister before undertaking projects (e.g., construction, shipping routes, or offshore development) that may impact the designated habitat.
- **Supports recovery efforts** by ensuring that conservation actions are focused on the most critical areas.

---

### **6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- It is **binding on all federal departments and agencies**.
- Any activity that may adversely affect the critical habitat must undergo **environmental assessment and consultation** with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
- The Order is part of a broader framework of recovery planning and is intended to be **dynamic**, with potential future updates as new data emerge.

---

### **7. Significance and Broader Context**

- This Order is a key step in Canada’s commitment to **conserving biodiversity** and meeting its international obligations under agreements such as the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)** and the **International Whaling Commission (IWC)**.
- It reflects the importance of **marine conservation**, especially in the **North Atlantic**, where right whale populations are under severe threat.
- The designation supports **collaborative efforts** with Indigenous communities, scientists, shipping industries, and conservation groups to reduce threats like ship strikes and entanglement.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the North Atlantic Right Whale (Eubalaena glacialis) Order* is a legally binding, science-based designation that formally protects the essential areas required for the survival and recovery of this endangered species. Issued under the authority of the *Species at Risk Act*, the Order ensures that critical habitat is identified, preserved, and managed to support long-term recovery. It also confirms compliance with legal requirements, including the absence of overlap with prohibited areas, and serves as a foundational element in Canada’s broader marine conservation strategy.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The North Atlantic Right Whale is legally protected as an endangered species.
- The critical habitat has been identified in a recovery strategy and is publicly accessible.
- The Order legally designates specific areas as critical habitat.
- No portion of the designated habitat is in a prohibited area under SARA, making the Order lawful.
- The Order enables federal agencies to prevent harmful activities and supports species recovery through habitat protection.
