### **Regulation Summary: Fruit Remission Order, 2006**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is based on **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which empowers the government to grant remissions (reductions or waivers) of customs duties under specific conditions.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary purpose is to **grant a remission of customs duties** for certain imported fruits that were processed during a specified calendar year.
- This remission applies to **specific companies** and **specific products**, with limits defined in the attached schedule.

#### **3. Scope of the Remission**
- **Applicable Entities**: The remission applies to a **company listed in Column I** of the attached schedule.
- **Product Type**: The product must be one listed in **Column II** of the schedule.
- **Import Purpose**: The product must have been **imported for processing** during the year specified in **Column III**.
- **Duty Amount**: The remission covers **up to the amount specified in Column IV** of the schedule. This means that only a portion of the customs duty paid or payable is waived — not the full amount.

> Example: If a company imported apples for processing in 2005, and the schedule specifies a remission of $50,000, then up to $50,000 of the customs duty owed on that import can be forgiven.

#### **4. Key Condition – Timely Claim Submission**
- A **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.
- The claim must be made **no later than December 31, 2008**.
- This deadline is critical: any claim submitted after this date will not be eligible for remission under this order.

> Note: The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is the designated authority responsible for processing such claims, which may reflect a historical administrative arrangement or transfer of duties in the Canadian government structure.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette or otherwise made available through the official government registry).
- This means the remission provisions are active from that date onward, provided all eligibility and procedural requirements are met.

#### **6. Legal and Practical Implications**
- This is a **targeted, time-limited relief measure** designed to support specific industries (likely the fruit processing sector) during a particular period.
- It reflects a policy objective of encouraging or supporting **processing activities** by reducing the financial burden of importing raw materials.
- The limitation to a specific year (Column III) and product (Column II) ensures that the remission is not broadly applied, maintaining fiscal accountability.

#### **7. Important Limitations**
- The remission is **not automatic** — it requires a formal claim to be filed by the deadline.
- The maximum remission amount (Column IV) is capped, preventing unlimited benefit.
- The eligibility is restricted to **only those companies and products listed in the attached schedule** — no general or blanket application.

### **Conclusion**
The *Fruit Remission Order, 2006* is a **fiscal relief measure** under Canadian customs law that allows certain qualifying companies to reclaim up to a specified amount of customs duties on fruits imported for processing during a designated year.
