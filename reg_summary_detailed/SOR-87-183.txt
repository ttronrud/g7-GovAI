### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Content:**
The text does **not** contain the actual regulation itself — instead, it is a list of **repeal notices**. This means that the referenced provisions of prior regulations have been formally **removed or canceled** by later legislation.

**2. Key Repeal References:**

- **SOR/2010-120, s. 282**  
  This section of the *Statutory Regulation 2010-120* (a regulatory amendment or order issued by the Ontario government) **repeals multiple previous provisions**. The repeated citation indicates that **numerous sections** of earlier regulations were removed under this single repeal clause.  
  - The specific section number (s. 282) is likely a broad repeal clause designed to remove outdated, redundant, or superseded rules.  
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization effort, such as streamlining administrative procedures, aligning with new laws, or eliminating obsolete requirements.

- **SOR/95-74, s. 8**  
  This refers to a regulation from **1995**, which was repealed. It likely dealt with a specific area of regulation (e.g., licensing, environmental standards, or occupational health/safety), though the exact subject is not specified in the text.

- **SOR/88-198, s. 8 and s. 10**  
  These are provisions from a regulation issued in **1988**, also repealed. These sections may have related to workplace safety, licensing, or public health, depending on the original context of that regulation.

**3. Legal and Regulatory Implications:**
- Once a regulation is **repealed**, it is no longer legally enforceable.  
- The repeal means that any legal obligations, penalties, or procedural requirements previously governed by those sections are **no longer in effect**.  
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Eliminate outdated or conflicting rules
  - Improve clarity and coherence in the regulatory framework
  - Reflect changes in policy or law (e.g., new legislation or administrative reforms)

**4. Context and Significance:**
- The repeated appearance of **SOR/2010-120, s. 282** suggests that this single section was responsible for repealing a large number of provisions — possibly across multiple related regulations.  
- This kind of sweeping repeal is common in regulatory reform, where a government seeks to consolidate or simplify rules.  
- The repeal of older provisions (e.g., from 1988 or 1995) indicates that the current regulatory framework is modernized and updated to meet contemporary needs.

**5. Important Note:**
- The text provided **does not contain the original regulation** that was repealed — only the notice of its repeal.  
- To understand the **original content** of the repealed provisions, one would need to consult historical versions of the regulations referenced (e.g., SOR/88-198, SOR/95-74, or SOR/2010-120).

### Conclusion:

The provided text is a **list of repeals**, not a regulation itself. It indicates that **multiple provisions** from prior Ontario regulations — primarily under **SOR/88-198, SOR/95-74**, and especially **SOR/2010-120, s. 282** — have been **officially canceled**. This reflects a regulatory update or reform effort to remove outdated or redundant rules. The repeal was enacted to modernize the legal framework and ensure alignment with current policy and administrative standards.

> 🔍 **Recommendation**: To fully understand the scope and impact of these repeals, one should consult the full text of the original regulations (e.g., SOR/88-198, SOR/95-74) and the detailed content of SOR/2010-120, particularly section 282, in the official Ontario government legislation database (e.g., [www.ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca) or the *Regulations Act* database).
