---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulation is enacted under **section 3 of the Intelligence Commissioner Act**.
- Section 3 empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to designate a Minister as responsible for the administration and oversight of the Intelligence Commissioner Act.
- This designation is not merely procedural—it establishes formal accountability and responsibility for the Act’s implementation.

---

### **2. Key Provisions and Meaning**

- **Designation of the Prime Minister**: The Prime Minister is officially designated as the **Minister responsible** for the Intelligence Commissioner Act.
- This means that the Prime Minister holds the **primary administrative and policy responsibility** for the Act, including:
  - Ensuring the Act is properly implemented.
  - Overseeing the operations and accountability of the Intelligence Commissioner.
  - Providing direction to the Commissioner and relevant agencies in matters related to intelligence oversight.
  - Responding to reports or inquiries under the Act.
- The designation is **formal and legally binding**, creating a clear line of ministerial responsibility.

---

### **3. Purpose and Rationale**

The designation serves several key governmental and institutional purposes:

- **Accountability**: It ensures that the federal government has a clear, high-level ministerial point of accountability for the oversight of intelligence activities. This enhances transparency and public trust in the intelligence regime.
- **Policy Direction**: The Prime Minister, as head of government, is in a position to set the overall policy framework for intelligence oversight, ensuring alignment with national security and democratic values.
- **Coordination**: It facilitates coordination between the Office of the Intelligence Commissioner and other federal departments, particularly those involved in intelligence and security.
- **Compliance with Constitutional and Legal Principles**: The Act is designed to uphold democratic oversight of intelligence activities. By assigning responsibility to the Prime Minister, the government ensures that intelligence oversight is integrated into the broader governance structure.

### **4. Implications**

- **Role of the Intelligence Commissioner**: While the Commissioner is the independent statutory body responsible for oversight, the Prime Minister’s designation ensures that the government remains accountable to Parliament and the public for the Commissioner’s work.
- **Potential for Political Influence**: Critics may argue that designating the Prime Minister as the responsible minister could create a potential conflict of interest or risk politicization of intelligence oversight. However, the Act includes safeguards to ensure independence, such as the Commissioner’s statutory powers to investigate and report without political interference.
- **Parliamentary Accountability**: The designation supports the principle that the Minister responsible for a public office must be answerable to Parliament, especially in matters of national security and democratic oversight.

### **5. Context within the Intelligence Commissioner Act**

The *Intelligence Commissioner Act* establishes an independent office to oversee the activities of intelligence agencies in Canada (such as the Canadian Security Intelligence Service – CSIS and the Communications Security Establishment – CSE). The Act is designed to ensure that these agencies operate within the bounds of the law, protect civil liberties, and maintain public trust.

By designating the Prime Minister as the responsible minister, the government affirms that:
- The oversight of intelligence activities is a matter of national importance.
- The Prime Minister plays a central role in ensuring that intelligence operations are conducted lawfully and transparently.
- The Commissioner operates under the authority of a responsible minister, which is consistent with Canadian administrative and constitutional practice.

### **6. Conclusion**

This regulation formally assigns the Prime Minister the role of Minister responsible for the *Intelligence Commissioner Act*. It is a critical step in establishing clear governance and accountability for the oversight of Canada’s intelligence agencies. While it centralizes responsibility at the highest level of government, it operates within a framework designed to protect the independence and integrity of the Intelligence Commissioner’s office. The designation underscores the balance between national security needs and democratic accountability.
