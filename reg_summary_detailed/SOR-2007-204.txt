### **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolution on Lebanon (SOR/2024-138)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are a **domestic implementation** of **United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006)**, adopted on **August 11, 2006**, which addressed the situation in Lebanon, particularly in relation to the disarmament of armed groups, the establishment of a stable political framework, and the protection of civilians.

The Canadian government, acting under **Article 41 of the United Nations Charter**, which authorizes the Security Council to take action by military means if necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security, has adopted these regulations to **enable the effective application of the measures** outlined in UN Resolution 1701 within Canadian domestic law.

The regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**. This section empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations to implement the obligations arising from UN resolutions, particularly those involving international peace and security.

> **Key Point**: These regulations are not merely declaratory—they are binding legal instruments that impose specific restrictions on Canadian individuals and entities in relation to trade, movement, and assistance involving Lebanon.

#### **2. Definitions**

The following key terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Arms and related material** | Any weapon, ammunition, military vehicle, military or paramilitary equipment, and their spare parts. Includes all components used in the production, maintenance, or operation of such weapons. |
| **Canadian** | An individual who is a citizen of Canada under the Citizenship Act, or a body corporate incorporated or continued under Canadian or provincial law. |
| **Lebanon** | The Lebanese Republic, including all its political subdivisions (e.g., provinces, municipalities). |
| **Minister** | Refers specifically to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. |
| **Person** | Includes individuals, corporations, trusts, partnerships, funds, unincorporated associations, organizations, and foreign states. |

| **Technical data** | Includes blueprints, drawings, photographs, software, models, formulas, engineering designs, manuals, specifications, and any other technical information. |

> These definitions are critical because they establish the scope of what is prohibited under the regulations—particularly the distinction between arms and technical assistance.

#### **3. Prohibited Activities**

The core of the regulation is a **prohibition on direct or indirect dealings with Lebanon involving arms and technical assistance**.

##### **Prohibition 1: Export, Sale, Supply, or Shipping of Arms and Related Material**
> **No person in Canada and no Canadian outside Canada** may:
- Knowingly **export, sell, supply, or ship** (directly or indirectly) arms and related material **to any person in Lebanon**, regardless of where the material is located.

This includes:
- Physical movement of weapons or military equipment.
- Any form of supply chain or financial facilitation that enables such transfers.

##### **Prohibition 2: Carriage of Arms on Canadian Vessels or Aircraft**
> **No owner or master of a Canadian vessel** (as defined in Section 2 of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*) and **no operator of a Canadian-registered aircraft** may:
- Knowingly **carry, cause to be carried, or permit to be carried** arms and related material destined for Lebanon.

This applies even if the vessel or aircraft is en route to another country. It ensures that Canadian-flagged transport systems are not used to facilitate illicit transfers of military goods to Lebanon.

##### **Prohibition 3: Provision of Technical Assistance**
> No person in Canada or Canadian citizen abroad may:
- Knowingly **provide technical assistance** related to:
  - The **provision, manufacture, maintenance, or use** of arms and related material.

This includes:
- Training programs.
- Transfer of technical data (e.g., blueprints, software, design specifications).
- Consulting services that could enable the production or use of weapons.

> **Note**: This prohibition applies to all forms of assistance, even if not directly tied to arms sales.

---

#### **4. Exceptions: Authorized Activities**

Sections 3 to 5 (the main prohibitions) **do not apply** in the following cases:

- Arms and related material, or technical assistance related to such materials, that have been:
  - **Authorized in advance in writing by the Government of Lebanon**, or
  - **Approved in advance by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)**.

> This exception recognizes that certain legitimate governmental or UN-mandated activities may require cooperation with Lebanon, and allows for such activities to proceed without violating the regulations—provided they are formally approved.

---

#### **5. Broader Prohibition: Facilitation of Prohibited Activities**

> It is prohibited for any person in Canada or any Canadian outside Canada to:
- **Knowingly cause, facilitate, assist in, or intend to cause or assist in** any activity prohibited under Sections 3 to 5.

This includes:
- Providing financial support or services that enable or facilitate prohibited transfers.
- Using third-party intermediaries or shell companies to bypass the rules.
- Offering logistical support (e.g., shipping, storage, finance) that indirectly enables prohibited actions.

> This provision strengthens enforcement by addressing both direct and indirect facilitation.

#### **6. Exceptions for Humanitarian and Peace Support Activities**

Crucially, the regulations **do not prohibit** the following activities, which are essential for humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts:

- **Funding, processing, or payment of funds, financial assets, or economic resources**;
- **Provision of goods and services** necessary for:
  - The **timely delivery of humanitarian assistance**;
  - Supporting **basic human needs** in Lebanon.

These exceptions apply to:

| Entities Eligible |
|------------------|
| The **United Nations** (including its programs, funds, specialized agencies, and related bodies); |
| **International organizations**; |
| **Humanitarian organizations** with **observer status** granted by the UN General Assembly; |
| **Bilaterally or multilaterally funded non-governmental organizations (NGOs)** participating in: |
| - United Nations humanitarian response plans; |
| - Refugee response plans; |
| - Other UN appeals for assistance; |
| - Groups coordinated by the **UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)**; |
| - Their employees, grantees, subsidiaries, and implementing partners acting in those roles; |
| **Any other person authorized** by a **Security Council committee** established under Resolution 1636 (2005) (the "Committee of the Security Council").

> This ensures that Canada does not obstruct vital humanitarian work in Lebanon, while still upholding its international obligations to prevent the proliferation of weapons.

#### **7. Exemption Process for Prohibited Activities**

A person who wishes to engage in an activity prohibited under these regulations **must first apply in writing to the Minister of Foreign Affairs** for a **certificate of exemption**.

The Minister **must issue the certificate** if:
- The **Security Council did not intend** for the activity to be prohibited, or
- The activity has been **approved in advance** by:
  - The **Security Council**, or
  - The **Committee established under UN Security Council Resolution 1636 (2005)**.

> This creates a formal, transparent, and accountable process for exceptions—ensuring that any deviation from the general rule is based on explicit UN authorization.

---

#### **8. Legal Effect and Effective Date**

- These regulations are **binding on Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province**.
- They come into force on the **day of registration**.
- For the purposes of the **Statutory Instruments Act (paragraph 11(2)(a))**, the regulations **apply immediately upon enactment**, even before publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This means that the regulations are enforceable from the moment they are signed and registered, not after being officially published—ensuring timely compliance with international obligations.
