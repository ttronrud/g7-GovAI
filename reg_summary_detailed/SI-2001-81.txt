## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Supplementary Agreement to the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Republic of the Philippines**

### 🔹 **Background and Purpose**
This Supplementary Agreement was signed on **November 13, 1999**, in **Winnipeg**, Canada, to strengthen social security cooperation between **Canada** and the **Republic of the Philippines**. It builds upon the original **Agreement on Social Security**, signed on **September 9, 1994**, and aims to:

- Expand the scope of the original agreement by including the **Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)** of the Philippines into the material scope of the agreement.
- Improve coordination and mutual recognition of benefits for workers who have contributed in both countries.
- Address key issues such as creditable service, retirement and disability benefits, portability of contributions, and cross-border residency.

The agreement is designed to ensure that individuals who work or reside in both countries can receive social security benefits (e.g., retirement, disability, survivorship, funeral) under a consistent and fair framework.

## 🔍 Key Provisions and Amendments

---

### 1. **Amendment of Definitions in Article I**

#### ➤ **Competent Authority**
- The definition of "competent authority" is updated:
  - Replaces "the Administrator of the Social Security System" with:
    > *"the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Social Security System, and the President and General Manager of the Government Service Insurance System, each to the extent of his or her responsibility for the administration of the legislation specified in Article II 1(b)"*
  - This ensures that **both the Social Security System (SSS)** and the **Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)** have clearly defined roles in administering benefits.

#### ➤ **Competent Institution**
- A new phrase is added:
  > *"and the Government Service Insurance System, each to the extent that it is responsible under the legislation specified in Article II 1(b) for a matter under consideration"*
  - This clarifies that GSIS is now a recognized **competent institution** in the context of benefit administration.

#### ➤ **Creditable Period**
- The old definition of "creditable period" is **deleted** and replaced with a new, more precise one:
  
  > *"Creditable period means, as regards Canada, a period of contribution or residence used to acquire the right to a benefit under the legislation of Canada, and includes a period during which a disability pension is payable under the Canada Pension Plan; and, as regards the Republic of the Philippines, a period of contribution or creditable service used to acquire the right to a benefit under the legislation of the Republic of the Philippines, and includes a period during which a disability benefit is payable under that legislation, but does not include a period of contribution or creditable service for which contributions have been refunded."*

  ✅ **Key Points:**
  - Creditable periods include time when a person receives disability benefits.
  - Refunded contributions are **excluded** from being counted as creditable.
  - The definition is **country-specific** and applies separately to Canada and the Philippines.

#### ➤ **Government of Canada**
- The term "Government of Canada" is **deleted** from the agreement.  
  → This likely reflects a shift toward more precise reference to institutions rather than broad governmental entities.

### 2. **Amendment of Article II – Scope of Legislation**

#### ➤ **Sub-paragraph 1(b) (Revised)**
- The scope of legislation covered is expanded to include:
  1. **Social Security Act of 1997** – for retirement, disability, death, and funeral benefits.
  2. **Government Service Insurance Act of 1997** – for retirement, disability, survivorship, and funeral benefits.
  3. **Portability Law** – to allow **totalizing of creditable service** under both acts.

> 🔍 This is a major expansion: GSIS is now formally recognized under the agreement, and its retirement, disability, and survivorship benefits are now eligible for mutual recognition.

> ✅ The **Portability Law** enables individuals to combine their contributions from both Canada and the Philippines to meet eligibility requirements — a key feature for workers who move between the two countries.

---

### 3. **Amendment of Article VI – Employer and Contribution Terms**

- A new phrase is inserted:  
  > *"or a related" between "same" and "employer"*

  → This likely means that **"same employer or a related employer"** is now recognized, allowing for broader recognition of employment relationships (e.g., subsidiaries, affiliated companies) when determining eligibility for benefits.

---

### 4. **Amendment of Article VII – Residency and Contribution Requirements**

#### ➤ **Sub-paragraph (a) – Residency in the Philippines**
- Adds: *"presence or residence in the territory of the Philippines"*
- Clarifies: A person is subject to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan **only if** they make contributions during that period due to **employment or self-employment**.

#### ➤ **Sub-paragraph (b) – Residency in Canada**
- Similarly, a person is subject to Philippine legislation **only if** they make **compulsory contributions** during a period of presence/residence in Canada due to **employment or self-employment**.

> 🔍 This ensures that **only active contributors** are recognized — not passive residents or those with no formal employment ties.

#### ➤ **Redesignation and New Paragraph 2**
- The existing Article VII is redesignated as **Paragraph 1**.
- A new **Paragraph 2** is inserted, which reinforces the requirement that:
  - A person must have made **actual contributions** during the period of residence to be considered subject to either country’s pension plan.

> ✅ This strengthens the link between **residency and contribution activity**, preventing benefit claims based on mere presence.

---

### 5. **Amendment of Article VIII – Benefit Entitlement and Creditability**

#### ➤ **Sub-paragraph 2(b)**
- Changes:  
  > Deletes "of contributions" → replaces with **"which are creditable"**

  → Now refers to **creditable months** (i.e., months with valid contributions), not just total months.

#### ➤ **Paragraph 4**
- Adds: **"survivorship, funeral"** after "disability"
  → Ensures that **survivor and funeral benefits** are included in the list of benefits covered under the agreement.

> ✅ This broadens the scope of benefits to include family protection and end-of-life support.

---

### 6. **Amendment of Article XIII – Conditions for Benefit Entitlement**

#### ➤ **New Paragraph 2 (Inserted after Paragraph 1)**
> *"Where the legislation of the Philippines makes entitlement to the payment of a benefit conditional upon the fact that a person is in the service at the time of the occurrence of the contingency giving rise to that benefit, the condition shall be deemed to be met if, at that time, the person concerned is subject to the Canada Pension Plan. For the purpose of this paragraph, a person shall be deemed to be subject to the Canada Pension Plan if the contingency occurs during a calendar year which is a creditable period under that Plan in respect of that person."*

> 🔍 **Significance:**
- If a Filipino employee is in service at the time of a disability or death, and they are **subject to the CPP** during that calendar year (i.e., have a creditable period), then the **Philippine law’s service requirement is satisfied**.
- This allows **Philippine benefits** to be granted even if the individual was not formally employed in the Philippines at the time of the event — as long as they had CPP coverage during that year.

> ✅ This is a significant **benefit for Filipino workers in Canada**, especially those in temporary or part-time roles.

---

### 7. **Amendment of Article XVIII – Date of Claim Submission**

- A new sentence is added:
  > *"The date of presentation of a claim, notice or appeal to the authority or institution of the other Party shall be deemed to be the date of its presentation to the competent authority or institution of the first Party."*

> 🔍 This ensures **consistency in claim processing timelines**:
- If a claim is submitted to one country’s authority, it is considered submitted to the **first Party** (the one where the claim was initiated), regardless of where it is processed.
- Prevents disputes over whether a claim was timely filed.

---

### 8. **New Paragraph 4 in Article XIX – Currency Controls and Financial Restrictions**

> *"In the event that a Party imposes currency controls or other similar measures that restrict payments, remittances or transfers of funds or financial instruments to persons who are outside its territory, that Party shall, without delay, take suitable measures to ensure the payment of any amount that must be paid in accordance with this Agreement to persons described in Article III who reside in the territory of the other Party."*

> 🔍 **Purpose:**
- Addresses a major practical concern: **financial barriers** due to currency restrictions.
- Ensures that even if one country imposes controls, it will **take steps to facilitate payments** to residents of the other country.
- Prevents denial of benefits due to banking or remittance rules.

> ✅ A critical safeguard for cross-border financial flows.
