The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under Section 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under the authority of **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29). This provision empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the completion and receipt of scientific assessments of species at risk by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Purpose:**  
   The primary purpose of this Order is to formally recognize that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific assessments conducted by COSEWIC for specific species listed in the attached schedule. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of species—such as whether they are endangered, threatened, or of special concern—based on scientific data and expert analysis.

2. **Legal Context (Section 23(1) of SARA):**  
   Under SARA, COSEWIC is responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species at risk. Once a species is assessed, the findings are submitted to the federal government. Section 23(1) mandates that the Minister of the Environment, upon receiving these assessments, must notify the Governor in Council, thereby officially acknowledging the assessments and initiating the next steps in the legal and policy process.

3. **Formal Acknowledgment:**  
   The Order serves as an official, legally binding notification that the government has received and accepted the COSEWIC evaluations. This acknowledgment is a critical step in the regulatory process because it triggers the government’s obligation to:
   - Consider the species for listing in the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*,
   - Develop and implement recovery strategies,
   - Consider protective measures under SARA.

4. **Scope:**  
   The Order specifically refers to species listed in an **annexed schedule** (not included in your text). This schedule contains the names and scientific classifications of species that have been assessed by COSEWIC and are now formally recognized by the federal government. These species may include mammals, birds, fish, insects, plants, or other wildlife.

5. **Implications for Conservation:**  
   - Once acknowledged, the species are subject to further federal oversight under SARA.
   - The government may proceed with listing the species as endangered, threatened, or of special concern.
   - It may trigger the development of recovery plans, habitat protection measures, and other conservation actions.
   - It also establishes a foundation for potential regulatory actions, such as restrictions on activities that threaten the species.

6. **Governor in Council and Ministerial Role:**  
   The Order is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of the Environment**. This reflects the collaborative nature of SARA implementation, where scientific assessment (by COSEWIC) is followed by policy and regulatory action (by the federal government).

**Significance:**

This regulation is a foundational step in Canada’s species conservation framework. It ensures that:
- Scientific assessments are formally recognized,
- The government is legally bound to act on the findings,
- Conservation priorities are based on evidence,
- Public and environmental stakeholders are informed of the status of at-risk species.

It is part of a broader process under SARA that includes:
- COSEWIC assessments,
- Government listing of species,
- Development of recovery strategies,
- Implementation of protection measures.

**Conclusion:**

This Order is not a standalone conservation measure but a procedural and legal milestone. It confirms that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific findings of COSEWIC for specific wildlife species. This acknowledgment initiates the formal process of species protection under the *Species at Risk Act*, setting the stage for future conservation planning, policy development, and legal protections for the listed species.

**Note:**  
The actual list of species in the annexed schedule is not included in the provided text. To fully understand the scope of this regulation, one would need to refer to the original document (S.C. 2002, c. 29, as amended), where the schedule details the species involved.

This summary reflects the procedural, legal, and conservation significance of the regulation within the framework of Canada’s species at risk protection system.
