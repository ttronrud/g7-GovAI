**Detailed Summary of the CATSA Aerodrome Designation Regulations**

**Regulatory Text Summary:**

The *CATSA Aerodrome Designation Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act* (CATSA Act), are formally issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. This action is authorized specifically under **paragraph 34(a)** of the CATSA Act.

**Key Provisions and Purpose:**

1. **Legal Basis and Authority**:
   - The regulations are enacted pursuant to **paragraph 34(a)** of the *Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to designate aerodromes for the purposes of the Act.
   - This provision allows the government to identify and officially recognize specific airports or aerodromes that fall under the jurisdiction and oversight of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA).

2. **Purpose of the Regulations**:
   - The primary objective is to **designate specific aerodromes** (airports or airfields) that are subject to security screening and regulatory oversight by CATSA.
   - These designations ensure that security measures—such as passenger and cargo screening, access control, and threat assessment—are appropriately applied at designated locations where air travel begins or ends.
   - The designation helps establish a clear and legally binding framework for CATSA to carry out its mandate of protecting Canada’s air transport system from security threats.

3. **Scope and Content**:
   - The regulations include a **schedule** listing the specific aerodromes that are officially designated under this framework.
   - The list contains the names, locations, and potentially identifiers (such as ICAO codes or airport numbers) of the aerodromes included.
   - These designated aerodromes are subject to the security requirements and operational standards established by CATSA under the Act.

4. **Effective Date**:
   - The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
   - This means they become legally effective immediately upon publication, ensuring prompt implementation of the security designation framework.

5. **Legal Effect**:
   - Once registered, the designation of aerodromes in the schedule is binding and serves as a formal part of the CATSA Act.
   - It establishes the legal basis for CATSA to conduct security assessments, inspections, and enforcement activities at these locations.
   - The designation may also influence operational requirements for airlines, airport operators, and security personnel at those sites.

**Context and Significance**:

- These regulations are a foundational component of Canada’s national aviation security framework.
- By clearly identifying which aerodromes are under CATSA jurisdiction, the regulations support consistent, efficient, and accountable security practices across Canada’s aviation infrastructure.
- The designation process ensures that only those aerodromes that meet certain thresholds (e.g., volume of traffic, public access, or strategic importance) are included, helping to prioritize resources and focus security efforts where they are most needed.

**Citation and Source**:
- The regulations are published as **S.C. 2002, c. 9**, which refers to the Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 9.
- This indicates that the legislation was passed in 2002, reflecting an early phase in the development of Canada’s formal aviation security regime under CATSA.

**Conclusion**:

The *CATSA Aerodrome Designation Regulations* serve as a critical administrative instrument that legally identifies and assigns specific aerodromes to CATSA’s security oversight. By establishing a clear, enforceable list of designated sites, the regulations ensure that Canada’s civil aviation system is protected through targeted, compliant, and legally grounded security measures. The regulations are effective upon registration and form an essential part of the broader security architecture governing air travel in Canada.
