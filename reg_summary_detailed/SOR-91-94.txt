**Detailed Summary of the Taxation Statistics Diskette Fee Order (SI/88-188, 1988 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 4364)**

**Title:**  
Taxation Statistics Diskette Fee Order  

**Issuing Authority:**  
The Minister of National Revenue  

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **Order in Council P.C. 1988-2270**, dated September 29, 1988, and specifically under **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, the Minister has the authority to prescribe fees for services provided by the Government of Canada. This Order is an exercise of that statutory power.

**Effective Date:**  
January 10, 1991 (date of publication in the Canada Gazette)  

**Purpose of the Order:**  
To establish a standardized fee for individuals or entities requesting and receiving a computer diskette containing taxation statistics from the Minister of National Revenue.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Fee Structure:**  
   A fee of **$27** is to be paid by any person who requests and receives a computer diskette containing taxation statistics from the Minister of National Revenue.

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The fee applies to:
   - Any individual or organization making a formal request to the Minister of National Revenue.
   - The supply of a computer diskette (typically a floppy disk or similar digital storage medium at the time) that contains official taxation statistics.

3. **Nature of the Product:**  
   The diskette contains **official taxation statistics**, which may include data on:
   - Tax rates and collections
   - Revenue trends
   - Taxpayer demographics
   - Compliance and reporting data  
   (The specific content may vary depending on the publication or release, but it is derived from official federal tax records.)

4. **Fee Payment Requirement:**  
   The fee is due **at the time of request** and must be paid in full before the diskette is supplied. The payment is non-refundable and is not waived under any circumstances.

5. **Citation:**  
   The Order may be cited as the **"Taxation Statistics Diskette Fee Order"**.

6. **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
   The Minister of National Revenue is authorized to enforce this fee as part of its administrative and financial operations. Non-compliance with the fee requirement may result in denial of the requested diskette.

**Context and Background:**  
This regulation was enacted during a period when government agencies were increasingly digitizing public information and making data accessible through electronic formats. The $27 fee was established to:
- Cover the administrative and technical costs associated with producing, distributing, and managing digital tax data.
- Ensure that the supply of such information was sustainable and properly funded.
- Maintain a consistent and transparent fee structure for users.

**Historical Note:**  
Although the original Order was made in 1988, it was formally published and came into force in 1991. This reflects a common practice in Canadian administrative law where regulatory instruments are issued but only become effective upon publication in the Canada Gazette.

**Relevance Today:**  
While the original regulation refers to "computer diskettes," which were standard in the 1980s and early 1990s, the principles of this Order—specifically the requirement to charge a fee for the provision of official statistical data—remain relevant. Modern equivalents may involve digital downloads, online access, or subscription-based services, with similar fee structures applied under updated regulations.

**Conclusion:**  
The Taxation Statistics Diskette Fee Order establishes a clear, enforceable fee of **$27 per diskette** for individuals or organizations seeking official taxation statistics in digital format from the Minister of National Revenue. It reflects a balance between public access to government data and the financial responsibility of providing such services. While the medium has evolved, the underlying regulatory framework continues to serve as a model for managing access to official statistical information.
