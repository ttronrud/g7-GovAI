### **Core Powers and Authorities Granted to the Commodity Board**

#### 1. **Regulatory Authority Over Interprovincial and Export Marketing**
The Commodity Board is authorized to regulate the **marketing of New Brunswick potatoes in interprovincial and export trade**. This includes the sale, transport, pricing, and distribution of potatoes beyond New Brunswick’s borders.

Importantly, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** it currently holds over the **local marketing of potatoes within New Brunswick**, including those derived from the Act and the Plan. This means that the same mechanisms—such as setting quality standards, managing supply, and establishing pricing rules—can be applied to interprovincial and export markets as they are used domestically.

> **Purpose**: Ensures consistency in standards, pricing, and quality across all markets, protecting producers and maintaining market integrity.

---

#### 2. **Power to Impose Levies and Charges on Producers and Marketers**

The Commodity Board has the authority to:
- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing** of New Brunswick potatoes.
- **Classify producers into different groups** (e.g., small farms, large-scale operations, exporters, etc.).
- **Set different levies or charges** for each group based on factors such as production volume, market participation, or type of operation.

> **Example**: A small producer might pay a lower levy than a large exporter, reflecting differences in scale and market impact.

---

#### 3. **Use of Levies and Charges for Specific Purposes**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for:
- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., to hold potatoes during oversupply or market downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of potatoes (e.g., due to market collapse or poor demand).
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers.  
  This means that if some producers earn significantly more than others during a given period, the Board can use levy funds to redistribute money to ensure fairer returns across the sector.

> **Purpose**: To stabilize the market, protect producers from volatility, and promote equity in returns, especially during periods of fluctuating demand or prices.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Order**

1. **Market Stability**  
   Prevents price crashes or surges in interprovincial and export markets by enabling proactive management of supply and demand.

2. **Producer Protection**  
   Ensures that producers—especially small-scale ones—are not disadvantaged by market forces or unfair competition.

3. **Equity and Fairness**  
   Through income equalization, the Order helps balance returns among producers regardless of size or market access.

4. **Financial Resilience**  
   Establishes a financial buffer (via levies and reserves) to absorb losses during poor market conditions.

5. **Consistency with Domestic Practices**  
   Applies the same rules and standards used in local marketing to ensure uniformity and transparency in all markets.

The Order is made under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to issue regulations to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including potatoes, in both domestic and export markets.
