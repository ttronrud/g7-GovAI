**Detailed Summary of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Designated Violations Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**

The *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Designated Violations Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This action is authorized under **paragraph 19(1)(a) of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (the "Act")**.

This provision empowers the Governor General to adopt regulations that designate specific conduct as violations that may be addressed under the enforcement provisions of the Act, specifically **Sections 20 to 31** of the Act. These sections outline the powers and procedures for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) to investigate, prosecute, and take enforcement action against entities or individuals that breach consumer protection standards.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **identify and formally designate specific types of conduct as "designated violations"** that the FCAC may proceed against under the enforcement framework established in the Act. By clearly defining what constitutes a violation, the regulations provide clarity and consistency in enforcement actions, ensuring that both regulators and regulated entities understand the scope of prohibited behavior.

**3. Designated Violations**

The Regulations designate the following two categories of conduct as violations that may be proceeded with under Sections 20 to 31 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act:

**a) Contravention of any consumer provision**  
- This refers to any breach of a provision in the Act or any other applicable legislation that is designed to protect consumers.  
- Consumer provisions typically include rules related to transparency, fair dealing, disclosure of fees, accurate advertising, access to financial services, and protection against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.  
- Examples may include misleading advertising, failure to disclose fees or terms, or engaging in predatory lending practices.  
- Any such contravention, regardless of its severity or context, falls under the scope of these designated violations.

**b) Non-compliance with any compliance agreement**  
- This refers to failure to adhere to a formal agreement entered into between a financial institution or entity and the government (or a regulatory body) under an Act listed in **Schedule 1 to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act**.  
- Schedule 1 lists the federal Acts that are relevant to financial services and consumer protection (e.g., the Banking Act, the Insurance Act, the Securities Act, etc.).  
- A compliance agreement may involve corrective measures, such as improving internal controls, conducting audits, or implementing specific consumer protection policies.  
- Failure to meet the terms or obligations set out in such an agreement constitutes a violation under these regulations and may trigger enforcement action by the FCAC.

**4. Enforcement Framework**

By designating these violations, the regulations activate the enforcement powers under **Sections 20 to 31 of the Act**, which include:

- The authority to initiate investigations  
- The power to issue notices of violation  
- The ability to require corrective actions  
- The power to impose penalties or fines  
- The right to seek injunctive relief or other remedies  
- The capacity to pursue legal action in court  

These powers are applied only when the designated violations are identified and substantiated.

---

**5. Effective Date**

The Regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means that once the regulations are officially published and registered, they are immediately enforceable. This ensures timely implementation and provides legal certainty for both regulators and regulated entities.

---

**6. Key Implications**

- **Clarity and Predictability**: The Regulations provide clear boundaries for what constitutes a violation, reducing ambiguity in enforcement.
- **Enforcement Focus**: They allow the FCAC to prioritize enforcement actions against serious or recurring consumer protection breaches.
- **Accountability**: Entities are held accountable not only for direct consumer harm but also for failing to meet obligations established through compliance agreements.
- **Interagency Coordination**: The reference to Schedule 1 ensures that enforcement actions are aligned with the broader regulatory framework across financial sectors.

**Conclusion**

The *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Designated Violations Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 9) serve as a critical enforcement tool by formally identifying and defining two major categories of violations—contravention of consumer protections and failure to comply with compliance agreements—under the authority of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act. These designated violations enable the FCAC to act decisively and consistently to uphold consumer rights and ensure accountability in the financial sector. The regulations are effective upon registration, ensuring immediate applicability and reinforcing the agency’s mandate to protect financial consumers.
