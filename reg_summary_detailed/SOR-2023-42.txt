**Detailed Summary of the Electronic Heated Tobacco Products Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)), and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This provision allows for the remission (i.e., refund or cancellation) of customs duties in specific circumstances involving changes in tariff classification.

The regulation is rooted in the **Customs Tariff** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which governs the classification, duties, and importation of goods into Canada.

**2. Definition of "Goods"**  
The term **"goods"** is specifically defined in the Order as those items that:

- Were **imported into Canada on or after January 1, 2022**,  
- And were **classified under tariff item No. 2404.11.00** in the *List of Tariff Provisions* as it existed on **January 1, 2022**,  
- But would have been classified under **tariff item No. 2403.99.90** if they had been imported on **December 31, 2021**.

This distinction is critical because it reflects a **change in tariff classification** due to a revision in the tariff schedule. The classification change implies a shift in the applicable customs duty rate, which forms the basis for the remission.

> **Key Point**: The goods are not those that were classified differently in the past, but specifically those that were subject to a *classification change* between December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2022.

---

**3. Purpose of the Remission**  
The Order provides for a **remission of customs duties** for eligible goods imported during the period:

- From **January 1, 2022**,  
- To **the day before the Order comes into force**.

The remission is calculated as the **difference between**:

- The **customs duty actually paid or payable** at the rate applicable on the **date of importation**,  
- And the **customs duty that would have been payable** if the goods had been imported on **December 31, 2021** (i.e., the duty rate in effect prior to the classification change).

> In simpler terms:  
> If the duty rate was higher on January 1, 2022 (due to the new classification), the importer is entitled to a refund of the **difference** between the higher rate and the lower rate that would have applied had the goods been imported earlier.

This mechanism effectively **reduces the financial burden** on importers of electronic heated tobacco products due to a temporary, unintended increase in duty rates caused by a tariff revision.

**4. Conditions for Claiming Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, the importer must:

- **Submit a claim to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the responsible federal minister)  
- Within **two years of the date of importation** of the goods.

> This two-year window is a strict deadline. Failure to submit a claim within this period will result in the forfeiture of the right to remission.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (typically published in the Canada Gazette). This means the remission provisions are only available for goods imported during the specified period (January 1, 2022, to the day before registration).

---

**6. Scope and Implications**  
- The Order applies **only to electronic heated tobacco products** (EHTPs) that were subject to a classification change from 2403.99.90 to 2404.11.00.  
- It does not apply to other tobacco products or goods not affected by this specific tariff revision.  
- It is a **corrective measure** to prevent undue financial impact on importers due to a change in tariff classification that was not anticipated at the time of importation.

---

**7. Regulatory and Economic Context**  
This remission Order likely responds to a **tariff revision** that occurred on or around January 1, 2022, where the Canadian government reclassified certain heated tobacco products. The change may have been part of broader regulatory efforts to better categorize and regulate novel tobacco products. However, such a change could have inadvertently increased the cost of importing these products.

By providing a duty remission, the government acknowledges the **economic impact** on importers and ensures compliance with the principle of **fair and predictable trade practices**.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a targeted, temporary measure designed to:

- Correct an unintended increase in customs duties due to a change in tariff classification,  
- Provide financial relief to importers of electronic heated tobacco products,  
- Ensure compliance with customs rules while maintaining fiscal accountability,  
- And protect the integrity of the tariff system through a clear, time-bound, and transparent process.

It is a practical example of how customs policy can be adjusted to respond to real-world impacts, particularly in emerging product categories like heated tobacco.
