**Detailed Summary of the United Nations Sudan Regulations (as adopted under the United Nations Act)**

---

### **Background and Legal Basis**

The **United Nations Sudan Regulations** are a Canadian regulatory instrument enacted under **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to implement measures derived from **United Nations Security Council Resolutions**—specifically, **Resolution 1556 (2004)** and subsequent resolutions such as **Resolution 1591 (2005)** and **Resolution 2035 (2012)**.

These regulations are designed to **enforce international sanctions** against the **Republic of Sudan**, particularly in response to human rights abuses, conflict, and violations of international peace and security. The primary objective is to **prevent Canada from participating in or enabling activities that support or facilitate aggression, arms proliferation, or violations of international law in Sudan**.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations establish clear definitions to ensure consistency and legal precision:

- **Arms and related material**: Includes weapons, ammunition, military equipment (including vehicles), paramilitary equipment, and their spare parts.
- **Canadian**: A citizen under the Citizenship Act or any entity established, incorporated, or continued under Canadian or provincial law.
- **Committee of the Security Council**: A specialized body established under Resolution 1591 (2005), responsible for monitoring and overseeing implementation of sanctions related to Sudan.
- **Designated person**: A person named by the UN Security Council under Resolution 1591 (2005) or Resolution 2035 (2012). These individuals or entities are subject to targeted sanctions.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several definitions have been **repealed** (e.g., "property," "technical data") by **SOR/2020-122**, indicating that these regulations are now superseded or amended.
