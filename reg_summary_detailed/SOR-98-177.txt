**Detailed Summary of the National Parks Domestic Animals Regulations, 1998**

---

### **Overview**
The *National Parks Domestic Animals Regulations, 1998* (S.C. 1996, c. 10, s. 246) are a set of rules established under the *National Parks Act* by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. These regulations govern the **bringing into, keeping, and management of domestic animals within Canadian national parks and park reserves**, with the primary objectives of **protecting natural ecosystems, ensuring public safety, minimizing disturbances to wildlife, and maintaining the integrity of park environments**.

The regulations were enacted to balance the recreational and practical needs of visitors and land users with strict environmental and safety protections. They came into force on **March 19, 1998**, and have been amended over time (notably by SOR/2005-350), though key provisions remain in effect.
