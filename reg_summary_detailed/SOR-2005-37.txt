**Authority:**  
The Attorney General of Canada, acting under the authority granted in **paragraph (b)a of the definition of "approved container"** in **subsection 254(1)** of the *Criminal Code of Canada*.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
To formally approve specific blood sample collection containers as acceptable and suitable for use in accordance with **section 258 of the Criminal Code**, which governs the collection, preservation, and handling of blood samples in criminal investigations.

**Approved Containers:**  
The following containers are officially approved for use in collecting blood samples for forensic analysis under the Criminal Code:

1. **Vacutainer® XF947**

2. **BD Vacutainer™ 367001**  
   – A brand-name evacuated tube manufactured by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD), with model number 367001. This container is designed to hold blood and maintain sample integrity.

3. **Vacutainer® 367001**

**Key Legal and Practical Implications:**

- **Legal Admissibility:** Blood samples collected in these approved containers are considered reliable and admissible in court, provided the collection and handling procedures comply with the requirements of the *Criminal Code* (particularly section 258).

- **Forensic Integrity:** The approval ensures that the containers are designed to prevent contamination, leakage, or degradation of blood samples during transport and storage.

- **Consistency and Standardization:** By approving specific models, the Order promotes consistency in forensic evidence collection across law enforcement agencies and laboratories.

- **Exclusivity:** Only containers listed in this Order are recognized as "approved" for use under section 258. The use of other containers (even if similar) would not be legally valid unless separately approved.

**Repeal Clause:**  
The regulation includes a "[Repeal]" clause, which indicates that this Order is not a permanent statute but a temporary administrative directive. It is valid only until it is formally replaced or revoked. However, in practice, such orders are typically not repealed unless explicitly stated or superseded by a new directive.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette* or other official registry). The registration date is not specified in the text, but the issuance date (February 11, 2005) is the likely date of registration, assuming no delay in publication.
