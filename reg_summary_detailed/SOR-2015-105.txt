**Detailed Summary of the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2015)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
This Order is issued under the authority of **subsection 117.14(1)a of the Canadian Criminal Code** (R.S.C., c. C-46), as recommended by the **Minister of Justice** and approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**.  
It is formally registered under **S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139**, which provides the legal framework for amnesties under the Criminal Code.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Non-restricted firearm**: A firearm that is *not* a prohibited firearm or a restricted firearm.  
  - This means the firearm is legally owned under certain conditions but does not fall into the more strictly regulated categories (e.g., prohibited due to criminal history or specific design, or restricted due to safety concerns or ownership limitations).

---

### **3. Scope of the Amnesty Period**
The amnesty period is declared for individuals who meet **one of the following two conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Licence Expired Between January 1, 2004, and May 16, 2015**
- The individual held or held a licence to possess firearms or a licence to possess and acquire firearms.
- The licence **expired during the period from January 1, 2004, to May 16, 2015**.

#### **Condition 2: Licence Expires Between May 17, 2015, and May 16, 2017**
- The individual holds or held a licence that is **set to expire during the period from May 17, 2015, to May 16, 2017**.

> **Note**: The amnesty applies to individuals who were in possession of a **non-restricted firearm** at any time during the amnesty period and who meet one of the above licence expiry criteria.

---

### **4. Purpose of the Amnesty Period**
The primary goal of this amnesty is to provide a **safe, legal, and structured pathway** for individuals to resolve their firearm-related obligations without facing criminal penalties. During the amnesty period, individuals may:

- **Obtain a new licence** to possess firearms (i.e., apply for or receive a valid licence to possess or acquire firearms).
- **Deactivate** the firearm so that it is no longer a functional firearm (e.g., by rendering it inoperable).
- **Export** the firearm in full compliance with all applicable Canadian and foreign laws (including the laws of the destination country).
- **Turn in the firearm** to a police officer or a firearms officer for **destruction or lawful disposal**.
- **Sell or give** the firearm to:
  - A **public service agency** (as defined in *section 1 of the Public Agents Firearms Regulations*), such as government institutions or law enforcement bodies;
  - A **business** (including museums) that holds a valid licence to acquire firearms; or
  - An **individual** who holds a valid licence to possess and acquire firearms.
- **Possess the firearm** temporarily before carrying out one of the above actions (i.e., possession is permitted as a transitional step).

> The amnesty allows for **flexible and lawful resolutions** of firearm possession issues, especially for those who lost or had their firearms licences lapse due to administrative or personal circumstances.

---

### **5. Timeline of the Amnesty Period**
- **Start Date**: May 17, 2015  
- **End Date**: May 16, 2017  
- The period is **exactly two years**, beginning on May 17, 2015, and ending on May 16, 2017.

> This timeframe was strategically chosen to allow sufficient time for individuals to act, while also providing a clear endpoint to ensure accountability and compliance.

---

### **6. Legal Effect and Enforcement**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., the official publication date in the Canada Gazette).
- It applies only to individuals who meet the defined eligibility criteria.
- The amnesty **does not apply to prohibited or restricted firearms** or to individuals who do not hold or previously held a valid firearms licence.
- The provisions are **non-punitive** — individuals are not criminally charged for possessing a non-restricted firearm during this period if they comply with the amnesty conditions.

---

### **7. Key Objectives and Implications**
- **Promotes public safety**: By enabling responsible disposal or re-use of firearms, the amnesty reduces the risk of unlicensed or unmonitored firearm possession.
- **Supports legal compliance**: Provides a clear, government-sanctioned process for individuals to return to lawful firearm ownership or disposal.
- **Encourages accountability**: Individuals are required to act within the defined period, ensuring that the amnesty is not a permanent or indefinite exception.
- **Supports administrative relief**: Helps individuals who experienced licence lapses due to life events (e.g., job changes, relocation, or personal circumstances) to regain or re-establish lawful firearm status.

### **Conclusion**
The **Order Declaring an Amnesty Period (2015)** is a targeted, legally grounded measure designed to assist individuals with expired or expiring firearms licences to legally and safely manage their firearm possession. It offers a range of lawful outcomes — including reacquiring a licence, deactivating, exporting, or donating a firearm — without facing criminal penalties during the specified two-year window (May 17, 2015 – May 16, 2017). This reflects a balance between public safety, individual rights, and regulatory compliance under the Canadian Criminal Code.

This amnesty is a **temporary and conditional relief**, intended to address specific administrative and personal challenges related to firearms licensing, rather than to encourage or condone unregulated firearm ownership.
