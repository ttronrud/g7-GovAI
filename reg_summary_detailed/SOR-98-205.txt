**Detailed Summary of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada Adaptations Regulations (Firearms)**  
*Issued under Section 118 of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. 39*  
*Coming into force: December 1, 1998*

---

### **Overview**

The *Aboriginal Peoples of Canada Adaptations Regulations (Firearms)* are a set of amendments to the *Firearms Act* and related regulations, specifically designed to **adapt and tailor firearm licensing and use provisions to the cultural, historical, and traditional practices of Aboriginal peoples in Canada**. These regulations recognize the unique relationship between Aboriginal communities and traditional hunting, and ensure that the legal framework for firearm possession and use respects and supports this cultural context.

The regulations were introduced in accordance with **Section 118 of the Firearms Act**, which requires that proposed regulations affecting Aboriginal peoples be laid before each House of Parliament at least 30 sitting days before implementation. This regulation was laid before Parliament on **November 27, 1996**, meeting that requirement.

The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, enacted these regulations under **paragraph 117(u)** of the Firearms Act, which authorizes adaptations of the Act and its regulations for Aboriginal peoples.
