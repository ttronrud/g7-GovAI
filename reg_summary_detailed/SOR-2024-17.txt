## **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Hamas Terrorist Attacks) Regulations**

### **1. Purpose and Context**
The **Special Economic Measures (Hamas Terrorist Attacks) Regulations** were enacted by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) in response to the **Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023**, which the Canadian government has deemed a **grave breach of international peace and security** and a **serious international crisis**.

These regulations are grounded in Canada’s **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)** and are designed to **target individuals and entities** directly or indirectly involved in Hamas’ attacks or in supporting such actions, including human rights abuses committed during those attacks.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
The regulations derive their authority from specific provisions of the **Special Economic Measures Act**:
- **Paragraph 4(1)(a)a**: Powers to designate individuals or entities involved in terrorism or attacks on another state.
- **Subsection 4(1.1)b**: Allows for the designation of individuals who support or facilitate attacks.
- **Subsection 4(2)c**: Enables restrictions on financial and commercial dealings with designated persons.
- **Subsection 4(3)**: Provides for the imposition of economic sanctions.

These provisions are further supported by:
- **S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(1)** – Authority to impose sanctions.
- **S.C. 2017, c. 21, s. 17(2)** – Framework for economic measures against terrorism.
- **S.C. 2023, c. 26, ss. 254(2) to (4)** – Specific authorization for targeting Hamas-related actors.
- **S.C. 1992, c. 17** – General framework for economic sanctions under SEMA.

### **3. Definition of "Listed Person"**
A person is considered a **"listed person"** if the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is satisfied that there are **reasonable grounds to believe** they:
- Engaged in activities that **directly or indirectly facilitate, support, provide funding for, or contribute to** an attack or attempted attack by Hamas on Israel or persons in Israel;
- Participated in or facilitated **gross and systematic human rights violations** in connection with such attacks;
- Are an **associate** of someone listed under (a) or (b);
- Are a **family member** of someone listed under (a) to (c);
- Own, hold, or control (directly or indirectly) an entity listed under (a) to (d).

> This broad definition ensures that not only direct perpetrators but also financiers, enablers, family members, and affiliated organizations are subject to sanctions.

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities (Section 3)**
Any person in Canada or a Canadian living outside Canada is **prohibited from**:
- **Dealing in property** (anywhere in the world) owned or held by a listed person.
- **Entering into or facilitating transactions** related to such property dealings.
- **Providing financial or related services** in connection with such dealings.
- **Making available goods** (anywhere in the world) to a listed person or someone acting on their behalf.
- **Transferring or providing property** (other than goods) to a listed person or to a non-Canadian for the benefit of a listed person.
- **Providing financial or related services** to or for the benefit of a listed person.

> These prohibitions apply globally — meaning Canadian citizens and businesses cannot engage in financial or commercial activity with listed persons, regardless of where the property or transaction occurs.

---

### **5. Exceptions to Prohibitions (Section 3 – Exceptions)**
The prohibitions in Section 3 **do not apply** to the following transactions or payments:
1. **Payments due under pre-existing contracts** entered into by a listed person before becoming listed, **provided** the payment is not made to a listed person or their representative.
2. **Transactions necessary** to transfer accounts, funds, or investments from a listed person to a non-listed person **on the day the person became listed**.
3. **Loan repayment obligations**:
   - For loans entered into **before** the person became listed, and for enforcement of security or repayment by guarantors.
   - For loans made to **non-listed persons** and repaid to Canadians or Canadians abroad.
4. **Social or retirement benefits**, including:
   - Old Age Security (OAS)
   - Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
   - Québec Pension Plan (QPP)
   - Superannuation, pensions, disability benefits
   - Payments under the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act or Pension Benefits Division Act
5. **Legal services** necessary for a listed person to defend against or respond to these regulations.
6. **Transactions with international organizations** such as:
   - United Nations agencies
   - International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
   - Entities that have entered into grant or contribution agreements with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development

> These exceptions ensure that essential financial obligations, social protections, and diplomatic functions are not disrupted.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Facilitation or Assistance**
It is **prohibited to knowingly cause, facilitate, or assist** in any activity prohibited under Section 3. This includes **intentional or indirect support** of a listed person’s activities — even if not directly involved in transactions.

> This creates a **"knowing facilitation"** standard, making it illegal to help or enable a listed person to circumvent sanctions.

---

### **7. Ongoing Obligations for Financial Institutions**
Certain entities must **continuously monitor** their operations to determine whether they are in possession or control of property owned or controlled by a listed person. These include:
- **Banks** (domestic and foreign authorized in Canada)
- **Cooperative credit societies, credit unions, caisses populaires**
- **Insurance companies** (provincial and foreign, in Canada)
- **Fraternal benefit societies** (insurance-related activities)
- **Trust and loan companies**
- **Loan companies**
- **Entities engaged in securities or investment services** (if they open client accounts)
- **Provincial entities authorized to deal in securities or provide investment advice**

> These institutions have a **duty of vigilance** to detect and report any property linked to listed persons.

---

### **8. Disclosure Obligations**
Every person in Canada, every Canadian abroad, and every entity listed in Section 6 must **disclose without delay** to:
- The **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, or
- The **Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**

The following information:
- The **existence of property** in their possession or control that they believe is owned or controlled by a listed person.
- Any **transaction or proposed transaction** involving such property.

> This ensures transparency and enables authorities to investigate and respond to potential violations.

---

### **9. Immunity for Good-Faith Disclosures**
No legal action — **neither under the Special Economic Measures Act nor in civil court** — may be brought against a person who makes a **good-faith disclosure** under this section.

> This protects individuals and institutions from liability for reporting suspected violations.

---

### **10. Review and Removal of Designations**
- A **listed person** may apply in writing to the Minister to have their name removed from the schedule.
- The Minister must assess whether there are **reasonable grounds** to recommend removal to the Governor in Council.
- If there has been a **material change in circumstances** since the last application, a new application may be submitted.
- The process is **reviewable and time-bound**, allowing for potential removal if conditions change.

> This provides a **mechanism for accountability and fairness** in the designation process.

---

### **11. Name Dispute Resolution**
- A person whose name is **similar or identical** to a listed person and who claims they are not that person may apply to the Minister for a **certificate of non-identity**.
- Within **30 days**, the Minister must:
  - Issue a certificate if it is established the applicant is not the listed person; or
  - Provide notice to the applicant if it is not established.

> This protects individuals from wrongful designation due to name similarity.

---

### **12. Effective Date and Legal Application**
- The regulations **come into force on the day of registration**.
- For the purpose of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, the regulations apply **immediately upon enactment**, even before publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This ensures **immediate enforcement** without delay, consistent with urgent international security responses.
