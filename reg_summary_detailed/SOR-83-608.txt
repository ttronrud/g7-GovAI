The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2017-84*, specifically **section 1** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2017-84, which was **June 23, 2017** (as per the official publication date of the instrument).
- **Nature of the Provision**: While the original content of the regulation is not included in your input, the repeated references suggest that the provision in question was previously part of a legal framework (likely related to health, safety, or environmental standards, given common contexts of such regulations), and it has now been removed from force.
- **Legal Implication**: Any legal obligation, requirement, or rule derived from this regulation no longer applies. Entities or individuals previously subject to it are no longer bound by it, and references to it in existing laws or administrative processes are considered obsolete.

### Why This Matters:
- The repeal indicates a change in policy or legislative intent — possibly due to obsolescence, duplication, or the implementation of a new regulation.
- It is important for legal practitioners, regulators, and the public to be aware of repealed provisions to avoid relying on outdated rules.

### Conclusion:
The regulation in question is **no longer in effect**. It was formally repealed by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, effective **June 23, 2017**. As such, it should not be cited or applied in any current legal or administrative context. For accurate and current regulatory information, one should consult the current version of the statute or the official government registry.
