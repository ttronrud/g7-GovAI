### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Determination, Re-determination and Further Re-determination of Origin, Tariff Classification and Value for Duty Regulations**

This regulation establishes the procedural framework for determining, re-determining, and further re-determining the **origin**, **tariff classification**, and **value for duty** of imported goods under the *Customs Act* of Canada. It was issued by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and came into force on **January 1, 1998**.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Background**

- The regulation is based on provisions of the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 28), particularly:
  - **Section 59c**, **subsection 61(2)c**, and **paragraph 164(1)(i)e**.
- It gives effect to a **public announcement made on October 27, 1997**, which means it is **not required to be published under subsection 164(3)** of the *Customs Act* (as per paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a).
- This is because the regulation implements a prior public announcement, thus fulfilling the requirements under the Act without needing separate publication.

> **Key Implication**: The regulation is considered "procedurally valid" due to its origin in a formal public announcement, avoiding the need for additional publication in the Canada Gazette.

## **2. Definitions**

The regulation defines two key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 28) |
| **Officer** | An official designated by the Minister under subsections 58(1) or 59(1) of the *Customs Act* |

> These definitions apply throughout the regulation and clarify who has authority to make determinations.

---

## **3. Time Period for Further Re-determination**

A critical procedural rule is established regarding the **time limit** for a further re-determination of origin, tariff classification, or value for duty:

> **Five years** from the date of the initial determination under section 58 of the *Customs Act*.

However, this five-year period **only applies if**:
- A refund or correction is granted **within a specific window** — from the **first day of the 37th month** to the **last day of the 48th month** after the initial determination was made.

> **Example**: If the initial determination was made on January 1, 1997:
> - The five-year window for further re-determination begins on **July 1, 1997** (37th month).
> - It ends on **June 30, 2002** (48th month).
> - After that, no further re-determination is permitted under this rule.

> **Note**: This time limitation ensures timely resolution of disputes and prevents indefinite appeals or corrections.

## **4. Notice Requirements for Determinations**

The regulation mandates that **all determinations, re-determinations, or further re-determinations** must be formally notified to relevant parties. The notice recipients depend on the type of determination.

---

### **A. For Origin Determinations (including re-determination or further re-determination)**

The officer must notify:

1. The **importer** of the goods  
2. The **owner** of the goods at the time of release  
3. Any person **liable for payment of duties** at the time of release  
4. The **person who accounted for the goods** under subsections 32(1), (3), or (5) of the *Customs Act*

**Additionally**, if preferential tariff treatment (e.g., under a free trade agreement) was claimed:
- The officer must also notify the **person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin**.

> **Purpose**: Ensures transparency and accountability, especially when origin is critical for tariff benefits.

---

### **B. For Tariff Classification or Value for Duty Determinations**

The officer must notify:

1. The **importer**  
2. The **owner** at the time of release  
3. Any person **liable for payment of duties** at the time of release  
4. The **person who accounted for the goods** under subsections 32(1), (3), or (5)

> **Note**: Unlike origin determinations, **no additional notice to the Certificate of Origin signer** is required for tariff classification or value determinations.

---

### **C. Special Case: Determination Treated as a Re-determination under Subsection 97.201(5)**

- If a determination is treated under **subsection 97.201(5)** of the *Customs Act* as if it were a **re-determination under paragraph 59(1)(a)**, then:
  - The officer must give **notice of re-determination** (as per subsection 59(2)) to the **exporter or producer** of the goods.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that the source of the goods (the exporter or producer) is informed when a determination is made that affects their eligibility or compliance with origin rules.

---

### **D. When the President Makes a Re-determination or Further Re-determination**

The President (as the head of government) may also make such determinations under subsection 61(1) of the *Customs Act*. In such cases:

#### **For Origin Determinations**:
- Notify:
  1. Importer  
  2. Owner at time of release  
  3. Person liable for duties  
  4. Person who accounted for goods  
- **Plus**, if preferential treatment was claimed: notify the **Certificate of Origin signer**

#### **For Tariff Classification or Value Determinations**:
- Notify:
  1. Importer  
  2. Owner at time of release  
  3. Person liable for duties  
  4. Person who accounted for goods  

> **Note**: The President’s role is limited to specific cases (e.g., appeals or disputes involving national interest), and the notice obligations mirror those of officers.

---

## **5. Who Are the "Persons to Whom Paragraphs 59(3)(a) and 65(1)(a)" Apply?**

These paragraphs relate to **rights or obligations** of individuals following a determination.

> The persons covered are:
> - Those who received notice of the determination, re-determination, or further re-determination **under section 3 or 4** of the *Customs Act*
> - **Excluded**: Persons referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b) or 4(1)(b)

> **Clarification**: This means that individuals who were not directly involved in the transaction or who were not formally notified are not subject to these rights or responsibilities.

---

## **6. Who Are the "Persons to Whom Paragraphs 59(3)(b) and 65(1)(b)" Apply?**

These apply to persons who:
- Received notice of a determination, re-determination, or further re-determination under section 3 or 4
- Are **not**:
  - Covered under paragraph 3(1)(b) or 4(1)(b)
  - Authorized under **paragraph 32(6)(a)** or **subsection 32(7)** to account for goods

> **Implication**: This excludes individuals who have been formally delegated responsibility for accounting for goods (e.g., customs brokers or authorized agents), ensuring that only those with direct involvement are subject to certain procedural rights.

---

## **7. Repeal Clause**

> These regulations are **repealed** (i.e., replaced or canceled) **on January 1, 1998** — but this appears to be a typographical or interpretive error.

**Analysis**:
- The clause says: *"These Regulations come into force on January 1, 1998."*
- The word *"Repeal"* is listed at the end, which contradicts the effective date.

> **Conclusion**: The "Repeal" clause is likely a **mistake** or misplacement. It should not apply. The regulation **comes into force on January 1, 1998**, and remains in force as a valid set of rules.
