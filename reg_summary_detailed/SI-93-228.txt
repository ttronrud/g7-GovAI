### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1453 and Designation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage as the Minister for the Cultural Property Export and Import Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to the provisions of the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act*.

---

### **Key Provisions and Actions**

1. **Revocation of Prior Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1993-1453**, dated June 25, 1993.  
   - This earlier order had designated the **Minister of Communications** as the responsible Minister under the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act*.  
   - The revocation effectively removes the previous designation and invalidates the legal basis for that ministerial assignment.

2. **Designation of the New Minister:**  
   The Governor General in Council **designates the Minister of Canadian Heritage** as the Minister responsible for the purposes of the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act*.  
   - This designation is made under **Section 2** of the Act, which defines the term "Minister" in the context of the regulation of cultural property exports and imports.  
   - The Minister of Canadian Heritage is now the official authority with responsibility for implementing and enforcing the Act regarding the export and import of cultural property.

3. **Legal Basis for the Change:**  
   - The change is authorized by the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act*, specifically Section 2, which outlines the definition and appointment of the Minister.  
   - The designation is not merely administrative—it carries legal weight, as it determines who has authority over decisions related to the export or import of cultural property (such as artifacts, artworks, and other heritage items).

4. **Historical Context and Transition:**  
   - The original Minister of Communications was the responsible minister in 1993.  
   - However, by **July 12, 1996**, a statutory amendment (Section 46 of *Statutes of Canada, 1995, c. 11*) came into effect.  
   - This amendment **redefined the reference to "Minister of Communications" as "Minister of Canadian Heritage"**.  
   - This change reflected a broader government restructuring, where the responsibilities of the Communications portfolio were transferred to the newly formed or restructured **Ministry of Canadian Heritage**, which oversees cultural affairs, including heritage preservation, museums, and cultural property.

5. **Effective Date and Legal Continuity:**  
   - The revocation and new designation are effective **from the date of publication** (implied to be the date of the regulation’s issuance).  
   - The change ensures legal continuity and clarity in the application of the Act, aligning the responsible minister with the current government structure and the actual custodians of Canada’s cultural heritage.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- This regulation ensures that the **legal responsibility for regulating the export and import of cultural property** is held by the appropriate minister in the current governmental structure.  
- It reflects the **evolution of Canada’s federal ministries**, particularly the shift in cultural responsibilities from communications to heritage.  
- It strengthens the integrity and coherence of the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act* by ensuring that enforcement and decision-making authority are vested in the correct department.

---

### **Practical Implications**

- Any export or import of cultural property (e.g., archaeological artifacts, artworks, historical documents) must now be reviewed and approved by the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** or their designated office.  
- The Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for:
  - Reviewing export applications.
  - Assessing cultural significance.
  - Ensuring compliance with international agreements (e.g., UNESCO conventions).
  - Maintaining Canada’s cultural sovereignty and protecting national heritage.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **corrective and updating measure** that aligns the *Cultural Property Export and Import Act* with the current federal ministerial structure. By revoking the outdated designation of the Minister of Communications and designating the Minister of Canadian Heritage as the responsible minister, the government ensures that cultural heritage policy is managed by the appropriate authority, reflecting both legal accuracy and administrative efficiency.
