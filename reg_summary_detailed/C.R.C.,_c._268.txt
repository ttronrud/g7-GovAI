**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Order* and may be cited as such. This Order serves as a legal instrument that establishes the framework for the regulation of broiler chicken marketing in Saskatchewan, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **"Act"**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Saskatchewan* (French: *Loi*). This Act provides the legislative foundation under which the regulation operates. It grants the Commodity Board authority to regulate the marketing of certain agricultural products, including broiler chickens.

- **"Broiler Chicken"**: Defined as a chicken that:
  - Is produced from the egg of a domestic hen;
  - Is **not** raised or used for egg production;
  - Is grown to a **live weight of 5½ pounds or less**;
  - Is grown to an **age of six months or less**;
  - Is produced by a **licensed producer**.

> *Note*: This definition excludes chickens grown beyond these weight and age limits, effectively distinguishing broiler chickens from laying hens or mature chickens raised for meat beyond standard commercial broiler standards.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Natural Products Marketing Act. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and distribution of broiler chickens in Saskatchewan.

- **"Plan"**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Producers’ Marketing Plan*, originally established by *Order 587/66* dated March 18, 1966, issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. This Plan sets out the rules and procedures for local marketing, including pricing, quotas, and market access, and serves as the foundational policy document for the regulation.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Commodity Board**  

The Commodity Board is granted specific powers to regulate the **marketing of broiler chickens** in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial Trade**: The sale or distribution of broiler chickens between provinces.
- **Export Trade**: The sale or shipment of broiler chickens outside of Canada.

> This means the Commodity Board can regulate how broiler chickens are marketed when they leave Saskatchewan, including setting conditions for pricing, volume, quality, and market access.

**4. Powers Granted Under the Plan (with Limitations)**  

The Commodity Board may exercise **all or any powers** that are normally available to it in relation to the **local marketing** of broiler chickens within Saskatchewan — as outlined in **Sections 2 and 22 of the Plan**.

However, **two specific powers are explicitly excluded**:

- **Paragraph 22(j)** of the Plan: This power is not exercisable.
- **Paragraph 22(k)** of the Plan: This power is also not exercisable.

> These exclusions suggest that while the Board has broad authority over marketing and pricing in interprovincial and export markets, it is **prohibited from exercising certain regulatory or administrative powers** that would, for example, relate to specific controls on production quotas, pricing mechanisms, or administrative enforcement measures that are reserved or restricted under those particular plan provisions.

---

**5. Purpose and Scope**  

This Order enables the Commodity Board to:

- Ensure fair and orderly marketing of broiler chickens;
- Prevent market distortions in interprovincial and export trade;
- Protect producers and consumers through standardized practices;
- Maintain consistency with the long-standing *Marketing Plan* established in 1966, which has been foundational in managing the broiler chicken industry in Saskatchewan.

The regulation reflects a balance between market freedom and producer protection, particularly in a sector where supply and demand can be volatile.

---

**6. Jurisdiction**  

The powers granted under this Order apply **only to persons and property located within the Province of Saskatchewan**. This means that while the Board can regulate the *export* or *interprovincial* movement of broiler chickens, its enforcement and regulatory actions are limited to Saskatchewan-based producers, processors, and businesses involved in the supply chain.

---

**Conclusion**  

The *Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Order* is a targeted regulatory instrument that empowers the Saskatchewan Broiler Chicken Producers’ Marketing Board to manage the marketing of broiler chickens in interprovincial and export markets. It builds upon the 1966 Marketing Plan, allowing the Board to regulate pricing, volume, and market access while excluding specific powers related to production quotas or administrative controls under paragraphs 22(j) and (k). The regulation ensures that broiler chickens are marketed fairly and efficiently, protecting both producers and consumers, while operating within the legal and structural framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*.
