**Detailed Summary of the *Customs Drawback on Toy Skins Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Customs Drawback on Toy Skins Regulations* are a set of rules established under **Section 273 of the Customs Act** by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations provide a framework for **customs drawback**—a refund of duties paid on imported materials—specifically for **imported toy skins** used in the **manufacture of stuffed toys in Canada**.

The regulations aim to:
- Encourage the use of **Canadian-made fabrics** in stuffed toy production.
- Support domestic manufacturing by reducing the cost of imported raw materials.
- Promote economic development in the Canadian toy manufacturing sector through incentive-based duty relief.

These regulations may be cited as the **Customs Drawback on Toy Skins Regulations**.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Canadian fabric** | Any fabric woven or knitted in Canada, regardless of whether it contains imported materials. |
| **Drawback period** | A defined time frame during which a manufacturer can claim a drawback on imported toy skins. Two types are specified: |

### **Eligibility and Conditions for Drawback**

A drawback is **granted** if the following conditions are met:

1. **The imported toy skins were used** in the manufacture of stuffed toys during a specified **drawback period**.
2. The **manufacturer has not previously selected a drawback period** (i.e., first-time claimant).
3. The manufacturer's **total consumption of Canadian fabric** during the drawback period meets a minimum threshold (see below).
4. A **claim is filed within four years** of when the customs duties were paid on the imported toy skins.

> ⚠️ **Note**: No drawback is payable if the manufacturer's total consumption of Canadian fabric during the drawback period is **less than** its consumption during the **corresponding period in 1978**, or (if no production occurred in 1978) during the **first subsequent year** when the manufacturer began producing stuffed toys.

This provision ensures that manufacturers who do not maintain a consistent level of Canadian fabric use are not eligible, promoting sustainable domestic input.

### **Rate of Drawback (Based on Canadian Fabric Usage)**

The rate of drawback is **determined by the percentage of Canadian fabric** used in relation to the **duty-paid value of the imported toy skins**.

Let:
- **Duty-paid value** = the value of the imported toy skins on which duties were paid.
- **Total cost of Canadian fabrics** = the total cost of Canadian fabric used in producing stuffed toys during the period.

#### **1. If Canadian fabric cost > 55% of duty-paid value**
- **Drawback rate = 80% of customs duties + 2% of duties per percentage point above 55%**
  
  *Example*:  
  If Canadian fabric cost is 60% of duty-paid value:  
  → 80% + (2% × 5) = 80% + 10% = **90% drawback**

> This creates a **progressive incentive**—the more Canadian fabric used beyond 55%, the greater the refund.

#### **2. If Canadian fabric cost is between 45% and 55% inclusive**
- **Drawback rate = 80% of customs duties**

> A standard incentive for moderate use of Canadian fabric.

#### **3. If Canadian fabric cost < 45% of duty-paid value**
- **Drawback rate = 80% of customs duties – 2% per percentage point below 45%**

  *Example*:  
  If Canadian fabric cost is 35% of duty-paid value:  
  → 80% – (2% × 10) = 80% – 20% = **60% drawback**

> This penalizes manufacturers who rely heavily on imported materials, reducing the benefit for low domestic content.

#### **Cap on Drawback Rate**
> **No drawback shall exceed 100% of the customs duties**, even if the formula would otherwise produce a higher rate.

This cap prevents excessive refunds and ensures fiscal responsibility.

### **Timing and Application**

- **Applicability**:  
  The rules apply to **all customs duties paid on or after April 1, 1981**.

- **Claim Submission**:
  - A claim must be submitted in the **form prescribed by the Minister**.
  - It must be filed with a **collector of customs and excise**.

- **Minister’s Authority**:
  - The Minister may require the manufacturer to provide **additional documentation or information** to verify the validity of the claim (e.g., invoices, production records, fabric usage reports).

> This ensures transparency, accuracy, and compliance with customs and trade laws.

---

### **Claim Deadline**

- A claim for drawback must be filed **within four years** from the date the customs duties were paid on the imported toy skins.

> This establishes a clear time limit to prevent indefinite or delayed claims and ensures timely administration.

---

### **Purpose and Economic Rationale**

The regulations serve several key economic objectives:

1. **Promotion of Canadian Fabric Use**:  
   By offering increasing refunds for higher Canadian fabric content, the policy incentivizes manufacturers to use domestic materials.

2. **Support for Domestic Manufacturing**:  
   Reduces the effective cost of raw materials, making Canadian stuffed toy production more competitive.

3. **Trade Policy Alignment**:  
   Encourages trade in goods with significant Canadian content, aligning with broader national economic and industrial policies.

4. **Fiscal Responsibility**:  
   The cap at 100%, tiered structure, and consumption thresholds prevent abuse and ensure the program remains sustainable.

---

### **Key Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No drawback if Canadian fabric consumption is below historical baseline** (1978 or first post-1978 production year).
- **No drawback without a timely claim** (within 4 years).
- **No drawback if the manufacturer did not produce stuffed toys in 1978** (baseline is set to the first year of production after 1978).

These safeguards ensure that the benefit is only awarded to manufacturers with genuine, ongoing, and domestic-integrated production practices.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Customs Drawback on Toy Skins Regulations* are a targeted, performance-based incentive program designed to:

- Encourage the use of **Canadian fabrics** in stuffed toy manufacturing,
- Reward **increased domestic content** through a progressive drawback rate,
- Ensure **fiscal accountability** through caps, claim deadlines, and verification requirements,
- Support the **Canadian manufacturing sector** by reducing input costs for key raw materials.

While the regulations are specific to toy skins and stuffed toys, they reflect a broader principle in Canadian trade policy: using **customs drawback mechanisms** to promote domestic production and content, while maintaining balance between economic support and fiscal responsibility.

### **Relevance Today**

Though these regulations were enacted in the early 1980s (specifically effective from April 1, 1981), they remain historically significant as an early example of **sector-specific drawback policy** in Canada. Modern equivalents may exist under updated tariff or industrial policy frameworks, but this regulation illustrates the foundational principles of **content-based duty relief** and **industrial support through customs incentives**.
