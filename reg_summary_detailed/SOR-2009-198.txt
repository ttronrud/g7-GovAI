**Detailed Summary of the CEFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Enactment**

The CEFTA Rules of Origin Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the federal government the authority to adopt rules of origin for goods traded under specific free trade agreements, including those with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

The regulation is formally enacted under **Statutory Instrument S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** and is referenced in **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which likely provides the foundational framework or related provisions for customs and trade regulations.

**2. Scope and Applicability**

These regulations implement and give legal effect in Canada to specific provisions of **Annex C** of the **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Canada and the States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)** — specifically, the countries of **Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland**.

The agreement was signed on **January 26, 2008**, and the regulations bring into force the following provisions from Annex C:

- **Articles 1 to 8**  
  These articles establish the general principles of origin determination, including definitions of "originating goods," the requirement for a product to be produced or manufactured in a member country of EFTA, and the rules for determining whether a product qualifies as originating under the agreement.

- **Article 9, paragraph 1**  
  This provision outlines specific rules for **partial processing** and **value addition**. It ensures that goods undergo sufficient transformation or processing within EFTA countries to qualify as originating, even if components are imported from other countries.

- **Articles 10 to 12**  
  These articles address **specific rules of origin** for certain product categories, such as:
  - Textiles and apparel
  - Machinery and equipment
  - Chemicals and plastics  
  These rules define the required percentage of value added or the required level of processing to meet origin criteria.

- **Article 14**  
  This article establishes **rules for the treatment of goods produced in EFTA countries that are subsequently processed or transformed in Canada**. It clarifies whether such goods retain their origin status or lose it due to further processing in Canada.

- **Appendix I**  
  This annex contains **detailed product-specific rules of origin**, including:
  - Lists of products that are considered "originating" under the agreement
  - Specific thresholds (e.g., value content percentages) required for different product categories
  - Exemptions or special provisions for certain goods (e.g., agricultural products, raw materials)

These provisions are incorporated into Canadian law and thus have **the force of law** in Canada, meaning they are binding on all Canadian customs authorities, businesses, and importers.

**3. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on **July 1, 2009**.

However, if the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after July 1, 2009**, they will take effect on the **date of registration** rather than July 1. This provision ensures that any delays in formal publication do not result in a gap in legal applicability.

**4. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Enable Canadian importers and exporters to determine whether goods from EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland) qualify as "originating" under the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement.
- Facilitate access to **preferential tariff treatment** (e.g., reduced or zero tariffs) for qualifying goods entering Canada.
- Provide **clarity and consistency** in origin determination for businesses engaged in trade with EFTA countries.
- Ensure compliance with international trade obligations and support Canada’s broader trade policy goals, including promoting fair and transparent trade practices.

**5. Key Implications for Trade**

- **Origin Determination**: Importers must verify that goods meet the rules of origin set out in the regulation to claim tariff benefits.
- **Processing Requirements**: Goods must undergo sufficient processing or value addition within EFTA countries to qualify.
- **Product-Specific Rules**: Certain products (e.g., textiles, machinery) have defined thresholds (e.g., 50% or 60% value added) to qualify as originating.
- **Non-qualifying Goods**: Goods that fail to meet origin requirements may be subject to full Canadian tariffs.
- **Transparency and Compliance**: The inclusion of Appendix I provides a clear, searchable reference for businesses to assess product eligibility.

**Conclusion**

The CEFTA Rules of Origin Regulations are a critical component of Canada’s trade policy with EFTA countries. By legally incorporating the rules of origin from Annex C of the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement, these regulations provide a clear, enforceable framework for determining the origin of goods. This ensures that Canadian businesses can benefit from tariff reductions and promotes fair and predictable trade relations with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. The regulations, effective from July 1, 2009 (or upon registration), support Canada’s integration into the global trading system through transparent and rule-based trade practices.
