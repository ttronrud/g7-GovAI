**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Salt River First Nation) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal** in the Northwest Territories. This action is intended to **facilitate the eventual addition of these lands to the Salt River Reserve**, which is a designated reserve for the Salt River First Nation. By removing these lands from the disposal process, the government ensures they are preserved for the purposes of Indigenous land rights, self-governance, and community development under the framework of federal and territorial law.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

- **What is withdrawn:**  
  The tracts of territorial land listed in the **Schedule** attached to the Order — including both **surface rights and subsurface rights** — are formally withdrawn from disposal.

- **Duration of Withdrawal:**  
  The withdrawal is effective from the **date the Order is made** until **August 31, 2014**. This time-bound restriction ensures that the lands remain protected from being sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of during this period.

- **Geographic Scope:**  
  The lands are located in the **Northwest Territories**, specifically within the area of the Salt River First Nation.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Key Clarifications)**

Despite the general withdrawal of lands from disposal, **Section 2 of the Order does not apply** to the following activities — meaning these actions remain legally permissible and are not affected by the withdrawal:

1. **Mineral Prospecting Permits (Pre-existing):**  
   A person may locate a mineral claim under a prospecting permit that was **granted before the Order came into effect**.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims (Pre-existing):**  
   Claims that were **already located or recorded before the Order was made** are not affected.

3. **Leasing of Recorded Claims:**  
   A lease may be granted under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person holding a recorded mineral claim, **provided the lease covers land within that recorded claim**.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (Pre-existing Exploration Licences):**  
   A significant discovery licence under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* may be issued to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before the Order**, **if the licence covers an area subject to that exploration licence**.

5. **Production Licences (Pre-existing Exploration or Discovery Licences):**  
   A production licence may be issued to a holder of:
   - A significant discovery licence (issued before the Order), or
   - An exploration licence (issued before the Order),  
   **if the production licence covers an area subject to the prior licence**.

6. **Surface Leases for Claim Operations:**  
   A surface lease may be granted under the *Territorial Lands Act* to a holder of a recorded mineral claim or to someone with an interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*, **if the lease is required to enable the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest**.

7. **Renewal of Interests:**  
   The renewal of any mineral interest (e.g., exploration or production rights) is not affected by this Order.

> These exclusions are included to **preserve existing mining rights and operations** that were already established prior to the Order, ensuring continuity and legal certainty for industry and Indigenous stakeholders.

### **Repeal Provision (Clarification of Map References)**

The Order includes a **repeal clause** that clarifies the identification of the parcels being withdrawn:

- In the **Northwest Territories**, all parcels of land shown as **"Surface and Subsurface"** on certain official maps are included in the withdrawal.
- These maps are:
  - **File 33-1-5-2** in the **Land and Water Division** of the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** in **Ottawa**.
  - Also available in the **Land Administration Office** of DIAND in **Yellowknife, NWT**.

> This ensures that the parcels are clearly identifiable and accessible to government officials and stakeholders for record-keeping and administrative purposes.

---

### **Types of Parcels Withdrawn**

The Order specifies two categories:

1. **Surveyed Parcels:**  
   These are legally defined and mapped land parcels with precise boundaries, surveyed and officially recorded.

2. **Unsurveyed Parcels:**  
   These are land areas that have not yet been formally surveyed or mapped. While not fully defined, they are still included in the withdrawal and are subject to the same protections.

> The inclusion of unsurveyed parcels underscores the importance of protecting potential future reserve lands, even where boundaries are not yet established.

---

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- This Order reflects a commitment to **Indigenous land rights and self-determination**, particularly in the context of reserve expansion.
- It aligns with broader federal policies promoting **Indigenous reconciliation**, land title recognition, and the protection of First Nations’ interests in land and resources.
- The temporary nature of the withdrawal (until August 31, 2014) allows time for:
  - Final land agreements,
  - Legal and administrative processes,
  - Community consultation,
  - Potential future land transfers or reserve expansions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, time-limited measure to **protect specific territorial lands** from being sold or otherwise disposed of in order to **support the establishment or expansion of the Salt River First Nation’s reserve**. It balances the need for Indigenous land security with the legal rights of mineral claimants and operators who have existing interests in the area — ensuring that pre-existing rights are respected and continuity is maintained.

By clearly defining the scope, duration, and exclusions, the Order provides **legal certainty** and **administrative clarity** for government agencies, Indigenous communities, and resource developers.

**Note:** This Order is **no longer in effect** as it expires on August 31, 2014. Any further action regarding the Salt River Reserve would require a new legislative or regulatory instrument.
