**Detailed Summary of the China Direct Shipment Condition Exemption Order**

---

**Official Title and Citation:**  
*China Direct Shipment Condition Exemption Order*  
Statutory Reference: S.C. 1983-84, c. 22, s. 1  
Effective Date: March 1, 1985  

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, amends the customs requirements under the *Customs Tariff* to provide an exemption from the "direct shipment" condition for certain goods originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

---

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to remove the requirement that goods imported from the People’s Republic of China must be shipped *directly* from the PRC to Canada (i.e., without a transshipment or intermediate stop). This exemption allows goods that are shipped via Hong Kong—on a through bill of lading—to Canada to still qualify for tariff treatment under the direct shipment rule, thereby facilitating trade and reducing logistical barriers for importers.

**Key Provisions**

1. **Exemption from the Direct Shipment Requirement**  
   - The Order grants an exemption from **paragraph 40(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, which normally requires goods to be shipped directly from the country of origin to Canada.  
   - This exemption applies specifically to goods that **originate in the People’s Republic of China**.

2. **Conditions for the Exemption**  
   In order for the exemption to be valid, the following conditions must be met:

   a. **Date of Importation**  
      The goods must be imported into Canada and released and accounted for under the *Customs Act* **on or after January 1, 1988**.  
      → This establishes a minimum effective date for the exemption to apply, ensuring it is implemented only after a defined transition period.

   b. **Route of Shipment**  
      The goods must have been **shipped through Hong Kong** on a **through bill of lading** to a consignee in Canada.  
      → A "through bill of lading" means that the entire shipment is carried from the point of origin (PRC) to the destination (Canada) with Hong Kong as a transit point, and the carrier is responsible for the entire journey.  
      → This confirms that the shipment is not a transshipment in the sense of being reloaded or transferred at Hong Kong (e.g., to a different carrier), but rather continues directly from PRC to Canada via Hong Kong.

   c. **Documentation Requirement**  
      The importer must **submit to the Minister of National Revenue** any documentation requested by the Minister in relation to the exemption.  
      → This ensures transparency, compliance, and accountability. The Minister may request evidence such as the bill of lading, commercial invoice, or other supporting documents to verify the origin and route of the goods.

3. **Applicability and Limitations**  
   - The exemption is **subject to Section 3** of the *Customs Tariff* (which typically governs the scope and conditions of exemptions).  
   - The exemption applies only to goods originating in the PRC.  
   - It does not extend to goods from other countries or to goods that do not meet the specified shipment route (e.g., goods shipped via other third countries or without a through bill of lading).

**Legal Basis**  
The Order is made under **subsection 3.1(1.1)** of the *Customs Tariff*, which empowers the Minister of Finance to make regulations to amend or exempt certain conditions in the tariff, particularly those related to the direct shipment requirement.

---

**Significance and Impact**  
- **Trade Facilitation**: The exemption allows Canadian importers to source goods from China via Hong Kong, which is a major international trade hub. This provides greater flexibility in supply chains and enables access to Chinese goods that may otherwise be subject to stricter direct shipment rules.  
- **Economic Efficiency**: By permitting through shipments through Hong Kong, the regulation reduces the cost and complexity of logistics, especially for goods that are more efficiently transported via this route.  
- **Compliance Oversight**: The requirement for documentation ensures that the exemption is not misused and that goods remain properly traceable and accountable under Canadian customs law.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *China Direct Shipment Condition Exemption Order* is a targeted regulatory measure that streamlines the import process for goods from the People’s Republic of China by allowing through shipments via Hong Kong. It balances trade efficiency with compliance, ensuring that the exemption is both practical and enforceable. The rule remains active as of the date of this summary, though it is subject to future review or amendment in light of evolving trade policies or international relations.

> **Note**: This Order is no longer in force as of 2024, due to the implementation of new trade agreements and changes in Canadian customs policy. However, it remains historically significant as an early example of Canada’s adaptation to global supply chains involving third-country transshipment.
