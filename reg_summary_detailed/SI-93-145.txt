**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation constitutes an official transfer of administrative responsibility within the Canadian federal public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority**:  
   The regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council. This is the formal constitutional mechanism by which the federal government, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, makes policy and administrative decisions. The Governor General in Council acts as the ceremonial head of state, executing decisions made by the federal Cabinet.

2. **Legal Basis**:  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision allows for the reorganization of public service functions and the transfer of control and supervision of specific branches or units between departments. The purpose is to improve efficiency, align responsibilities with current policy priorities, or enhance service delivery.

3. **Transfer of Responsibility**:  
   The **Product Safety Branch**, which is a component of the **Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (DCCA)**, is being transferred. This branch is responsible for overseeing product safety regulations, including the monitoring, assessment, and enforcement of safety standards for consumer goods (e.g., food, toys, appliances, medical devices, and other products).

4. **Recipient Department**:  
   The control and supervision of the Product Safety Branch are being transferred to the **Department of National Health and Welfare (DNHW)**. This shift reflects a strategic realignment of responsibilities, likely due to the growing overlap between product safety and public health concerns (e.g., safety of medical devices, food safety, or environmental health impacts).

5. **Nature of the Transfer**:  
   The transfer involves **control and supervision**, not just operational functions. This means that the DNHW will now be responsible for:
   - Setting policy and strategic direction for the branch,
   - Overseeing the staffing, budgeting, and performance of the branch,
   - Approving major decisions and initiatives,
   - Ensuring compliance with legislative and regulatory frameworks related to product safety.

6. **Implications**:  
   - **Policy Alignment**: The transfer may reflect a broader government initiative to integrate consumer product safety with public health outcomes, especially in areas such as food safety, medical device safety, or environmental health.
   - **Operational Continuity**: The day-to-day operations of the Product Safety Branch will likely continue without disruption, but under new oversight and reporting lines.
   - **Interdepartmental Coordination**: The DNHW will now coordinate with other health and safety-related departments (e.g., Health Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada) to ensure consistent and effective regulation.
   - **Stakeholder Communication**: Affected agencies, industry stakeholders, and the public may need to adjust to the new oversight body, particularly in regulatory submissions or compliance processes.

7. **Effective Date and Implementation**:  
   While not explicitly stated in the excerpt, such transfers typically take effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette or a related official journal and are implemented through internal administrative procedures within the respective departments.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation formally reassigns the administrative and supervisory authority of the Product Safety Branch from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to the Department of National Health and Welfare. The move is grounded in statutory authority and is designed to better align product safety oversight with broader public health and safety objectives. It represents a significant structural change in the federal public service, reflecting evolving policy priorities and interdepartmental collaboration needs.
