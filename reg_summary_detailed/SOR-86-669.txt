**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Tender Fruit Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations, 1986**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Purpose**

The *Ontario Tender Fruit Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations, 1986* (SOR/86-100) were enacted by the **Ontario Tender Fruit Producers’ Marketing Board (Board)** under sections 3* and 4* of the *Ontario Tender Fruit Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1979-2538), which was established on September 20, 1979.  

These regulations establish a **service charge system** designed to generate revenue for the Board to support the marketing and promotion of Ontario’s tender fruits—specifically plums, prunes, pears, and peaches—within **interprovincial and export markets**. The funds collected are intended to assist producers through marketing initiatives, quality assurance, and market development.

The regulations apply only to:
- The **marketing of tender fruit** in interprovincial and export trade,
- And to **persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.

---

### **Service Charge Rates by Fruit Type**

Producers are required to pay a **service charge per pound** of tender fruit marketed, based on the type of fruit:

| Fruit | Service Charge per Pound |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **Fresh plums, prunes, or pears** | $0.0035 |
| **Fresh peaches** | $0.0078 |

> These charges apply whether the producer markets the fruit directly or on their behalf.

---

### **How the Service Charge is Collected**

There are **three distinct pathways** for the collection of the service charge, depending on how and where the fruit is sold:

#### **1. When Tender Fruit is Sold to the Board**
- The Board **deducts the service charge directly** from the payment it makes to the producer.
- The deduction is automatic and occurs when the Board purchases the fruit.

> Example: If a producer sells 1,000 lbs of peaches to the Board, the Board pays the producer $X minus $0.0078 × 1,000 = $7.80 service charge.

#### **2. When Tender Fruit is Sold to a Dealer-Shipper**
- The **dealer-shipper must deduct** the service charge from the amount paid to the producer.
- The dealer-shipper must **remit the full service charge to the Board within 21 days** of receiving the fruit.

> Example: A dealer-shipper buys 500 lbs of plums from a producer.  
> Service charge = 500 × $0.0035 = $1.75  
> The dealer pays the producer $Y – $1.75 and sends $1.75 to the Board within 21 days.

#### **3. When Service Charges Are Not Deducted or Paid in Time**
- If a producer sells fruit to someone other than the Board or a dealer-shipper, and the service charge is **not deducted or paid** in accordance with the above rules:
  - The producer must **pay all unpaid service charges** directly to the Board.
  - Payment must be made **within 15 days of the end of the following month** after the month in which the fruit was sold.

> Example: A producer sells 200 lbs of pears to a private buyer. No deduction occurs.  
> Service charge = 200 × $0.0035 = $0.70  
> The producer must pay this $0.70 to the Board **by the 15th day of the next month**.

---

### **Key Compliance and Enforcement Provisions**

- **Timeliness**: All deductions and payments must be made promptly to avoid penalties or administrative delays.
- **Recordkeeping**: While not explicitly detailed in these regulations, it is implied that producers and dealers must maintain records of sales and payments to ensure compliance.
- **Jurisdiction**: The regulations are strictly confined to Ontario and do not extend to intraprovincial sales or domestic retail sales unless connected to interprovincial or export trade.

---

### **Revocation of "Fresh Fruit" Definition**

The term *"fresh fruit"* was **revoked in 1992** (SOR/92-582, section 3), indicating that the regulation now focuses specifically on **tender fruits** (plums, peaches, prunes, pears) rather than a broader category. This reflects a narrowing of scope to ensure targeted support for specific high-value, perishable fruits.

---

### **Policy Objectives and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
1. **Revenue Generation**: To provide a stable, predictable source of funding for the Board to promote Ontario tender fruits in national and international markets.
2. **Market Support**: To help offset marketing costs associated with interprovincial and export trade, such as branding, quality control, packaging, and logistics.
3. **Fair Distribution of Costs**: To ensure that those involved in the marketing chain (producers, dealers, shippers) contribute fairly to the marketing infrastructure.
4. **Encouragement of Participation**: By establishing a transparent and enforceable system, the Board incentivizes participation in organized marketing efforts.

---

### **Limitations and Scope**

- **Exclusions**: The regulations do **not apply** to:
  - Railway companies.
  - Employees transporting fruit as agents of producers.
  - Any person who only transports fruit without engaging in buying, selling, or processing.
- **No Coverage of Processing**: The regulations do **not apply to processors** (those involved in making juice, canned goods, etc.), although they may be subject to other Ontario agricultural or food regulations.
- **No Coverage of Domestic Retail Sales**: Only sales in **interprovincial or export trade** are governed by these rules.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Tender Fruit Service Charge (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations, 1986* represent a targeted, revenue-based mechanism to support the marketing of Ontario’s tender fruits. By imposing a small, per-pound service charge on producers of plums, prunes, pears, and peaches—collected either directly by the Board, by dealer-shippers, or by producers themselves—these regulations ensure that the marketing costs of interprovincial and export trade are shared fairly among stakeholders.

The rules are clear, enforceable, and designed to promote consistent participation in the marketing system while protecting producers from undue financial burden. However, the regulations have been **replaced or updated** over time (e.g., the revocation of "fresh fruit" in 1992), and may now be part of a broader, more modernized agricultural marketing framework.

> **Note**: These regulations are historical and may no longer be in full force. For current compliance, consult the most recent Ontario agricultural marketing regulations or the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA).

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The 1986 Ontario Tender Fruit Service Charge Regulations require producers to pay a per-pound service charge (0.0035¢ for plums/prunes/pears, 0.0078¢ for peaches) on interprovincial and export sales, collected either by the Board, dealer-shippers, or directly by producers if not deducted—ensuring funding for marketing efforts within Ontario’s tender fruit industry.
