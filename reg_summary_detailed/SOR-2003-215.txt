**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Order Extending the Time for the Assessment of the Status of Wildlife Species

**Legal Authority:**  
Pursuant to **subsection 130(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), enacted in S.C. 2002, c. 29.

**Issuing Body:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
To extend the time period allowed for the assessment of the status of specific wildlife species listed in the Schedule to the Order. This extension is necessary to ensure that comprehensive scientific evaluations of the species’ population trends, threats, and conservation needs can be conducted, in accordance with the requirements of the *Species at Risk Act*.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Extension of Assessment Period:**  
   The time frame designated under **Section 14** of the *Species at Risk Act* for assessing the status of the wildlife species listed in the Schedule is **extended by three (3) years**.  
   - The extension begins on the day that **Section 14 of SARA comes into force**.  
   - The new deadline for completing the status assessments is therefore three years after that date.

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The extension applies specifically to the wildlife species listed in the **Schedule** attached to this Order. These species are subject to the requirement under SARA to have their status assessed by the scientific and conservation community to determine whether they are at risk of extinction.

3. **Consultation Requirement:**  
   Before issuing this Order, the Minister of the Environment conducted consultations with the **competent ministers** (i.e., relevant federal or provincial authorities responsible for species conservation or environmental protection). This consultation process is mandated under subsection 130(5) of SARA to ensure transparency, intergovernmental coordination, and stakeholder input.

4. **Public Disclosure:**  
   A formal statement explaining the reasons for the extension was included in the **public registry**. This ensures public access to the rationale behind the decision, promoting transparency and accountability in the regulatory process.

5. **Effective Date (Coming Into Force):**  
   The Order comes into force on **June 5, 2003**. This date marks the start of the extended assessment period for the listed species.

**Rationale for the Extension:**  
While the original timeline under Section 14 of SARA was intended to ensure timely action on at-risk species, the extension recognizes that:
- Comprehensive scientific assessments require time for data collection, analysis, and peer review.
- Some species may be difficult to monitor due to their habitat, rarity, or elusive nature.
- Additional time allows for more robust and reliable status determinations, which are essential for effective conservation planning and decision-making under SARA.

**Significance:**  
This Order reflects the government’s commitment to upholding the principles of the *Species at Risk Act*, particularly the need for science-based, thorough, and timely assessments of wildlife species at risk. It also demonstrates the importance of adaptive management—adjusting timelines when necessary to ensure effective conservation outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulatory order is a legally binding instrument that provides a three-year extension to the deadline for assessing the status of specific wildlife species under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is issued in accordance with established procedural requirements, including ministerial consultation and public disclosure, and is designed to support sound, evidence-based conservation decisions.
