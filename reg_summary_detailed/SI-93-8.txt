**1. Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation empowers the Minister of National Revenue to establish and set fees or charges for individuals or entities that request copies of official publications issued by the Department of National Revenue (DNR). The primary objective is to ensure that the DNR can sustain the cost of producing, printing, distributing, and managing the dissemination of its publications—such as tax forms, guidelines, notices, and other official documents—while maintaining accessibility to the public.

**2. Legal Authority**  
The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24). This provision grants the Minister of National Revenue, in consultation with the Treasury Board, the authority to prescribe fees for services provided by the Department of National Revenue, including the distribution of publications. The Governor General in Council (the formal head of government) approves the Minister’s recommendation, thereby giving legal force to the fee-setting power.

This authority is part of a broader framework that allows the federal government to manage administrative costs and ensure fiscal responsibility in the delivery of public services.

**3. Scope of Application**  
The regulation applies to **any person who requests that publications of the Department of National Revenue be distributed to them**. This includes:

- Individuals (e.g., taxpayers, citizens)
- Businesses or organizations
- Government agencies or institutions
- Other entities that formally request copies of DNR publications

The publications may include, but are not limited to:
- Tax forms (e.g., T1, T4, T5)
- Tax guidelines and interpretive documents
- Notices of tax policy changes
- Regulatory notices or compliance materials
- Publicly available information on tax laws and procedures

**4. Key Features of the Authorization**  
- **Prescriptive Power**: The Minister of National Revenue is authorized to issue an order (formal regulatory instrument) that specifies the exact fees or charges to be applied to such requests.
- **Flexibility**: The fees can be set based on various factors, such as:
  - The type of publication requested
  - The volume or frequency of distribution
  - The method of delivery (e.g., postal, electronic, in-person)
  - The nature of the recipient (e.g., individual vs. organization)
- **Cost Recovery**: The fees are intended to cover the administrative and operational costs associated with printing, mailing, or delivering publications.
- **Transparency**: The Minister is required to ensure that the fees are clearly communicated and justified, allowing recipients to understand the cost structure.

---

**5. Governance and Oversight**  
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for proposing and issuing the fee order.
- The **Treasury Board** provides policy and financial oversight, ensuring that the fees are reasonable, consistent with public service principles, and aligned with broader government cost-recovery policies.
- The Governor General in Council formally approves the order, ensuring it is within the legal authority granted by the Financial Administration Act.

**6. Implications and Considerations**  
- **Public Access**: While fees are introduced, the regulation does not undermine public access to information. The DNR must still ensure that essential publications remain available to the public, especially for basic tax compliance.
- **Equity and Accessibility**: The regulation may raise concerns about affordability for low-income individuals or small businesses. However, the government may provide exemptions or reduced fees for certain groups (e.g., seniors, low-income taxpayers) through subsequent policy decisions.
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: Recipients are expected to pay the prescribed fees when requesting publications. Failure to do so may result in administrative consequences, though such enforcement is typically limited and governed by broader administrative rules.

**7. Historical Context**  
This regulation was introduced in 1991 as part of a broader effort to modernize and financially manage federal government services. It reflects a shift toward cost-based service delivery, where administrative costs are reflected in user fees to ensure sustainability.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation establishes a formal, legally sound mechanism for the Department of National Revenue to charge fees for the distribution of its publications. It balances the need for financial sustainability with the public’s right to access essential tax information. The Minister of National Revenue, acting with Treasury Board support, has the authority to set these fees through an order, ensuring that the DNR can continue to deliver vital information while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
