**Detailed Summary of the Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1992**

---

### **Overview**

The *Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1992* is a regulatory instrument issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada and the Public Service Commission) to govern the temporary employment of individuals in specific categories within the Department of National Defence (DND) for short-term periods.

This regulation was enacted to address a specific operational need in the DND during a defined period—**from April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994**—where the Public Service Commission determined that applying the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to short-term appointments would be **unpractical and not in the best interest of the Public Service**.

---

### **Background and Rationale**

1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act**  
   The Public Service Commission concluded that it was not practicable or in the public interest to apply the comprehensive employment protections and standards of the *Public Service Employment Act* to individuals appointed for:
   - **One or more periods of less than three months each**
   - **With a total duration of less than six months in any consecutive 12-month period**

   These short-term appointments are common in certain functional areas of the DND where temporary staffing is required due to project-based work, seasonal demands, or transitional needs.

2. **Specific Categories of Employment Covered**  
   The exclusion applies only to the following categories within the DND:
   - **Operational Category**
   - **Administrative Support Category**:
     - Clerical and Regulatory
     - Secretarial
     - Stenographic and Typing
     - Data Processing
   - **Technical Category**:
     - Drafting and Illustration
     - Engineering and Scientific Support
   - **Scientific and Professional Category**:
     - Education
     - Nursing

3. **Timeframe**  
   The regulations apply **only from April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994**.

4. **Legal Basis**  
   The regulation is authorized under two key provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:
   - **Section 41(1)**: Allows the Public Service Commission to **exclude** certain appointments from the operation of the PSEA when it is deemed impractical or contrary to public interest.
   - **Section 37(1)**: Authorizes the Governor in Council to **make regulations** to implement specific employment practices, including those related to short-term contracts.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### 1. **Applicability**
- The regulations apply to **all persons** appointed in the specified categories and functions during the stated period (April 9, 1992 – April 30, 1994).
- The regulations **do not apply** to permanent or long-term appointments, nor to other departments outside the DND.

#### 2. **Recruitment and Appointment**
- The **Deputy Minister** of the Department of National Defence (or an individual specifically authorized by the Deputy Minister) has the authority to:
  - Recruit
  - Select
  - Appoint
  individuals for temporary positions in the specified categories.
- Appointments are made **for one or more specified periods of less than three months**, with a **total of less than six months in any 12-month period**.

#### 3. **Termination of Employment**
- Employment under these regulations may be terminated by the Deputy Minister or an authorized individual **with at least one day’s notice**, under the following circumstances:
  - **For cause** (e.g., misconduct, failure to perform duties)
  - **Due to lack of work** or the **discontinuance of a function** within the Department.

> This provides flexibility in managing staffing needs without being bound by the more rigid termination procedures found in the standard Public Service Employment Act.

#### 4. **No Application of Full Public Service Employment Act Protections**
- The full range of employment rights, benefits, and protections under the *Public Service Employment Act* (such as fair process, grievance procedures, job security, and eligibility for permanent positions) **do not apply** to individuals hired under these temporary terms.
- This includes:
  - Absence of automatic entitlement to pension or benefits
  - Limited or no right to appeal or challenge employment decisions
  - No obligation to provide notice or process for dismissal unless for cause or due to lack of work

---

### **Purpose and Justification**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Provide operational flexibility** to the Department of National Defence in managing temporary staffing needs.
- **Avoid administrative burden** that would arise from applying the full scope of the Public Service Employment Act to short-term, project-based roles.
- **Support efficiency and responsiveness** in areas such as:
  - Administrative support
  - Technical services (e.g., engineering, drafting)
  - Education and nursing support (e.g., training, temporary assignments)

The Public Service Commission determined that applying the full employment framework to such short-term roles would:
- Be **operationally impractical**
- **Undermine the ability of DND to respond quickly** to changing needs
- Not serve the **overall public interest** in terms of cost, efficiency, and service delivery

---

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Limited to DND**: Applies only to the Department of National Defence.
- **Time-bound**: Only valid from April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994.
- **Limited to specific job groups**: Excludes other categories (e.g., medical, legal, managerial roles) and other departments.
- **Temporary nature**: All appointments are strictly short-term and do not lead to permanent status.
- **No rights to permanent employment or benefits**: Temporary employees are not eligible for pension, health benefits, or promotion pathways under standard public service rules.

### **Legal Citation**

These regulations may be cited as:  
**The Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1992**

### **Conclusion**

The *Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1992* represents a targeted, time-limited exception to the general employment framework of the Public Service Employment Act. It enables the DND to efficiently manage temporary staffing in key support functions during a specific period without imposing the full administrative and procedural burdens of permanent public service employment.

While it provides necessary flexibility for operational needs, it also reflects a recognition that **short-term, non-permanent employment** should be governed by different standards—particularly in terms of rights, benefits, and termination procedures.

This regulation is **not a general policy** and remains confined to the specified categories, timeframe, and department. Its legacy is primarily historical, as it was designed for a specific period and does not extend beyond April 30, 1994.

**Note**: This regulation is no longer in force after April 30, 1994. Any current temporary employment arrangements in the DND would be governed by updated policies, possibly under different legal frameworks or modernized employment practices.
