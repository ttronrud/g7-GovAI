The provided text is a legal instrument issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, based on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The regulation is made **pursuant to paragraph 226(2)(b)a** and **section 277b of the Excise Tax Act**.
  - **Paragraph 226(2)(b)a** of the Excise Tax Act authorizes the government to prescribe rules for the collection and administration of Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) on certain goods, including returnable beverage containers.
  - **Section 277b** provides the specific framework for the taxation of returnable beverage containers, including the conditions under which such containers are subject to GST/HST and the mechanisms for collecting and returning tax.

- The regulation is issued under **Section 28(2)** of **S.C. 2007, c. 18** (a Statutory Code) and **Section 125(1)** of **S.C. 1993, c. 27**, which provide the procedural and legislative basis for such regulatory actions.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of the Returnable Beverage Container (GST/HST) Regulations is to:
- Define the rules governing the **collection, return, and taxation of returnable beverage containers** (such as bottles and cans) used in the beverage industry.
- Ensure that **GST/HST is applied appropriately** when beverage containers are returned to producers or retailers for recycling or reuse.
- Establish a **clear and enforceable framework** to prevent tax avoidance or evasion through container reuse or recycling schemes.

#### **3. Prescribed Acts for Compliance**
For the purposes of paragraph 226(2)(b) of the Excise Tax Act, the following legislation is **prescribed** as relevant to the regulation:
- **The Environment Act, S.N.S. 1994–95, c. 1**  
  → Provides the environmental framework under which beverage container programs operate, including responsibilities related to waste management and pollution prevention.

- **The Beverage Containers Act, R.S.N.B. 2011, c. 121**  
  → Applies in the **Northwest Territories** and outlines the rules for beverage container deposit and return systems, including container recovery and tax obligations.

- **The Beverage Containers Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. B-2.1**  
  → Applies in **Prince Edward Island** and establishes similar provisions for beverage container programs and associated tax rules.

- **The Environmental Protection Act, S.N.L. 2002, c. E-14.2**  
  → Applies in **Newfoundland and Labrador** and supports environmental protection measures tied to beverage container handling and recycling.

> ⚠️ **Note on Repeal**: The text includes two notes indicating that these provisions were **repealed by SOR/2013-44, section 13**.  
> This means that the **original reference to these Acts being "prescribed" is no longer in force** as of the date of the repeal.  
> Therefore, the current regulation may not rely on these specific Acts as a basis for the prescribed rules.  
> The repeal suggests that the government has replaced or updated the regulatory framework, likely with more modern or comprehensive legislation.

### **Key Implications and Context**
- The regulation is part of a broader **environmental and fiscal policy** strategy to:
  - Promote **container recycling** and reduce litter.
  - Generate **revenue** through the taxation of returnable containers.
  - Ensure **fair and consistent tax treatment** across provinces and territories.

- The inclusion of provincial beverage container acts indicates that **provincial legislation** plays a role in shaping the tax and return mechanisms, reflecting a **shared jurisdiction** between federal (Excise Tax Act) and provincial authorities.

- The **repeal** of the reference to these Acts suggests a shift in regulatory focus—possibly toward a **federalized, streamlined system** or a more integrated approach to beverage container taxation and environmental management.

### **Conclusion**
The Returnable Beverage Container (GST/HST) Regulations were intended to establish a standardized federal framework for taxing returnable beverage containers under the Excise Tax Act. It relied on specific provincial environmental and beverage container legislation to define compliance and operational procedures. However, due to the **repeal of those references in SOR/2013-44, s. 13**, the regulation no longer references these acts as prescribed. This indicates that the regulation is either:
- **Outdated**, or
- **Replaced** by newer legislation, or
- **No longer in active force** in its current form.

Thus, while the **intent and structure** of the regulation remain relevant to beverage container taxation, its **current legal standing is limited** due to the repeal of the prescribed Acts.

**Recommendation for Users**:  
This regulation should be reviewed in conjunction with **current federal and provincial beverage container laws** and **updated Excise Tax Act provisions** to determine its current applicability. The repeal notice (SOR/2013-44, s. 13) should be consulted to understand the replacement or transition measures.
