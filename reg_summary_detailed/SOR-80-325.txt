**Detailed Summary of the Trident Aircraft Ltd. Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Context**
The **Trident Aircraft Ltd. Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** and the **Treasury Board**. This action was authorized under **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote No. 1 of the Appropriation Act No. 2, 1978–79**.

These regulations establish a framework for **government-backed insurance of loans** made to **Trident Aircraft Ltd.**, a Canadian aerospace company, by private lenders. The primary objective is to mitigate financial risk for private lenders who extend capital to Trident Aircraft Ltd., thereby encouraging investment in a high-risk, emerging industry (aerospace manufacturing).

### **2. Title and Citation**
- The regulations are officially titled: **"Trident Aircraft Ltd. Regulations"**.
- They may be cited as such in legal and administrative references.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several key terms:

- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce**. This is the responsible government department overseeing the implementation of the insurance program.

- **Private Lender**: Defined as any lender approved by the Minister who is:
  - Not the **Government of Canada**;
  - Not the **government of any province of Canada**;
  - Not an **agency** of any such government or any company effectively controlled by such a government or its agencies;
  - Not a **municipal corporation**.

> *Purpose of this definition*: To exclude public entities and government-controlled bodies from participating as private lenders, ensuring that only independent, non-governmental financial institutions or individuals are eligible for insurance coverage.

- **Trident Aircraft Ltd.**: A company incorporated under the laws of the **Province of British Columbia**, with its **head office in Vancouver, BC**.

---

### **4. Insurance Coverage – Scope and Limits**
Under the regulations, the Minister may provide insurance on loans made by private lenders to Trident Aircraft Ltd., subject to the following conditions:

- **Maximum Coverage**: The insurance amount **cannot exceed 90%** of the value of any individual loan.
- **Aggregate Limit**: The total amount of insurance provided **cannot exceed two million Canadian dollars (CAD)** across all loans.
- **Authorization Basis**: The power to provide insurance is derived from **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote No. 1 of the Appropriation Act No. 2, 1978–79**, which grants the Minister fiscal authority for such programs.

> *Significance*: This cap limits the government’s financial exposure and ensures that the insurance program is targeted and financially sustainable.

---

### **5. Application Process**
A private lender wishing to have a loan insured must:
- Submit a formal **application to the Minister**.
- Provide **all information** that the Minister may reasonably require to assess the risk, verify the lender’s eligibility, and determine the suitability of the loan for insurance.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency, due diligence, and risk assessment before insurance is granted.

---

### **6. Insurance Fee**
Private lenders who receive insurance must:
- Pay an **annual insurance fee** of **1% per annum** of the total amount of insurance in force at any given time.
- Pay the fee **in advance**, in **semi-annual installments** (i.e., twice a year).

> *Example*: If a lender has $500,000 in insured loans, the annual fee is $5,000 (1% of $500,000), paid in two installments of $2,500 each.

> *Purpose*: Recovers administrative and risk management costs from the beneficiaries of the insurance program.

### **7. Repayment Demand and Insurance Payment Limitations**
If a private lender **demands repayment of a loan before its maturity date**, and insurance has been provided for that loan, the amount payable to the lender under the insurance policy is **limited** to the **lesser of two amounts**:

1. **The amount of insurance in effect on the date of the demand**;  
2. **90% of the loss incurred by the private lender**.

> *Example*:  
> - Suppose the loan was insured for $1 million.  
> - The lender demands early repayment and incurs a loss of $700,000.  
> - 90% of the loss = $630,000.  
> - Insurance amount in force at time of demand = $1 million.  
> - Therefore, the insurance payout is capped at **$630,000** (the lesser of $1 million and $630,000).

> *Purpose*: Prevents the government from covering losses that exceed the risk threshold (90%) and ensures that the insurance is not used to subsidize losses beyond what is deemed reasonable or allowable under the program.

  - Provisions for termination, review, or revocation of insurance;
  - Requirements for reporting or compliance.

> *Implication*: The Minister retains discretion to refuse or modify insurance based on risk assessment, economic conditions, or policy changes.

### **9. Overall Objectives and Policy Implications**
- **Stimulate Investment**: Encourage private capital to flow into high-risk, innovative industries like aerospace manufacturing.
- **Reduce Risk for Lenders**: Provide financial protection against default or early repayment, which are common in emerging or volatile sectors.
- **Limit Government Exposure**: Caps are in place to prevent excessive public spending.
- **Promote Canadian Industry**: Supports the development of domestic aerospace capabilities through targeted financial support.

- The regulation is **time-bound**, issued under a specific appropriation act from 1978–79, suggesting it was a temporary measure tied to a specific economic or industrial initiative.

### **Conclusion**
The **Trident Aircraft Ltd. Regulations** constitute a targeted, risk-managed insurance program designed to support private investment in a high-risk aerospace enterprise. By limiting coverage to 90% of loans, capping total exposure at $2 million, requiring detailed applications, and imposing a fee structure, the regulations balance the need to protect private lenders with fiscal responsibility and risk control. The insurance is not a full guarantee but a partial risk mitigation tool, with clear limits on payouts in the event of early repayment or loss.

This regulation serves as a model for government-financed risk-sharing programs in emerging or capital-intensive industries.
