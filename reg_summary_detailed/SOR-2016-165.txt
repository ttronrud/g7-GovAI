**Regulatory Summary: Candles Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The Candles Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. This action is authorized under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. Section 37 empowers the Governor General in Council (i.e., the federal government) to make regulations to implement, interpret, or enforce the provisions of the CCPSA, particularly in relation to consumer product safety.

**2. Core Prohibition**  
The central provision of these regulations is a **mandatory safety requirement** for candles:  
👉 *A candle must not reignite spontaneously after it is extinguished.*

This means that no candle, regardless of type (e.g., paraffin, soy, beeswax, or other fuel sources), may be designed, manufactured, sold, or distributed in Canada in a way that allows it to catch fire or re-ignite on its own after being extinguished. Such spontaneous reignition poses a significant fire hazard, especially in homes, dormitories, or other occupied spaces, and could lead to property damage or personal injury.

**3. Scope and Application**  
The regulation applies to all candles that are:
- Manufactured, imported, or distributed in Canada, and  
- Intended for consumer use (e.g., decorative, functional, or for holiday use).

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Wax candles  
- Pillar candles  
- Taper candles  
- Candles with wicks (including those with or without metal or other components)  
- Candles that are sold in retail or online environments  

The rule does not apply to candles that are explicitly designed for use in controlled environments (e.g., industrial or laboratory settings), unless such use is clearly indicated and regulated separately. However, the general consumer market is covered.

**4. Enforcement and Compliance**  
The regulation is enforceable under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. The Minister of Health, in collaboration with Health Canada’s Consumer Product Safety Division, has the authority to:
- Inspect products  
- Conduct market surveillance  
- Take enforcement actions (such as recalls, fines, or product seizures) against manufacturers, importers, or distributors that violate the regulation  
- Issue warnings or corrective orders to ensure compliance  

Non-compliance may result in penalties, including financial fines or the removal of products from the market.

**5. Repeal Clause**  
The regulation explicitly includes a **repeal clause** indicating that these specific Candles Regulations are intended to replace or supersede any previous rules or guidance on candle safety that may have existed prior to 2010. This ensures a clear, up-to-date, and legally binding standard for candle safety in Canada.

**6. Effective Date**  
These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws). Registration in the Gazette is the formal step that makes the regulation legally effective and enforceable across Canada.

**Purpose and Public Safety Significance**  
The primary goal of the Candles Regulations is to reduce the risk of accidental fires caused by candles reigniting after being extinguished. This is a common hazard in households, particularly during holidays or in poorly ventilated spaces. By mandating that candles cannot reignite, the regulation enhances consumer safety and aligns Canada’s product standards with international best practices in fire safety.

**Conclusion**  
The Candles Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish a clear, enforceable safety standard that prohibits candles from spontaneously reigniting after being extinguished. This regulation strengthens consumer protection under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, ensuring that candles sold in Canada are safe and pose minimal fire risk to users. It is a key example of how federal regulations target specific consumer product risks to protect public health and safety.
