#### **2. Key Transfer: Control and Supervision to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**

Effective **December 12, 2003**, the following public service functions and units within the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI)** are transferred to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**:

##### a) International Region – Intelligence and Interdiction Functions
- The **portion of the International Region** responsible for:
  - **Intelligence gathering** and analysis,
  - **Interdiction operations** (e.g., detecting and preventing the smuggling of people, goods, or contraband),
  - Conducted **overseas on a full-time basis**.
- This transfer consolidates international enforcement and intelligence activities under CBSA’s operational command.

##### b) Departmental Delivery Network Branch – Immigration Warrant Response Centre
- The **Immigration Warrant Response Centre (IWRC)**, which handles:
  - The execution of immigration warrants,
  - Coordinating responses to enforcement actions involving immigration violations.
- This unit is now under CBSA’s control and supervision.

##### c) Vancouver Offices
- **Vancouver Enforcement Office** – responsible for on-the-ground enforcement activities in Vancouver.

- **Intelligence Unit, Montreal** – responsible for intelligence activities in Montreal.

> These units are transferred to CBSA to strengthen integrated enforcement and intelligence capabilities across major urban centres.

- All **non-port-of-entry offices** within Canada that:
  - Engage in **full-time enforcement activities**, including:
    - Removals (deportations),

    - War crimes investigations (where applicable).
  - Conduct **intelligence functions** related to immigration enforcement.

#### **3. Additional Provision: Ministerial Power Transfer**

For **greater certainty and clarity**, the regulation includes a separate transfer of **ministerial powers and functions**:

- The **powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** under **subsection 77(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)** are transferred:
  - From the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** to the **Solicitor General of Canada**.
  - The Solicitor General is now styled as the **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.

> This includes the authority to **sign the "certificate"** required under subsection 77(1) of the IRPA — a certificate that confirms the eligibility of an individual to be removed from Canada under immigration law.

> This transfer is significant because:
> - It shifts the legal authority for removal decisions from the immigration minister to a senior public safety minister.
> - It aligns enforcement and removal powers with broader public safety and national security objectives.
> - It reflects a broader government strategy to integrate immigration enforcement with public safety governance.

#### **4. Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

The primary objectives of this regulation are:

- **Enhanced Coordination**: To bring all enforcement and intelligence functions under a single, unified agency (CBSA), improving inter-agency cooperation and operational efficiency.
- **Improved Oversight and Accountability**: Centralizing enforcement functions under CBSA enables better monitoring, reporting, and compliance with legal and policy standards.
- **Public Safety Focus**: By transferring enforcement and intelligence responsibilities to a public safety minister, the government emphasizes the role of immigration enforcement as part of national security and public safety.
- **Streamlined Operations**: Reduces duplication and bureaucratic fragmentation by aligning enforcement activities with CBSA’s mandate.

---

#### **5. Significance and Impact**

- **Structural Change**: Marks a major reorganization of the federal immigration enforcement structure, moving from a departmental model to a more agency-driven model.
- **Cultural Shift**: Reflects a shift in how immigration enforcement is viewed — not just as a legal or administrative function, but as a core component of national security and public safety.
- **Legal Clarity**: The specific transfer of the certificate-signing power provides clear legal authority to the new minister, reducing ambiguity in the removal process.

---

#### **6. Effective Date**

All transfers take effect on **December 12, 2003**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant restructuring of Canada’s immigration enforcement architecture. It consolidates key enforcement and intelligence functions from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration into the Canada Border Services Agency, enhancing operational efficiency and national security integration. Additionally, it reassigns critical ministerial authority — particularly the power to sign removal certificates — to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, reinforcing the link between immigration enforcement and broader public safety policy.
