**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Joint Notice Extending the Prohibition Period for Certain Activities on Georges Bank**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation is a formal **Joint Notice** issued by two federal and provincial ministers under the authority granted in **subsection 141(2)a** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act").

- **Original Prohibition Period**:  
  On **April 11, 2016**, the Federal Minister and the Provincial Minister issued a Joint Notice (SOR/2016-70) that prohibited certain petroleum-related activities — specifically, exploration and drilling, as well as production, conservation, processing, and transportation of petroleum — in a designated portion of the offshore area known as **Georges Bank**.  
  This original prohibition period was set to end on **December 31, 2022**.

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The authority to impose or extend such prohibitions stems from the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*, which was enacted in 1988 (S.C. 1988, c. 28) and amended in 2015 (S.C. 2015, c. 39, s. 3).  
  Subsection 141(1)a allows for the initial imposition of a prohibition period, while subsection 141(2)a authorizes the extension of that period when appropriate.

### **2. Purpose of the Extension**

The Ministers have determined, after a comprehensive review of:

- Environmental impacts (including marine ecosystem health, fish stocks, and biodiversity),
- Socio-economic considerations (such as impacts on fishing communities, Indigenous rights, and local economies),
- Scientific assessments of the region’s ecological sensitivity,
- and other relevant factors,

that **a 10-year extension** of the prohibition period is both necessary and appropriate.

This extension reflects a commitment to **protecting the marine environment** of Georges Bank, a globally significant area for marine life and fisheries, while also ensuring that any future development is based on sound science and long-term sustainability.

### **5. Significance and Implications**

- **Environmental Protection**:  
  Georges Bank is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic. The prohibition helps prevent potential harm from oil exploration and drilling, which could disrupt sensitive habitats, affect fish populations (such as cod and haddock), and threaten ecosystem stability.

- **Socio-Economic Impact**:  
  The ban supports the livelihoods of fishing communities in Nova Scotia and surrounding regions by preserving access to fish stocks and maintaining the integrity of marine resources.

- **Scientific and Policy Precedent**:  
  The extension demonstrates a policy shift toward **precautionary management** of offshore resources, prioritizing environmental safety over short-term economic gains.

- **Transparency and Review**:  
  The decision was based on a thorough review process involving environmental assessments, stakeholder consultations, and scientific input, reinforcing public trust in the regulatory process.
