**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47)**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation, enacted under the *Financial Administration Act* (specifically **Section 157**), serves to **discontinue the requirement** that certain annual reports be submitted to Parliament. The decision is based on a formal assessment by the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) that these reports **contain no additional or essential information** beyond what is already provided in the **Public Accounts** or in **expenditure estimates** submitted to Parliament.

The core rationale is **efficiency and transparency in parliamentary oversight**. Since the information in these reports is either redundant or already available in more comprehensive, official financial or performance documents, continuing to require their submission adds unnecessary administrative burden without enhancing parliamentary accountability.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 157 of the Financial Administration Act**:  
  This section empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting through the executive) to **discontinue or modify the submission of reports** to Parliament if they are found to:
  - Contain information already included in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates, or
  - Provide less information than required by law.

The regulation is a formal exercise of this statutory authority, grounded in the principle that **parliamentary oversight should be focused on material, non-redundant information**.

---

### **Scope of the Discontinuation**

The regulation identifies and **discontinues the requirement** for the following annual reports to be laid before one or both Houses of Parliament:

| Report | Relevant Act and Section |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Annual Report of Statistics Canada** | *Statistics Act*, s. 4 |
| **Annual Report of the Correctional Service of Canada** | *Corrections and Conditional Release Act*, s. 95 |
| **Annual Report of the Department of National Health and Welfare** | *Department of National Health and Welfare Act*, s. 13 |
| **Annual Report of the Department of Public Works** | *Public Works Act*, s. 35 |
| **Annual Report of the Department of Supply and Services** | *Department of Supply and Services Act*, s. 19 |
| **Annual Report of the Department of the Solicitor General** | *Department of the Solicitor General Act*, s. 5 |
| **Annual Report on the Farm Debt Review Boards** | *Farm Debt Review Act*, s. 38 |
| **Annual Report on the Administration of Part I of the Canada Labour Code** | *Canada Labour Code*, s. 121 |
| **Annual Report on the Administration of Part III of the Canada Labour Code** | *Canada Labour Code*, s. 263 |
| **Annual Report on the Administration of the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act** | *Plant Breeders’ Rights Act*, s. 78 |
| **Annual Report of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** | *Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act*, s. 13 |
| **Annual Report of the Library and Archives of Canada** | *Library and Archives of Canada Act*, s. 11 |
| **Annual Report of the Canadian Space Agency** | *Canadian Space Agency Act*, s. 23 |
| **Annual Report on the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA)** | *Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency Act*, ss. 9 and 21 |

> **Note**: Each of these reports was previously required by statute to be laid before Parliament annually. This regulation effectively **removes that requirement**.

### **Key Justification and Rationale**

1. **Redundancy with Public Accounts and Estimates**  
   The government determined that the content of these reports does not provide new or unique information beyond what is already available in:
   - The **Public Accounts of Canada**, which detail government spending and financial performance.
   - **Expenditure estimates**, which outline projected costs and budget allocations.

2. **Reduction in Parliamentary Burden**  
   By eliminating redundant reports, Parliament avoids:
   - Overwhelming itself with repetitive or duplicative information.
   - Spending time reviewing documents that do not add value to fiscal oversight.

3. **Cost and Efficiency Gains**  
   The discontinuation reduces administrative costs for federal departments, the Treasury Board, and the Office of the Auditor General, while streamlining the reporting process.

4. **Alignment with Modern Governance Principles**  
   The move reflects a broader shift toward **results-based accountability**, where performance and financial data are integrated into consolidated reporting frameworks (e.g., the Public Accounts and performance reports), rather than scattered in separate annual summaries.

---

### **Implications and Effects**

- **No immediate impact on departmental operations**: Departments continue to prepare and maintain these reports internally for internal governance and reporting to oversight bodies.
- **Parliamentary access to information**: The information remains accessible through other official channels, such as the Public Accounts, the Auditor General’s reports, or the departmental annual reports filed under other provisions.
- **Potential for future review**: The decision is not permanent. If new information or accountability needs arise, the requirement could be revived through legislative amendment or ministerial recommendation.

---

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- The regulation **does not affect** the ability of departments to publish their reports publicly or to provide them to oversight bodies (e.g., the Auditor General, the Senate, or the House of Commons).
- The discontinuation applies only to the **formal requirement to lay the reports before Parliament**.
- Reports may still be used for internal management, policy review, or public disclosure, but **no longer need to be submitted to Parliament as a statutory requirement**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **significant streamlining of federal parliamentary reporting requirements**. It reflects a pragmatic approach to governance, where redundant or duplicative reporting is eliminated to improve transparency, efficiency, and focus on essential fiscal and performance information. By aligning departmental reporting with the Public Accounts and expenditure estimates, the government ensures that Parliament receives a consolidated, comprehensive view of government operations without being burdened by repetitive or redundant annual summaries.

This action underscores the evolving nature of parliamentary oversight in Canada — moving from volume-based reporting to **quality, relevance, and accountability-driven reporting**.
