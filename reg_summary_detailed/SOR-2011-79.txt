4. **Drugs intended for veterinary use only**

> These exclusions ensure that public services and non-commercial research are not burdened by licensing fees.

---

### 💡 **7. Remission of Fees (Fee Waiver)**

A key feature is the **remission mechanism** to prevent undue financial burden on small or new businesses.

#### Conditions for Remission:
- If the applicant’s **actual gross revenue** from activities under the licence during the **previous calendar year** is **less than 1%** of the base fee ($4,510), then:
  - The applicant can claim **remission** of the **difference** between the fee and 1% of their actual revenue.
- The applicant must provide a **statement signed by the individual responsible for financial affairs** stating their actual gross revenue.

> Example:  
> - Base fee = $4,510  
> - 1% of base fee = $45.10  
> - If applicant’s actual revenue = $30,000 → 1% = $300 → exceeds $45.10 → no remission  
> - If actual revenue = $100 → 1% = $10 → less than $45.10 → remission of $35.10

> ⚠️ *This remission clause was repealed by SOR/2019-134, s. 5.*

---

### 📅 **8. Payment Timing and Deferral**

- The fee is payable **at the time of submitting** the application.
- However, if the applicant has **not completed their first full calendar year** of operations under the licence:
  - The fee is **deferred until the end of that year**.

> This allows new businesses to start operations without immediate financial pressure.

> ⚠️ *This deferral rule was repealed by SOR/2019-134, s. 14.*

---

### 🔍 **9. Auditor Requirement and Enforcement (Conditional on Remission)**

If the Minister determines the financial statement provided under section 31(2) is **inadequate**, the Minister may require the applicant to provide:

- **Audited sales records** from a **qualified independent auditor**.

#### Timeline:
- The applicant has **60 days** to submit the audited records after the Minister’s request.

#### Consequences of Non-Compliance:
- If records are **not submitted within 60 days**:
  - The **difference between the fee due and the amount already paid** becomes **immediately payable**.
- If audited records show:
  - The amount paid is **less than the actual fee** → **difference is immediately payable**.
  - The amount paid is **greater than the actual fee** → **remission is granted**, and the Minister **must repay** the excess.

> ⚠️ *This section was repealed by SOR/2019-134, s. 15.*

---

### 📅 **10. Effective Date and Continuation Provisions**

- The regulations came into force on **April 1, 2011**.
- If registered after that date, they come into force on the **date of registration**.

> ⚠️ **Critical Continuation Clause (Post-Repeal):**  
> Even after repeal, the **previous version of the regulations** continues to apply in certain cases:
> - Fees deferred under specific subsections (e.g., 9(1), 10, 17(4), 35(4), 43(1), 48(3), 51(4))
> - Remissions under specific sections (e.g., 11, 17(2), 44, 51(2))

> This ensures **continuity of obligations** for existing applications or deferred payments.
