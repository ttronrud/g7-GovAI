**Detailed Summary of the *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* (S.C. 2011, c. 7, s. 3(2), 5(2), 11; R.S., c. C-46)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* are a set of administrative rules made under the *Criminal Code of Canada* (the "Code") to establish standardized procedures for the collection, analysis, storage, handling, and destruction of bodily substances provided by offenders under specific court-ordered conditions. These regulations apply in three distinct legal contexts:  
1. **Probation orders** (under section 732.1 of the Code),  
2. **Conditional sentence orders** (under section 742.3 of the Code), and  
3. **Recognizance conditions to keep the peace** (under section 810.3 of the Code).

The regulations ensure consistency, safety, and legal compliance across provinces and territories by setting out technical requirements for sample collection and management, and by requiring notification to the federal government when provincial or territorial authorities plan to conduct such activities.

### **Key Provisions and Structure**

#### **1. Definitions**
- **Code**: Refers to the *Criminal Code* of Canada.
- **Qualified Medical Practitioner**: A person who is legally licensed and authorized to practice medicine under provincial law (e.g., physicians, surgeons).
- **Qualified Technician**: Any individual or class of individuals designated by the Attorney General of a province or territory as qualified to collect blood samples for use under specific sections of the Code (e.g., sections 254, 256, 258). This designation must be formally approved.

> *Note*: Only qualified medical practitioners and qualified technicians may be authorized to take blood samples.

---

#### **2. Applicability by Court Order Type**

The regulations apply to bodily substance samples provided by offenders under the following court-ordered conditions:

##### **A. Probation Orders (Section 732.1(3)(c.1) or (c.2))**
- Applies when a court imposes a probation order with conditions requiring the provision of bodily substances.
- Requires that samples be collected, analyzed, stored, and destroyed in accordance with the rules below.

##### **B. Conditional Sentence Orders (Section 742.3(2)(a.1) or (a.2))**
- Applies when a person is sentenced to a conditional sentence (a form of alternative sentencing), and the court imposes conditions requiring the provision of bodily substances.
- Same procedural requirements as probation orders.

##### **C. Recognizance Conditions to Keep the Peace (Section 810.3(1))**
- Applies to individuals who have been released on recognizance with conditions to "keep the peace," including requirements to provide bodily substances.
- Includes specific Code paragraphs such as:
  - 810(3.02)(b), (c)
  - 810.01(4.1)(f), (g)
  - 810.1(3.02)(h), (i)
  - 810.2(4.1)(f), (g)

> All three contexts require the same core procedural standards for sample handling.

#### **3. Prescribed Bodily Substances**
The following bodily substances are legally recognized and regulated under each of the above conditions:
- Breath  
- Urine  
- Blood  
- Hair  
- Saliva  

These are the only substances permitted under the regulations for compliance with the relevant Code provisions.

---

#### **4. Requirements for Blood Sample Collection**

- **Only qualified medical practitioners and qualified technicians** may be authorized to collect blood samples.
- A **qualified medical practitioner must assess** that taking the blood sample would **not endanger the person’s life or health** before the sample is taken.
- This requirement ensures that medical safety is prioritized and that no unnecessary risk is imposed on the offender.

---

#### **5. Breath Sample Analysis Requirements**

- A breath sample must be analyzed using one of two approved methods:
  - An instrument approved under the *Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order*, or  
  - A screening device approved under the *Approved Screening Devices Order*.
- This ensures accuracy, reliability, and standardization in breath testing, especially in cases involving alcohol or drug use.

---

#### **6. Blood Sample Storage Requirements**

- Blood samples must be stored in a container that has been **approved under the Order Approving Blood Sample Containers**.
- This standardization prevents contamination, degradation, or tampering and ensures the integrity of the sample for forensic or legal purposes.

---

#### **7. Destruction of Samples**

- In all three contexts (probation, conditional sentence, recognizance), a sample of a bodily substance must be **destroyed within one year** of the date it is provided.
- This applies to all types of samples (breath, urine, blood, hair, saliva).
- The one-year destruction deadline is a critical safeguard to protect privacy, prevent misuse, and ensure compliance with legal timelines.

---

#### **8. Notification Requirement to Federal Government**

Before any province or territory:
- Proposes to designate individuals (e.g., technicians) or
- Establishes specifications (e.g., testing protocols, equipment standards) under subsections of the Code (specifically 732.1(8), 742.3(6), or 810.3(1)),

It **must notify the Attorney General of Canada in writing** that the jurisdiction has:
- The **technical capability** to perform sample collection,
- The **operational capability** to analyze, store, handle, and destroy samples appropriately.

> This requirement ensures federal oversight and consistency across jurisdictions, particularly in relation to the use of blood and breath samples in criminal justice.

---

#### **9. Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day the **Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in *R. v. Shoker*** comes into force.
- If the regulations are registered after that date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This links the regulations to a major judicial decision (R. v. Shoker), which addressed issues of privacy, bodily autonomy, and the legality of collecting and analyzing bodily substances as part of sentencing conditions. The regulations were developed in response to that ruling to ensure compliance with constitutional principles.

### **Key Objectives and Principles**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal Compliance** | Ensures all sample procedures comply with the *Criminal Code* and relevant court orders. |
| **Medical Safety** | Prevents harm to individuals by requiring medical assessment before blood draws. |
| **Standardization** | Uses approved instruments and containers to ensure consistency and reliability of results. |
| **Privacy and Data Protection** | Mandates timely destruction of samples to minimize long-term retention and exposure. |
| **Federal Oversight** | Requires provincial/territorial authorities to demonstrate capacity before implementing sample programs. |

### **Significance and Context**

These regulations were introduced in response to the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in *R. v. Shoker* (2011), which held that:
- The collection of bodily substances (e.g., blood, breath) under sentencing conditions must be justified by a legitimate purpose.
- There must be a clear connection between the sample and the sentence.
- Individuals have a right to privacy and bodily integrity.

The regulations provide a **balanced framework** that:
- Allows courts to impose monitoring conditions (e.g., for drug offenses or repeat offenders),
- Maintains public safety and law enforcement needs,
- Respects individual rights through procedural safeguards.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Samples of Bodily Substances Regulations* establish a comprehensive, standardized, and legally grounded system for the collection, handling, and disposal of bodily substances in Canada. By applying uniform rules across probation, conditional sentencing, and recognizance conditions, the regulations promote fairness, consistency, and accountability. They also reflect the constitutional imperative to protect individual rights while enabling effective judicial oversight.

These rules are not standalone—they are part of a broader legal ecosystem involving the *Criminal Code*, federal-provincial coordination, and judicial interpretation of privacy rights. Their enforcement depends on adherence to medical, technical, and procedural standards, all of which are designed to ensure both public safety and respect for human dignity.

These regulations were last in force as of March 31, 2015 (SI/2014-105), and remain applicable unless amended or replaced by new legislation.
