### **Detailed Summary of the Family Support Orders and Agreements Garnishment Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Purpose**

The *Family Support Orders and Agreements Garnishment Regulations* (commonly referred to as the **Garnishment Regulations**) were made under **section 61 of the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act (FOAEAA)**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. These regulations came into force on the day that **Part II of the FOAEAA became effective** (originally enacted in 1986, as S.C. 1986, c. 5).

**Purpose**:  
To establish the rules governing the **garnishment of federal government moneys** to satisfy **family support obligations**, such as child support, spousal support, or other financial provisions ordered by a court or included in a family agreement.

These regulations provide a clear framework for how federal income and benefits can be subject to garnishment when a person is liable for unpaid family support, while also protecting certain types of payments and ensuring procedural fairness.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act*.
- **"Garnishable moneys"** are defined in **subsection 23(1)** of the Act and are limited to specific federal income and benefit programs, as listed below.

---

#### **3. Designated Garnishable Moneys (Under Section 3)**

The following federal programs and provisions are designated as **garnishable**, **provided they meet specific exclusions**:

| Program / Act | Relevant Provision(s) | Key Exclusions |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Income Tax Act** | Sections 164 and 216 | Excludes **subsection 164(1.4)** when it applies to amounts excluded by provincial income tax law from garnishment |
| **Excise Tax Act** | Section 253 | Applies to employee or partner rebates (e.g., tax rebates) |
| **Department of Employment and Social Development Act** | Section 7 | Grants and contributions under: <br> - Skills Link program <br> - Apprenticeship Incentive Grant <br> - Apprenticeship Completion Grant |
| **Wage Earner Protection Program Act** | Entire Act | Excludes fees/expenses paid to trustees or receivers under subsection 22(2) |
| **Employment Insurance Act** | Entire Act | Excludes benefits paid on behalf of a beneficiary to a province or municipality |
| **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** | Entire Act | Excludes: <br> - Benefits to children of disabled contributors (para. 44(1)(e)) <br> - Orphan benefits (para. 44(1)(f)) <br> - Amounts deducted and paid to provincial governments under subsection 65(2) |
| **Old Age Security Act (OAS)** | Sections 3, 11, 19, 21 | Excludes amounts deducted and paid to provinces under subsection 36(2) |
| **Department of Social Development Act** | Section 7 | Grants under the **Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities** (note: this provision was repealed in 2011, SOR/2011-189, s.1) |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several of these designations were **repealed or amended** over time:
> - The reference to the Department of Social Development Act (Opportunities Fund) was **repealed in 2011**.
> - A provision related to the garnishment period (previously 35 days) was **repealed in 2014** (SOR/2014-101, s.3).

Thus, **only the currently active programs** listed above are subject to garnishment under the current version of the Regulations.

---

#### **4. Priority of Garnishment (When Multiple Payments Are Due)**

- If a judgment debtor becomes due to receive **two or more garnishable moneys** on the **same day**, they shall be garnished **in the order** in which the relevant provisions are listed in **Section 3** of the Regulations.
- Example: If both CPP and OAS payments are due on the same day, CPP comes first due to its position in the list.

> This ensures a **clear hierarchy** in the enforcement of garnishments, preventing ambiguity in priority.

---

#### **5. Continuity of Garnishment When Additional Payments Become Due**

- If **additional garnishable moneys** become payable to a debtor **after** a garnishment is already in effect, the **existing garnishments continue to have priority**.
- The new moneys are not garnished until the existing ones are fully satisfied.
- This prevents a debtor from being "double-garnished" or having their payments disrupted by new obligations.

> This rule protects the **integrity of existing enforcement actions** and ensures consistency in the payment process.

---

#### **6. Form of Application to Garnishee (Schedule 1)**

- For **paragraph 28(c)** of the FOAEAA, the application to garnishee must be submitted in the **form set out in Schedule 1**.
- This form includes:
  - Declaration of truthfulness of information
  - Name and signature of the applicant (declarant)
  - Department of Justice reference number
  - Date
  - Details of the garnishee summons (court or entity that issued it)
  - Account number
  - Amounts owed: arrears and periodic payments
  - Statement that federal moneys under designated programs may be garnished
  - Contact information for the court or issuing authority

> This standardized form ensures **clarity, transparency, and legal compliance** in initiating garnishment proceedings.

---

#### **7. Service of Documents on the Minister of Justice**

- Service of documents (e.g., garnishee summons) on the **Minister of Justice** must be done in one of the following ways:
  1. **In accordance with the law of the province** where the court that issued the summons is located.
  2. **By registered mail** to:
     > Department of Justice  
     > Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Unit  
     > Ottawa, Ontario  
     > K1A 0H8  
  3. **By electronic communication**, if such a method has been **agreed upon** between the provincial enforcement service and the Department of Justice.

> This ensures **efficient and legally valid service** of documents, even across provincial boundaries.

---

#### **8. Timeframe for Minister’s Response (Section 41)**

- The **Minister of Justice** must respond to a garnishee summons **within 20 days** of receiving the documents (as per section 28 of the Act).
- This response is required **to confirm or deny** the validity of the garnishment or to initiate further processing.

> This establishes a **clear timeline** for administrative review and ensures timely processing of garnishment applications.

---

#### **9. Notice to the Judgment Debtor (Section 45)**

- Once the Minister has received the summons, they must issue a **notice to the judgment debtor** within **20 days**.
- The notice must be in the form set out in **Schedule 2**.
- It must be sent to **all addresses** provided in the original application to garnishee.

> This ensures the debtor is **fully informed** of the garnishment and has an opportunity to respond or challenge it.

---

#### **10. Processing Fee and Recovery Rules**

- A **processing fee of $38 per year** is charged to the judgment debtor for each year during which the garnishee summons is **binding on Her Majesty**.
- The fee is **only recoverable in the year** it becomes payable.
- If:
  - The garnishment ends before the end of the year, or
  - The debtor is no longer bound by the summons during the year,
  → The fee (or part thereof) is **remitted** (refunded).

> This protects debtors from being charged for unused or terminated garnishments and ensures **fairness in cost recovery**.

> Example: If a garnishment is issued on January 1, 2024, and ends on June 30, 2024, the $38 fee is only charged for the first 6 months (pro-rated), and the remainder is refunded.

---

#### **11. Protection of Federal Payments**

- The Regulations **do not apply to all federal benefits**. Specific exclusions exist for:
  - CPP benefits to children of disabled contributors
  - Orphan benefits
  - OAS deductions to provinces
  - Certain tax rebates and grants (with exceptions)

> These exclusions are designed to **protect vulnerable populations** and ensure that essential benefits are not unnecessarily seized.

---

#### **12. Continuity of Older Rules (Section 10–12)**

- Sections 10 to 12 of the FOAEAA, as they existed **immediately before the Regulations came into force**, **continue to apply** to any garnishee summons served **before that date**.
- These rules remain in effect **until the next anniversary** of the day the summons became binding on Her Majesty.

> This provides **legal continuity** for ongoing cases and avoids disruption in long-standing enforcement actions.

---

#### **13. Garnishment Process Flow (Summary)**

1. A court or provincial entity issues a **garnishee summons** for family support.
2.
