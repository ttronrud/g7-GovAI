**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Laboratory Registration under the Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
On the recommendation of:  
- The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs  
- The Treasury Board  

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**.  

This provision grants the federal government’s administrative authority to establish and regulate fees for specific services or activities under federal legislation, including the power to prescribe fees through regulatory orders when authorized by law.

**Subject Matter:**  
The regulation authorizes the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** to issue a **prescriptive order** setting the **fees to be paid for Laboratory Registration** under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Purpose:**  
   The primary purpose is to establish a clear, transparent, and legally enforceable fee structure for laboratories that wish to register under the Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act. This ensures that laboratories involved in testing or certifying urea-formaldehyde insulation products contribute appropriately to the administrative and regulatory costs of maintaining compliance and product safety standards.

2. **Scope of Authority:**  
   The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is empowered to:
   - Determine the specific fees (e.g., registration fees, annual renewal fees, or other applicable charges)  
   - Set the terms and conditions under which these fees are payable  
   - Issue a formal regulatory order (a "prescriptive order") that legally establishes these fees

3. **Legal Foundation:**  
   The authority is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (the federal government) to authorize fees for services or activities under federal statutes. This enables the government to fund administrative oversight, enforcement, and regulatory operations without needing to amend primary legislation.

4. **Regulatory Process:**  
   - The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs recommends the fee structure.  
   - The Treasury Board (a key body responsible for financial policy and accountability) reviews and supports the recommendation.  
   - The Governor in Council formally approves and issues the order, thereby making it legally binding.

5. **Implications:**  
   - Laboratories seeking to conduct testing or certification of urea-formaldehyde insulation products must pay the prescribed registration fees.  
   - The fees will likely be used to support regulatory oversight, quality assurance, and enforcement of safety and environmental standards related to insulation materials.  
   - The order will be published in the Canada Gazette or other official government publications, ensuring public access and transparency.

6. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   The process includes consultation and review by the Treasury Board, ensuring fiscal responsibility and alignment with broader government financial policies. The fee structure will be subject to future review and adjustment as needed.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides the legal mechanism for the federal government to establish and enforce a fee system for laboratory registration under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. It ensures that regulatory costs are properly funded while maintaining compliance with established financial administration principles. The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs will issue a formal order setting the fees, which will then become enforceable under federal law.
