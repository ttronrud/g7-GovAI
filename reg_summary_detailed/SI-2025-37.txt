#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
This regulation is issued under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "PSR Act"), specifically under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of that Act.

The regulation is formally referenced as:

#### **2. Background and Context**
On **October 26, 2021**, the Government of Canada issued **Order in Council P.C. 2021-938**, which transferred certain powers, duties, and functions related to the **Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA)** from the **Minister of Health** to the **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** and the **Associate Minister of Health**.

This initial transfer was part of a broader government initiative to align public health responsibilities with a more integrated and holistic approach to mental health and substance use issues. The rationale was to strengthen coordination between mental health and substance use services, recognizing their interconnected nature.

This action represents a **reversal or realignment** of the earlier transfer made in P.C. 2021-938, likely due to evolving policy priorities, administrative efficiency, or strategic reallocation of responsibilities within the Department of Health.

#### **5. Implications and Significance**
- **Administrative Reorganization**: Reflects a shift in how substance abuse policy is managed within the federal government. The return of the CCSA functions to the Minister of Health suggests a renewed focus on substance use as a core public health issue under the broader health portfolio.
