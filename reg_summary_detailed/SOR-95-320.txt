### **Detailed Summary of the Directions to the CRTC (Direct-to-Home (DTH) Pay-Per-View Television Programming Undertakings) Order**

This regulatory order, enacted under the *Broadcasting Act* of Canada and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on April 29, 1995, establishes a comprehensive policy framework for the **licensing of Direct-to-Home (DTH) pay-per-view television programming undertakings** in Canada. The order was developed to ensure that the pay-per-view (PPV) market operates in a **competitive, fair, and sustainable manner**, while simultaneously **supporting the development of Canadian content** and maintaining the integrity of Canada’s national broadcasting system.

---

## **Background and Policy Rationale**

The regulation is grounded in several key policy objectives:

1. **Growing Importance of Pay-Per-View Services**  
   Pay-per-view services are recognized as increasingly important for:
   - Exhibiting feature films and other television programming.
   - Providing a significant financial contribution to the production of **independently-produced Canadian programming**.

2. **Need for a Competitive Market**  
   DTH pay-per-view services should operate in a **dynamically competitive market**, with multiple providers offering diverse programming to subscribers. This competition ensures:
   - A broader range of both Canadian and foreign content.
   - Consumer choice and value.

3. **Economic Viability Should Not Be a Barrier**  
   The CRTC must **not refuse a licence solely on grounds of economic viability**, even if a proposed service is not immediately profitable. This ensures market entry is open and accessible.

4. **Mandatory Contribution to Canadian Programming**  
   All DTH pay-per-view undertakings must make a **financial contribution of more than 5% of their gross annual revenues** to the production of Canadian programming. This is a key mechanism to ensure that the industry supports domestic content creation.

5. **Integrity of the Canadian Broadcasting System**  
   The licensing policy must uphold the broader broadcasting policy set out in *subsection 3(1) of the Broadcasting Act*, which emphasizes national interest, cultural diversity, and public service.

6. **Transparency and Public Participation**  
   The proposed order was:
   - Published in the *Canada Gazette* (April 29, 1995).
   - Opened for public comment.
   - Laid before both Houses of Parliament, with 40 sitting days having passed since publication — fulfilling the statutory consultation requirements under *paragraph 8(1)(a) and (b)* of the *Broadcasting Act*.

## **Key Provisions of the Order**

### **1. Promotion of a Competitive Market**
- The CRTC is directed to **promote a dynamic, competitive market** for DTH pay-per-view programming undertakings.
- This includes encouraging multiple providers to enter the market, ensuring competition, and preventing monopolistic or anti-competitive practices.

### **2. Establishment of a Licensing Class**
- The CRTC must establish a **distinct class of licences** specifically for DTH pay-per-view television programming undertakings.
- These licences will govern how such services are authorized, operated, and regulated.

### **3. Prohibition of Exclusive or Preferential Rights**
- The CRTC must **prohibit** any DTH pay-per-view undertaking from:
  - Acquiring **exclusive rights** to distribute feature films or programming.
  - Holding **preferential distribution rights** over other providers.
- This ensures that no single provider dominates the market and limits barriers to entry.

### **4. Equitable Obligations and Financial Contribution to Canadian Programming**
- DTH pay-per-view undertakings must:
  - Make **significant financial contributions** to Canadian programming.
  - Contribute **more than 5% of gross annual revenues** to Canadian content production.
- The contribution must be:
  - **Administered independently** of the undertaking (i.e., not tied to internal financial decisions).
  - Transparent and accountable to Canadian content producers and regulators.

### **5. Application of Exhibition Ratios and Minimum Requirements**
- The CRTC must apply rules **comparable to those in place for other pay-per-view services**, including:
  - **Annual exhibition ratios** (e.g., minimum percentage of Canadian films vs. foreign films).
  - **Minimum annual numbers of Canadian films and events** to be exhibited.
  - **Remittances to rights holders** for Canadian films and events exhibited (to ensure fair compensation and support for Canadian creators).

### **6. Compliance with Canadian Satellite Policy**
- All DTH pay-per-view undertakings must adhere to the **same general Canadian satellite policy** as other broadcasters, including:
  - Use of Canadian satellite facilities.
  - Restrictions on foreign satellite use (subject to policy compliance).

### **7. No Bar to Use of Foreign Satellites for Non-Canadian Content**
- The CRTC **must not refuse a licence** solely because an applicant intends to:
  - Use **foreign satellites** to distribute **non-Canadian programming**.
- Such use is permitted **as long as it complies with general Canadian satellite policy**.

### **8. No Barrier to Holding a DTH Distribution Licence**
- The CRTC **must not deny a licence** to a pay-per-view undertaking simply because the applicant already holds a licence for a DTH distribution undertaking.
- This promotes integration and operational efficiency without creating market exclusion.

### **9. Licensing Process and Timeliness**
- The CRTC is **required to initiate a licensing process immediately upon the coming into force** of the Order.
- It must:
  - **Call for applications** for:
    - English-language DTH pay-per-view programming undertakings.
    - French-language DTH pay-per-view programming undertakings.
  - Complete these licensing processes **concurrently** with the licensing process for DTH distribution undertakings (as outlined in the earlier *Directions to the CRTC (DTH Satellite Distribution Undertakings) Order*).
