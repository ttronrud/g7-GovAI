Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Fishing Zones of Canada (Zones 1, 2 and 3) Order**

#### **1. Title and Citation**
- **Official Title**: *Fishing Zones of Canada (Zones 1, 2 and 3) Order*
- The regulation may be cited in full as: *Fishing Zones of Canada (Zones 1, 2 and 3) Order*

This document establishes and defines three designated fishing zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3—adjacent to the Canadian coast. These zones are intended to regulate fishing activities within specific maritime boundaries to promote sustainable fisheries management, ensure compliance with Canadian fisheries laws, and support coordination with international agreements when applicable.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **C.H.S. Chart** | Refers to the *Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart* (French: *carte S.H.C.*). This is the official nautical chart used by Canadian authorities to map coastal and marine features, including depth contours, coastlines, and geographical landmarks. It serves as a reference for determining accurate maritime boundaries and positions. |
| **Geographical Coordinates of Points** | Refers to the precise latitude and longitude values of specific points used to define the boundaries of each fishing zone. These coordinates are derived from **Columns III and IV** in the schedule attached to the Order. These columns typically list the latitude and longitude of key reference points that form the vertices of the polygonal boundary lines for each zone. |

#### **3. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of this Order is to **officially designate and legally define** three distinct areas of the sea adjacent to Canada’s coastline as **fishing zones of Canada**.

These zones are established to:
- Provide clear spatial boundaries for fishing operations.
- Enable enforcement of fishing regulations (e.g., catch limits, gear restrictions, seasonal closures).
- Facilitate coordination between federal, provincial, and Indigenous authorities.
- Support data collection and monitoring of fish stocks.
- Comply with international obligations under agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and bilateral fisheries agreements.

---

#### **4. Geographic Boundaries of the Zones**

Each fishing zone is defined as a **geographically bounded area** of the sea, adjacent to Canada’s coast. The boundaries are established using **straight-line segments** connecting specific **geographical coordinates of points**.

- The Order specifies three distinct zones:
  - **Zone 1**
  - **Zone 2**
  - **Zone 3**

Each zone is bounded by straight lines joining a series of points whose coordinates are listed in the **schedule** attached to the Order. These coordinates are derived from the **C.H.S. Chart**, ensuring that the boundaries are accurate, consistent with nautical standards, and aligned with actual coastal geography.

> Note: The repetition of the phrase *"Being that area of the sea adjacent to the coast of Canada, bounded by straight lines joining the geographical coordinates of points set out below"* in the text appears to be a typographical or structural redundancy, likely used to emphasize the definition of each zone. In practice, each zone will have its own unique set of coordinates in the schedule.

---

#### **5. Legal Effect and Authority**

- This Order is issued under the authority of a relevant federal statute, such as the *Fisheries Act* or *Policies and Regulations of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)*.
- Once enacted, the designated zones become **legally binding** and form part of Canada’s regulatory framework for marine resource management.
- The definition of these zones provides a clear basis for:
  - Licensing of fishing vessels.
  - Enforcement of fishing regulations.
  - Determining jurisdiction over fishing activities.
  - Preventing overfishing and protecting marine ecosystems.

---

#### **6. Practical Implications**

- **Fishing Vessels**: Must operate within the boundaries of the designated zones to comply with licensing and permit requirements.
- **Regulatory Enforcement**: Fisheries officers and monitoring systems use the defined coordinates to track vessel movements and ensure compliance.
- **Data and Mapping**: The coordinates from the C.H.S. Chart allow for precise mapping and integration into digital platforms used by DFO and other agencies.
- **Environmental Protection**: By defining clear zones, the government can better manage fish stocks and protect sensitive marine habitats.

---

#### **7. Schedule Reference**

- The full geographic details (latitude and longitude of boundary points) for each zone are provided in the **schedule** appended to the Order.
- These coordinates are critical for:
  - Navigation.
  - Legal interpretation.
  - Administrative and enforcement purposes.

> Example format in the schedule (hypothetical):
> - Zone 1:  
>   Point A: 45°N, 60°W  
>   Point B: 46°N, 62°W  
>   Point C: 47°N, 61°W  
>   (Lines connect these points to form the boundary)

---

#### **8. Limitations and Clarifications**

- The zones are **not intended to extend beyond Canada’s maritime boundaries** as defined by international law (e.g., territorial seas, exclusive economic zones).
- The zones are **adjacent to the coast**, meaning they are not open ocean areas but rather coastal waters.
- The Order does **not** specify catch limits, species restrictions, or vessel size limits—those are governed by other regulations.
- This Order only defines *geographic boundaries*. Specific fishing rules are found in other legislation or accompanying regulations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Fishing Zones of Canada (Zones 1, 2 and 3) Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that establishes the **spatial boundaries** of three coastal fishing zones in Canada. By using precise geographical coordinates from the Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart, it provides a clear, legally recognized framework for managing fishing activities in these areas. While it does not contain detailed fishing rules, it serves as a critical reference point for all downstream regulations, enforcement, and environmental management related to Canadian fisheries.

This Order ensures that fishing operations are conducted within clearly defined, legally recognized maritime areas, supporting sustainable fisheries, national security, and compliance with international obligations.

---

> **Note**: For full legal and operational application, this Order must be read in conjunction with the schedule, relevant statutes (e.g., *Fisheries Act*), and other DFO regulations.
