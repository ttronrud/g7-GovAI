### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- The Agency has the authority to conduct inspections and audits.
- Failure to comply with reporting, licensing, or inspection requirements can result in **fines, suspension, or revocation** of a licence.
- The 30-day notice and opportunity to respond ensures due process and fair treatment of licensees.
