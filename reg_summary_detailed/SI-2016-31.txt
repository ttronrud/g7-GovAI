The regulation you have provided is a formal order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order of the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) acknowledging receipt of scientific assessments under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*

**Citation:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Instrument 2002-29)

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Issuance by the Governor in Council:**  
   The Order is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council. This is the formal mechanism by which federal government decisions are made, particularly when they are recommended by a minister (in this case, the Minister of the Environment). It reflects the constitutional role of the Crown in Council in executing legislation.

2. **Based on Recommendation of the Minister of the Environment:**  
   The Order is not made independently but is issued on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment. This ensures that the decision aligns with the government’s scientific and policy priorities as defined under SARA.

3. **Acknowledgment of Assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC):**  
   The core purpose of the Order is to formally acknowledge that the *Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada* (COSEWIC) has completed and submitted scientific assessments for specific species listed in the annexed schedule.  
   - COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species in Canada and determining whether they are at risk of extinction.
   - These assessments are based on scientific data, including population trends, habitat conditions, threats, and biological information.

4. **Subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act:**  
   This subsection requires the Minister of the Environment to, upon receiving a COSEWIC assessment, consider it in determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA.  
   - The Order confirms that the Minister has received these assessments and is now in a position to proceed with the formal listing or reclassification of species based on the scientific findings.

5. **Species Listed in the Annexed Schedule:**  
   The Order refers to a list of specific species that have been assessed by COSEWIC. While the full list is not included in the excerpt, it typically includes both vertebrate and invertebrate species (e.g., birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, plants) that are considered at risk.  
   - These species may be proposed for inclusion in SARA’s official list of endangered or threatened species, or may be reclassified due to changes in their status.

6. **Purpose and Significance:**  
   - This Order is a procedural step in the SARA process that formalizes the government’s acceptance of scientific evidence.  
   - It enables the Minister to initiate the next stage of the legislative process—formally listing the species under SARA—based on the best available science.  
   - It also triggers potential conservation actions, such as habitat protection, recovery planning, or prohibitions on harmful activities.

7. **Legal and Policy Implications:**  
   - Once a species is officially listed under SARA, it is protected by federal law, and measures can be taken to prevent its decline.  
   - The Order ensures transparency and accountability by documenting that assessments were conducted and received before any listing decisions are made.  
   - It also supports public trust in the scientific and regulatory process by clearly showing that decisions are grounded in expert evaluation.

**In Summary:**  
This regulation formally recognizes the completion and receipt of scientific assessments by COSEWIC for a list of species at risk. It is a critical administrative step that enables the Minister of the Environment to proceed with the official listing of these species under the *Species at Risk Act*. The Order ensures that conservation decisions are based on sound scientific evidence, supports biodiversity protection, and aligns with Canada’s legal and environmental commitments.

**Note:**  
This Order was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and is part of a broader framework to protect Canada’s biodiversity. It reflects the government’s commitment to using science-based assessments to inform environmental policy and species protection. Subsequent updates to the species list may occur as new assessments are completed and new information becomes available.

This summary is consistent with the structure and intent of SARA and the role of COSEWIC in the Canadian species protection regime.
