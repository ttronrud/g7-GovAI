---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the *Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act* (the "Act"), establish detailed requirements for **qualified mortgage lenders**, **approved mortgage insurers**, and **reinsurance practices** in Canada.

- Must have:
  - **At least 3 years of experience** administering such loans in Canada
  - **Capability and resources** to meet all insurance conditions

---

## **4. Reinsurance Provisions**

An **approved mortgage insurer** may only:

- **Cause itself to be reinsured** against a risk it has underwritten **if the reinsurer is also an approved mortgage insurer**  
  → Prevents non-approved insurers from taking on risks through reinsurance.

- **Reinsure a risk** undertaken by another insurer **only if** that insurer’s contract is, or could be deemed under **Section 19 of the Act**, to be a **policy**  
  → Ensures that reinsurance is tied to formal, policy-based arrangements.

> ❌ *No reinsurance allowed* unless both parties are approved and the underlying contract qualifies as a policy.

---

## **5. Loan Replacement Restrictions**

An approved mortgage insurer **must not replace** an insured mortgage or hypothecary loan with another loan under the same insurance coverage **unless**:

1. **Both loans are made to the same borrower**, and  
   → The new loan is intended to **discharge the outstanding balance** of the original loan (i.e., refinancing)

2. **The new loan is part of a loan workout** designed to:
   - Reduce or avoid losses on a real or potential insurance claim  
   → Protects against fraudulent or speculative loan replacements

> 💡 This prevents insurers from using loan replacement as a way to evade insurance obligations or create financial risk.

---

## **6. Commitment to Insure a Portfolio**

An approved mortgage insurer that makes a **commitment to insure a portfolio of loans up to a specified total value** must:

- **Not insure any individual loan** under that commitment **later than one year after the commitment is made**

> ⏱️ Ensures that commitments are acted upon within a reasonable timeframe, preventing long-term delays in underwriting.

---

## **7. Prescribed Relationship (Section 13(1)(c))**

A person or entity is considered to be in a **prescribed relationship** with an approved mortgage insurer if:

- The mortgage insurer and/or its controlled entities (under Section 3 of the *Insurance Companies Act*) **beneficially own more than 20% of the voting shares** of a qualified mortgage lender, **OR**
- Another person/entity and its controlled entities:
  - Beneficially own **more than 20% of the voting shares** of the qualified mortgage lender, **AND**
  - Also beneficially own **more than 20% of the voting shares** of the approved mortgage insurer

> 🔍 This creates a **conflict-of-interest threshold** — if ownership exceeds 20%, the relationship is flagged for regulatory scrutiny.

---

## **8. Deemed Joint Ownership (Section 5)**

Two or more persons/entities are **deemed to be a single person or entity** for ownership purposes if they:

- Have **agreed (formally or informally)** to act **jointly or in concert** in respect of:
  - Shares in a qualified mortgage lender or approved mortgage insurer  
  - Shares in any entity that owns shares in a qualified mortgage lender or approved mortgage insurer  
  - Shares in any entity that controls such an entity  

> ⚖️ This includes:
- Agreements to **veto** board proposals
- Agreements that **no proposal may be approved without consent** from one or more parties

> ❌ **Exception:**  
Ownership is **not presumed** to be joint or in concert simply because:
- One is a proxyholder of another  
- They vote in the same way (e.g., all vote "yes" or "no")

> 📌 This prevents automatic assumptions of control based on voting patterns alone.

---

## **9. Notification Requirement for Prescribed Relationships**

Under **Section 14 of the Act**, an approved mortgage insurer **may enter into a policy with a person/entity in a prescribed relationship** **only if**:

- The **Minister is notified at least 60 days in advance** that the insurer is **currently or expects to be** in such a relationship

> 🚨 This provides **early regulatory oversight** and transparency in relationships that could pose conflicts of interest.

---

## **10. Fee Structure for Approved Insurers**

Fees paid by approved mortgage insurers under **Section 9 of the Act** are calculated using the following formula:

> **Fee = (Total direct premiums written in a calendar year)**

- Fees are **due and payable on March 1 of the following year**
- May be **recovered as a debt due to Her Majesty** (i.e., the Crown)

> 💰 This creates a **direct link between premiums earned and regulatory fees**, ensuring that insurers contribute to oversight costs based on their activity.
