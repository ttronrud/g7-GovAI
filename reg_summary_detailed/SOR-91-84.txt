**Detailed Summary of the EEC Aged Cheddar Cheese Export Regulations (1991)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The *EEC Aged Cheddar Cheese Export Regulations*, 1991 (cited as the "Regulations"), were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, under **Section 12 of the Canadian Dairy Commission Act**. These Regulations **replaced and revoked two earlier export quota regulations**:

- *The Aged Cheddar Cheese Export Quota Regulations, 1981* (P.C. 1981-1704)
- *The EEC Aged Cheddar Cheese Export Quota Regulations, 1983* (P.C. 1982-3920)

The primary purpose of these new Regulations is to **establish a modern, transparent, and flexible system for allocating export entitlements** for the export of **Canadian aged cheddar cheese to the European Economic Community (EEC)** at a special customs tariff under a bilateral trade agreement between Canada and the EEC.

The effective date of these Regulations is **January 1, 1991**.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Aged Cheddar Cheese** | Canadian-produced cheddar cheese that is graded **Canada 1** under the *Safe Food for Canadians Regulations* and aged for **at least nine months**. |
| **Commission** | The **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)**, responsible for administering the export entitlement system. |
| **EEC** | The **European Economic Community** (now the European Union). |
| **Eligible Exporter** | A person (individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative) to whom an export entitlement is allotted by the Commission. Includes entities referred to in Section 3. |
| **Export Entitlement** | The portion of the annual export quota allocated to an eligible exporter. Includes entitlements retained from prior years. |
| **Export Quota** | The total annual quantity of aged cheddar cheese permitted to be exported from Canada to the EEC under the special customs tariff. |
| **Person** | Any individual, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association. |

### **Key Provisions and Operational Framework**

#### **1. Continuity of Entitlements (January 1, 1991 Onward)**

- All persons who were **eligible exporters as of December 31, 1990**, under the previous regulations are **automatically confirmed as eligible exporters** under the new Regulations.
- These exporters **retain their existing export entitlements** as of December 31, 1990, without change.

> This ensures stability and continuity for established exporters during the transition.

---

#### **2. Adjustment of Export Entitlements Based on Quota Changes**

The Commission may adjust export entitlements annually in response to changes in the **export quota** (increase or decrease).

##### **(a) In the Case of an Increase in the Export Quota**
- The Commission calculates the **share of the increase** for each eligible exporter based on the **proportion of their export entitlement utilized** in the prior year (i.e., prorated on the basis of their entitlement as of December 31 of the previous year).
- The Commission **notifies each exporter** in writing of:
  - The total increase in the quota
  - The amount of the increase allocated to them
- The Commission **increases the exporter’s export entitlement** by the calculated share **only if** the exporter:
  - Can demonstrate **capacity to produce or obtain** aged cheddar cheese
  - Can **export sufficient quantities** to fully utilize the increased entitlement

##### **(b) In the Case of a Decrease in the Export Quota**
- The Commission **reduces** each exporter’s export entitlement **prorated** on the basis of their prior-year entitlement utilization.

> This ensures that quota reductions are distributed fairly and proportionally.

---

#### **3. Utilization Requirement and Notification of Non-Utilization**

- Each eligible exporter must submit a **report by June 30** of each year confirming:
  - Agreements with **one or more EEC importers**
  - Total export volume **equal to or exceeding** their export entitlement for the year

- If an exporter becomes aware that it **will not fully utilize** its export entitlement, it must **notify the Commission immediately**.

- If the Commission believes (based on notification or other evidence) that an exporter will not fully utilize its entitlement:
  - The Commission **reduces** the entitlement by the amount of the expected non-utilization.
  - The Commission then:
    - Calculates the **share of the unused portion** to be reallocated among remaining exporters, again **prorated** on the basis of prior-year utilization
    - Notifies all remaining exporters of the amount and share
    - Increases their entitlements **only if** they can prove they can produce/export sufficient quantities to fully utilize the new entitlement

> This creates a dynamic reallocation mechanism to ensure efficient use of the export quota.

---

#### **4. Recovery of Entitlements After Reduction or Cancellation**

##### **(a) Reduction Due to Non-Utilization (Non-Controllable Reasons)**
- If the Commission determines that an exporter **could not fully utilize** its entitlement due to **reasons beyond its control** (e.g., market collapse, natural disaster), then:
  - In the **following year**, the exporter’s entitlement is **restored to its pre-reduction level**
  - Any exporter whose entitlement was **increased** due to the reallocation is **reduced back to its pre-increase level**
  - Any export entitlements allocated via **subsections 9(3) to (5)** (e.g., due to reallocation) are **withdrawn**

##### **(b) Cancellation of Entitlements**
- The Commission may **cancel** an exporter’s export entitlement if:
  - The exporter becomes a **subsidiary, related, associated, or controlled** entity of another eligible exporter
  - The exporter **fails to comply** with:
    - Section 6 or subsection 7(1) (reporting or utilization requirements)
    - Section 10 or 11 (export compliance or recordkeeping)
    - Terms of **export assistance payments** under the *Exported Dairy Products Assistance Payment Order*

##### **(c) After Cancellation, Reallocation Process**
- If an entitlement is cancelled and the Commission believes the failure was **beyond the exporter’s control**, then:
  - The exporter is **restored to its pre-cancellation entitlement** in the following year
  - Any exporters whose entitlements were increased due to the cancellation are **reduced to their pre-increase levels**
  - Any entitlements allocated under subsections 9(3) to (5) are **withdrawn**

> This ensures fairness and accountability, preventing misuse or consolidation of market power.

---

#### **5. Open Access to Export Entitlements (For Non-Eligible Entities)**

If, after all reallocations, **a portion of the export quota remains unused**, the Commission may open the process to **non-eligible applicants**.

##### **Application Criteria**
Applicants must meet **all of the following**:
- Involved in the **production or distribution** of Canadian cheese
- Capable of **producing or obtaining** aged cheddar cheese and exporting it to the EEC in sufficient volume
- Has **experience in exporting dairy products**
- Is **not a subsidiary, related, associated, or controlled** by an eligible exporter

##### **Process for Allocation**
- The Commission invites applications within a period it determines.
- After the deadline:
  - The Commission **retains** only those applications that meet the criteria.
- The Commission then:
  - Draws **one application at random** from the retained pool
  - Allocates an export entitlement equal to the **lesser of 20,000 kg or the remaining available quota**

- This process is **repeated** until no applications remain.

> This provides a **market-based opportunity** for new or smaller players to enter the export market.

---

#### **6. Allocation to Remaining Eligible Exporters (After All Other Processes)**

If a portion of the quota remains after the above steps, the Commission allocates it **prorated** based on the **proportion of each eligible exporter’s prior-year entitlement that was utilized** in the current year.

> This ensures continued equity among existing exporters.

---

#### **7. Transfer of Export Entitlements**

- **No transfer** of export entitlements is allowed **unless**:
  1. The Commission **determines** that the proposed transferee meets the same eligibility criteria as defined in paragraphs 9(2)(a) to (d)
  2. The Commission **authorizes** the transfer

> This prevents unauthorized or speculative transfers and maintains control over the system.

---

#### **8. Export Compliance Requirement**

- No eligible exporter may export aged cheddar cheese under its export entitlement **unless it holds legal title** to the cheese.

> This ensures that exports are legitimate and traceable, protecting against fraud or unauthorized sales.
