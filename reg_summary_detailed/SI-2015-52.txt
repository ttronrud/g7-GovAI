**Detailed Summary of the Ministerial Responsibilities Under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act Order**

---

### **Background and Legal Context**

This Order in Council (OIC) is a regulatory instrument issued under the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**, specifically pursuant to **subsection 4(3)d** of the Act. This provision grants the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial recommendations) the authority to:

- Specify which Minister (or both Ministers) shall be responsible for administering particular provisions of the IRPA;
- Allow both the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** and the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** to share responsibility for certain provisions, depending on the context.

Prior to this Order, the **joint responsibility** of both Ministers for administering the IRPA was established under **subsections 4(1)a and (2)b**, which state that both Ministers have responsibility for the administration of the Act. However, the exact division of duties across specific sections of the Act had not been clearly defined, leading to potential ambiguity in operational responsibilities.

The Order in Council **P.C. 2005-2042**, issued on November 21, 2005, had previously outlined ministerial responsibilities. This new Order **repeals** that earlier Order and replaces it with a more detailed, current, and precise allocation of responsibilities under the IRPA.

---

### **Key Provisions of the New Order**

#### **1. Repeal of Previous Order**
- The Order **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2005-2042**, which had previously defined ministerial responsibilities under the IRPA.
- This ensures that the current, updated allocation of duties reflects the most recent legislative and administrative developments.

#### **2. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the day it is **published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.
- It was **effective July 1, 2015**.

### **Allocation of Ministerial Responsibilities**

The Order clearly assigns responsibility for specific provisions of the IRPA to either the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP)** or the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (MCI)**. This is a significant clarification of administrative roles within the federal government.

---

#### **A. Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP) is responsible for the following provisions:**

These responsibilities are assigned to the MPSEP **in respect of matters related to national security, border security, and emergency preparedness**, reflecting the broader mandate of public safety and security.

| Section / Subsection | Provision / Purpose |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| **20.1(1)** | Powers of the Minister to issue directions in relation to the protection of national security. |
| **63(5)** | Authority to issue directions to prevent or mitigate threats to national security. |
| **77(1)** | Powers related to the removal of individuals who pose a threat to national security. |
| **Section 81** | Powers to manage the detention of individuals under national security grounds. |
| **82.1(1)** | Authority to detain individuals in connection with national security threats. |
| **Section 82.4** | Powers related to the management of individuals under security-related immigration controls. |
| **109(1)** | Powers to detain individuals for security-related reasons. |
| **Paragraph 173(b)** | Authority to apply security grounds for inadmissibility or removal. |

> ✅ **Key Insight**: These provisions are primarily related to **national security, threat assessment, and emergency response**. The MPSEP’s role reflects the government’s emphasis on safeguarding public safety, especially in cases involving terrorism, threats to critical infrastructure, or potential security breaches.

---

#### **B. Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP) is also responsible for the following provisions:**

These provisions relate to **border management, emergency response, and security-related immigration decisions**.

| Section / Subsection | Provision / Purpose |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Section 6** | Powers to issue orders under certain security-related immigration conditions. |
| **15(4)** | Authority to issue directions related to security concerns during processing or removal. |
| **16(2.1)** | Powers to manage the processing of individuals under security-related grounds. |
| **Section 21** | Powers to manage entry and exit of individuals under security conditions. |
| **Section 73** | Powers to manage the removal of individuals posing security risks. |
| **77(2)** | Powers to manage the removal of individuals under security-related grounds. |
| **Section 86** | Powers to manage the detention of individuals for security reasons. |
| **Section 87** | Powers to manage the conditions of detention under security grounds. |
| **Section 110** | Powers to manage the removal of individuals under security-related grounds. |
| **146(1)** | Powers to manage the detention and removal of individuals in connection with national security. |
| **Section 147** | Powers related to the management of security-related detention and removal. |
| **167(1)** | Powers to manage the removal of individuals under national security grounds. |
| **Sections 169, 170, 171** | Powers related to the management of individuals in security-related removal processes. |
| **175(2)** | Powers to manage the processing of individuals under security-related inadmissibility grounds. |

> ✅ **Key Insight**: These provisions show a **strong overlap between immigration and public safety**, particularly in **detention, removal, and security-based decisions**. This reflects the growing integration of immigration enforcement with broader public safety objectives.

---

#### **C. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (MCI) is responsible for all other matters**

All provisions of the IRPA **not specifically assigned to the MPSEP** fall under the responsibility of the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**.

This includes:
- General immigration processes (e.g., applications, visas, settlement);
- Family reunification;
- Refugee protection and claims;
- Permanent residence and citizenship;
- Immigration policy development and program delivery.

> ✅ **Key Insight**: The MCI retains **overall responsibility for the core immigration functions**, ensuring continuity in areas not directly tied to national security or emergency preparedness.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Clarity in Roles and Responsibilities**  
   The Order eliminates ambiguity in ministerial responsibilities, ensuring that decisions related to national security are made by the appropriate Minister (MPSEP), while routine immigration processes remain under the MCI.

2. **Alignment with National Security Priorities**  
   By assigning key security-related provisions to the MPSEP, the government reinforces the integration of immigration enforcement with national security and emergency preparedness frameworks.

3. **Administrative Efficiency**  
   Clear delineation of duties enables better interdepartmental coordination, reduces overlap, and improves decision-making speed in high-stakes situations (e.g., threats to public safety).

4. **Legal and Policy Consistency**  
   The Order reflects a shift in how the federal government views the relationship between immigration and public safety, recognizing that security concerns can intersect with immigration control.

5. **Accountability and Oversight**  
   Assigning specific sections to specific Ministers enhances accountability, as each Minister is responsible for decisions within their defined scope.

### **Conclusion**

This Order in Council is a critical piece of administrative regulation that:

- **Repeals outdated ministerial responsibilities**;
- **Clearly assigns responsibilities** under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to either the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration;
- **Reflects evolving policy priorities**, especially in the area of national security and border management;
- **Strengthens interdepartmental coordination** between immigration and public safety.

By defining who is responsible for what, the Order ensures that immigration decisions are made in a manner that is both legally sound and operationally effective—particularly in cases involving national security threats, emergency responses, and the detention or removal of individuals.
