Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulation Summary**

**Governing Authority:**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

**Legal Basis:**  
The order is made pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**. This provision empowers the government to designate certain land areas as being included in land grants, particularly where such inclusion serves to protect or preserve lands of cultural, historical, or environmental significance — especially in relation to Indigenous rights, traditional use, or land access.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **ensure that specific portions of land adjacent to Dolomite Lake**, near the Town of Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, are **automatically included in any future land grant** involving that parcel. This inclusion is specifically tied to the **shoreline area within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark**.

This provision is likely intended to:

- Protect the **ecological and cultural integrity** of the shoreline;
- Recognize and safeguard **traditional use areas** or **Indigenous access rights** to water and adjacent land;
- Ensure that **no future land grants** can exclude land that is directly adjacent to the lake's waterline, thereby preventing fragmentation or displacement of access rights;
- Align with broader principles of **Indigenous land rights and environmental protection** in northern Canada.

### **Specific Land Description**

The regulation applies to the following parcel:

> **All that portion of Lot 5, Block 103**, near the Town of Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories.

This lot is defined by reference to a **specific survey plan**:

- **Plan of Survey Number 95538**  
- Part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records**, held at **Ottawa**  
- A **copy of this plan is filed** in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under **File Number 4233**

This means that the legal description of the land is tied to a formal, recorded survey, ensuring clarity and enforceability in land transactions.

### **Area of Inclusion**

The regulation specifies that **any portion of the lot lying within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of **Dolomite Lake** must be **included in any future grant or transfer of that land**.

- **Ordinary high water mark**: This is a defined benchmark in shoreline management, typically representing the highest point reached by water during normal tidal or seasonal fluctuations. It is used to demarcate land that is regularly or periodically submerged.
- The 30.48 metres (100 feet) buffer zone is a standard distance used in land management to protect ecologically sensitive or culturally significant areas.

This inclusion is **automatic** — it does not require separate application or approval. Any future land grant involving this lot will **automatically include** the shoreline portion within this buffer.

---

### **Geographic Context**

- **Location**: Near the **Town of Inuvik**, Northwest Territories  
- **Body of Water**: **Dolomite Lake** — a significant natural feature in the region, known for its ecological and cultural importance to local Indigenous communities.

---

### **Implications and Significance**

1. **Indigenous Rights and Access**:  
   The regulation may reflect recognition of traditional land and water use by Indigenous peoples, particularly the **Inuvialuit**, who have historical and cultural ties to the Inuvik area and surrounding lakes.

2. **Environmental Protection**:  
   The shoreline zone is ecologically sensitive and may support wildlife habitats, water quality, and natural processes. Protecting this area helps maintain environmental sustainability.

3. **Legal Clarity and Predictability**:  
   By clearly defining which portion of the land is included in any grant, the regulation reduces ambiguity in land transactions and ensures consistent treatment of shoreline areas.

4. **Compliance with Federal Land Policy**:  
   The order aligns with broader federal policies promoting **sustainable land use**, **cultural preservation**, and **Indigenous self-determination** in northern Canada.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, legally binding directive** that ensures the inclusion of a specific shoreline buffer (30.48 m or 100 ft) of Lot 5, Block 103, near Dolomite Lake, Inuvik, in any future land grant. It is grounded in the Territorial Lands Act and reflects a commitment to protecting culturally and environmentally significant areas adjacent to water bodies. The regulation provides clear, enforceable boundaries and is supported by a formal survey record, enhancing transparency and legal certainty in land administration.

**Note**: This regulation should be interpreted in the context of broader Indigenous rights and land use policies in Canada, particularly those related to the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)** and **Crown-Indigenous relations** in the North.
