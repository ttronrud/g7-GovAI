**Detailed Summary of the Guidelines Respecting Control in Fact for the Purpose of Subsection 377(1) of the Bank Act**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

The **Guidelines Respecting Control in Fact** are issued by the **Minister of Finance** under **subsection 3(4)a of the Bank Act** (as amended by S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 37(3)) and are specifically designed to implement **subsection 377(1)** of the Bank Act.  

These guidelines apply in the context of **applications referred to under subsection 396(2)** of the Bank Act, which typically involves applications for approval of transactions (such as share acquisitions or control changes) that may result in a change in ownership or control of a bank or its subsidiary.

The primary objective is to **determine whether a proposed transaction would, if approved, lead to a contravention of subsection 377(1)** — a provision that prohibits certain forms of *de facto* control over banks by individuals or groups that could undermine the stability, transparency, and independence of the banking system.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**

- The guidelines apply **only to applications made under subsection 396(2)** of the Bank Act.
- They are used by the Minister or regulatory authorities to assess whether a transaction would result in **"control in fact"** — meaning actual or de facto influence over a bank — even if formal ownership does not exceed thresholds.
- The assessment must consider the **policy objectives** set out in **section 4 of the Bank Act**, which are designed to protect the integrity and stability of the banking sector.

---

### **3. Key Policy Objectives (Section 4 – Must Be Considered)**

The following **core policy objectives** must be evaluated when assessing whether a transaction would violate subsection 377(1):

#### **(a) Preservation of Ownership Rules and Systemic Stability**
- Maintain **high transparency and effective market oversight** of banks.
- Reduce risks of **distortions in credit allocation** due to close relationships between banks and investors (e.g., preferential lending).
- Enhance the **safety and soundness** of banks by preventing undue influence that could compromise prudent financial management.

#### **(b) Operational Autonomy and Strategic Flexibility**
- Allow banks to operate independently and make strategic decisions based on **their own best interests**, not those of any single shareholder or shareholder group.
- Promote **independent decision-making** in areas such as business planning, capital allocation, and dividend policy.

#### **(c) Investor Rights and Accountability**
- Ensure investors can exercise **meaningful influence** over the bank through their ownership.
- Allow investors to use **equity accounting methods** (as per generally accepted accounting principles) to reflect their true ownership and influence in financial reporting.

These objectives form the foundation of the regulatory analysis and must guide every determination under subsection 377(1).

---

### **4. Factors to Be Considered in the Assessment (Section 5 – Detailed Criteria)**

A comprehensive list of **factors** must be evaluated to determine whether control in fact exists. These are grouped into several key areas:

---

#### **A. Ownership Structure and Equity Holdings**
- The **number, type, and distribution** of securities (shares) held by the bank or its subsidiaries.
- The **value of equity** and the **number and type** of securities held or proposed to be acquired by the applicant.
- The **rights, privileges, or features** attached to these securities (e.g., voting rights, conversion rights, preferential dividends).

---

#### **B. Involvement and Expertise of the Applicant and Shareholders**
- The **level of involvement** of the applicant, any significant shareholder, or their affiliates in the bank’s or subsidiary’s business operations.
- The **knowledge or expertise** of the applicant or its shareholders in financial services or areas relevant to the bank’s operations.

---

#### **C. Relationships Among Shareholders**
- Relationships, agreements, understandings, or arrangements among:
  - Significant shareholders of the bank or its subsidiaries.
  - The applicant and shareholders of the bank or subsidiary.
  - The applicant and persons involved in securities of the bank.

These relationships may indicate coordination, collusion, or shared interests that could lead to undue influence.

---

#### **D. Board and Management Structure**
- The **composition and structure** of:
  - The board of directors.
  - Committees of the board (e.g., audit, compensation, governance).
  - Senior management committees.
- The **voting arrangements** of these bodies (e.g., supermajority requirements, veto power).

This includes whether the applicant or its affiliates have **influence over board decisions**, such as the ability to:
- Require **prior consent** before a proposal is presented to the board or committee.
- **Veto** a proposal being considered.

---

#### **E. Interlocking Directorships and Family Relationships**
- Whether shareholders, directors, or senior officers of the bank or subsidiary are also shareholders, directors, or senior officers of the applicant.
- Whether there are **family relationships** between the applicant’s directors/senior officers and those of the bank or its subsidiaries.

Such interconnections may suggest a lack of independence and potential for conflicts of interest.

---

#### **F. Influence Over Operations and Strategic Decisions**
- Whether the applicant (or affiliated parties) can:
  - Determine or veto **day-to-day operations**.
  - Influence **business plans**.
  - Approve or block **significant capital expenditures**.
  - Influence **dividend policy**.
  - Influence the **issuance of securities**.

This assesses the extent to which the applicant controls the bank’s strategic and operational direction.

---

#### **G. Terms of Agreements and Dependencies**
- The **material terms and conditions** of any agreement or arrangement between:
  - The applicant and the bank.
  - The applicant and any subsidiary of the bank.
- Whether there is a **dependency** of the bank or subsidiary on the applicant created by such agreements (e.g., access to funding, services, or credit).

Such dependencies may imply control, even without direct ownership.

---

#### **H. Links to Entities on Which the Bank Depends**
- Whether the applicant has **links** to any entity on which the bank has a dependency (e.g., through a loan, service agreement, or joint venture).

This helps identify indirect control chains that may undermine the bank’s independence.

---

#### **I. Public Representations About Control**
- Whether the applicant has made **representations to regulatory bodies or agencies** (e.g., the Bank of Canada or other financial regulators) asserting that it controls the bank.

Such statements may be taken as evidence of intent or actual control.

---

#### **J. Any Other Relevant Factors**
- Any other factor that is **materially related** to any of the policy objectives in section 4.

This provides flexibility for the regulator to consider emerging or context-specific issues.

---

### **5. Definition of "Significant Shareholder"**

A **significant shareholder** is defined as:
> A person whose **aggregate beneficial ownership** (including shares beneficially owned by entities controlled by them) of a class of shares in a bank or subsidiary **exceeds 10%** of all outstanding shares of that class.

This threshold is critical — even if ownership is below 10%, if it is part of a larger group or network of ownership, the combined effect may still trigger scrutiny.

---

### **6. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The guidelines **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- They are binding on the Minister of Finance and applicable to all assessments of transactions under subsection 396(2) of the Bank Act.

---

### **7. Regulatory Intent and Underlying Principles**

The guidelines reflect a **proactive regulatory approach** to prevent:
- **Undue influence** by private investors over public financial institutions.
- **Systemic risks** arising from opaque or hidden control structures.
- **Distortions in lending and investment decisions** due to conflicts of interest.

By focusing on **control in fact**, rather than just legal ownership, the guidelines ensure that the integrity of the banking system is protected even when formal ownership thresholds are not exceeded.

---

### **Conclusion**

These guidelines provide a **comprehensive, structured framework** for evaluating whether a transaction involving a bank or its subsidiary would result in **de facto control** that violates subsection 377(1) of the Bank Act. They emphasize **transparency, accountability, and independence** in banking governance, while balancing the legitimate interests of investors in exercising their rights.

They serve as a key tool for the Canadian regulatory regime to **protect the stability, fairness, and soundness of the banking sector** by preventing concentration of power that could compromise public trust and financial oversight.
