**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Public Inquiries into Objections to Proposed Incorporations, Continuances, and Amalgamations**

---

### **Regulatory Background**
This regulation, issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 26(5) of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (Act)**, establishes the procedural framework governing **public inquiries** into objections raised by individuals or entities against proposed incorporations, continuances, or amalgamations of cooperative credit associations.

The regulation was originally enacted in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 48)** and is currently **repealed in part** by **SOR/98-533, section 2**, which removes certain provisions. However, the summary below reflects the **content that remains in force** as of the current regulatory status.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The provision regarding *address for service* (paragraph under "Address for service of documents") has been **repealed** by SOR/98-533, s. 4. Therefore, that specific clause is no longer applicable and should be disregarded in current practice.

---

### **Scope of Application**
These Rules apply **only to public inquiries** held under **subsection 26(3)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. They govern the procedures for initiating, conducting, and concluding such inquiries when the Superintendent determines that an objection must be investigated due to public interest or necessity.

---

### **Initiation of an Inquiry**

1. **Necessity and Public Interest**
   - The Superintendent may initiate an inquiry **only if satisfied** that it is **necessary and in the public interest**.

2. **Notice of Inquiry**
   - At least **14 days before** the inquiry, the Superintendent must:
     - Publish a **notice of inquiry** in:
       - The *Canada Gazette* (official government publication)
       - A **newspaper of general circulation** located at or near the place where the association’s **head office will be situated**
     - Serve the **parties** (applicant and objector(s)) with:
       - A notice of the inquiry
       - A copy of the objection
       - An invitation to attend the inquiry

3. **Content of the Notice**
   The notice must clearly state:
   - The **date, time, and place** of the inquiry
   - The **purpose** of the inquiry and the **substance of the objection**
   - The **name of the presiding officer**
   - Any other information the Superintendent deems appropriate

---

### **Cancellation of an Inquiry**

An inquiry may be **cancelled** if:
- The **application is withdrawn**, or
- The **objection is withdrawn**, or (if multiple objections exist) **all objections are withdrawn**

Upon cancellation:
- The Superintendent must:
  - Serve the parties with a **notice of cancellation**
  - Publish this notice in the *Canada Gazette* (as per paragraph 4(1)(a))

---

### **Service of Documents**

Documents required under these rules may be served in one of the following ways:
- **Personal delivery** to the recipient
- **Registered or certified mail** to the recipient’s address for service
- If no address is known, to the **usual or last known address**
- Alternatively, the **presiding officer** may specify another method

> ❌ **Note**: The original provision specifying the *address for service* (e.g., based on application or objection) has been **repealed** (SOR/98-533, s. 4). Therefore, the current rules do not define a specific address for service. Service must now follow the general principles above, with reliance on the presiding officer’s discretion.

---

### **Presiding Officer and Conduct of Inquiry**

- The Superintendent may **appoint a person** (other than themselves) to serve as **presiding officer**, especially when the Superintendent is unavailable or when a more neutral or experienced individual is needed.

---

### **Parties’ Rights and Participation**

1. **Submissions**
   - Either party may:
     - Submit **written submissions**
     - Make **oral submissions** to the presiding officer

2. **Representation**
   - A party may attend the inquiry **in person** or be represented by **legal counsel**

3. **Calling Witnesses**
   - The presiding officer may **allow a party to call witnesses** if relevant to the inquiry

4. **Order of Submissions**
   - The **objector** must make submissions **first**, in support of the objection
   - The **applicant** then makes **responses** in rebuttal

> This order ensures transparency and fairness by giving the challenger the opportunity to present their case before the proponent responds.

---

### **Public Access and Transparency**

- Every inquiry must be **open to the public** — members of the public may attend and observe proceedings.

---

### **Access to Objection and Supporting Documents**

- During a specific period:
  - **From the day the notice of inquiry is published in the Canada Gazette**  
    to the day the **Minister issues or decides not to issue** the letters patent (formal approval)

- Any person may:
  - **Examine** the objection
  - **Request a copy** of:
    - The objection
    - Any documents submitted in support of or opposition to it

- These examinations or requests may be made at:
  - The **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Ottawa**
  - Or, during the inquiry, at the **location where the inquiry is being held**

> This provision ensures **public transparency** and allows stakeholders to review the basis of the objection and supporting evidence.

---

### **Reporting and Distribution of Findings**

- After the inquiry concludes, the **Superintendent prepares a report** of the findings.

- Upon the **Minister making the report publicly available** under **subsection 26(4)** of the Act, the Superintendent shall:
  - **Send a copy of the report directly to the parties** (applicant and objector)

> This ensures that all parties receive a formal record of the inquiry outcomes, enhancing accountability and legal clarity.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Public access to inquiries, notices, and documents ensures accountability |
| **Fairness** | Structured order of submissions (objection first, then response) promotes balanced review |
| **Public Interest** | Inquiries are only held when necessary and in the public interest |
| **Timeliness** | Notices must be issued at least 14 days in advance to allow for preparation |
| **Accessibility** | Parties and the public can review documents and attend hearings |

---

### **Repealed Provisions (Important Clarification)**

- **Section on Address for Service**: The clause stating that the address for service is the address in the application or objection has been **repealed** by **SOR/98-533, s. 4**.
- This means that service must now rely on **general methods** (delivery, mail, or officer’s discretion), and **no automatic reference to application or objection address** is valid.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **clear, structured, and transparent procedural framework** for public inquiries into objections to cooperative credit associations. It balances the need for **public accountability** with **fair treatment of applicants and objectors**, while ensuring that the process remains accessible, open, and governed by established rules.

Despite being partially repealed, the core procedural elements — including **notice, public access, order of submissions, and distribution of findings** — remain central to the regulatory oversight of cooperative credit associations in Canada.

These rules are essential for maintaining **public trust** in the financial regulatory process and ensuring that cooperative credit institutions are established in a manner that serves the broader community interest.
