**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Lilliput (Toxolasma parvum) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is the primary federal legislation in Canada designed to prevent wildlife species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery. The Act was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and was amended in 2015 (S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).

The specific legal basis for this Order is found in **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA. These provisions empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and regulate the critical habitat of a listed wildlife species, provided certain conditions are met.

**2. Species at Issue: Lilliput (Toxolasma parvum)**

- The Lilliput (*Toxolasma parvum*) is a species of small, rare land snail native to Canada.
- It is classified as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act*.
- This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Lilliput was developed and approved as part of the species’ conservation planning.
- This strategy identifies the **critical habitat** — the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.
- The identified critical habitat has been officially included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track information on species at risk and their conservation status.

**4. Jurisdictional and Exclusion Clause**

- Subsection **58(2)(b)** of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are **"in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)"**, which generally includes areas that are:
  - Located in a federal or provincial jurisdiction where the government has not taken responsibility for managing the area,
  - Or areas that are subject to certain types of land use or ownership that would make designation impractical or legally problematic.

- The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat specified in this regulation is located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)**. This confirms that the designated critical habitat is legally eligible for protection under SARA and that the Minister has the authority to proceed with designation.

---

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issues this **Critical Habitat of the Lilliput (Toxolasma parvum) Order** to formally designate the specific geographic areas that constitute the critical habitat for the species.
- The designation is based on scientific evidence from the recovery strategy and is consistent with the requirements of SARA.
- Once designated, the critical habitat is protected under the Act, meaning:
  - Federal projects or activities that may adversely affect the habitat must undergo environmental assessments.
  - Permits may be required for any development, construction, or land use activity that could impact the habitat.
  - The habitat is legally recognized as essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

---

**6. Legal Application and Enforcement**

- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Lilliput. This means that any federal activity that could harm or degrade the designated critical habitat is subject to review and may be prohibited or modified.
- The Order is **effective upon registration** with the Government of Canada (i.e., when it is officially published in the Canada Gazette).

---

**7. Date and Issuance**

- The Order was issued on **October 17, 2022**, by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
- It is a formal administrative action taken to fulfill the government’s legal obligation under SARA to protect endangered species and their essential habitats.

---

**8. Significance of the Regulation**

- This Order represents a key step in the conservation of the Lilliput, a species that is both ecologically unique and vulnerable due to habitat loss and other threats.
- It ensures that the specific environmental conditions necessary for the Lilliput’s survival — such as specific soil types, microclimates, and vegetation — are legally protected.
- It also supports broader biodiversity goals and contributes to Canada’s commitment to fulfilling international obligations under biodiversity and species conservation frameworks.

---

**Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the endangered Lilliput (*Toxolasma parvum*) under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, legally sound, and compliant with federal environmental protections. By protecting this habitat, the Government of Canada is taking a proactive step to support the long-term survival and recovery of this rare and ecologically significant species.
