**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Northern Bottlenose Whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) Scotian Shelf Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
July 3, 2018  
**Issuing Authority:**  
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)* — S.C. 2002, c. 29  
Specifically, **Section 58** of SARA, which provides the legal framework for identifying, designating, and protecting critical habitat for wildlife species at risk.

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The Northern Bottlenose Whale (*Hyperoodon ampullatus*) Scotian Shelf population is designated as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification reflects the species’ vulnerability due to threats such as habitat degradation, noise pollution, and climate change.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for this species has been developed and is **publicly registered** in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*. This strategy identifies the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the population — known as **critical habitat**.

3. **Legal Requirement for Exclusion of Certain Areas:**  
   Under **Section 58(2)(b)** of SARA, certain areas that are designated as **"places"** (i.e., specific geographic locations) may be excluded from critical habitat designation if they fall within a protected area established under federal or provincial law.  
   
   In this case, a portion of the identified critical habitat lies within **Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area (MPA)** — a federally designated marine conservation area.

   Furthermore, **Section 58(5)** of SARA provides that any portion of critical habitat located in a place referred to under subsection 58(2) must be **excluded** from the official critical habitat designation.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Applicability of Section 58(1):**  
   Section 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Northern Bottlenose Whale Scotian Shelf population — **but only to the portion that is not located in a protected area**.  
   
   Specifically, the critical habitat is **excluded** from designation in **Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area**, as defined in **Schedule 2 to the Gully Marine Protected Area Regulations**.

2. **Exclusion of Zone 1 of the Gully MPA:**  
   The Order explicitly excludes from the formal critical habitat designation **the area in Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area**. This exclusion is legally required under **Section 58(5)** of SARA because that zone is a protected area under federal marine protection legislation.

3. **Purpose of the Exclusion:**  
   The exclusion ensures that:
   - The marine protected area (MPA) continues to serve its purpose of conserving biodiversity and protecting sensitive marine ecosystems.
   - The designation of critical habitat does not conflict with existing environmental protections.
   - The recovery strategy remains practical and enforceable, without overlapping with legally protected zones.

4. **Legal Basis for the Order:**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issued this Order **pursuant to Sections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA:
   - **Section 58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister to make an order designating critical habitat.
   - **Section 58(5)**: Requires that any portion of critical habitat located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2) be excluded from the order.

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Government of Canada (i.e., upon official publication in the Canada Gazette or other statutory register).

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Conservation Balance:** The regulation reflects a balance between protecting the essential habitat of an endangered species and preserving existing marine protected areas.
- **Legal Clarity:** It provides clear legal authority and boundaries for where critical habitat is recognized, and where it is not — helping to avoid regulatory conflicts.
- **Support for Recovery:** By excluding Zone 1 of the Gully MPA, the Order ensures that the species' recovery strategy can be implemented without undermining the ecological integrity of a protected marine zone.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the Public Registry and the clear reference to the Gully MPA regulations enhance transparency and public accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that designates the critical habitat of the endangered Northern Bottlenose Whale (Scotian Shelf population), **excluding the portion located in Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area**. This exclusion is mandated by law to respect existing marine conservation designations and to ensure the effective and lawful implementation of species recovery efforts. The Order supports both species conservation and broader marine environmental protection objectives.
