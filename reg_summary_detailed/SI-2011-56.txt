**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:** Order in Council under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), S.C. 2002, c. 29  
**Date:** [Not specified in text, but likely issued in 2009 or later based on context]  
**Issued by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  
**Pursuant to:** Subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA)

---

### **Core Decisions**
The Governor General in Council **decides not to add three species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** (Schedule 1 to SARA):

1. **Bocaccio rockfish** (*Sebastes paucispinis*)  
2. **Canary rockfish** (*Sebastes pinniger*)  
3. **Lake Winnipeg Physa** (*Physa sp.*)

Additionally, the Minister of the Environment **approves inclusion in the public registry under Section 120 of SARA** of a formal statement explaining the rationale for each decision.

## **1. Bocaccio Rockfish (*Sebastes paucispinis*)**

### **Background and Status**
- **Range:** Southeast Alaska to northern Oregon.
- **COSEWIC Assessment (2002):** Listed as *Threatened* due to observed population declines.
- **US Status (Puget Sound/Georgia Basin):** Listed as *Endangered* under the US Endangered Species Act (April 2010); however, US populations may be recovering due to reduced fishing pressure.
- **Current Canadian Status:** Within the *critical zone* under DFO’s precautionary reference points.

### **Primary Threat**
- **Fishing as a non-targeted (bycatch) threat** – Bocaccio is not a targeted species but is caught incidentally in commercial, recreational, and First Nations fisheries.
- **High mortality risk:** When brought to the surface, Bocaccio dies due to rapid pressure changes — making live release impossible.

### **Socio-Economic Impacts of Listing**
- A **45% reduction in target species harvest** would be required to reduce incidental catch to 50 metric tons (t).
- **Estimated annual losses:**
  - $27.5 million in commercial sector profits
  - 700 jobs lost in the first year
  - $40.5 million in GDP loss
  - $24.5 million in household income loss
- These impacts would be significant and disproportionately affect rural communities and fishery-dependent economies.

### **Management Approach (Alternative to Listing)**
Instead of listing under SARA, the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** proposes continued management under the *Fisheries Act*, supported by the **Commercial Groundfish Integration Pilot Program (CGIPP)** — a three-year initiative launched in 2006.

#### Key Elements of CGIPP:
- **Inter-fleet trading system:** Allows commercial fleets to trade species allocations, reducing need to discard bycatch.
- **Comprehensive catch monitoring:** 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring of all catch.
- **Full catch accountability:** All catch (landed and released) must be tracked and reported.
- **Individual Vessel Quotas (IVQs):** Harvesters must hold individual quotas for species with total allowable catch (TAC).
- **Quota transferability:** Quotas can be transferred between commercial groundfish licenses.

#### Harvest Reductions Achieved:
- From 200–300 t to **150 t or lower**:
  - 120 t in 2006/07
  - 150 t in 2007/08
  - 121 t in 2008/09
- This reflects voluntary industry action to avoid high-density areas of Bocaccio.

#### Ongoing Measures:
- **Voluntary relinquishment program:** Fishers voluntarily give up proceeds from incidental Bocaccio catch to a research society.
- **Active avoidance:** Fishers modify practices to avoid areas with known Bocaccio densities.
- **Multi-species surveys:** Monitor relative abundance of rockfish to inform management.
- **Improved monitoring:** To assess recreational and First Nations catch levels.
- **Review of recreational creel program:** To better estimate recreational catch and inform future monitoring.
- **Cooperation with First Nations:** To develop tools for reporting catch from food, social, and ceremonial fisheries — which are currently not considered a threat.

#### Stock Assessment and Policy:
- Stock assessments are updated every **four years** to assess population health.
- If the population moves outside the "healthy zone" (a precautionary threshold), a **reduction in TAC** will be implemented.
- The **groundfish trawl sector** (accounting for 90% of non-directed catch) is the focus for future TAC and IVQ implementation.

### **Conclusion**
The Bocaccio is **not added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** because:
- Effective, science-based, and economically viable management is already in place via the CGIPP.
- Listing would impose prohibitions under Section 32 of SARA (prohibiting killing, harming, capturing, or taking) — which would effectively halt all fishing activities involving the species, regardless of intent.
- The socio-economic costs of such a ban are too high and unjustified given the current recovery trajectory and effective mitigation efforts.

## **2. Canary Rockfish (*Sebastes pinniger*)**

### **Background and Status**
- **Range:** Gulf of Alaska to northern Baja California.
- **COSEWIC Assessment (2007):** Listed as *Threatened* due to population decline.
- **US Status (Puget Sound/Georgia Basin):** Listed as *Threatened* (April 2010); US population has shown recovery since fishing reductions in 1999.
- **Current Status:** Recent DFO stock assessments indicate an **increase in overall abundance**, suggesting potential recovery at current mortality levels.

### **Primary Threat**
- **Targeted by commercial trawl and hook-and-line fisheries.**
- Also caught as **bycatch** in recreational and salmon troll fisheries.
- **No live release possible** due to pressure-related mortality when brought to surface.

### **Socio-Economic Impacts of Listing**
- **Estimated annualized profit loss:** $1.0 million (out of total $11.8 million over 40 years).
- The **full value of the fishery** ($11.8 million over 40 years) would be lost if listed.
- Most of the loss ($0.9 million annually) would fall on **commercial harvesters**.

### **Management Approach (Alternative to Listing)**
- Continued management under the *Fisheries Act* via the **Commercial Groundfish Integration Pilot Program (CGIPP)**.
- Management objective: Maintain population within the **"healthy zone"** — a precautionary threshold where the stock is not at risk from fisheries.

#### Key Management Actions:
- **Catch limits reduced** in both commercial and recreational fisheries following the 2007 COSEWIC assessment.
- **Multi-species monitoring** to track relative abundance.
- **100% at-sea and dockside monitoring** of all catch.
- **Full catch accountability** and **100% retention of rockfish**.
- **Reduced individual quotas** and **transferability between licenses**.

#### Additional Measures:
- **Groundfish trawl discards included in catch quotas** to more accurately estimate total mortality.
- More frequent stock assessments (every four years) to monitor population health.
- If assessments show the stock moves **outside the healthy zone**, the **commercial TAC will be reduced** in accordance with scientific advice.

#### Monitoring in Non-Commercial Fisheries:
- Improved monitoring in:
  - Salmon troll fisheries
  - Recreational fisheries
  - First Nations food, social, and ceremonial fisheries
- To ensure bycatch does not increase.

### **Conclusion**
The Canary rockfish is **not added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** because:
- Population trends show **positive recovery** under current management.
- No further harvest restrictions are needed to support recovery.
- Listing would trigger **prohibitions under Sections 32 and 33 of SARA**, effectively banning all fishing activities involving the species — a disproportionate and economically damaging outcome.
- The existing management framework (CGIPP) provides effective, adaptive, and transparent tools for monitoring and response.

## **3. Lake Winnipeg Physa (*Physa sp.*)**

### **Background and Status**
- **Taxonomy:** An aquatic snail found exclusively in **Lake Winnipeg**.
- **COSEWIC Assessment (2002):** Listed as *Endangered*.
- **Reassessment (2006):** COSEWIC reaffirmed the endangered status due to lack of new data.
- **Threats:** Population decline and reduction in area of occupancy due to:
  - Habitat loss
  - Human disturbance
  - Habitat degradation
  - Nutrients and contaminants from sewage lagoons, industrial activities, waste storage, and landfills.

### **Taxonomic Uncertainty**
- In **March 2009**, DFO convened a regional science advisory meeting (CSAS 2009/004) to assess whether the Lake Winnipeg Physa is a **distinct species**.
- **Conclusion:** There is **insufficient scientific evidence** to support that it is a unique taxonomic unit.
