  - **Kept above ground** at the mine site.
  - **Readily accessible** for inspection by:
    - Safety officers
    - Safety and health committees
    - Safety and health representatives
- Records must be:
  - **Dated and signed** by the person who created them.
  - **Countersigned by the mine manager** for any plan or procedure.
- If submitted to the **Coal Mining Safety Commission (CMSC)** for approval:
  - Employer must **notify the safety committee or representative in writing immediately**.
  - Approved plans must be **kept on-site and available for employee review**.
- In case of **inconsistency** between a referenced standard and a general provision, the **general provision prevails**.

> ⚠️ This ensures transparency, accountability, and traceability of safety decisions.

---

### 2. **Personnel Qualifications and Appointment Requirements**

- **No employee can be appointed to a supervisory role without meeting qualifications for all junior positions.**
- **Each coal mine must have a separate mine manager.**
- Upon death, resignation, or incapacity of the mine manager:
  - Employer must **identify in writing**:
    - A first-class mine official to act as mine manager
    - An underground manager to act as mine manager
    - Or **cease operations**
  - The employer must comply with the identified replacement within **90 days**.
- **Daily supervision** must be provided by:
  - At least **one underground manager**
  - At least **one overman**

> ✅ Ensures continuity of safe management and oversight even during personnel changes.

---

### 3. **Explosives and Detonators – Strict Controls**

#### 🔒 Storage:
- **No explosives or detonators may be stored underground.**
- Must be stored in an **approved above-ground structure**.
- Maximum storage: **Only the amount needed for 24 hours of underground use**.
- Detonators must be stored **separately** from explosives in a room with a **masonry wall ≥150 mm thick**.

#### 🚚 Transportation:
- Explosives and detonators must be transported in **secure cases or canisters**.
- Detonators must be in **separate cases** from explosives.
- **No case can contain more than 5 kg of explosive** unless approved by the CMSC.
- Cases must be kept **at least 300 mm away** from any equipment that could ignite them.

#### 🧑‍💼 Handling & Control:
- Only a **qualified person** (with mine examiner certificate) may control:
  - Storage
  - Issuance
  - Receipt of explosives/detonators
- Before issuing a detonator:
  - Must test for **electrical continuity**
