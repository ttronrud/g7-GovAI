---

### **4. Prohibited Actions and Risk Limits**

**Core Restriction (Section 3 & 4):**

A company **must not**:
- Acquire or increase a substantial investment in a designated entity (under paragraph 2(a)), **nor**
- Give up control of a designated entity while keeping a substantial investment (under paragraph 2(b)),  
**if, after the transaction, the total value of the following exceeds 50% of the company’s regulatory capital:**

#### 🔹 Components of the 50% Threshold:
1. **Shares and ownership interests**:
   - Beneficially owned by the company **or** by entities it controls.
   - In designated entities where the company has a **substantial investment but does NOT exercise control**.

2. **Loans**:
   - Held by the company or by entities it controls.
   - Made to designated entities where the company has a **substantial investment but no control**.

3. **Outstanding guarantees**:
   - Given by the company or by entities it controls.
   - On behalf of designated entities where the company has a **substantial investment but no control**.

> ✅ This rule applies **only** when the company does **not exercise control** over the designated entity.

---

### **5. Prohibition on New Lending or Guarantees**

A company that holds a **substantial investment** in a designated entity **without control** must **not**:
- Make a **loan** to that entity, or
- Provide a **guarantee** on its behalf,  
**or permit entities under its control to do so**,  
**if** such actions would cause the total value (as defined above) to **exceed 50% of its regulatory capital**.

> This ensures that even after an investment is made, further exposure through lending or guarantees is strictly limited.

---

### **6. Exclusions from the 50% Threshold**

Certain investments **do not count** toward the 50% limit. Specifically, the following are **excluded**:

- Investments made under:
  - Regulations made under **paragraph 501(a)** of the ICA (other than these Minority Investment Regulations);
  - **Subsection 493(3.1)** of the ICA **before** the coming into force of section 426 of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* (S.C. 2001, c. 9);
  - Investments made by a **specialized financing entity** controlled by the company.

> This provides flexibility for specific types of investments that are considered transitional or within established regulatory frameworks.

---

### **7. Exclusions from Value Calculation**

Certain assets are **excluded** from the total value calculation for the 50% threshold:

- Shares or ownership interests acquired under:
  - **Sections 498 to 500** of the ICA (e.g., related to capital adequacy or risk-based capital);
  - Loans made by a **bank controlled by the company** under **subsection 193(12) or (13)** of the *Bank Act* (chapter B-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985).

> This prevents double-counting or overreach in risk assessments involving banking-related transactions.

## 📌 Key Takeaways and Implications

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Risk Focus** | Targets **financial intermediaries** (factoring, leasing, financing) that carry market or credit risk—common in non-insurance financial activities. |
| **Control vs. Investment** | Distinguishes between **control** and **investment**. A company can invest without controlling, but must stay within 50% of regulatory capital. |
| **50% Regulatory Capital Cap** | A clear, enforceable limit to prevent systemic risk from minority investments in high-risk entities. |
| **Transparency & Accounting** | Uses **book value** (for equity) and **face value** (for guarantees), ensuring consistency with accounting standards. |
| **Exclusions** | Provides exemptions for transitional or bank-related investments, reducing regulatory burden where appropriate. |
| **Enforcement** | Enforced through the Superintendent of Insurance, who monitors compliance with capital adequacy and risk exposure rules. |

## 🏁 Conclusion

The **Minority Investment (Insurance Companies) Regulations** serve as a critical **risk mitigation tool** within the Canadian insurance regulatory framework. They ensure that insurance companies do not accumulate excessive exposure to non-controlled financial entities—particularly those with material market or credit risk—thereby protecting the financial stability of the insurance sector and the broader financial system.

By setting a **50% threshold of regulatory capital**, the regulations introduce a **prudential safeguard** that prevents over-concentration of risk, while allowing limited flexibility through specific exemptions. This balance supports innovation in financial services while preserving the core stability of insurance companies.
