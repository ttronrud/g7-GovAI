**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation Issued under the Visiting Forces Act (Canada), 1984**

---

### **1. Title and Issuance**
This document is an official **Proclamation** issued by the **Governor General of Canada**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, under the authority granted by **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act (Chapter V-6 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, as amended)**.

- **Date of Issue**: August 21, 1984  
- **Location**: Ottawa, Canada  
- **Issued by**: The Right Honourable **Gerald Eric Le Dain**, Deputy of the Governor General  
- **Signed by**: George Post, Deputy Registrar General of Canada  
- **Royal Authority**: The proclamation is issued under the authority of **Queen Elizabeth II**, Head of the Commonwealth, as represented through the Governor General.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
The proclamation is grounded in **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act**, which empowers the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting through the Cabinet and Privy Council) to:

- Designate any country as a **"designated state"** for the purposes of the Act; and  
- Declare the **extent to which the Act applies** in that designated state.

This provision allows Canada to regulate the presence, activities, and rights of foreign military forces visiting Canadian territory or operating within Canada’s jurisdiction, particularly in matters of security, legal status, and liability.

The following **13 countries** are officially designated as "designated states" under this proclamation:

| Country | Status |
|--------|--------|

### **4. Scope of Application of the Visiting Forces Act**
The proclamation declares that the **Visiting Forces Act applies to the designated states**, **with one key exception**:

- **Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act is excluded** from application in these countries.

#### What is Part VI?
Part VI of the Visiting Forces Act typically deals with **provisions related to the liability of Canadian authorities for injuries or damages arising from the actions of foreign military personnel**. It may include rules about compensation, jurisdiction, and liability in cases involving Canadian citizens or property.

> Therefore, **foreign military forces visiting these designated countries are subject to the Visiting Forces Act, except for the provisions in Part VI**, which are not extended to those nations.

This means:
- Canadian law regarding the **presence, conduct, and rights of visiting foreign military forces** (such as access to land, use of facilities, legal status, and obligations of host nations) applies.
- However, **Canadian liability for damages or injuries to individuals (e.g., Canadian citizens or residents)** caused by foreign forces **is not triggered** under Part VI.

---

### **5. Purpose and Policy Rationale**
The government's decision to designate these 13 countries reflects a strategic and diplomatic policy to:

- **Facilitate the lawful and orderly presence** of foreign military forces in Canada or Canadian-operated regions (e.g., during joint exercises, peacekeeping, or defense cooperation).
- **Clarify legal obligations** between Canada and these nations regarding the deployment of military personnel.
- **Ensure consistency in the application of Canadian law** in international military engagements.
- **Support Canada’s role in international defense cooperation**, particularly with countries in the Caribbean, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

The inclusion of countries like **Belize, Nepal, and Sierra Leone** suggests a focus on regional stability and development partnerships, while the inclusion of **Kuwait, UAE, and Thailand** reflects strategic military and economic ties.

---

### **6. Legal Effect and Obligations**
- All **federal institutions, government officials, and citizens** in Canada are required to take notice of this proclamation and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- The designation is **binding and enforceable** under Canadian law.
- It applies **to all foreign military forces** visiting or operating in these countries **in the context of the Visiting Forces Act**.
- The exclusion of Part VI ensures **that Canada does not assume liability** for harm caused by visiting forces in these countries — a significant legal safeguard.

---

### **7. Historical Context (1984)**
This proclamation was issued in **1984**, during a period of increased global military engagement and Cold War-era diplomacy. Canada was actively involved in:
- Peacekeeping missions in Africa and the Middle East.
- Regional security cooperation in the Caribbean and Asia.
- Developing defense ties with developing nations.

The inclusion of countries like **Zimbabwe** (which gained independence in 1980) and **Nepal** (a landlocked nation with limited international military ties) indicates Canada’s interest in **engaging with a broad range of nations** for mutual security and stability.
