**Detailed Summary of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (GST) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders that provide for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

The Order specifically applies to the **Champagne and Aishihik First Nations** and concerns the **remission of Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was paid during a defined period.

---

**2. Legislative Basis**  
The Order is grounded in the **Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Self-Government Agreement**, which was signed on **May 29, 1993**, and amended as of **November 2, 2000**. This agreement established a framework for self-government and included provisions related to taxation and financial autonomy for the First Nations.

The remission of GST is directly tied to **Sections 15.7 to 15.11** of this Self-Government Agreement. These sections outline the conditions and mechanisms under which the First Nations may be entitled to a refund or remission of GST paid during a specific period.

**3. Key Definitions**  
- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Self-Government Agreement, as it existed on **November 2, 2000**. This version includes all amendments and updates made prior to that date.  
- **"Person"**: Defined in accordance with **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**, which generally refers to any individual, corporation, or entity that is subject to tax under the Excise Tax Act. In this context, it includes the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations and any entities acting on their behalf.

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
- The remission applies to **GST paid by a "person"** (i.e., the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations or affiliated entities) during the period from **October 1, 1997, to October 31, 2000**.  
- The remission is **limited to the amount and conditions specified in Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**. This means that the refund or cancellation of tax is not automatic or general but is strictly governed by the terms agreed upon in the self-government agreement.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
- The remission is **conditional** on the **non-availability of a refund under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**.  
  - Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act typically provides a mechanism for refunds or tax relief under certain circumstances.  
  - By explicitly excluding any refund under this section, the Order ensures that the remission under the Self-Government Agreement takes precedence and avoids potential overlap or duplication of benefits.

**6. Purpose and Public Interest**  
The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This reflects a broader policy of recognizing and supporting the financial self-sufficiency and autonomy of Indigenous communities through equitable tax arrangements. The remission helps to reduce financial burdens on First Nations during the early years of self-government, enabling greater fiscal capacity to manage their own affairs.

---

**7. Effective Date**  
The Order **comes into force on November 2, 2000** — the date the Self-Government Agreement was updated to its final form. This timing ensures that the remission is implemented in alignment with the agreement's formal adoption and ratification.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a **legally binding, targeted remission of GST** paid by the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations between October 1, 1997, and October 31, 2000. It is a direct result of the self-government agreement and reflects a commitment to financial equity and Indigenous self-determination. By aligning with the specific provisions of the agreement and excluding any entitlement under the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, the Order ensures clarity, consistency, and fairness in tax treatment for the First Nations during a critical period of governance transition.

This Order serves as a key example of how federal tax policy can be tailored to support Indigenous self-government through negotiated, equitable financial arrangements.
