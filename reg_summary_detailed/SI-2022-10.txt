**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulatory Instrument:**
**Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in Nunavut (Bathurst Island) Order**  
- **Legal Citation:** R.S., c. T-7 (Territorial Lands Act)  
- **Issuing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs  
- **Authority Basis:** Paragraph 23(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act*  

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **protect specific tracts of territorial land in Nunavut** by **withdrawing them from disposal (i.e., sale, lease, or other forms of transfer)** for a defined period. This protection is intended to ensure that these lands remain intact and available for consideration in the development of the **Nunavut Land Use Plan (NLUP)** — a comprehensive framework for land use, environmental protection, and community-based planning.

This withdrawal is not a permanent restriction but a **temporary measure** designed to allow time for the government to assess and plan for sustainable land use, particularly in ecologically sensitive or culturally significant areas.

#### **3. Area and Measurement**
- **Total Area:** Approximately **2,000 square kilometers**  
- **Measurement Method:** Albers Equal Area Projection (a standard cartographic projection used for accurate area representation)  
- **Topographic Data:** Based on **CanVec Edition 9** (a national topographic dataset)  
- **Coordinate System:** Geodetic coordinates referenced to the **1983 North American Datum (NAD83)** within the **Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS)**

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**

- The withdrawal from disposal is effective for a period of **10 years**, beginning on the date the Order is made.  
- This means that **no disposal (sale, lease, or transfer)** of the land or its **surface and subsurface rights** can occur during this period, unless otherwise exempted.

---

### **Exemptions (Section 2 Does Not Apply To)**

Despite the general withdrawal, the Order explicitly **excludes certain activities** from being affected by the withdrawal provisions. These are critical exceptions that allow continuity in existing mineral rights and exploration activities:

1. **Staking of Mineral Claims**  
   - A prospecting permit holder who staked a mineral claim **before the date of the Order** is not affected.  
   - The claim remains valid and can be recorded.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims**  
   - Claims that were staked or recorded **before the Order takes effect** are exempt.

3. **Granting of Leases under Nunavut Mining Regulations**  
   - A lease can be granted to a person with a **recorded mineral claim**, provided the lease covers land within that claim.

4. **Issuance of Significant Discovery Licences (Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - A significant discovery licence can be issued to a holder of an **exploration licence issued before the Order**, if the licence covers land subject to that exploration licence.

5. **Issuance of Production Licences**  
   - A production licence can be issued to a holder of a significant discovery licence (as above), if it covers land subject to that discovery licence.

6. **Issuance of Surface Leases**  
   - A surface lease can be issued to a holder of a recorded mineral claim or interest (under Nunavut Mining Regulations or Canada Petroleum Resources Act), **if the lease is required to enable the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest**.

7. **Renewal of Interests**  
   - Renewals of existing mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not affected by the withdrawal.

> ✅ These exemptions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing exploration or development activities are not disrupted** by the temporary withdrawal, preserving continuity in the mineral sector while protecting the land for broader planning purposes.

### **Key Legal and Environmental Implications**

- **Environmental Protection:** The area is adjacent to two **national parks and a national wildlife area**, indicating high ecological value. The withdrawal helps prevent environmental degradation from unregulated mining or development.
  
- **Cultural and Indigenous Considerations:** The region lies within or near protected areas with potential cultural significance for Inuit communities. The withdrawal supports Indigenous land use planning and respects traditional knowledge and stewardship.

- **Planning and Governance:** This Order is a **procedural step** in the development of the **Nunavut Land Use Plan**, which is essential for balancing economic development, environmental sustainability, and community needs.

- **Temporary Nature:** The 10-year restriction is not a permanent ban — it is a **temporary safeguard** to allow time for comprehensive planning and public consultation before any disposal decisions are made.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order represents a **targeted, environmentally and culturally sensitive intervention** under the Territorial Lands Act. It:

- Withholds approximately **2,000 km² of land on northern Bathurst Island** from disposal for **10 years**  
- Protects ecologically and culturally significant lands adjacent to national parks and wildlife areas  
- Preserves existing mineral rights and exploration activities through specific exemptions  
- Supports the long-term development of a sustainable and community-informed Nunavut Land Use Plan  

It reflects a balance between **economic interests in mineral exploration** and **environmental and cultural protection**, ensuring that land use decisions in Nunavut are made thoughtfully, transparently, and in accordance with both legal frameworks and Indigenous priorities.

--- 

**Final Note:** This Order is a key component of Nunavut’s land governance strategy and underscores the importance of **planning-led development** over immediate exploitation of natural resources.
