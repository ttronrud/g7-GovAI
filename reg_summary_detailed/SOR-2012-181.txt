**Detailed Summary of the CJFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CJFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing tariff preferences under free trade agreements.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1) – Provides the legal foundation for the regulation-making power.  
  - S.C. 1997, c. 36 – Likely refers to an earlier enabling statute or related framework (possibly the Customs Tariff Act or related legislation).

These regulations are specifically designed to implement the **Canada–Jordan Free Trade Agreement (CJFTA)**, which was signed on **June 28, 2009**, and entered into force to promote trade and economic growth between Canada and Jordan.

### **2. Definition of "Originating Goods"**

In these regulations, the term **"originating"** refers to goods that qualify as originating in the territory of a **Party (Canada or Jordan)** under the **rules of origin** established in **Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin)** of the CJFTA.

- **Key Implication**:  
  Only goods that meet the specific rules of origin—such as the requirement that a product be wholly obtained or produced in Jordan, or contain a minimum percentage of Jordanian content—will be considered "originating."  
  This determines whether those goods are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the agreement.

### **3. Eligibility for Jordan Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, goods exported from **Jordan** are entitled to the **benefits of the Jordan Tariff** (i.e., reduced or zero tariffs) in Canada **if** they meet one of the following two conditions:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipment Without Transshipment Through Another Country**

If the goods are shipped directly from Jordan to Canada **without passing through any other country**, the importer is entitled to preferential treatment **if**:

- The shipment is conducted via a **through bill of lading** (a single document that covers the entire journey from origin to destination), **or**
- The shipment is not via a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly shows the **shipping route**;
  - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** (if any) prior to entry into Canada.

> This ensures transparency and verifiability of the shipment path, even in cases where a through bill of lading is not used.

#### **Condition 2: Shipment Through Another Country**

If the goods are shipped to Canada **through another country** (e.g., via a third nation like the United States or the UAE), the importer must provide:

1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
   - The full **shipping route**;
   - All **points of shipment and transhipment** before entry into Canada.

2. A **copy of the customs control documents** that demonstrate:
   - The goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the third country.

> This requirement ensures that the goods were not re-exported or processed in a way that would disqualify them from being considered "originating" under the CJFTA.

> The customs control documentation must be sufficient to prove that the goods were not subjected to processing, reclassification, or alteration that would affect their origin.

### **4. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 36 of the Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 18 of the Statutes of Canada, 2012) comes into force.

- **Note**: The regulations are stated to be in force as of **October 1, 2012**.  
  This date marks the official implementation of the CJFTA and the activation of tariff preference benefits for qualifying Jordanian goods.

---

### **5. Purpose and Significance**

- **Objective**:  
  To facilitate fair and transparent trade between Canada and Jordan by enabling Jordanian goods that meet origin criteria to enter Canada with reduced or zero tariffs.

- **Economic Impact**:  
  Encourages investment in Jordanian manufacturing and agriculture, supports local industries, and strengthens bilateral trade ties.

- **Compliance and Enforcement**:  
  The requirement for documentary evidence ensures that customs authorities can verify compliance with origin rules, reducing the risk of fraud or misuse of tariff preferences.
