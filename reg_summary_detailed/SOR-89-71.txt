Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, purpose, key provisions, and implications.

## **Detailed Summary of the "Members of Committees Regulations"**

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

- **Agreement Reference**:  
  The regulation is issued under the **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Canada and the United States**, signed on **January 2, 1988**, specifically under **Chapter Nineteen** of that agreement. Chapter Nineteen governs **dispute resolution mechanisms**, including the establishment of **extraordinary challenge committees** to review decisions made by panels in trade disputes.

- **Annex Reference**:  
  The regulation is directly linked to **Paragraph 1 of Annex 1904.13** of Chapter Nineteen. This paragraph establishes the requirement for the Parties (Canada and the U.S.) to **consult in developing a roster of judges or former judges** who can serve as members of extraordinary challenge committees.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The regulation is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of:
  - The **Minister for International Trade**
  - The **Minister of Finance**

  This authority is derived from **paragraph 77.27(c)** of the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**, which empowers the federal government to create regulations governing the appointment and operation of committees related to import measures, including those under international trade agreements.

- **Regulation Citation**:  
  The regulation is officially cited as **S.C. 1988, c. 65, s. 42**, and is known as the **"Members of Committees Regulations"**.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Establish a **formal, transparent, and impartial roster of qualified individuals** (judges or former judges) who may be selected to serve on **extraordinary challenge committees**.
- Ensure that the selection process for such committee members is **fair, consistent, and in accordance with the FTA’s dispute resolution framework**.
- Provide a clear mechanism for **appointing members** of these committees when challenges to panel decisions arise.

---

### **3. Key Provisions**

#### **A. Definition of "Committee Roster"**
- The term **"committee roster"** refers to the official list of individuals established under **Section 3** of the regulation.
- This roster is **not a permanent appointment list**, but rather a **pool of qualified candidates** from which members are selected.

#### **B. Duration of Roster Membership**
- Candidates listed on the roster are:
  - Selected to serve **for a period of three years**, or
  - **Until they cease to be in good behaviour** (a legal term meaning they are no longer acting in an ethical, professional, or legally acceptable manner).
- This ensures that the roster remains current and that individuals are only retained if they maintain professional integrity.

#### **C. Selection Process for Committee Members**
- When a candidate is needed to serve on an extraordinary challenge committee (e.g., to review a panel’s decision on a definitive trade measure), the selection must follow this process:
  1. A **selection board** is formed.
  2. The board is **chaired by the Minister of Finance**.
  3. The board includes:
     - The **Minister of Finance**
     - **Other ministers** of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, as designated by the **Prime Minister from time to time**.
  - This ensures **inter-ministerial oversight** and **political accountability**, while maintaining independence in the selection of judicially qualified individuals.

#### **D. Appointment of Committee Members**
- Once a candidate is selected by the board:
  - The **Minister of Finance** (or the relevant Minister) is responsible for **formally appointing** the individual as a member of the challenge committee.
- The appointment is **not automatic**; it requires formal action by the Minister after the board’s decision.

### **4. Named Candidates on the Roster**

The regulation explicitly names the following individuals as candidates on the committee roster:

| Name                     | Position/Title |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Deschênes, Jules        | Judge / Former Judge |
| Estey, Willard Zebedee  | Judge / Former Judge |
| Evans, Gregory Thomas   | Judge / Former Judge |
| Morgan, Herbert         | Judge / Former Judge |
| Nemetz, Nathaniel Theodore | Judge / Former Judge |

> These individuals are **qualified legal professionals**, likely with experience in administrative law, trade law, or judicial review, making them suitable for evaluating the legality or fairness of panel decisions under the FTA.

---

### **5. Operational Implications**

- **Transparency and Accountability**:  
  The inclusion of a formal board with ministerial oversight ensures that selections are not arbitrary and are subject to governmental accountability.

- **Judicial Neutrality**:  
  By drawing from a list of **judges or former judges**, the process promotes **impartiality and legal expertise**, which is essential in trade disputes involving complex legal and economic issues.

- **Flexibility and Renewability**:  
  The three-year term and "good behaviour" condition allow for periodic review and renewal of the roster, ensuring that only active, reputable individuals remain on it.

- **Cross-Border Consistency**:  
  Since the FTA is a bilateral agreement, this regulation supports **cooperative dispute resolution** between Canada and the U.S., ensuring both nations have access to a shared pool of qualified experts.

---

### **6. Broader Significance**

- **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**:  
  This regulation strengthens the **dispute settlement framework** under the Canada-U.S. FTA by providing a clear, rule-based process for challenging panel decisions, which is critical in maintaining trust in trade rulings.

- **Prevention of Arbitrariness**:  
  By requiring a formal selection board and a defined roster, the regulation prevents ad hoc or politically influenced appointments, enhancing the legitimacy of the challenge process.

- **Alignment with International Standards**:  
  The structure mirrors international practices in trade dispute resolution (e.g., WTO dispute settlement), reinforcing Canada’s commitment to fair and transparent trade governance.

---

### **7. Limitations and Considerations**

- **No Automatic Appointment**:  
  Being on the roster does not guarantee appointment; selection is discretionary and based on the needs of a specific case and the board’s assessment.

- **Political Oversight**:  
  While the board is chaired by the Minister of Finance, the inclusion of other ministers (designated by the Prime Minister) introduces political influence. This may raise concerns about impartiality, though the requirement for judicial expertise helps balance this.

- **Expiry and Renewal**:  
  The three-year term means the roster must be periodically updated, which could lead to gaps or changes in expertise over time.

## **Conclusion**

The **Members of Committees Regulations** provide a **clear, structured, and legally grounded framework** for selecting members of extraordinary challenge committees under the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. By establishing a **roster of qualified judges or former judges**, setting a **three-year term**, and mandating a **ministerially supervised selection process**, the regulation ensures that trade disputes are reviewed by **independent, expert, and accountable individuals**. This enhances the **credibility, fairness, and effectiveness** of dispute resolution in the FTA, reinforcing the mutual trust between Canada and the United States in their shared trade regime.

---

**Final Note**:  
These regulations remain in force as of the date of issuance and are part of Canada’s broader legal framework for managing international trade disputes. They reflect a balance between **legal professionalism**, **governmental oversight**, and **bilateral cooperation** under the FTA.
