### **3. Information Recipients (Designated Recipients)**

The Minister of Health is the **default recipient** of certain information under subsections 241.31(1) to (2) of the *Criminal Code*. However, specific provincial or territorial officials are designated as recipients for certain types of information:

| Jurisdiction | Designated Recipient |
|------------|------------------------|
| Ontario | Chief Coroner |
| Quebec | Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services |
| British Columbia | Deputy Minister of Health |
| Saskatchewan | CEO of Saskatchewan Health Authority |
| Alberta | President and CEO of Alberta Health Services |
| Northwest Territories | Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services |
| Nunavut | Minister of Health |

> These recipients receive data on:
> - Eligibility assessments
> - Requests for MAID
> - Prescriptions or administration of substances
> - Withdrawals or deaths related to MAID

This ensures **provincial-level oversight**, particularly in investigations involving death, and supports coroner-led inquiries when necessary.

### **4. Exemptions from Reporting Obligations**

Certain practitioners are **exempt** from providing information under specific subsections of the regulations:

- A practitioner who receives a request **directly from the patient or another person** to obtain a written opinion on eligibility (under paragraph 241.2(3)(e) or (3.1)(e)) is **not required** to report under subsections 5(1), 6(1), or 6.1(1), or section 9.
- A practitioner who consults with another practitioner **on a condition-specific basis** (e.g., for expertise in a chronic illness) and shares results is also exempt — provided the consultation was for medical expertise and not for decision-making on eligibility.

> These exemptions aim to **protect patient confidentiality** and reduce unnecessary reporting burdens in routine clinical consultations.
