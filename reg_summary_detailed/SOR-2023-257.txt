### **Detailed Summary of the Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations (Canada)**

The **Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations** (VCE Regulations) are a comprehensive set of rules issued under the authority of the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, and other enabling legislation. These regulations establish the **minimum safety, construction, and equipment standards** for Canadian vessels, particularly those engaged in commercial operations. Below is a detailed, structured summary of the key provisions, objectives, scope, definitions, and exceptions.

## **1. Legal Authority and Legislative Basis**

The regulations are made under several statutory provisions:

- **Sections 157a and 270b of the Canada Labour Code** (for labour-related safety standards).
- **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (primary enabling statute).
- **International Conventions**:
  - *SOLAS* (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended)
  - *MLC 2006* (Maritime Labour Convention, 2006)
  - *FSS Code* (Fire Safety Systems Code)
  - *2008 IS Code* (Intact Stability Code)
  - *LSA Code* (Life-Saving Appliance Code)
- **Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act** (for Arctic operations)
- **Statutory Amendments**:
  - S.C. 2018, c. 22, s. 14; c. 27, s. 568
  - S.C. 2017, c. 20, s. 377

  - S.C. 2014, c. 29, s. 75(1)
  - S.C. 2001, c. 26

These regulations are **aligned with international standards**, with specific Canadian modifications incorporated through **Technical Publications (TPs)**.

## **2. Scope of Application**

### **Applicable Vessels**
The regulations apply to the following Canadian vessels:

| Category | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Passenger Vessels** | - Safety Convention vessels (e.g., those meeting SOLAS standards)<br> - Non-Safety Convention vessels **24 m or longer** |
| **Cargo Vessels** | **24 m or longer** |

> *Note:* Vessels less than 24 meters in length are generally excluded unless otherwise required by specific provisions.

### **Part 2 Application**
Part 2 applies to vessels that are **required to be registered or listed** under Part 2 of the Canada Shipping Act.

### **Foreign Vessels in Internal Waters**
- **Section 117** applies to foreign vessels navigating in **frazil ice or ice slush conditions** within Canada’s internal waters.

### **Exclusions**
The regulations **do not apply** to:
- **Pleasure craft** (non-commercial vessels)

## **3. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|----------|
| **2008 IS Code** | International Code on Intact Stability, 2008 (as amended); interpreted with Canadian modifications (TP 7301) |
| **FSS Code** | International Code for Fire Safety Systems (as amended) |
| **SOLAS** | International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (as amended) |
| **MLC 2006** | Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (as amended) |
| **Length** | As defined in SOLAS Chapter II-1, Regulation 2.5 |
| **Inland Voyage / Sheltered Waters / Near Coastal Voyage (Class 2)** | As defined in Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations |
| **Recognized Organization** | An organization with a formal agreement with the Minister of Transport (e.g., classification societies) |
| **Recommended Practices and Standards** | Published by marine classification societies, government bodies, or international organizations; treated as mandatory when referenced in footnotes |
| **TP 15415** | *Canadian Modifications for the Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations* (December 2023) – key for interpreting international standards in Canadian context |

### **Interpretive Rules**
- **"Should" → "Must"**: In documents incorporated by reference, "should" is interpreted as a mandatory requirement.
- **"Administration" → "Minister"**: For consistency with Canadian jurisdiction.
- **"Ship" → "Vessel"**: Used uniformly throughout.
- **"Ships of traditional build" → "Wooden vessels of primitive build"**: For MLC 2006 interpretation.
- **References to SOLAS/MLC 2006 are modified by TP 15415** – all references are subject to Canadian amendments.
- **Guidelines, recommendations, and requirements in footnotes are mandatory**.

## **4. Grandfathering Provisions (Section 8)**

To ease transition for older vessels, the regulations allow **grandfathering** for vessels constructed before the regulation’s effective date.

### **Eligible Vessels**
A vessel qualifies as a **grandfathered vessel** if:
1. It **has never flown the flag of a foreign state**; or  
2. It **held a valid certificate** under the Vessel Certificates Regulations or Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations **on the day the regulation came into force**, or **at any time during the 5 years prior**.

### **Mandatory Compliance (Despite Section 8)**
Even if grandfathered, the vessel must comply with:
- **Section 103** (SOLAS Chapter III) – **only for regulations 20 and 22.3**
- **Subsection 301(2)** of the Hull Construction Regulations

### **Additional Compliance Requirements (After 1st Anniversary)**
After the first anniversary of the regulation’s coming into force, grandfathered vessels must comply with:
- **Cargo vessels with mechanical propulsion**:
  - Regulations 3–4.2, 3–8, 5, and 5–1 of SOLAS Chapter II-1 (instead of sections 12(5)/(6) and 80/81 of Hull Construction Regulations)
- **Non-Safety Convention passenger vessels**:
  - Regulations 6 to 8 of Chapter II-1 of SOLAS (instead of sections 24 and 25 of Hull Construction Regulations)
- **General SOLAS Chapter III requirements**:
  - Regulations 1.5, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 9, and 17–1

### **Equipment and Modifications**
The **authorized representative** must ensure that the following components comply with current regulations:
- Parts undergoing **repairs, alterations, or modifications** that:
  - Substantially alter vessel dimensions or passenger accommodation
  - Substantially increase service life or outfitting life
- Machinery, systems, and equipment related to such parts
- Any **replaced parts or equipment** after the regulation came into force

### **Loss of Grandfathering**
A vessel **ceases to be grandfathered** if:
- Its intended service changes such that it can no longer meet pre-regulation requirements
- It **ceases to hold a Vessel Safety Certificate for more than 5 years**

### **Vessels Built >10 Years Before Most Recent Registration**
If a vessel:
- Has **never held a Vessel Certificate**, or
- Has **never held a Vessel Safety Certificate during the 5 years before the regulation came into force**

→ It must comply with the regulations **as if constructed within the last 10 years**.
