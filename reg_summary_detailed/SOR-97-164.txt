### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a clear and enforceable time limit for copyright owners who are **not members of a collective society** (i.e., collecting societies) to claim royalties arising from the **retransmission of their works**. It ensures that royalty claims are made within a defined timeframe, promoting legal certainty and administrative efficiency in the collection and distribution of royalties under the Canadian Copyright Act.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Applicable Parties:**  
   - The regulation applies to **copyright owners** who:
     - Do **not authorize** a collective society (such as a performing rights society or a mechanical rights society) to collect royalties on their behalf.
     - Have works that are **retransmitted** (e.g., broadcast or rebroadcast via television, radio, or other media).

2. **Nature of the Royalty in Question:**  
   - The royalties are those referred to in **paragraph 31(2)(d)** of the *Copyright Act*, which typically relates to **retransmission rights**—specifically, the right to receive compensation when a work is retransmitted (e.g., a TV show being rebroadcast).

3. **Time Limit for Claiming Royalties:**  
   - A copyright owner who is not a member of a collecting body has **two years** from the end of the calendar year in which the retransmission occurred to **claim the royalties** payable under **subsection 76(1)** of the *Copyright Act*.

   > Example:  
   > If a work was retransmitted in the calendar year 1996, the copyright owner must file a claim for royalties by **December 31, 1998** (i.e., two years after the end of 1996).

4. **Legal Basis for the Time Limit:**  
   - The two-year period is established under the authority granted by **paragraph 70.66(3)(b)(a)** of the *Copyright Act*, which empowers the Copyright Board to set timeframes for royalty entitlements for non-members of collecting societies.

### **Key Implications**

- **Clarity and Predictability:**  
  The regulation provides certainty to copyright owners and collecting societies by defining a clear deadline for claiming royalties, reducing disputes over whether a claim is time-barred.

- **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
  Copyright owners must act promptly. Failure to file a claim within the two-year window may result in the loss of the right to recover royalties, even if the retransmission occurred and the work was legally used.

- **Exclusion of Collective Societies:**  
  This regulation specifically applies to **non-members** of collecting bodies. Members of such societies are generally entitled to royalty collection through the society’s established procedures and may not be subject to this two-year deadline, as their rights are managed directly by the collective.

- **Scope of Retransmission:**  
  The regulation applies to any retransmission of a work—whether by television, radio, online platforms, or other media—where the work is transmitted again after its initial public broadcast.

---

### **When Do These Regulations Come Into Force?**

- The regulations officially **come into force on March 19, 1997**.

This means that any retransmission occurring on or after March 19, 1997, will be governed by this two-year claim period for non-member copyright owners.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a critical mechanism for balancing the rights of individual copyright owners with the administrative and financial realities of royalty collection. By setting a two-year window for claiming retransmission royalties when a copyright owner is not part of a collecting society, the regulation ensures that rights are protected while preventing indefinite or delayed claims that could disrupt the royalty system. It reflects the Canadian government’s effort to maintain a fair, transparent, and efficient copyright framework for both creators and users of copyrighted works.
