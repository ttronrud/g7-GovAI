**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation, known as the *Critical Habitat of the Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk. The Act was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and provides a legal framework for the identification, protection, and recovery of species at risk.

The Order is made by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**, who has the authority under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of SARA to designate critical habitat for listed species. These provisions allow the Minister to establish and regulate the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of a species at risk.

**2. Species at Risk**

The species in question is the **Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra)**, a freshwater mussels species native to Canada. It is classified as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act*. This classification means the species faces a very high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate conservation measures.

**3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

The critical habitat for the Snuffbox was previously identified in the **recovery strategy** developed for the species. This strategy outlines the necessary conditions for the species to survive and recover, including specific environmental features such as water quality, substrate type, flow conditions, and habitat connectivity.

This recovery strategy has been formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada that documents all species at risk and their associated recovery plans and designations. This inclusion ensures transparency and public access to information about the species and its conservation needs.

**4. Key Legal Condition**

A key provision in this Order is that **no portion of the designated critical habitat lies in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA**.

Subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA generally refers to areas where the designation of critical habitat would be prohibited due to **provincial or territorial jurisdictional issues**, such as where the area is located in a province or territory that has not fully cooperated with federal conservation efforts, or where there are conflicting land-use or ownership rights. However, in this case, the Minister confirms that **none of the identified critical habitat falls into such a prohibited category**.

This legal affirmation is essential because it validates the federal government’s ability to proceed with the designation without being barred by jurisdictional constraints.

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and legally protect the critical habitat** of the Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra). By doing so, the government:

- Identifies the specific geographic areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery;
- Provides legal protection to these areas, meaning that any activities that could degrade or destroy the habitat (such as construction, mining, or pollution) may be subject to review or restriction;
- Ensures that federal actions (e.g., licensing, planning, or development projects) are assessed for their potential impact on the critical habitat;
- Supports the broader recovery of the species by safeguarding the environmental conditions necessary for its long-term survival.

---

**6. Legal Authority and Effective Date**

- The Order is issued **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and (5)** of SARA, which empower the Minister to designate critical habitat based on scientific assessments and recovery strategies.
- The Order is **effective upon registration** with the federal government (i.e., when it is officially published in the Canada Gazette), which occurred on **September 6, 2019**.
- Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Snuffbox, meaning that all federal actions affecting the habitat must comply with the requirements of the Act, including environmental assessments and mitigation measures.

**7. Significance of the Order**

This Order is a significant step in the conservation of the Snuffbox, one of Canada’s most endangered freshwater mussels. The Snuffbox is highly sensitive to environmental changes, including water quality, sedimentation, and habitat fragmentation. By formally protecting its critical habitat, the federal government is taking proactive action to prevent further decline and support recovery efforts.

Additionally, this designation contributes to Canada’s broader biodiversity conservation goals and demonstrates the government’s commitment to implementing science-based, legally enforceable protections for species at risk.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra) Order* is a legally binding regulation that formally identifies and protects the essential environmental areas required for the survival and recovery of an endangered freshwater mussel species. It is grounded in scientific assessment, complies with federal legislative requirements, and ensures that federal actions are evaluated for potential harm to the species’ habitat. The Order underscores Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation under the *Species at Risk Act* and serves as a critical component in the long-term recovery of the Snuffbox population.
