The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2012-17, s. 3]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Regulation SOR/2012-17, section 3**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists or has legal effect.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2012-17, section 3* (Statutory Instrument 2012-17, section 3), which is a government regulation issued under the authority of the Canadian government.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2012-17, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on January 18, 2012 (the effective date of the regulation).
- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (Inferred)**: While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your input, the repeated references suggest that it was likely a provision related to a particular area of law — such as environmental standards, occupational health and safety, or a specific licensing or compliance requirement — that was later deemed outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or regulations.

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures established by this regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the **current, active regulations** that have replaced or superseded it.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization or consolidation effort to streamline or update the legal framework.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It was officially canceled by **SOR/2012-17, section 3**, and its content is not applicable today. To find the current legal requirements, one should consult the most recent version of the relevant statute or regulation that now governs the subject matter.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., scope, provisions, enforcement mechanisms) cannot be provided. The summary above is based solely on the metadata and status of the repeal.

If you can provide the original regulation's title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting the use of certain chemicals"), I can offer a more detailed and context-specific summary.
