**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Order Granting a Refund of Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **Section 58 of the Customs Tariff**, as amended, and on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**.  
**Act Reference:** S.C. 1997, c. 36 (the *Customs Tariff*).  

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a **refund mechanism** for a surtax previously imposed on the importation of certain steel goods. Specifically, it provides for the **refund of the surtax** that was previously collected under the *Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods*, as it was in effect on **April 28, 2019**.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Eligible Goods and Classes:**
   The refund applies to goods falling into specific **classes** as defined in **Schedule 1** to the original surtax order (the Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods). The classes are categorized as follows:

   - **Classes 2 to 5 and 7** – *All goods originating in any country* (i.e., global coverage).
   - **Classes 1 and 6** – *Only for goods originating in specific countries*: **Colombia, Korea, Panama, and Peru**.

   This means that:
   - For most steel goods (classes 2–5 and 7), regardless of the country of origin, a refund is available.
   - For goods in classes 1 and 6, the refund is only available if the goods originate from Colombia, Korea, Panama, or Peru.

2. **Conditions for Refund:**
   - The refund is granted **only for the surtax (or portion thereof)** that:
     - Was actually paid by the importer;
     - And for which **no other claim for relief** has been made under the *Customs Tariff* (e.g., other exemptions, reductions, or offsets).

   This ensures that the refund is not double-claimed and prevents overlap with other available relief provisions.

3. **Scope and Application:**
   - The refund is **specifically limited** to the surtax imposed on the importation of steel goods under the April 28, 2019 version of the surtax order.
   - It does **not** extend to other types of duties or taxes, nor does it apply retroactively beyond the date of registration.

4. **Effective Date:**
   - The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
   - This means the refund becomes available to eligible importers from the date of official publication and registration.

### Interpretation and Implications:

- **Policy Objective:**  
  This regulation appears to be a corrective or relief measure designed to support trade with specific countries (Colombia, Korea, Panama, and Peru) by reducing the effective cost of importing certain steel goods from those nations. It may reflect trade policy considerations, such as strengthening economic ties or responding to market conditions.

- **Targeted Relief:**  
  The distinction between goods from different countries suggests a **preferential treatment** for imports from selected nations, potentially to encourage or stabilize trade with those countries.

- **Administrative Clarity:**  
  By specifying that refunds are only granted where no other relief has been claimed, the regulation ensures fiscal accountability and prevents abuse of the refund system.

### Conclusion:

This regulation provides a **targeted refund** of the surtax imposed on specific classes of steel goods, with different eligibility rules based on the **country of origin**. It supports trade with Colombia, Korea, Panama, and Peru by refunding the surtax on certain steel imports from those countries, while extending the same benefit to all steel goods in other classes regardless of origin. The refund is conditional on no prior claim for relief under the Customs Tariff and takes effect upon registration. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and trade policy objectives.

This Order is a key administrative tool under the *Customs Tariff* to manage the financial impact of import surcharges on specific goods and to support international trade relationships.
