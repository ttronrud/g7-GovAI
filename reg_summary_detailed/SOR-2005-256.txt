**Detailed Summary of the Tariff Classification Advance Rulings Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations are a formal implementation of **Customs Notice N-505**, issued on **March 31, 2003**, and published under the authority of the **Customs Act**. The regulations are designed to operationalize provisions related to **advance rulings on tariff classification** of goods under Canadian customs law.

Key legal foundations include:

- **Paragraph 167.1(b)a** of the Customs Act: Authorizes the issuance of regulations to give effect to a public announcement (Customs Notice N-505).
- **Paragraph 167.1(d)a** of the Customs Act: Authorizes the regulations to implement amendments to **Section 43.1** of the Act, which was amended by **Section 36 of the Act to Amend the Customs Act and to Make Related Amendments** (S.C. 2001, c. 25), and came into force on **April 1, 2003**.

The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, enacted these regulations **pursuant to Section 43.1d** and **paragraphs 164(1)(i) and (j)** of the Customs Act, thereby establishing a formal framework for advance tariff rulings.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Provide a clear, consistent, and legally binding process for **advance rulings on the tariff classification of goods**.
- Enable importers, exporters, and producers to obtain **predictable and reliable guidance** on how goods will be classified under the Canadian tariff system before importation.
- Ensure that rulings are based on accurate facts, consistent with current laws, and subject to review or modification where necessary.

This helps reduce uncertainty, supports compliance, and promotes fair trade practices by ensuring that classification decisions are transparent and justifiable.

### **3. Definitions**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 28).
- **"Advance ruling"**: A formal determination by a customs officer on the **tariff classification of goods** made under **paragraph 43.1(1)(c)** of the Act. It is not a decision on duties or taxes, but specifically on *how the goods are classified* under the Harmonized System (HS) codes.

### **4. Who Can Apply for an Advance Ruling?**

Any of the following individuals or entities may apply:

1. **Importers of goods in Canada**
2. **Persons authorized to account for goods** under:
   - Paragraph **32(6)(a)** or
   - Subsection **32(7)** of the Customs Act

---

### **5. Timing of Application**

- An application for an advance ruling must be submitted **not less than 120 days before** the proposed date of importation.
- This ensures sufficient time for the customs officer to review the application and issue a ruling before the goods are imported.

---

### **6. Language Requirements**

- Applications must be submitted in **English or French**, reflecting Canada’s official languages.

---

> This ensures that rulings are based on complete and accurate data.

---

### **8. Consistency in Rulings**

- Officers must provide **consistent rulings** for applications involving **identical or substantially similar facts and circumstances**.
- This promotes fairness and predictability in the application of tariff classification rules.

---

### **9. Format and Content of the Ruling**

- The officer must issue the advance ruling in **writing**.
- The ruling must be in the **same language** as the original application.
- The ruling must include **clear reasons** for the classification decision, enabling transparency and appeal if necessary.

### **10. Effectiveness and Scope of the Advance Ruling**

- The ruling applies to goods that are:

- The ruling becomes effective on the **date of issuance**, or on a **later date specified** in the ruling.

---

### **11. Binding Nature of the Ruling**

An advance ruling remains in effect and **binds the Minister** (i.e., the Minister of Finance or the relevant customs authority) if **all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **No material change** in:
   - The facts,
   - The circumstances, or
   - Canadian laws on which the ruling is based.
2. The person who received the ruling has **acted in accordance** with it.

### **12. Postponement of Ruling Issuance**

An officer may **postpone issuing** an advance ruling if there is a risk that a subsequent process will affect the classification decision, including:

- A **verification** under **Section 42.01** of the Act,
- A **review, re-determination, or further re-determination** of tariff classification under **Sections 59, 60, or 61**,
- A **hearing before the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** or any court.

> This prevents premature rulings that could be invalidated or overturned by later administrative or judicial proceedings.

---

### **13. Declining or Postponing a Ruling**

An officer may **decline to issue** an advance ruling if:

- The applicant fails to provide **supplementary information** within the required 30-day period.
- It is **impractical or unreasonable** to provide a ruling prior to the proposed date of importation (e.g., due to lack of data or evolving facts).

---

### **14. Modification or Revocation of an Advance Ruling**

An advance ruling may be **modified or revoked** under the following circumstances:

1. Based on an **error of fact** or **incorrect tariff classification**.

---

### **15. Effect of Modification or Revocation**

- A modification or revocation applies to goods:
  - That are the subject of the original ruling,
  - And that are imported **on or after the effective date** of the modification or revocation.

- If the modification or revocation:
  - Is **to the detriment** of the person who received the ruling, **and** that person has **not acted in accordance** with the original ruling, OR
  - Is **to the benefit** of the person who received the ruling,

> Then it applies to goods imported **before** the effective date of the modification or revocation.

> This protects parties who relied on the original ruling and ensures fairness in cases of adverse changes.

---

### **17. Postponement of Effective Date (Good Faith Reliance)**

  - **Postpone** the effective date of the modification or revocation,
  - For a period **not exceeding 90 days**.

> This protects legitimate business decisions and prevents financial or operational harm due to a later correction.

- The officer must provide **written notice** of any such postponement.
