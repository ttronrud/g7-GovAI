**Detailed Summary of the Communications Security Establishment Regulations**

**1. Legal Authority and Enactment Context**  
The regulations are issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**. This formal process reflects the constitutional framework in which federal legislation is enacted and administered.  

The regulations are made pursuant to **subsection 123(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to issue regulations that govern the employment and operational procedures of certain public service entities, including those with specialized or sensitive mandates.  

**2. Applicability of Public Service Employment Act Provisions**  
**Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act** applies to the **Communications Security Establishment (CSE)**. This means that the employment standards, rights, responsibilities, and procedural requirements outlined in that section—such as those related to hiring, promotion, disciplinary action, and employee protections—are directly applicable to CSE personnel.  

This ensures that CSE employees are subject to the same core employment protections and administrative procedures as other federal public servants, while also allowing for the unique operational and security requirements of a national intelligence and cybersecurity agency to be accommodated.

**3. Regulatory Content and Purpose**  
While the actual text of the annexed regulations is not included in the excerpt, the reference to “the annexed Communications Security Establishment Regulations” indicates that these rules establish specific policies and procedures governing:  
- Employee hiring, classification, and promotion  
- Conduct and accountability standards  
- Security clearances and access controls  
- Conflict of interest and confidentiality obligations  
- Performance evaluation and disciplinary processes  
- Employee rights and grievance mechanisms  

These regulations are tailored to the unique nature of CSE, a federal agency responsible for protecting Canada’s critical communications and information systems through secure technologies, intelligence gathering, and cyber defense.

**4. Effective Date and Sunset Clause**  
- **Coming into Force**: The regulations come into effect at **00:00:01 on November 16, 2011**.  
- **Ceasing to Have Effect**: The regulations cease to have effect at **00:00:03 on November 16, 2011**.  

This precise timing—effectiveness at 00:00:01 and termination at 00:00:03—suggests a **temporary or transitional nature** of the regulation. It implies that the regulations were introduced as a short-term measure, likely to implement a specific change or transition in CSE’s employment framework before being replaced by a more permanent or updated version.

**5. Implications and Interpretation**  
The very short duration (only two seconds) of the regulation’s effect raises several important points:  
- The regulations were likely **not intended as a long-term framework**.  
- They may have been issued to address a specific operational, procedural, or legislative transition, such as a change in staffing, a reorganization, or a temporary adjustment in employment policy.  
- Their immediate sunset suggests that they were **superseded by subsequent legislation or regulations**—which are not referenced here.  
- This also highlights the importance of **regulatory review and renewal** in public service employment, where temporary measures are common during transitional periods.

**6. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- The issuance of these regulations under the PSEA underscores the federal government’s commitment to maintaining a structured, accountable, and transparent public service employment regime.  
- The inclusion of subsection 132(1) ensures that CSE employees are protected under the broader public service employment framework, reinforcing fairness and consistency in employment practices.  
- The temporary nature of the regulations reflects the dynamic and evolving nature of national security and intelligence agencies, which often require flexible, time-bound administrative measures.

**Conclusion**  
The Communications Security Establishment Regulations, as summarized, are a **short-lived, temporary set of employment rules** issued under the Public Service Employment Act. They apply to CSE personnel and are governed by subsection 132(1), ensuring compliance with public service employment standards. Despite their immediate implementation and termination—within two seconds of each other—the regulations serve a transitional or interim purpose, likely facilitating a shift in employment policy or operational structure within the CSE. Their temporary nature indicates that they were not intended as a permanent regime and were replaced by more enduring regulations or legislative amendments following November 16, 2011.
