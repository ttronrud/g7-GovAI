**Detailed Summary of the Name Use (Affiliates of Banks or Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Name Use (Affiliates of Banks or Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* are a set of Canadian regulatory rules established under the *Bank Act* (the "Act") to govern how certain financial entities affiliated with banks or bank holding companies may use names and identifying marks. These regulations aim to prevent public confusion between deposits and other types of liabilities, particularly to protect depositors and maintain transparency in financial markets.

These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific provisions in the *Bank Act* — specifically **section 978a** and **subsection 983(18)b** — and came into force on **May 19, 2008**, following the enactment of the *Act to amend the law governing financial institutions* (S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 129(8)).

---

### **Key Purpose**

To ensure that entities affiliated with banks or bank holding companies do **not mislead the public** into believing that instruments issued by them are deposits or that liabilities incurred by them are deposits — which could compromise deposit insurance, consumer protection, and market integrity.

---

### **Applicability**

The rules apply to **entities affiliated with a bank** or a **bank holding company**, provided the entity meets certain conditions. Affiliation is broadly interpreted to include subsidiaries, affiliates, or other related entities under common control.

However, **the rules do not apply** to certain types of entities that are already regulated or operate in distinct sectors (e.g., insurance, cooperatives, securities).

---

### **Conditions for Application**

An entity is subject to the name use restrictions **only if it meets all of the following conditions**:

#### **1. Does Not Engage in Deposit-Liability Business in Canada**
- The entity **does not accept deposits** in Canada.
- This means it cannot operate as a depository institution (such as a credit union, savings bank, or trust company) that takes money from the public as deposits.

#### **2. Does Not Misrepresent Instruments as Deposits**
- The entity **must not represent to the public** that any instrument it issues (e.g., bonds, notes, loans) is a **deposit**.
- Nor may it suggest that any liability it incurs (e.g., through borrowing) is a **deposit**.

> *Example*: If a company issues a note or bond and says "This is a deposit," it violates this rule.

#### **3. Disclosure Requirement (If Engaging in Financial Services and Borrowing)**
If the entity:
- Provides financial services as part of its business, **and**
- Borrows money in Canada:
  - Through the **issuance of instruments in denominations of less than $150,000**, or
  - By **borrowing from a person in an amount of less than $150,000**

Then it must **disclose** the following in a relevant document:
- It is **not a member institution** of the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**;
- The liability incurred through the borrowing is **not a deposit**;
- It is **not regulated as a financial institution** in Canada.

> *Note*: This disclosure must be included in:
> - A **prospectus**, **information circular**, or **offering document** related to the borrowing, **or**
> - A **statement delivered directly to the lender**, if no such offering document exists.

### **Exemptions**

Several types of entities are **exempt** from these name and disclosure rules:

#### **Exempt Entities (Full Exemption from Conditions)**

| Type of Entity | Reason |
|---------------|--------|
| **Trusts or loan corporations** incorporated under federal or provincial law | Already regulated under separate frameworks; not considered financial institutions in the deposit sense. |
| **Associations covered under the Cooperative Credit Associations Act** | Cooperatives with specific regulatory status; operate under cooperative principles. |
| **Cooperative credit societies** incorporated and regulated under provincial law | Operate as cooperatives with distinct governance and deposit structures. |

#### **Exempt Entities (No Need for Disclosure in Paragraph 1(c))**

| Type of Entity | Reason |
|---------------|--------|
| **Insurance companies** or **fraternal benefit societies** (federal or provincial) | Operate in the insurance sector, not in deposit-taking. |
| **Insurance holding companies** | Regulated under insurance law, not banking law. |
| Entities **controlled by or substantially invested in by an insurance holding company** | Protected under insurance regulatory frameworks. |
| Entities **primarily engaged in dealing in securities** (e.g., portfolio management, investment counselling) | Engaged in securities trading, not deposit-taking. |

> These exemptions reflect the principle that different financial sectors have different regulatory regimes and that misrepresentation risks are not equally applicable across all financial activities.

### **Exemptions for Pre-Existing Names or Marks**

The name or identifying mark rules **do not apply** if:

- The name or mark was **already used** by the entity or an affiliated entity **before** the bank or bank holding company adopted it.
- The name or mark was used in the **corporate name** or in a **business name** under which the entity or affiliate operates.

> *Example*: If a company called "First Financial Services Inc." had been using that name for 20 years before a bank acquired it, the bank can use that name without triggering disclosure or restriction rules.

Similarly, **identifying marks** (logos, symbols, etc.) used previously by the entity or its affiliates are **not subject to restriction**.

> This prevents unnecessary disruption to established brand identities and business continuity.

---

### **Regulatory Framework and Legal Basis**

- The rules are derived from **section 983(4)(b)** and **subsection 983(5.3)** of the *Bank Act*, which impose obligations on affiliated entities.
- **Subsections 983(8) and (9.1)** apply to entities affiliated with **bank holding companies**.
- The regulations clarify **when and how** these obligations apply, particularly in relation to name usage and public disclosures.

---

### **Effective Date and Repeal**

- The regulations **came into force on May 19, 2008**, upon the coming into force of **section 129 of S.C. 2007, c. 6** (the *Act to amend the law governing financial institutions*).
- There is a **repeal clause** indicating that these regulations are not intended to be permanent; they are temporary and may be amended or replaced as regulatory frameworks evolve.

> *Note*: As of May 19, 2008, these regulations were in force (confirmed by SI/2008-58).

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prevent Misrepresentation** | Stops entities from misleading the public into thinking their obligations are deposits, which could lead to misuse of CDIC insurance. |
| **Protect Depositors** | Ensures that only CDIC-insured institutions can claim deposit protection. |
| **Promote Transparency** | Requires clear disclosure when entities borrow or issue instruments, especially if those instruments are below $150,000. |
| **Support Financial Sector Clarity** | Differentiates between deposit-taking institutions and other financial service providers (e.g., lenders, insurers, investment firms). |
| **Avoid Unnecessary Burden** | Exempts well-regulated or non-deposit-taking entities (e.g., insurers, cooperatives) from restrictive rules. |

---

### **Practical Example**

Suppose a company named "BankTrust Ltd." is a non-deposit-taking financial services firm that provides advisory services and borrows $100,000 from a private investor.

- It is **not** a member of CDIC.
- It does **not** accept deposits.
- It issues a promissory note to the investor.

**Under these regulations:**
- It must **disclose** in the borrowing agreement or offering document that:
  - It is not a CDIC member;
  - The liability is not a deposit;
  - It is not regulated as a financial institution in Canada.

If it fails to do so, it could be considered to have misrepresented its financial structure — a violation of the rules.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Name Use (Affiliates of Banks or Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* are a targeted, risk-based regulatory tool designed to:

- Prevent public confusion between deposits and other liabilities;
- Strengthen consumer protection by ensuring transparency;
- Maintain the integrity of the deposit insurance system (CDIC);
- Provide reasonable flexibility by exempting well-regulated or non-deposit-taking entities.

They reflect a balance between regulatory oversight and operational practicality, ensuring that affiliated entities do not exploit the public’s trust in banking and deposit insurance without proper disclosure.

These regulations remain a key component of Canada’s financial institution regulatory framework, particularly in safeguarding the stability and trustworthiness of the financial system.
