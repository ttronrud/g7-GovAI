**Detailed Summary of the Gillam Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Gillam Airport Zoning Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. These regulations were enacted to manage land use and development around **Gillam Airport**, located in the vicinity of Gillam, Manitoba. The purpose is to ensure aviation safety by restricting structures, vegetation, and waste disposal near the airport, particularly in areas that could interfere with aircraft operations during takeoff, landing, or approach.

The regulations were formally published in multiple official and local media outlets (Canada Gazette Part I, Nickel Belt News, and La Liberté) between March 20 and April 2, 1993, to provide a reasonable opportunity for public comment before final adoption. Following this public consultation, the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, issued the regulations under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

### **Key Definitions and Components**

The regulations define several key geographic and technical terms used throughout:

1. **Airport**  
   Refers to Gillam Airport in the vicinity of Gillam, Manitoba.

2. **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**  
   A fixed reference point located on the centerline of runway 05–23, **762 meters from the threshold of runway 05**.  
   - **Elevation**: 144.4 meters above sea level.  
   - This point serves as the origin for measuring distances and elevations in all zoning components.

3. **Approach Surfaces**  
   Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 05–23).  
   - **For runway 05 approach**:  
     - Slope: 1 meter vertically to 40 meters horizontally (1:40).  
     - Rises to a horizontal line 3,000 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.  
     - Outer ends of this line are 525 meters from the runway centerline.  
     - The horizontal line is 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end.  
   - **For runway 23 approach**:  
     - Identical slope and geometry to the 05 approach.  
   - These surfaces define the maximum allowable height for structures during aircraft approach phases.

4. **Outer Surface**  
   An imaginary horizontal plane set at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the airport reference point (144.4 m = 189.4 m above sea level)**.  
   - However, if this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe requirements.  
   - This surface defines the upper limit for structures in the outer perimeter of the airport zone.

5. **Strip**  
   The active landing area of the airport associated with runway 05–23:  
   - **Width**: 150 meters (75 meters on each side of the centerline).  
   - **Length**: 1,644 meters (from threshold to threshold).  
   - This is the primary operational zone where aircraft take off and land.

6. **Transitional Surfaces**  
   Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until they intersect with the outer surface.  
   - Slope: 1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally (1:7).  
   - These surfaces serve as a buffer zone between the active runway area and the outer surface, ensuring a gradual transition in height.

7. **Applicable Land Area**  
   All land, including public road allowances, located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, as defined in **Part VI of the schedule**.  
   - The outer boundary of this zone is a **circle with a 4,000-meter radius**, centered on the airport reference point.

### **Core Provisions and Restrictions**

#### **1. Height Limitations on Structures**
- **No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This means that any structure—whether new or an addition to an existing one—must remain below the defined height limits at every point along its vertical extent. The restrictions apply even to minor structures such as signs, antennas, or sheds.

#### **2. Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows to a height that exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or lessee of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that natural growth does not create hazards during aircraft approaches or landings due to obstruction or wind turbulence.

#### **3. Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**
- No owner or lessee may allow any part of the regulated land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird strikes, which pose a significant safety risk to aircraft operations.

### **Geographic and Planning Basis**

All zoning elements are derived from **Gillam Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2854**, dated **November 8, 1990**, which provides the official map and technical specifications for the airport’s layout and surrounding zones.

- The **airport reference point**, approach surfaces, strip, transitional surfaces, and outer boundary are all precisely defined on this plan and referenced in the schedule.
- The plan serves as both a **technical blueprint** and a **legal foundation** for the regulation.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: To prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting vertical and horizontal encroachments near the runway.
2. **Consistency with Aviation Standards**: To align with internationally recognized standards for airport zoning (e.g., ICAO and Canadian aviation guidelines) regarding approach surfaces and buffer zones.
3. **Environmental Protection**: To reduce bird-related hazards by restricting waste disposal that attracts birds.
4. **Public Participation and Transparency**: The prior publication in multiple media ensured public awareness and opportunity for stakeholder input.

### **Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Applicability** | All land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point |

| **Natural Vegetation** | Excessive growth must be removed if it exceeds defined surfaces |
| **Waste Disposal** | Prohibited if it attracts or feeds birds |
| **Legal Authority** | Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act |
| **Enforcement** | By the Minister of Transport; enforcement may include orders to remove structures or vegetation |

### **Conclusion**

The *Gillam Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for land use around Gillam Airport. By defining clear height limits, managing natural growth, and restricting bird-attractive waste, the regulations significantly enhance aviation safety and operational efficiency. The rules are grounded in a detailed, map-based plan and are designed to balance community development with the need for safe and uninterrupted air traffic operations.

These regulations remain a critical component of Canada’s aviation safety infrastructure and serve as a model for similar airport zoning efforts in rural and regional communities.
