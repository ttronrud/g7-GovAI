**Detailed Summary of the Prescribed Classes of Persons in Respect of Diversion of Imported Goods Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations are part of the Canadian *Customs Act* framework and are designed to address the issue of **diversion of imported goods** — specifically, when imported goods are incorrectly classified due to a failure to properly account for them under the Act.

The regulation is rooted in a public announcement made on **October 27, 1997**, which served as a formal notice of proposed rules. Because this announcement was made under the authority of **paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a of the Customs Act**, the regulations are **not required to be published in the Canada Gazette** under **subsection 164(3)** of the Act. This is a procedural exemption that allows certain regulatory instruments to be issued without full public notice when they are based on a prior public announcement.

### **2. Legislative Authority**

The regulations are made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**, under two specific provisions of the *Customs Act*:

- **Subsection 32.2(2)c** of the *Customs Act*  
- **Paragraph 164(1)(i)d** of the *Customs Act*

These provisions grant the Minister and the Governor General the authority to prescribe classes of persons who may be subject to specific rules regarding the diversion of imported goods when a declaration of tariff classification is incorrect.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **identify and define specific classes of persons** who may be held accountable or affected when there is a **failure in the proper accounting or classification of imported goods** — particularly when such failure results in an incorrect tariff classification under **section 32.2** of the *Customs Act*.

This is especially relevant in cases where goods are **diverted** (i.e., moved or sold outside of the intended or authorized channel) after they have been officially accounted for in customs records.

### **4. Definition of "Prescribed Classes of Persons"**

The regulations prescribe two distinct classes of persons who are subject to the rules under **section 32.2** of the *Customs Act* when a declaration of tariff classification is rendered incorrect due to a failure referred to in **subsection 32.2(6)** of the Act.

These classes are:

#### **Class 1: Persons Who Purchase or Otherwise Acquire the Imported Goods After Accounting**
- Any individual or entity that **purchases** or **otherwise acquires** (e.g., through leasing, borrowing, or other means) the imported goods **after** the goods have been officially accounted for under any of the following subsections of the *Customs Act*:
  - **Subsection 32(1)** – Goods are accounted for upon entry into Canada
  - **Subsection 32(3)** – Goods are accounted for upon re-export or transfer
  - **Subsection 32(5)** – Goods are accounted for upon sale or disposal

> This class includes buyers who obtain the goods after customs has already recorded their entry or movement.

#### **Class 2: Persons Who Sell or Otherwise Dispose of the Imported Goods After Accounting**
- Any individual or entity that **sells** or **otherwise disposes of** (e.g., through resale, donation, destruction, or transfer) the imported goods **after** the goods have been officially accounted for under:
  - **Subsection 32(1)**
  - **Subsection 32(3)**
  - **Subsection 32(5)**

> This class includes sellers or third parties who remove the goods from the supply chain after customs has completed its accounting process.

### **5. Key Legal Provisions Referenced**

- **Section 32.2 of the Customs Act**: Establishes the rules for dealing with incorrect tariff classifications, including the liability of persons involved in the diversion of goods.
- **Subsection 32.2(6)**: Specifies the types of failures (e.g., failure to account for goods) that trigger the application of the rules under section 32.2.
- **Paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a**: Provides an exemption from the requirement to publish regulations in the Canada Gazette if they are based on a prior public announcement.
- **Paragraph 164(1)(i)d**: Grants the authority to prescribe classes of persons under the Act.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on January 1, 1998**. This date marks the beginning of their legal application and enforcement within the Canadian customs system.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- **Clarity in Accountability**: The regulations clearly define who is considered a "person" who may be involved in the diversion of goods after customs has accounted for them. This helps customs authorities identify and pursue liability when incorrect classifications occur.
- **Prevention of Fraud and Misclassification**: By targeting individuals or entities who acquire or dispose of goods after accounting, the rules help prevent tax evasion, misrepresentation, or improper use of imported goods.
- **Enforcement Tool**: These prescribed classes serve as a legal basis for customs officers to assess penalties, recover duties, or take enforcement actions when goods are diverted improperly.
- **Procedural Efficiency**: The regulation avoids the need for full publication in the Canada Gazette due to its origin in a public announcement, streamlining the regulatory process.

### **8. Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations identify two types of people who can be held responsible when imported goods are incorrectly classified after customs has already recorded their entry or movement:

1. **Buyers** who purchase the goods after customs has officially accounted for them.
2. **Sellers or disposers** who sell or otherwise get rid of the goods after customs has accounted for them.

If a classification error occurs due to a failure to properly account for the goods (as defined in section 32.2(6)), these persons may be subject to the rules and consequences under section 32.2 of the *Customs Act*.

The rules were issued on **October 27, 1997**, based on a public announcement, and became effective on **January 1, 1998**.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation strengthens the integrity of Canada’s customs classification system by clearly defining who is responsible when imported goods are diverted after customs has completed its accounting. It ensures that both buyers and sellers are held accountable for actions that could lead to incorrect tariff declarations and potential revenue loss. The regulation is a practical and legally sound mechanism to enforce compliance with customs procedures and protect the interests of the Canadian government.
