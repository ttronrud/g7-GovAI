It appears that you've started a request to provide a detailed summary of a regulation, but the actual regulation text or content was not included in your message. Could you please provide the specific regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the full text or details of the regulation (e.g., a law, rule, policy, or executive order), I will be happy to deliver a comprehensive, clear, and accurate summary covering its purpose, key provisions, scope, applicable entities, enforcement mechanisms, and any relevant implications. 

Please paste the regulation text or link to the document when ready.
