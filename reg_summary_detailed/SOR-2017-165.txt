## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Certificate of Supplementary Protection Regulations**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The **Certificate of Supplementary Protection Regulations (CSPR)** were introduced by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, pursuant to specific provisions in the **Patent Act**:

- **Paragraphs 12(1)(g)a, (h)b, and (k)b**  
- **Subsection 134(1)c**

These provisions allow for the granting of **supplementary protection certificates (SPCs)** to pharmaceutical patents — a mechanism designed to compensate for the time lost during regulatory approval processes (e.g., for drugs) before a patent can be commercialized.

> **Objective**: To extend the effective term of a patent for medicinal products that have undergone lengthy regulatory review, thereby incentivizing innovation in drug development.

### **2. Regulatory Framework and Citation**
- **Primary Statute**: *Patent Act* (Act)
- **Citations**:
  - S.C. 2017, c. 6, s. 34(2)  
  - R.S., c. 33 (3rd Supp.), s. 3  
  - S.C. 2017, c. 6, s. 59  
  - R.S., c. P-4  

These regulations implement **section 104 to 122** of the *Patent Act*, particularly focusing on **section 106**, which governs the issuance of SPCs.

## 🔧 Key Definitions and Interpretations

### **(1) Authorization for Sale**
- Defined as an authorization under the **Food and Drugs Act** (or its predecessors) that permits the **sale of a drug in Canada**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Interim orders under section 30.1 of the Food and Drugs Act
  - Certificates under section C.08.015 of the *Food and Drug Regulations*
  - Exemptions under C.10.002(1) or C.10.008(1)
  - Authorizations under C.05.006, C.05.008, C.08.010, C.11.003(1), or C.11.014(1)
  - Section 67 or 71 of the *Natural Health Products Regulations*
  - Section 21 or subsection 24(2) of the *Clinical Trials for Medical Devices and Drugs Relating to COVID-19 Regulations*

> **Key Point**: Only **full marketing authorizations** (e.g., notices of compliance) qualify. Temporary or conditional authorizations do not.

---

### **(2) Prescribed Variations (Under Section 105(3) & (4))**
These define what constitutes a "variation" of a medicinal ingredient that may still fall within the same patent claim for SPC purposes.

Allowed variations include:
- **Chemical modifications**:
  - Ester, salt, complex, chelate, or non-covalent derivative
- **Stereochemical changes**:
  - Enantiomer or mixture of enantiomers
- **Crystalline or solvate forms**:
  - Solvate or polymorph
- **Post-translational modifications**:
  - In vivo or in vitro modifications (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation)

> **Note**: Any combination of these variations is also acceptable.

> **Implication**: A drug's chemical form can be changed without invalidating the patent claim if it falls within these defined variations.

---

### **(3) Prescribed Requirement (Section 106(1)(a))**
- The **patent must be in force** at the time of application.
- This means the patent must be valid, not expired, and not revoked.

---

### **(4) Prescribed Manners of Patent Pertinence (Section 106(1)(c))**
For a patent to qualify for an SPC, it must cover one of the following:

| Type of Claim | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Ingredient Claim** | Covers the medicinal ingredient or combination of ingredients in a drug approved for sale |
| **Process Claim** | Covers the ingredient obtained via a specified manufacturing process and included in a drug with an authorization for sale |
| **Use Claim** | Covers the use of the ingredient or combination in a drug with an authorization for sale |

> **Note**: The claim must be directly linked to the drug for which the authorization for sale was issued.

---

### **(5) Prescribed Authorization for Sale (Section 106(1)(c))**
- Must be a **Notice of Compliance** issued under:
  - **Section C.08.004** or **C.08.004.01** of the *Food and Drug Regulations*

> This ensures that only finalized, legally valid marketing approvals are eligible.

---

### **(6) Minister’s Consultation Rights**
- The Minister may consult with **Patent Office officers or employees** regarding any matter related to:
  - A patent listed in an SPC
  - An application for an SPC

> This provides transparency and technical oversight in the review process.

---

### **(7) Prescribed Countries and Filing Timelines (Section 106(1)(f))**

| Country/Region | Filing Period for SPC Application |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **EU and EU member states** | 24 months — **if** the original SPC application was filed **no later than the first anniversary** of the day the *Canada–EU CETA Implementation Act* came into force |
| **All other countries** (e.g., USA, Australia, Japan, UK, Switzerland) | 12 months |

> **Key Trigger**: The 24-month period applies only when the application was filed **on or before the first anniversary** of the *CETA Implementation Act* coming into force (which occurred on **April 1, 2018**).

> **Note**: The 12-month period applies to all other cases, including applications filed after that date.

---

### **(8) Prescribed Period for Filing the SPC Application (Section 106(3))**
- The applicant must file the SPC application within **120 days** of the date of the **authorization for sale** (notice of compliance).

   - The applicant is either:
     - The **patentee** recorded in the Patent Office, or
     - The **manufacturer authorized under section 8** to file the application
4. **Attestation that**:
   - When the authorization for sale was filed, **no equivalent marketing approval** had been submitted in a **prescribed country** (EU, USA, Australia, Japan, Switzerland, UK), **OR**
