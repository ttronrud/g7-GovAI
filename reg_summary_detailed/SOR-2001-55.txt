**Detailed Summary of the Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under two specific provisions of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*:

- **Section 503.1a** of the Act — which provides the legal authority for the regulation of supervisory information.
- **Paragraph 531(a)** of the Act — which enables the regulation to prescribe what constitutes "supervisory information" for trust and loan companies.

These regulations were originally enacted as part of **S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 144**, and were previously referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 45**. The regulations were later amended or repealed in part (a section was repealed by **SOR/2011-196, s. 33**), indicating periodic updates to reflect evolving supervisory needs.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and protect sensitive supervisory information** held by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (or equivalent regulatory body) regarding trust and loan companies. The regulations establish what constitutes **prescribed supervisory information**, and set out **rules governing when and how such information may be disclosed**, ensuring that confidential regulatory data is not improperly shared with the public or third parties.

### **Prescribed Supervisory Information (Section 1)**

For the purposes of **Section 503.1 of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**, the following information is classified as **prescribed supervisory information** and is strictly protected:

#### 1. **Financial Condition Ratings**
- Any rating assigned by the Superintendent to assess the financial health of the company.
- Any other rating that is **substantially based on information obtained from the Superintendent** (e.g., internal risk assessments, stress tests, capital adequacy evaluations).

> *Rationale:* These ratings are critical for assessing the stability and risk profile of the company and are used by regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to evaluate systemic risk.

#### 2. **Stage of Intervention**
- Any stage of intervention assigned to the company under the **Guide to Intervention for Federal Financial Institutions**.
- This includes classifications such as "early warning," "monitoring," "intervention," or "liquidation," depending on the severity of financial distress.

> *Rationale:* This helps identify the level of regulatory engagement and signals potential risks to the financial system.

#### 3. **Regulatory Orders, Agreements, or Directions**
- Any **order** made under **subsection 473(3)** of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (e.g., cease-and-desist orders).
- Any **prudential agreement** entered into by the company under **Section 506.1** (e.g., capital adequacy or liquidity agreements).
- Any **direction** issued under **Section 507** (e.g., operational or financial directives to improve governance or compliance).

> *Rationale:* These represent formal regulatory actions that may impact the company’s operations, governance, or financial structure.

#### 4. **Supervisory Reports and Recommendations**
- Any report prepared by or at the request of the Superintendent.
- Any recommendation made by the Superintendent following:
  - Annual or special examinations.
  - Other supervisory reviews (e.g., stress testing, internal controls audits).
- Includes **correspondence** between the Superintendent and the company’s directors, officers, or employees.

> *Rationale:* These documents provide detailed insights into regulatory findings, compliance gaps, and performance issues.

#### 5. **Deposit Insurance Premiums (Repealed Section)**
- Previously included:
  - The **category** under which the company is classified under the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Differential Premiums By-law**.
  - The **premium rate** assigned to the company.
  - The **annual premium** determined for the company.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This section was **repealed by SOR/2011-196, s. 33**, meaning that **CDIC premium classifications and rates are no longer considered supervisory information** under these regulations. This reflects a shift in regulatory focus or policy, possibly due to changes in deposit insurance governance or transparency requirements.

### **Supervisory Information for Affiliates (Section 2)**

If a company has an **affiliate** (a related entity under common control), the regulations specify that certain **affiliate-specific supervisory information** may also be considered supervisory information, depending on the type of affiliate:

| Affiliate Type | Applicable Regulation |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Bank (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations* |
| Authorized Foreign Bank (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* |
| Cooperative Credit Association (subject to Cooperative Credit Associations Act) | *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* |
| Insurance Company (subject to Insurance Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations* |
| Bank Holding Company (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* |
| Insurance Holding Company (subject to Insurance Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* |

> *Rationale:* This ensures that supervisory information about affiliated institutions is governed consistently with their respective regulatory regimes, maintaining oversight integrity across the financial group.

---

### **Disclosure Prohibitions and Exceptions**

#### **General Prohibition (Section 3)**
- A company **shall not directly or indirectly disclose** any information referred to in Section 1 (the prescribed supervisory information).
- This includes **public disclosure**, **media releases**, **shareholder communications**, or **third-party sharing** without proper authorization.

> *Purpose:* To protect sensitive regulatory assessments and prevent misuse or misinterpretation of internal evaluations.

#### **Permitted Disclosure (Section 4)**
A company **may disclose** the prescribed supervisory information under the following conditions:

1. **To Affiliates, Directors, Officers, Employees, Auditors, Securities Underwriters, or Legal Advisors** —  
   - Disclosure is allowed **only if** the company ensures that the information **remains confidential**.
   - This includes internal use by management, board members, or external advisors involved in compliance or governance.

2. **To Disclose Material Facts or Changes (Paragraph 1(1)(c))**  
   - A company or its affiliate **may disclose** information under paragraph 1(1)(c) (specifically, information related to ratings, interventions, or orders) **if**:
     - The information contains a **material fact** or **material change**.
     - Such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., Canadian securities laws under the *Securities Act* or provincial equivalents).

> *Rationale:* This balances the need for regulatory confidentiality with the public interest in transparency, especially when material financial or operational changes affect investors or the market.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Canada Gazette.
- This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication, allowing regulatory bodies and financial institutions to adjust their internal policies and procedures accordingly.

### **Key Implications and Regulatory Significance**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Protects the integrity of supervisory assessments and prevents premature public exposure of financial vulnerabilities. |
| **Risk-Based Oversight** | Aligns with modern financial regulation by focusing on early warning signals (e.g., intervention stages, ratings). |
| **Affiliate Governance** | Ensures consistent application of supervisory standards across related entities. |
| **Transparency Balance** | Allows limited disclosure when required by securities laws, promoting investor protection without compromising regulatory discretion. |
| **Policy Evolution** | The repeal of the CDIC premium section shows regulatory adaptation — possibly due to increased transparency in deposit insurance or changes in risk assessment models. |
