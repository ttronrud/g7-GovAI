### 1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2014-857**

- The regulation formally **repeals (cancels)** Order in Council P.C. 2014-857, which was issued on June 26, 2014.  
- This prior order had likely established interim administrative or procedural arrangements related to the planning, approval, or implementation of the St. Lawrence Bridge project.  
- By repealing this order, the government removes any legal or procedural framework that was previously in place, signaling a shift to a new, more streamlined or finalized approach under the current legislation.  
- The repeal ensures that the project’s governance and decision-making are now aligned with the updated statutory framework provided by the *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act*.

### 2. **Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs**

- The regulation designates the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** as a **member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** specifically for the purposes of administering and overseeing the *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act*.  
- This designation is significant because:
  - It formally assigns the minister the authority to act as the **principal government representative** in matters related to the St. Lawrence Bridge project.
  - Membership in the Queen’s Privy Council grants the minister the legal standing to issue orders, make decisions, and represent the federal government in official capacities under the Act.
  - It ensures clear accountability and leadership for the project, with a dedicated minister responsible for its implementation and coordination.

### Purpose and Significance

- This regulation serves as a **governance update** to the St. Lawrence Bridge project, consolidating authority and removing outdated administrative structures.
- It reflects a commitment to **streamlining decision-making** and ensuring that the project is managed by a single, clearly defined point of responsibility within the federal government.
- The designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs underscores the importance of infrastructure development and intergovernmental coordination in the project’s success.

### Context

- The *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act* was enacted in 2014 to establish the legal and procedural framework for the construction of a new bridge across the St. Lawrence River, intended to improve transportation, economic development, and regional connectivity between Quebec and Ontario.
- The repeal of P.C. 2014-857 likely reflects a move from interim or transitional governance to a more permanent and legally robust structure under the new Act.

**In Summary:**

On November 4, 2015, the federal government, under the authority of Section 3 of the *New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Act*,  
- **repealed** the earlier Order in Council P.C. 2014-857, removing outdated administrative provisions;  
- **designated the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada to serve as the official minister responsible for the project under the Act.
