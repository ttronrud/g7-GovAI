### **3. Definitions and Taxable Items**

The regulation prescribes the following items as **taxable** under the Excise Tax Act:

#### **(a) Carbonated Beverages**
- All carbonated drinks (e.g., soda, soft drinks, sparkling water) are included in the taxable category.
- This includes both domestic and imported carbonated beverages sold in school cafeterias.

#### **(b) Beverages included in paragraph 1(d) of Part III of Schedule VI to the Act, when sold in cans, cartons, or bottles**

  - Milk
  - Juice
  - Tea
  - Coffee
  - Other non-alcoholic, non-carbonated drinks
- However, **only those beverages sold in specific packaging** (i.e., **cans, cartons, or bottles**) are subject to excise tax under this provision.
- **Key Limitation**: The tax applies **only when sold in these containers**. If such beverages are sold in bulk or in non-packaged forms (e.g., in dispensers), they may be excluded.

#### **(c) Foods included in any of paragraphs 1(e) to (l) of Part III of Schedule VI to the Act, when prepackaged for sale to consumers**
- Paragraphs 1(e) to (l) of Part III of Schedule VI generally include:
  - Canned or packaged meat and meat products
  - Canned or packaged fish
  - Canned or packaged vegetables
  - Canned or packaged fruit
  - Canned or packaged dairy products
  - Canned or packaged processed foods
- These foods are **only taxable when prepackaged** for sale to consumers.
- **School cafeteria sales** of these items are subject to excise tax **only if the food is sold in prepackaged form** (e.g., in individual portions, trays, or sealed containers), not if it is served in bulk or unboxed.

---

### **4. Key Exclusions and Conditions**

- The regulation **does not apply to**:
  - Beverages or foods sold in bulk or unpackaged form.
  - Items not listed in the relevant sections of Schedule VI.
  - Foods or beverages not sold in school cafeteria settings.
- The **packaging condition** (cans, cartons, bottles, or prepackaged) is a **critical determinant** of tax applicability.

---

### **5. Historical and Current Status**

- **Original Enactment**: 1990 (S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12)
- **Repeal**: SOR/2002-277, section 7
- **Status**: **Repealed and no longer in effect**.
- This means that **as of 2002**, the specific list of taxable school cafeteria foods and beverages defined in this regulation is **no longer valid**.
- The current excise tax regime on school cafeteria items may be governed by updated legislation or different provisions, possibly under revised schedules or new regulations.

---

### **6. Implications and Interpretation**

- This regulation was likely introduced to **target specific high-consumption, high-profit items** in school cafeterias (e.g., sugary drinks, processed snacks) for excise taxation.
- The focus on **packaged items** suggests a policy intent to tax consumption in a controlled, measurable way—particularly for items that are easily quantified and distributed.
- The repeal indicates that the government may have determined that:
  - The original list was outdated,
  - The tax policy had been superseded by broader or more effective measures,
  - Or that the specific school cafeteria tax was no longer necessary or equitable.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation was a **temporary, targeted administrative measure** under the Excise Tax Act to define which school cafeteria food and beverage items were subject to excise tax. It specifically included:

- All **carbonated beverages**,
- Certain **non-carbonated beverages** sold in **packaged form** (cans, cartons, bottles),
- Certain **processed or packaged foods** sold in **prepackaged form**.

However, the regulation is **now repealed** and **no longer in force**, meaning it has **no current legal effect**. Any current excise tax treatment of school cafeteria items would be governed by **updated legislation** or **other provisions** in the Excise Tax Act.

---

> ✅ **Bottom Line**:  
> This regulation is **historical and obsolete**. It was a temporary definition of taxable items in school cafeterias, but it has been **repealed since 2002** and is not applicable today.
