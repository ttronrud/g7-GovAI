**Detailed Summary of the Brokering Control List Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The Brokering Control List is established under **section 4.11a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, as amended by **S.C. 2018, c. 26, section 5**, and is promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**.

This regulation is part of Canada’s broader export control framework designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), missile technologies, and other items that could be used in acts of terrorism or aggression.

### **Purpose of the Brokering Control List**

The primary purpose of the Brokering Control List is to **extend export control measures to brokers** — individuals or entities that facilitate the movement of controlled goods and technologies — even when the actual transaction does not involve direct export or import. 

By including certain goods and technologies on this list, the government ensures that **any person acting as a broker** (including intermediaries, agents, or third-party facilitators) is subject to **strict oversight and licensing requirements** if they are involved in transactions involving items that could be used for malicious purposes.

This regulation strengthens Canada’s ability to **detect, monitor, and restrict** the flow of sensitive technologies and materials through indirect channels, especially those that may bypass direct export controls.

---

### **Scope of the Brokering Control List**

The List applies to **specific goods and technologies** identified in the **Export Control List (ECL)**, with certain conditions and exceptions. Specifically, the following categories are included:

#### **1. Goods and Technology in Groups 2 and 9 of the ECL Schedule**

- All items listed in **Groups 2 and 9** of the Schedule to the Export Control List are automatically included in the Brokering Control List.
- These groups typically cover:
  - **Chemical and biological weapons-related materials and equipment**
  - **Nuclear materials and related technologies**
  - **Radiological dispersal devices (e.g., "dirty bombs")**
  - **Missile-related components and systems**

> *Note: These groups are known for their high sensitivity and direct relevance to weapons of mass destruction.*

#### **2. Goods and Technologies in Groups 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the ECL**, **plus sub-items 5504(2)(d), (e), and (g)**

These items are included **only if**:
- Their **properties** (e.g., physical characteristics, performance capabilities) and/or
- Any **information made known to the broker** (such as technical specifications, end-use details, or intended recipient information)

would lead a **reasonable person to suspect** that the goods or technology could be used in one or more of the following activities:

##### **(a) Development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification, or dissemination of:**
- Chemical or biological weapons
- Nuclear explosive or radiological dispersal devices (e.g., "dirty bombs")
- Materials or equipment usable in such weapons or devices

##### **(b) Development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, or storage of:**
- Missiles or other delivery systems capable of delivering:
  - Chemical or biological weapons
  - Nuclear explosive or radiological dispersal devices
- Materials or equipment usable in such missiles or systems

##### **(c) Use in any facility** used for any of the activities described in (a) or (b)

> This means that even if the goods are not directly exported, a broker may be subject to control if there is a **reasonable suspicion** — based on the nature of the item and disclosed information — that it will be used in prohibited activities.

#### **3. Additional Inclusion Based on Ministerial Determination**

In addition to the above, the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** may include certain goods and technologies from Groups 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and sub-items 5504(2)(d), (e), and (g), **if the Minister determines** that:

- Based on the **properties** of the item and **additional information** (such as:
  - Intended end-use
  - Identity of the intermediary or final consignee
  - Conduct or history of the recipient or broker)

— there is a **likelihood** that the item will be used in the activities or facilities described in paragraph (b) above.

> This provision allows for **flexible, case-by-case decisions** based on intelligence, risk assessments, or emerging threats.

---

### **Effective Date and Enforcement Timeline**

- The Brokering Control List **comes into force** on the day that **Section 5 of S.C. 2018, c. 26** (the Act to amend the Export and Import Permits Act and the Criminal Code) comes into force.
- If the regulation is **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, it will instead come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the regulation is implemented in a timely manner, aligned with the broader legislative amendments that support Canada’s accession to the **Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)** and other international obligations.

---

### **Key Implications and Enforcement Considerations**

1. **Brokers Are Subject to Licensing Requirements**
   - Any individual or entity acting as a broker in transactions involving listed items must obtain an **export permit** or be otherwise authorized.
   - Brokers are required to **disclose relevant information** (e.g., end-use, end-user, recipient) to the Minister or relevant authorities.

2. **Reasonable Person Standard**
   - The determination of whether an item is included hinges on whether a **reasonable person** would suspect misuse — not on definitive proof of misuse.
   - This creates a **risk-based approach** to control, allowing proactive intervention.

3. **Broader Scope than Direct Export Controls**
   - Unlike traditional export controls that apply only to direct exporters or importers, this regulation extends controls to **intermediaries**, making it harder for prohibited technologies to move through unregulated channels.

4. **Alignment with International Obligations**
   - The regulation supports Canada’s commitments under the **Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)**, which emphasizes the need to regulate the trade of weapons and related technologies to prevent proliferation.
   - It strengthens Canada’s ability to act in coordination with international partners to combat WMD proliferation.

5. **Compliance and Monitoring**
   - Brokers must maintain records of all transactions involving listed goods and technologies.
   - The Minister may conduct audits or investigations to verify compliance.

### **Note on Enforcement and Updates**

- The regulation was **in force as of September 1, 2019**, as noted in **SI/2019-41** (Statutory Instrument 2019-41).
- The Brokering Control List is **subject to periodic review and update**, particularly as new technologies emerge or new threats are identified.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Brokering Control List** is a critical component of Canada’s export control regime, designed to **close loopholes** in the system by extending regulatory reach to brokers and intermediaries. By focusing on **risk-based criteria** and **reasonable suspicion**, it enables proactive enforcement while balancing legitimate trade needs.

It reflects Canada’s commitment to:
- Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
- Ensuring that sensitive technologies are not diverted to malicious users
- Complying with international obligations, especially under the Arms Trade Treaty

This regulation significantly enhances the effectiveness of Canada’s export controls in a complex, globalized trade environment where indirect trade routes are common.
