**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Forces Compulsory Early Superannuation Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
The *Canadian Forces Compulsory Early Superannuation Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence. This action is authorized under **Vote 56a of the Appropriation Act No. 7, 1964**. This legislative backing ensures that the regulations are within the established budgetary and policy framework of the Canadian government.

The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Canadian Forces Compulsory Early Superannuation Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

---

**2. Scope and Definitions**  
All terms and expressions used in these regulations are interpreted in accordance with their meaning in the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Act**. This ensures consistency and legal coherence with the broader superannuation framework governing military pension entitlements.

---

**3. Purpose and Context**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to **address the financial and pension implications for Canadian Forces personnel who are retired early due to force reductions** — specifically, reductions in the total number of military members — rather than due to personal performance issues or misconduct.

This provision recognizes that such early retirements may be a result of **organizational downsizing** (e.g., reductions in military establishment or personnel numbers), not individual shortcomings. The regulations aim to provide **greater pension equity** for those affected by such reductions.

**4. Key Provision – Eligibility for Extended Service Recognition**  
A contributor (i.e., a member of the Canadian Forces) who:

- Has served **ten or more years** in the forces,  
- Is **compulsorily retired before reaching the normal retirement age**,  
- And such retirement occurs **during a specific two-year period** beginning on **May 7, 1964**, and ending **two years thereafter (i.e., May 7, 1966)**,  
- Due to a **reduction in the total number of members of the forces**,  

**shall be deemed to have served 20 or more years** in the forces — for the purposes of **subsection (3) of section 10 of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act** — **if**:

1. The **Service Pension Board** determines that the retirement was:
   - **Due to a reduction in the total number of members of the forces**, specifically resulting from **reductions in the establishment of the regular forces** (i.e., a structural or administrative cutback),  
   - **Not due to**:
     - Inefficiency in the performance of duties,  
     - Misconduct, or  
     - A request made by the contributor (i.e., the individual voluntarily chose to retire).

**5. Impact on Pension Entitlements**  
Under normal circumstances, if a service member retires early and does not meet the full 20-year service requirement, they would be entitled to a **reduced annuity** under **clause (A) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c)** of subsection (3) of section 10 of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.

However, **this regulation modifies that outcome**. By deeming the service as equivalent to **20 or more years**, the contributor is treated as having met the full service threshold for pension purposes. As a result:

- They **would not be subject to the reduced annuity** under clause (A)(ii)(c),  
- And instead would be entitled to a **full or enhanced pension** based on the 20-year service standard.

This effectively **protects the pension value** of service members who were forced into early retirement due to force reductions, ensuring that their contributions are not penalized by the early retirement rules.

---

**6. Time Limit and Historical Context**  
The regulation applies **only to retirements occurring between May 7, 1964, and May 7, 1966**. This narrow timeframe reflects a specific historical event — likely tied to post-World War II military restructuring or post-1960s defense budget adjustments — when the Canadian government implemented significant reductions in military personnel.

This time-bound nature means the regulation is **not retroactive or general**, and only applies to those affected during that defined two-year window.

---

**7. Role of the Service Pension Board**  
The determination of whether a retirement was due to a force reduction is **not automatic**. It must be assessed and approved by the **Service Pension Board**. This ensures a fair and objective review of each case, based on evidence and official records.

The Board evaluates whether:
- The reduction in force was institutional (e.g., due to defense policy or establishment cuts),  
- The retirement was not a result of individual performance or personal choice.

This judicial-like review adds a layer of accountability and fairness in the application of the rule.

---

**8. Significance and Implications**  
- **Equity and Fairness**: The regulation prevents service members from being financially penalized for circumstances beyond their control (e.g., government-driven force reductions).  
- **Recognition of Service**: It acknowledges the long-term commitment of service members who retired early due to structural changes.  
- **Pension Protection**: By allowing the 20-year service benchmark to be met, it ensures a more generous and equitable pension outcome.  
- **Historical Relevance**: This regulation is a key example of how Canadian military pension policy has evolved to respond to changing defense needs and personnel management.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Canadian Forces Compulsory Early Superannuation Regulations* serve as a targeted, historically grounded measure to protect the pension rights of Canadian Forces members who were retired early due to government-driven reductions in military strength during a specific period (May 7, 1964 – May 7, 1966). By allowing such individuals to be deemed to have served 20 or more years, the regulations ensure they are not subject to reduced annuities under the standard early retirement provisions — thus promoting fairness, recognizing service, and reflecting the realities of military restructuring in the mid-20th century.

These regulations remain a significant precedent in the administration of military superannuation, illustrating how policy can adapt to historical circumstances while maintaining integrity in pension entitlements.
