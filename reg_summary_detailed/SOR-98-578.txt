### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation**

#### **1. Title and Issuing Authority**
- **Title**: Proclamation Declaring Applicability of the Government Corporations Operation Act to The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited
- **Issuing Body**: The Governor General of Canada, acting by and with the advice of the Privy Council for Canada
- **Issued By**: The Honourable William Ian Corneil Binnie, Deputy of the Governor General
- **Date of Issuance**: December 1, 1998
- **Place**: Ottawa, Canada

This document is a **legal proclamation** issued under the authority of the Crown, specifically through the Governor in Council, which is the formal mechanism by which the federal government makes decisions on matters of public policy and legislation.

#### **2. Legal Basis**
The proclamation is grounded in **Section 6 of the Government Corporations Operation Act (GCOA)**, which states that:
> The Act applies to a corporation only from the date of the issue of a proclamation by the Governor in Council declaring the Act to be applicable to that corporation.

This means that the GCOA does **not automatically apply** to all federal corporations. Instead, its application must be **explicitly declared** via a proclamation issued by the Governor in Council. This provision ensures that the application of the Act is deliberate, transparent, and legally justified.

#### **3. Subject of the Proclamation**
- **Corporation Involved**: *The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited*
- **Legal Status**: A corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)*
- **Ownership**: All issued shares are held by or in trust for **Her Majesty in right of Canada** — indicating that the corporation is a **federally owned entity**, not privately held.

This ownership structure is critical because it establishes the corporation as a **government-owned entity**, making it eligible for governance under the GCOA.
