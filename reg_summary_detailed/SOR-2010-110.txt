The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2010-110, s. 3]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Statutory Instrument No. 2010-110**, under section 3 of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  The regulation is no longer in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the repeal provision in **SOR/2010-110, section 3**.

- **SOR/2010-110**:  
  This is a **Statutory Instrument** (often referred to as a "regulation" or "order") issued under the authority of a federal or provincial statute. In this case, it is likely a **provincial regulation** under the jurisdiction of a Canadian province (e.g., Ontario, British Columbia, etc.), as SOR stands for "Statutory Rules" in provincial contexts.  
  (Note: Without the specific province or parent statute, the exact scope of the original regulation cannot be determined.)

- **Section 3 of SOR/2010-110**:  
  This section contains the **repeal clause** that formally removes the referenced regulation. It typically states that certain rules, by-laws, or provisions are canceled and no longer apply. The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Update or modernize legislation,
  - Eliminate outdated or redundant rules,
  - Align with new laws or policy objectives,
  - Address legal inconsistencies or administrative inefficiencies.

- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - Any legal obligations, requirements, or prohibitions previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
  - Entities or individuals who were previously subject to its provisions must now comply with **current, applicable laws** or regulations.
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or reform initiative.

- **Original Purpose (Inferred)**:
  Although the original content of the regulation is not provided, the fact that it was repealed suggests it may have governed a specific area such as:
  - Licensing or permits,
  - Environmental standards,
  - Workplace safety,
  - Vehicle or equipment use,
  - Public health or sanitation,
  - Building or zoning matters,
  - Or another area of regulatory oversight.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Since the original regulation has been **repealed**, it is **not currently enforceable** or available in legal databases. To understand what the regulation originally governed, one would need to consult the **text of the original regulation** (which is now archived or superseded) or the **parent statute** that authorized it.

### Conclusion:

The referenced regulation has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2010-110, section 3**. As such, it is **no longer in effect** and should not be relied upon for legal or compliance purposes. The repeal likely reflects a legislative update, streamlining, or replacement of outdated rules. For accurate, current regulatory information, refer to the **current version of the relevant statute or regulation**, which may now cover the same subject matter under different provisions.

🔍 **Recommendation**:  
To obtain the full context of what the repealed regulation governed, consult:
- The official government publication (e.g., Ontario's Laws website or the relevant provincial legislative database),
- The parent enabling statute (e.g., *Ontario Regulation of [Subject]*),
- Or the text of SOR/2010-110, which may include the original regulation's name and scope before repeal.

Without the specific province or parent legislation, a more detailed summary of the original regulation cannot be provided.
