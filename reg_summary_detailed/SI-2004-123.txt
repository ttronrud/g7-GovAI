**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, implements a significant reorganization of Canada’s public health governance structure under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Transfer of Control and Supervision**:
   - The **Population and Public Health Branch** of the **Department of Health** is transferred to the **Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**.
   - This transfer includes the **control and supervision** of all public service functions, personnel, operations, and responsibilities associated with that branch.
   - The branch previously operated under the Department of Health, which is a federal department responsible for health policy and services. The transfer marks a shift in administrative oversight to PHAC, a newly established agency designed to strengthen and streamline public health operations.

2. **Establishment of PHAC as a Central Public Health Authority**:
   - The regulation establishes the **Public Health Agency of Canada** as a distinct, independent federal agency responsible for leading and coordinating public health activities across Canada.
   - This move reflects a strategic effort to improve the efficiency, accountability, and responsiveness of Canada’s public health system by consolidating key functions under a single, dedicated agency.

3. **Appointment of the Minister of Health as Head of PHAC**:
   - The **Minister of Health** is formally designated as the **presiding officer** (or head) of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
   - This ensures that the agency remains accountable to the federal government and maintains a direct link to the broader health policy framework, while also allowing PHAC to operate with operational independence in day-to-day public health delivery and research.

4. **Effective Date**:
   - The transfer and the new responsibilities of the Minister of Health take effect on **September 24, 2004**.
   - This date marks the official operational start of the Public Health Agency of Canada as a fully functional entity with its new mandate.

### Purpose and Significance:

- The reorganization aims to:
  - Improve coordination and decision-making in public health matters.
  - Enhance the agency’s capacity to respond to public health emergencies (e.g., disease outbreaks, environmental health risks).
  - Strengthen the scientific and evidence-based approach to public health policy.
  - Provide a more focused and specialized structure for public health services, moving away from the broader administrative scope of the Department of Health.

### Legal Authority:

- The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to transfer parts of public service functions between departments or agencies, particularly when it serves the public interest or improves administrative efficiency.

**Conclusion**:

This regulation represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of Canada’s public health governance. By transferring the Population and Public Health Branch from the Department of Health to the newly formed Public Health Agency of Canada, and by appointing the Minister of Health as its head, the government established a more focused, responsive, and accountable public health agency. Effective September 24, 2004, PHAC became the central federal body responsible for public health policy, surveillance, and response, laying the foundation for its future role in protecting and promoting the health of Canadians.
