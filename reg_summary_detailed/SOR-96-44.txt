## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Duties Relief Regulations**

### 🔹 **Regulatory Background and Legal Basis**

- **Issuance Authority**:  
  The regulations were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under specific provisions of the *Customs Tariff* and related statutes.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The repeal and replacement are grounded in the following legal provisions:
  - **Section 80(3)** of the *Customs Tariff*  
  - **Paragraphs 83.02(1)(a)** and **83.05(a)** of the *Customs Tariff*  
  - **Section 95** of the *Customs Tariff*  

- **Effective Date**:  
  The new regulations come into force on the date that **Section 55 of Act No. 41 of 1995** (the *Act to amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts*) comes into effect.

> ⚖️ This ensures alignment with broader legislative reforms to modernize Canada’s customs framework, particularly in relation to duty relief mechanisms.

### 🔹 **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **establish clear, consistent, and equitable rules for relief from the payment of duties** on certain imported or exported goods under specific conditions. These include:

- Goods undergoing processing or use in Canada
- Goods used for export or international purposes
- Goods involving intergovernmental cooperation (e.g., under the Canada–U.S.-Mexico Agreement)
- Textile fabrics and specific industrial goods

This replaces the outdated **Duties Relief Regulations (P.C. 1987-1570)** and modernizes the framework to reflect current trade practices, international agreements, and administrative efficiency.

An application for duty relief may be made by:
- The **importer or exporter** of goods
- The **processor, owner, or producer** of the goods  
  *Between the time of direct shipment to Canada and their export or deemed export.*

> ✅ **Note**: Relief is **not available** if the exported goods are **damaged before export**.

---

### 🔹 **Exclusions from Duty Relief**

Certain goods are **excluded** from relief under paragraphs **89(1)(c)** and **(e)** of the Act:
- Goods listed in **Schedule I**

Under paragraphs **89(1)(d)** and **(e)**, relief is **not granted** for:
1. **Spirits imported for processing or direct consumption** in Canada (i.e., used in processing other spirits).
2. Goods imported for processing or consumption in Canada **where the same quantity of domestic or imported goods of the same class** is processed or consumed.
3. **Non-textile fabrics** processed or consumed in a plant **other than the one where equivalent domestic or imported goods of the same class** are processed or consumed.

> ❌ These exclusions ensure that duty relief does not create unfair advantages or distort competition in processing.

### 🔹 **Export Timeframes (Deadlines for Export)**

All goods eligible for duty relief must be exported within specified timeframes:

| Type of Good | Export Deadline |
|------------|------------------|
| Goods under **paragraph 89(1)(a) or (b)** | Within **4 years** of release from customs |
| Goods in which **89(1)(c)**-relieved goods are directly consumed or expended | Within **4 years** of release |

### 🔹 **Duty Relief for Textile Fabric**

A special rule applies when imported textile fabric is considered to be of the **same class as domestic textile fabric**:

- If the **duties payable on imported fabric exceed** those that would have been payable on domestic fabric, then:
  - The **relieved portion** of duties equals the **proportion** of:
    - Duties that would have been payable on domestic fabric  
    - Divided by  
    - Actual duties payable on imported fabric

> 💡 Example: If domestic fabric would have cost $100 in duties, and imported fabric costs $150, then only $66.67 (i.e., 2/3 of $100) of the $150 is eligible for relief.

---

### 🔹 **Conditions for "Same Condition" (Paragraph 89(1)(a))**

Goods are considered to be in the same condition as when imported if they:
- Undergo any of the processes listed in **subparagraph (6)(b) of Article 2.5 of the CUSMA Agreement**, **without materially altering** their characteristics
- Are used for:
  - Display or demonstration  
  - Development or production of goods to be exported (excluding plant equipment)  
  - Reusable containers used in **international transportation**

> 📌 This allows flexibility in processing while preserving the integrity of the original goods.

---

### 🔹 **Same Class of Goods (Paragraphs 89(1)(d) and (e))**

Domestic and imported goods are considered of the **same class** if:
1. They are **interchangeable** in processing, or  
2. They are **directly consumed or expended interchangeably** in processing

#### Special Rule for Textile Fabrics (Same Class Criteria)

Two textile fabrics (domestic and imported) are considered of the same class if:
- Both are composed of fibres falling within **one class in Schedule II**, OR  
- Fibres fall outside a class in Schedule II, **but**:
  - The class in which domestic fabric’s fibres fall is **within** the class of imported fabric’s fibres, OR  
  - The difference between the **proportions** of fibres in that class (expressed as % of total weight) **does not exceed 33 percentage points**

> 📏 Example: If domestic fabric has 40% of its weight in Class A fibres and imported fabric has 60%, the difference is 20% — within 33%, so they qualify.

> 🔍 This allows for some flexibility in fibre composition while maintaining regulatory consistency.

### 🔹 **Prescribed Classes (Schedules III, II, and Financial Administration Act)**

- **Schedule III** defines **classes of ships and aircraft** that qualify for duty relief (e.g., ocean-going vessels, aircraft).

  - Being registered in any country  
  - Used **exclusively** for laying/repairing oceanic telegraph cables **outside Canada**  
  - Proceeding on an **ocean voyage outside Canada**

- Or by a **department of Government of Canada**, a **Crown corporation** (named in Schedules II or III of the *Financial Administration Act*)  
- And are used **exclusively** in conjunction with:
  - A **joint project** between Canada and a CUSMA country
