**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Western Brook Lamprey (Lampetra richardsoni) Morrison Creek Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
May 3, 2019  
**Issuing Authority:**  
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29  
Specifically, subsections 58(4) and 58(5), and subsection 58(1)

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The Western Brook Lamprey (*Lampetra richardsoni*) Morrison Creek population is legally recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and is subject to specific protections and management measures under SARA.

2. **Action Plan and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal **action plan** for the Western Brook Lamprey Morrison Creek population was developed to guide recovery efforts. This action plan includes a scientifically determined identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.  
   This identified critical habitat has been officially **registered in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to information about the species’ conservation needs.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2)b):**  
   A key procedural condition of the regulation is that **no portion of the identified critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.  
   Subsection 58(2)b generally prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are:
   - Located within a **prohibited area** (such as a national park or protected area),  
   - Or areas where the designation would be inconsistent with other federal or provincial land-use or environmental protections.  
   The fact that the critical habitat is **not located in such a prohibited area** confirms that the designation is both legally permissible and environmentally appropriate.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **formally designate and legally protect** the critical habitat of the Western Brook Lamprey (Lampetra richardsoni) Morrison Creek population. By doing so, the Government of Canada ensures that:

- The habitat is recognized as essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- Any federal actions (e.g., development, infrastructure projects, land-use planning) that could adversely affect this habitat are subject to review and mitigation under SARA.
- The habitat is protected from degradation or destruction, especially from activities that may disrupt spawning, feeding, or migration.

---

### **Legal Basis**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issues this Order under:

- **Section 58(4)**: Authority to designate critical habitat when it has been identified in a recovery strategy or action plan.
- **Section 58(5)**: Authority to make the designation after the critical habitat has been published in the Public Registry and confirmed to meet legal criteria (such as not being in a prohibited area).

Additionally, **Section 58(1)** applies to the critical habitat, meaning that the designated area is subject to the legal obligations of SARA, including:

- Protection from federal activities that could destroy or degrade the habitat.
- Requirements for environmental assessments and consultations when federal projects may impact the habitat.
- The obligation for federal agencies to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on the habitat.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, which is the official publication of federal laws and regulations. This ensures that the designation becomes legally binding and enforceable upon publication.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Conservation Protection:** The identified areas are now legally protected from federal development or actions that could harm the lamprey’s life cycle.
- **Stakeholder Accountability:** Federal departments and agencies must assess and manage any proposed activities in or near the designated habitat.
- **Transparency and Public Access:** The designation is publicly available in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, promoting transparency and enabling public participation in conservation efforts.
- **Recovery Support:** This formal recognition supports the broader recovery strategy for the species by providing a clear spatial framework for habitat protection and restoration.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a critical step in the conservation of the endangered Western Brook Lamprey Morrison Creek population. By formally designating its critical habitat—after scientific assessment and legal review—it ensures that the species receives the necessary protection under SARA. The exclusion from prohibited areas under subsection 58(2)b confirms that the designation is both legally sound and ecologically appropriate, contributing to the long-term survival of this unique and vulnerable species.

This Order exemplifies how SARA enables science-based, legally enforceable conservation measures to protect biodiversity in Canada.
