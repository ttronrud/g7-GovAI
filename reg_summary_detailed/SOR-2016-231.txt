**Detailed Summary of the Cannabis Exemption (Food and Drugs Act) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Cannabis Exemption (Food and Drugs Act) Regulations* were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Health**, pursuant to **paragraph 30(1)(j) of the Food and Drugs Act (R.S., c. F-27)**. This provision grants the government the authority to exempt certain substances from the scope of the Food and Drugs Act, provided that specific conditions are met.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **align the regulatory treatment of cannabis with its legal status under the *Cannabis Act***, while ensuring that cannabis does not fall under the strict controls of the *Food and Drugs Act* when it is used in a lawful, authorized, and non-medical or non-food-related context.

### **Core Exemption Provision**

**Cannabis**, as defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Cannabis Act**, is **exempt from the application of the Food and Drugs Act**—**unless** it is used for one of the following specific purposes:

#### 1. **Medical or Therapeutic Use**
- If cannabis is:
  - Manufactured, sold, or represented for use in:
    - The **diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention** of a disease, disorder, or abnormal physical state (including its symptoms), or
    - The **restoration or correction of organic functions** in **human beings or animals**.

> *This means that if cannabis is being marketed or used for any medical purpose (e.g., pain relief, epilepsy treatment), it is subject to the Food and Drugs Act and must comply with its requirements for safety, efficacy, and labeling.*

#### 2. **Use in Modifying Organic Functions**
- If cannabis is represented for use in **modifying organic functions** in human beings or animals (e.g., altering brain function, mood, or physiological responses).

> *This includes non-therapeutic but functionally altering uses such as enhancing performance or altering perception—such uses fall under the scope of the Food and Drugs Act.*

#### 3. **Use in Food-Related Disinfection**
- If cannabis is manufactured, sold, or represented for use in **disinfecting premises** where food is manufactured, prepared, or stored.

> *This prevents cannabis from being used in food safety environments, which would otherwise pose potential contamination or health risks.*

#### 4. **Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) Status**
- If cannabis is an **active pharmaceutical ingredient** as defined in **subsection C.01A.001(1) of the Food and Drug Regulations**.

> *This applies when cannabis is used as a key component in a drug formulation. In such cases, it is subject to the full regulatory framework of the Food and Drugs Act.*

#### 5. **Clinical or Experimental Research**
- **Repealed provision** (SOR/2025-43, s. 75):  
  Previously, cannabis sold for use in a **clinical trial** (as defined in section C.05.001 of the Food and Drug Regulations) or an **experimental study** (as defined in section C.08.013) was exempt.  
  → **This provision has been repealed** as of the amendment in SOR/2025-43, section 75.  
  > *As of now, cannabis used in research is not automatically exempt from the Food and Drugs Act. Research activities must comply with applicable regulations, and the exemption no longer applies to such uses.*

### **Additional Exemptions Based on Licensing and Designation**

Despite the general rule that cannabis is subject to the Food and Drugs Act when used for specific purposes, the following **exceptions apply**:

#### **Exemption for Licensed and Designated Persons**

- Cannabis manufactured or sold by any of the following persons is **exempt from the Food and Drugs Act**, **unless** it is represented for a use listed in the above paragraphs:
  
  1. A person to whom a **licence other than a cannabis drug licence** was issued under **subsection 62(1) of the Cannabis Act**.  
     → This includes entities operating under licences for:
     - Retail sales (e.g., cannabis stores),
     - Cultivation,
     - Processing,
     - Distribution (non-drug purposes),
     - Or other non-drug-related activities.

  2. A **designated person** as defined in **Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations**.  
     → These are individuals or entities officially designated by the government to handle cannabis in a regulated manner (e.g., for distribution to medical users, or in specific research settings).

> *This ensures that legitimate cannabis businesses operating under the Cannabis Act are not subject to dual regulatory burdens under both the Cannabis Act and the Food and Drugs Act.*

---

### **Exemption for Non-Therapeutic Research**

- Cannabis is **exempt from the Food and Drugs Act** if it is **sold for non-therapeutic research on cannabis**, as defined in **subsection 1(2) of the Cannabis Regulations**, and such research is conducted **in accordance with the Cannabis Regulations**.

> *This allows for scientific and academic research into the properties of cannabis without requiring full compliance with the Food and Drugs Act. However, the research must be authorized and conducted under the framework of the Cannabis Regulations.*

> *Note: This exemption is explicitly labeled as "[Repeal]" in the original text—however, based on the context and the structure of the document, it appears that this may be a typographical or editorial error. Given the current version of the regulation, the exemption appears to remain in force unless otherwise amended. Nevertheless, the official repeal in SOR/2025-43, s. 75, suggests that this exemption is no longer valid as of that date.*

> ✅ **Conclusion**: As of **SOR/2025-43, s. 75**, the exemption for non-therapeutic research has been **repealed**. Therefore, cannabis used in such research is **no longer exempt** from the Food and Drugs Act and must comply with its requirements.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **came into force on August 24, 2016**.

### **Key Implications and Regulatory Significance**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Regulatory Alignment** | Cannabis is treated as a distinct substance under the Cannabis Act, avoiding unnecessary overlap with the Food and Drugs Act for non-medical, non-food, and non-drug-related uses. |
| **Medical Exceptions** | Any use of cannabis for diagnosis, treatment, or symptom management requires compliance with the Food and Drugs Act—ensuring safety, efficacy, and labeling standards. |
| **Business Exemptions** | Licensed and designated operators (e.g., retailers, cultivators) are exempt from the Food and Drugs Act, streamlining operations. |
| **Research Restrictions** | Research on cannabis is now subject to stricter oversight under the Cannabis Regulations, and no automatic exemption from the Food and Drugs Act exists. |
| **Food Safety** | Cannabis cannot be used for disinfection in food premises—protecting public health and food integrity. |
| **API Status** | If cannabis is used as a pharmaceutical ingredient, it falls under the full purview of the Food and Drugs Act. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Cannabis Exemption (Food and Drugs Act) Regulations* establish a **clear and targeted exemption** framework for cannabis, allowing it to operate under the *Cannabis Act* rather than the more prescriptive *Food and Drugs Act*, **except** when cannabis is used for medical, research, or food-related purposes.

However, the **repeal of the clinical and experimental research exemption** (as of SOR/2025-43, s. 75) significantly tightens regulatory oversight of cannabis research, requiring such activities to comply with both the Cannabis Regulations and, where applicable, the Food and Drugs Act.

This regulation reflects a **pragmatic balance** between enabling legal cannabis use and protecting public health, safety, and food integrity—while ensuring that medical and scientific applications are properly regulated.
