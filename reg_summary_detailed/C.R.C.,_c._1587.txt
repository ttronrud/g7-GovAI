### **4. Payment of Premiums**
- **Due Date**: Monthly premiums are due on the **first day of each month**.
- **Grace Period**: A **one-month grace period** is allowed after the first premium without interest. During this time, the policy remains in force.
  - **Exception**: The grace period **does not apply** if the only premium paid is an **interim premium** (less than one month).
- **Premium Deduction**: If the insured dies during the grace period, any unpaid premium will be **deducted from the insurance payout**.
- **Payment Methods**:
  - Can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually in advance.
  - Annual advance payments are equivalent to:
    - 3 months’ premium (quarterly),
    - 6 months’ premium (semi-annual),
    - 12 months’ premium (annual).
- **Payment Process**:
  - Payments must be sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs (Ottawa) or any district office.
  - Delivery to a post office constitutes payment **as of the time of delivery**.
  - Payment made before the grace period ends may still be proven through documentation.
  - **Effect of delivery**: Payment is deemed made on the due date, even if delivered later.

> This ensures flexibility in payment while maintaining due dates and preventing lapses in coverage.

### **5. Refund of Premiums on Death or Surrender**
- **Death During Premium Period**:
  - If the insured dies during a premium period, the **unexpired portion of the premium** is refunded in the settlement.
  - Refund is calculated from the **end of the calendar month** in which death occurs.

- **Policy Surrender**:
  - If the policy is surrendered, the insured receives:
    - The **cash surrender value** of the policy, and
    - The unexpired portion of the premium.
  - The unexpired portion is calculated from **either**:
    - The beginning of the month of surrender, or
    - The end of the month of surrender,
    - Whichever yields the **greater amount**.

> These provisions protect policyholders from overpayment and ensure fair treatment upon early termination or death.

---

### **6. Interim Term Insurance**
- Allows short-term coverage (less than one month) when the first monthly premium is paid.
- An **interim premium** is payable at the time of initial policy issuance.
- The interim premium is calculated on the **same mortality basis** as the regular monthly premium.
- Applies only to the period between the date of premium payment and the due date of the first monthly premium.

> This provides flexibility for veterans who may not be able to pay full premiums immediately.

---

### **7. Cash Surrender Value**
- A cash surrender value may be paid to the insured under the following conditions:
  1. The policy has been in force for **at least two years** and premiums have been paid for **at least two years**.
  2. A **written application** is submitted by the insured and beneficiaries (unless their whereabouts are unknown or unascertainable after a satisfactory search by the Superintendent).
  3. The policy is **returned to the Superintendent** for cancellation or retention.

- The value is based on:
  - The **policy reserve** using the **British Offices Life Tables, Om (5)**.
  - Interest at **3.5% per annum**.

- The value is **paid in full and final settlement** of the policy.

> This allows policyholders to exit the policy with a refund based on its accumulated value.

---

### **8. Reduced Paid-Up Insurance**
- Available after two years of continuous premium payments.
- Must be requested **within three months after the due date of the first premium in default**, if any.
- The insured may receive **paid-up insurance** for a reduced amount.
- The amount is calculated as the **net single premium** at the insured’s current age, based on the policy reserve at the end of the paid period.

> This allows policyholders to convert their active policy into a permanent, lower-cost policy without further premium payments.

---

### **9. Automatic Extended Term Insurance**
- If a premium is not paid within the grace period (after two years of policy in force), the policy automatically continues for an extended term.
- The extended term duration is determined by the **policy reserve** at the date the premium fell due.
- The reserve is applied as a **net single premium** at the insured’s current age.
- The extended term **terminates upon expiration**.
- The term is calculated in whole months (fractional parts are disregarded).

> This provides continued coverage without requiring new applications or proof of insurability, protecting veterans from sudden loss of coverage.

---

### **10. Reinstatement of Policy**
- If a premium is not paid within grace and no cash surrender or reduced paid-up insurance has been applied:
  - The policy may be **reinstated** within **five years** from the due date of the first premium in default.
  - Requires:
    - Consent of the Minister.
    - Payment of **all arrears of premiums** plus **interest at 5% per annum compounded annually**.
    - Evidence of **insurability** provided by the Minister.

> This offers a path to restore coverage after a lapse, with safeguards to ensure continued risk assessment.

---

### **11. Financial Accountability and Reporting**
- A **Veterans Insurance Account** is established in the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.
  - All moneys received are **credited** to the account.
  - All moneys paid under the Act are **charged** to the account.
- **Annual Review**:
  - At the end of each fiscal year, the Superintendent calculates the **outstanding liability** from policies under the Act.
  - If the liability exceeds the account balance:
    - The **excess is credited** to the account.
  - If the account balance exceeds the liability:
    - The **excess is charged** to the account.

> This ensures financial transparency and long-term solvency of the program.
