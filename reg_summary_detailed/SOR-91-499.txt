## **II. Core Principles and Objectives**

The rules are guided by several foundational principles:

1. **Fairness and Efficiency**  
   > *"These Rules shall be liberally construed to secure the fairest, least expensive and most expeditious determination of every proceeding."*  
   - The Tribunal is empowered to interpret rules broadly to ensure fairness, reduce costs, and expedite outcomes.

2. **Flexibility and Discretion**  
   - The Tribunal may:
     - **Dispense with, vary, or supplement** any rule if it is fair and equitable.
     - **Combine multiple proceedings** (e.g., appeals, inquiries, reviews) to reduce duplication and improve efficiency.
     - **Extend or abridge time limits** if necessary, based on fairness and circumstances.

3. **Procedural Fairness**  
   - If a procedural issue arises not covered in the rules, the Tribunal may resolve it in a manner consistent with applicable rules and principles of procedural fairness.

4. **No Invalidity Due to Form or Technical Errors**  
   > *"No proceeding is invalid by reason of a defect in form or a technical irregularity."*  
   - This ensures that procedural errors do not undermine the validity of a proceeding, promoting practicality and resilience in administrative decision-making.
