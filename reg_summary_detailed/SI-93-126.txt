**Regulation Summary: Amalgamation of the Privy Council Office and the Federal-Provincial Relations Office**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This means that the decision is made at the highest level of the Canadian federal government, with the Governor General formally approving the action in accordance with constitutional conventions and legislative authority.  

The legal foundation for this action is **paragraph 2(b) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision grants the federal government the power to reorganize public service departments and transfer or combine functions among different offices, provided such actions are in the public interest and are consistent with the principles of administrative efficiency and accountability.

**2. Key Action: Amalgamation and Combination**  
The central provision of the regulation is the **amalgamation and combination** of two key federal offices:

- The **Privy Council Office (PCO)**  
- The **Federal-Provincial Relations Office (FPRO)**  

These two offices are being merged into a single, unified entity. This means that their administrative structures, staff, responsibilities, and operational functions will be combined under a single organizational framework.

**3. Oversight and Governance Structure**  
The combined office will operate under **dual leadership**:

- **Under the Prime Minister**  
  This ensures that the merged office remains closely aligned with the Prime Minister’s priorities and strategic direction. The Prime Minister will have overall authority and responsibility for the functioning of the combined office, reflecting its role in shaping national policy and governance.

- **Under the Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet**  
  This position is traditionally a key administrative and constitutional role within the federal government. The Clerk oversees the day-to-day operations of the Privy Council and the Cabinet, including the management of official communications, records, and procedural functions. By placing the combined office under this official, the government ensures continuity, constitutional integrity, and administrative stability.

**4. Rationale and Objectives**  
While not explicitly stated in the regulation, the amalgamation likely aims to achieve several strategic objectives:

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Eliminating duplication of functions and streamlining decision-making processes.
- **Improved Coordination**: Ensuring better alignment between federal policy development and intergovernmental relations.
- **Stronger Federal Leadership**: Centralizing key functions related to intergovernmental coordination and constitutional governance under the Prime Minister’s office, while maintaining the Clerk’s role in administrative oversight.
- **Clearer Accountability**: Establishing a single point of responsibility for both the internal governance of the federal government and its interactions with provincial governments.

**5. Implications**  
- **Operational Impact**: Staff from both offices will likely be reassigned or integrated into the new structure, potentially leading to changes in reporting lines and responsibilities.
- **Policy Impact**: The combined office will now be responsible for both the internal functioning of the federal government (e.g., Cabinet operations, official communications) and the management of federal-provincial relations (e.g., intergovernmental agreements, policy coordination, fiscal transfers).
- **Constitutional Significance**: The move reinforces the role of the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council in maintaining the balance between executive leadership and constitutional governance.

**6. Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization of federal administrative structures. By merging the Privy Council Office and the Federal-Provincial Relations Office under the Prime Minister and the Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, the government seeks to create a more cohesive, efficient, and strategically focused entity capable of managing both internal governance and intergovernmental relations effectively.
