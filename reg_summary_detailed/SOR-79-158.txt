Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This proclamation establishes **Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC)** — a regulatory and marketing agency — under the authority of the *Farm Products Agencies Act*.

The Governor in Council determined that a **majority of Canadian chicken producers** supported the creation of such an agency.

The proclamation outlines the structure, powers, membership, operations, and oversight mechanisms of the CFC, with specific provisions governing **marketing plans, quotas, pricing, licensing, levies, and cooperation** with provincial bodies.

## 📈 Core Function: The Marketing Plan (Plan)

The CFC is empowered to implement a **marketing plan** consisting of:

### 1. **Quota System**
A system to control the volume of chicken that can be marketed in interprovincial and export trade.

#### A. For **Signatory Provinces** (all provinces except non-signatory territories):
- A **live-weight quota** is allocated to each producer.
- Quotas are set by the **appropriate provincial Commodity Board** on behalf of CFC.
- The total quota allocation for a province must equal:
  - Chicken authorized for **interprovincial/export trade** under quotas,
  - Chicken authorized for **intraprovincial trade** under quotas,
  - Chicken anticipated to be marketed **outside of quotas**.

> 📌 **Initial Quota Target**: Based on the average production in the province during the 1986–1990 period.

> ⚠️ **No unilateral changes** allowed that would increase or decrease total quota volume (except in line with a proportional change across all provinces).

> ✅ **Adjustments allowed**:
> - CFC may reduce or refuse to allocate quotas to producers who have exceeded prior quotas.
> - CFC may establish quotas for periods other than a year (e.g., 2 years).

#### B. For **Non-Signatory Territories** (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut):
- A **eviscerated-weight quota** is allocated.
- Total allowed for interprovincial marketing into signatory provinces equals the **5-year average** (1986–1990) of chicken marketed into signatory provinces during that time.

> ✅ **Flexibility**:
> - CFC may establish initial or subsequent allocations for non-signatory territories for periods other than a year.
> - Any increase or decrease must be **proportional** to changes in signatory provinces.

> ⚠️ **Anti-Predatory Clause**:
> - Quotas **cannot be augmented** due to predatory marketing (e.g., shorting a market to supply a new one).
> - If predatory practices occur, the quota system is **liable for adjustment**.

---

### 2. **Licensing System**
- CFC may establish a **licensing system** for individuals or entities marketing chicken in interprovincial or export trade.
- **Fees** may be charged per license.
- **Conditions** include:
  - Compliance with all CFC and provincial board regulations.
  - Restrictions on pricing and marketing practices.
- **Unpaid fees** become **debt due to CFC after 30 days**.

---

### 3. **Levies and Charges**
- CFC may impose **levies or charges** on producers or marketers.
- Levies must be sufficient to cover:
  - Administrative and marketing costs.
  - Creation of reserves.
  - Losses from sales or disposal.
- Levies may be **grouped by producer category** (e.g., small vs. large farms).
- CFC may **delegate collection** to a Commodity Board with the concurrence of that board.

---

### 4. **Price Protection (Anti-Predatory Pricing)**
- In interprovincial trade, **no producer may sell chicken in a signatory province at a price lower than**:
  - The price charged at the same time for similar chicken in the **same province or territory** of origin, **plus**
  - Reasonable transportation costs to deliver it.

> This prevents undercutting and ensures fair pricing across regions.

---

### 5. **Cooperation with Provincial Boards**
CFC must:
- **Share records, minutes, and decisions** with provincial Commodity Boards.
- Allow designated officers from provincial boards to **attend CFC meetings** when issues are relevant.
- Provide **advance notice** of proposed orders or regulations that may affect provincial operations.

> This ensures transparency and collaboration between federal and provincial bodies.

---

### 6. **Review and Evaluation of the Plan**
- CFC must **hold annual meetings** to:
  - Review the marketing plan.
  - Evaluate existing orders and regulations.
  - Determine if modifications are needed.
- A meeting is required **at least once per year**, and **as often as requested** by at least two provincial Commodity Boards.

> This ensures responsiveness to market and regional needs.
