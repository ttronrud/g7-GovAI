### **1. Background and Legal Context**

- **Original Provision in the Tax Rebate Discounting Act**:  
  The original definition of "Minister" in subsection 2(1) of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act* referenced the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**. This ministerial title was part of the original legislative framework governing the administration of tax rebate discounting programs.

- **Change in Ministerial Title (Due to Departmental Reorganization)**:  
  Pursuant to **paragraph 62(1)(t) of the Department of Industry Act**, the title "Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs" was officially replaced by **"Minister of Industry"**.  
  - This change was implemented through **Order in Council P.C. 1995-536**, issued on **March 29, 1995**.  
  - The Department of Industry Act (S.C. 1995, c. 1) was enacted to restructure federal departments and realign ministerial responsibilities.  
  - The change reflects a broader administrative reorganization where the responsibilities previously held by the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs were consolidated or renamed under the Minister of Industry.

- **Legal Authority for the Transfer**:  
  The transfer of powers, duties, and functions is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.  
  - This Act provides the legal mechanism for the Government of Canada to reassign functions between ministers in response to structural or administrative changes.  
  - The transfer is not a new legislative enactment but a formal administrative adjustment based on existing statutory authority.

- **From**: The **Minister of Industry**  
- **To**: The **Minister of National Revenue**  
- **Subject Matter**: The powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Industry **under the Tax Rebate Discounting Act**.

This means that all responsibilities previously exercised by the Minister of Industry in relation to the administration, oversight, or implementation of the tax rebate discounting program are now assumed by the **Minister of National Revenue**.

### **3. Key Implications**

- **Administrative Efficiency**:  
  The transfer aligns the administration of tax rebate discounting with the **Minister of National Revenue**, who is already responsible for tax policy, compliance, and revenue collection. This improves coordination and ensures that tax-related programs are managed within a unified and consistent framework.

- **Continuity of Operations**:  
  While the ministerial title has changed, the substantive functions of the tax rebate discounting program remain unchanged. The transfer ensures continuity in program delivery and compliance.

- **Legal and Procedural Clarity**:  
  The regulation removes ambiguity about which minister is responsible for administering the Tax Rebate Discounting Act. It provides a clear, legally grounded assignment of authority, which supports accountability and transparency.
