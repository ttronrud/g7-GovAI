# **Detailed Summary of the Aviation Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**  
*(Under the Canada Labour Code – Part II, S.C. 2000, c. 20, s. 5–8, 20)*

---

## **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

- **Issuance**: These regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour** and the **Minister of Transport**.
- **Legal Basis**: Enacted under specific sections of the *Canada Labour Code*:
  - Sections **125a, 125.1b, 125.2c, 126d, and 157e**.
- **Purpose**: To establish health and safety standards for employees working on **aircraft in operation**, and for individuals granted access to aircraft, ensuring their protection from occupational hazards including noise, electrical risks, contamination, and exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos.

---

## **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

- **Non-employee individuals** who perform work on an aircraft to gain knowledge or experience (e.g., trainees, apprentices), **as if they were employees**.
- **All employees employed on board aircraft during operation**.
- **Persons granted access** to aircraft by the employer (e.g., maintenance staff, support personnel).

> ⚠️ **Key Principle**: All provisions of these regulations must be interpreted and applied as if the non-employee were an actual employee.

## **4. Noise Exposure and Hearing Protection (Part on Acoustics)**

### **4.1 Measurement Requirements**
- Sound exposure must be measured using:
  - A sound level meter **recommended in CSA CAN/CSA-Z107.56-13** (Clause 4.3).
  - The instrument must be **certified** by a Standards Council of Canada-accredited body to meet **Clause 4 requirements**.
- Measurement must be conducted:
  - **Instantaneously** during normal working conditions.
  - Using the **slow response setting** of the SLM.

### **4.2 Exposure Limits**
- **No employee may be exposed to**:
  - An A-weighted sound pressure level **exceeding the limits in Schedule** (column 1) for durations over those specified (column 2).
  - A **noise exposure level (Lex,8) exceeding 87 dBA** in any 24-hour period.

### **4.3 High-Risk Exposure (≥84 dBA)**
If an employee may be exposed to **≥84 dBA for a period likely to endanger hearing**, the employer must:
1. **Immediately appoint a qualified person** to conduct an investigation.
2. **Notify** the workplace committee or health and safety representative (HSR) of:
   - The investigation.
   - The name of the appointed person.

### **4.4 Investigation Requirements**
The investigation must assess:
- Sources of sound on board.
- Likely A-weighted sound pressure levels and exposure durations.
- Existing noise-reduction methods.
- Whether exposure exceeds the **87 dBA limit**.
- Whether exposure may reach **≥84 dBA**.

### **4.5 Report Requirements**
After consultation with the HSR or committee, the investigator must:
- Document observations and findings.
- Provide **recommendations** for:
  - Engineering controls to reduce exposure (e.g., sound barriers, quieter equipment).
  - Use of hearing protectors for exposure between **84–87 dBA**.
- The report must be:
  - **Kept by the employer** for **10 years**.
  - **Accessible to affected employees**.

### **4.6 Employee Notification & Hearing Protection**
If the report indicates exposure ≥84 dBA:
- The employer must:
  - Provide **written information** on the hearing risks.
  - Make the report **readily available** to the employee.
  - **Post a notice** in a conspicuous, accessible location indicating where the report can be reviewed.

### **4.7 Hearing Protection Requirements**
If engineering controls are **not feasible** to reduce exposure below the limit:
- The employer must:
  - Provide **hearing protectors** that:
    - Are certified by an accredited body to meet **CSA Z94.2-02 (R2007)** standards.
    - Prevent exposure to the hazardous sound level.
  - **Train employees** in fitting, care, and use of protectors (in consultation with HSR or committee).

> 🔍 **Note**: Hearing protection is not a substitute for engineering controls — it is only used when those are not feasible.
