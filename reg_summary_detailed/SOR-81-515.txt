**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Egg Marketing Administration Levies Order (1981)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**
This regulation, known as the *Manitoba Egg Marketing Administration Levies Order*, is issued under **Section 4 of the Manitoba Egg Order** and operates within the broader framework of the **Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba** ("Act"). 

- The **Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** is the statutory body established under the Act to oversee the marketing and economic management of eggs produced in Manitoba.
- This Order provides specific provisions for the **fixing, imposition, and collection of levies** on egg producers based on the volume of eggs they market in interprovincial and export markets.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to:
- Establish a **fair and standardized levy** on egg producers who sell their eggs outside Manitoba (i.e., in interprovincial or international markets).
- Ensure that producers contribute financially to support the **marketing, promotion, and economic stability** of Manitoba’s egg industry, particularly in competitive or export-oriented markets.
- Create a transparent and enforceable mechanism for collecting these levies through a defined schedule and payment process.

### **3. Key Definitions**
The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* — the foundational legislation governing marketing boards and commodity levies. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act to administer marketing policies and collect levies. |
| **Eggs** | Any variety, grade, or class of eggs produced by domestic hens (*Gallus Domesticus*) in Manitoba. This includes all types of commercially produced eggs, regardless of grade or packaging. |
| **Plan** | The *Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan*, which is periodically established and amended under the Act. This Plan sets out the overall strategy for marketing, pricing, and financial management of the egg industry. Any regulatory measures (e.g., levies) are aligned with the Plan. |
| **Producer** | Any individual or entity engaged in the production of eggs within the Province of Manitoba. This includes farmers, poultry operations, and other egg-producing businesses. |

### **4. Levy Amount and Scope**
- **Levy Rate**: Every producer must pay a levy of **2 cents per dozen of eggs** marketed.
- **Scope of Application**: The levy applies **only to eggs marketed in interprovincial and export trade**. 
  - Eggs sold within Manitoba are **exempt** from this levy.
  - The levy does not apply to eggs sold directly to consumers or through local retail channels within the province.

---

### **5. Timing and Due Date of Payment**
- The levy is **due and payable at the time of marketing** — meaning when the producer sells the eggs to a buyer outside Manitoba.
- However, the **actual payment must be made within a specified timeframe**:
  - Producers must pay all levies for eggs marketed in a given week **not later than seven days after the end of that week**.
  - For example, if eggs were marketed during the week ending June 21, 1981, the levy must be paid by June 28, 1981.

### **8. Significance and Implications**

- It supports the **economic sustainability** of the local egg industry by funding marketing initiatives, quality assurance, and market development.
- The levy is **proportional and based on volume** (per dozen), making it equitable and transparent.

- Failure to pay the levy on time may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Commodity Board, although specific penalties are not detailed in this Order.

By linking the levy to the marketing activity of producers and setting a strict payment deadline, it ensures financial accountability and supports the broader economic goals of the Manitoba egg industry as outlined in the Natural Products Marketing Act and the Manitoba Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan.

This Order reflects a balanced approach to market participation, ensuring that producers who access wider markets contribute to the collective marketing infrastructure of the industry.
