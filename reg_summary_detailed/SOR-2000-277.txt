**Detailed Summary of the Deposit Insurance Application Fee By-law (Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation)**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Board of Directors enacted this by-law under two specific provisions of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*:

- **Paragraph 11(2)(g)a**: Grants the Board the authority to establish and amend by-laws related to the administration of deposit insurance, including fees associated with applications.
- **Subsection 18(1)b**: Empowers the Board to prescribe fees that must be paid in connection with applications for deposit insurance.

This by-law serves to formally establish a mandatory, non-refundable fee for certain deposit insurance applications.

**Key Provision:**  
The by-law prescribes a **fixed application fee of $20,000** that must accompany any application for deposit insurance submitted by a **provincial institution** under **subsection 17(1.1)** of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*.

**Scope of Application:**  
- Applies specifically to **provincial financial institutions** (e.g., provincial credit unions or other institutions chartered or regulated under provincial law) that are seeking deposit insurance coverage.
- The fee is required when such institutions apply under the specific provision in the Act (subsection 17(1.1)), which governs the eligibility and process for provincial institutions to obtain deposit insurance.

**Nature of the Fee:**  
- **Non-refundable**: The $20,000 fee is not refundable under any circumstances, regardless of the outcome of the application or whether the institution is approved for insurance coverage.
- This reflects a policy decision to ensure that the administrative and operational costs of processing applications are covered and to provide a stable revenue stream for CDIC to manage the application review process.

**Effective Date:**  
The by-law comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate statutory authority (typically the Canada Gazette or the relevant government registry). This means its provisions are immediately applicable upon formal publication and registration.

**Legal References:**  
- **R.S. c. 18 (3rd Supp.), s. 51**: Refers to the statutory framework that allows the Board to adopt by-laws for administrative purposes.
- **S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 100**: This is the enabling legislative provision that authorizes the Board to make by-laws, including those concerning fees.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- The fee ensures financial accountability and helps fund the administrative costs of evaluating applications and assessing risk.
- It provides a clear, predictable cost for provincial institutions seeking deposit insurance, reducing uncertainty in the application process.
- The non-refundable nature underscores the finality of the fee, aligning with standard administrative fee practices in financial regulation.

**Conclusion:**  
This by-law establishes a standardized, non-refundable fee of **$20,000** for provincial institutions applying for deposit insurance under subsection 17(1.1) of the CDIC Act. It is legally grounded, clearly defined, and designed to support the operational integrity and financial sustainability of the CDIC’s application process. The by-law takes effect upon registration and applies uniformly to eligible provincial institutions.
