**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Use of Departmental Data by Private Sector Firms

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Treasury Board.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to authorize the setting of fees or charges for the use of government data, particularly when such data is provided to the public by a government department.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority to Prescribe Fees:**  
   The **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** is authorized to issue a regulatory order that establishes specific fees or charges to be collected from **private sector firms** that use data from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (DCCA) and subsequently sell that data to the public.

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The regulation applies specifically to:
   - Private sector firms that access data from the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.
   - Firms that intend to **resell or otherwise commercially distribute** that data to the general public.

3. **Purpose of the Fee:**  
   The fees are intended to:
   - Recoup the administrative, operational, and technological costs associated with the collection, maintenance, and provision of data by the Department.
   - Ensure that the use of public data for commercial purposes is financially sustainable and does not place undue burden on the government.
   - Provide a transparent and accountable mechanism for revenue generation tied to data access and dissemination.

4. **Regulatory Process:**  
   - The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs will issue a formal **order** to prescribe the fees.
   - The order will specify:
     - The types of data subject to fees.
     - The conditions under which access or resale is permitted.
     - The amount, method, and timing of fee payment.
     - Any exemptions or special provisions (e.g., for small businesses or non-profit organizations, if applicable).

5. **Governance and Oversight:**  
   - The decision is made jointly by the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Treasury Board, indicating a balance between sectoral expertise and financial accountability.
   - The Treasury Board’s involvement ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with broader government financial policies.

6. **Legal Justification:**  
   The use of paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act provides a statutory foundation for the government to establish fees for data access, which is consistent with established practices for managing public resources and services.

**Implications:**

- **For Private Sector Firms:**  
  Firms must now comply with new financial obligations when using or reselling data from the Department. They will be required to pay fees based on the volume, type, or use of data.

- **For the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs:**  
  The department gains a formal mechanism to fund data management activities and potentially expand its data infrastructure or services.

- **For Public Interest:**  
  The regulation supports transparency and accountability in data use. It ensures that commercial exploitation of government data is properly monetized, potentially enabling better data governance and public trust.

**Limitations and Considerations:**  
- The regulation does not apply to data used solely for internal analysis or non-commercial purposes.
- The fees are not intended to restrict access to data but to ensure fair and sustainable use in commercial contexts.
- The Minister is expected to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and ensure fees are reasonable and proportionate.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal, legally grounded framework enabling the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to charge private sector firms for the commercial use and resale of its data. It reflects a growing trend in government policy to manage data as a public asset and to ensure that its commercial use is financially sustainable and ethically governed. The process is transparent, rooted in existing legislation, and designed to balance public interest with fiscal responsibility.
