**Detailed Summary of the NATO Common Infrastructure Project Remission Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *NATO Common Infrastructure Project Remission Order* and may be cited as such. It establishes a formal mechanism for the remission (i.e., exemption) of customs duties and excise taxes on specific goods imported into or purchased within Canada.

---

**2. Purpose of the Remission**  
The primary objective of this Order is to facilitate the construction and development of systems and services that are designated as *Canadian components* of the **NATO Common Infrastructure Project (NCIP)**. These components are critical to NATO’s operational infrastructure and are developed in collaboration with Canadian entities using funds from NATO’s common pool.

By exempting certain equipment, materials, and supplies from customs duty and excise taxes, the Order supports Canada’s role in contributing to NATO’s shared infrastructure—ensuring cost-effective, timely, and efficient delivery of essential capabilities without financial burden from importation or domestic procurement.

**3. Scope of Exemption**  
The remission applies to:
- Equipment  
- Materials  
- Supplies  

That are:
- **Imported into Canada** or **purchased in Canada**  
- Used **exclusively** for the construction and development of systems and services  
- Designated by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs** as *Canadian components* of the NATO Common Infrastructure Project  
- Funded **exclusively from NATO common funds**  

This means that only goods directly tied to the NCIP and financed by NATO are eligible. The exemption is not available for general or unrelated purchases.

**4. Requirement for Exemption Certificate**  
A key procedural requirement is that **no remission may be granted unless**:
- An **exemption certificate** is issued and attached to the relevant documentation.  
- The certificate must be signed by an **officer designated by the Minister of National Defence**, upon request from the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**.

This ensures accountability and verification that:
- The goods are genuinely part of the NATO Common Infrastructure Project  
- The Minister of National Defence has reviewed and approved the use of the goods  
- The request originates from a legitimate, authorized source within the Canadian government’s NATO framework  

Without this certificate, the claim for remission will be denied, regardless of the nature of the goods or their intended use.

---

**5. Role of the Minister of National Revenue**  
The Minister of National Revenue is tasked with:
- Issuing **instructions and directions** necessary to implement this Order effectively  
- Ensuring that customs and excise authorities recognize and process remission claims in accordance with the provisions of the Order  
- Maintaining compliance with applicable tax and customs laws while allowing for the necessary exemptions  

This includes updating internal procedures, training officials, and establishing clear guidelines for handling exemption certificates and related documentation.

---

**6. Legal and Procedural Implications**  
- The Order operates **notwithstanding Section 2** of the relevant enabling legislation (likely the *Customs Act* or similar), which may otherwise impose general duty and tax obligations. This demonstrates a specific legislative exception for the NCIP.  
- The exemption is **conditional and limited**—it does not apply to all goods or all purchases, only those meeting strict criteria of project designation, funding source, and documentation.  
- The requirement for an official exemption certificate introduces a **layer of administrative control** to prevent misuse or unauthorized tax relief.

**7. Strategic and Diplomatic Significance**  
This Order reflects Canada’s strategic commitment to NATO by enabling the development of shared infrastructure that enhances interoperability, security, and operational readiness among NATO allies. It also strengthens Canada’s role as a key contributor to collective defense, allowing for cost-effective procurement and deployment of critical technologies.

**Conclusion**  
The *NATO Common Infrastructure Project Remission Order* provides a targeted, legally grounded exemption from customs and excise duties for specific goods used in the development of Canadian-designed NATO infrastructure. It is designed to support international cooperation while maintaining fiscal discipline and administrative oversight. The requirement for a Minister of National Defence-endorsed exemption certificate ensures that the exemption is both legitimate and properly authorized, protecting Canadian tax revenue and ensuring accountability in the use of public funds.

This Order is a practical tool that enables Canada to fulfill its obligations within NATO without incurring unnecessary financial costs, while remaining fully compliant with Canadian tax and customs law.
