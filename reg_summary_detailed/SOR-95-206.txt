**Detailed Summary of the Air Transportation Tax Order, 1995**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Air Transportation Tax Order, 1995* (S.C. 1994, c. 29, s. 2; SOR/94-331, 1994 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2076) is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **section 11** of the *Excise Tax Act*. It **revokes the previous Air Transportation Tax Order, 1994 (P.C. 1994-666)** and replaces it with updated tax rates for air transportation, effective **May 1, 1995**.

This Order establishes specific tax amounts applicable to air travel under different conditions, based on the **timing of the flight (before or after February 28, 1998)** and the **nature of the ticket** (whether it is restricted to a single segment or not). It also differentiates between **scheduled passenger flights** and **charter agreements**.

The Order may be cited as the *Air Transportation Tax Order, 1995*.

### **Key Definitions and Context**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Excise Tax Act*.
- The tax applies under **subsection 10(1)** and **10(2)** of the Act, which govern the imposition of air transportation tax.
- The tax is calculated under **subparagraph 11(1)(a)(ii)** and **paragraphs 11(1)(b)** and **11(2)(b)** of the Act, depending on the circumstances.

## **I. Tax Rates Based on Flight Timing and Ticket Restrictions**

### **1. Flights Beginning After February 28, 1998 (Post-February 1998 Flights)**

#### **For Subparagraph 11(1)(a)(ii) – Single Segment Travel (No Stops or Return)**
- **If the ticket is restricted to one segment (no stops, no return):**  
  → **$1.50** per segment  
- **In all other circumstances (multi-segment, round-trip, etc.):**  
  → **$3.00** per segment

> *Note: This applies to passenger transportation where the fare is paid or payable after December 31, 1997.*

#### **For Paragraph 11(1)(b) – Ticketed Passenger Travel**
- **If the ticket is restricted to one segment (no stops, no return):**  
  → **$15.00**  
- **In all other circumstances:**  
  → **$30.00**

> *Note: Applies when the passenger completes their own ticket and it is restricted by the carrier’s system to a single segment.*

---

### **2. Flights Beginning on or Before February 28, 1998 (Pre-February 1998 Flights)**

#### **For Subparagraph 11(1)(a)(ii) – Single Segment Travel**
- **If the ticket is restricted to one segment:**  
  → **$3.00**  
- **In all other circumstances:**  
  → **$3.00** *(same as above — no change in rate for non-restricted tickets)*

> *Note: The rate remains $3.00 regardless of ticket restriction in this category.*

#### **For Paragraph 11(1)(b) – Ticketed Passenger Travel**
- **If the ticket is restricted to one segment:**  
  → **$27.50**  
- **In all other circumstances:**  
  → **$55.00**

> *Note: This reflects a higher tax rate for pre-1998 flights, especially for non-restricted tickets.*

---

## **II. Charter Agreements – Paragraph 11(2)(b)**

This section addresses tax on **charter flights**, where a group or entity arranges transportation via a charter agreement.

#### **For Flights Beginning After February 28, 1998**
- **Per emplanement (each passenger boarding):**  
  → **$15.00**  
- *Applies when the amount paid is after December 31, 1997.*

#### **For Flights Beginning on or Before February 28, 1998**
- **Per emplanement (each passenger boarding):**  
  → **$27.50**  
- *Applies to all charter flights occurring on or before February 28, 1998.*

> *Note: The tax per emplanement is consistent with the passenger tax rates for the same flight type and timing.*

---

## **Key Transitional and Timing Provisions**

- **Effective Date:** The Order comes into force on **May 1, 1995**.
- **Fare Payment Deadline:** The tax is assessed based on when the **amount is paid or payable**, not when the flight occurs. Thus:
  - If the fare is paid **after December 31, 1997**, the new rates apply (especially for post-February 1998 flights).
  - If the fare is paid **on or before December 31, 1997**, the **old rates (from 1994)** generally apply — though the 1995 Order supersedes the 1994 Order from May 1, 1995 onward.
- **Emplanement Date Threshold:** The flight’s **start date** (emplanement) determines whether it falls under pre- or post-February 28, 1998 rules.

## **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

1. **Phased Transition:** The Order introduces a **gradual transition** in tax rates, aligning with changes in air travel patterns and pricing structures post-1998.
2. **Differentiation by Ticket Type:** It distinguishes between **restricted (single segment)** and **flexible (multi-segment)** tickets to reflect the complexity and cost of different travel arrangements.
3. **Fairness and Revenue Collection:** The tax is designed to be **proportional to the complexity and cost of the journey**, with lower rates for simple, direct flights and higher rates for complex or long-distance trips.
4. **Charter Tax Adjustment:** The higher tax on pre-1998 charters may reflect a need to maintain revenue during a period of changing aviation demand or market conditions.

## **Legal and Administrative Implications**

- The Order is **binding and enforceable** under the *Excise Tax Act*.
- It applies to all **air transportation services** provided in Canada, including both commercial and charter flights.
- Tax liability is determined at the time of **emplanement** and based on the **payment timing** and **ticket restrictions**.
- The rates are **per segment** or **per emplanement**, depending on the context.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Air Transportation Tax Order, 1995* establishes a comprehensive, time-based, and ticket-type-dependent tax structure for air travel in Canada. It:

- Replaces outdated 1994 rates with updated, more nuanced provisions.
- Introduces **lower taxes for simple, direct flights** (e.g., one-way, no stops).
- Imposes **higher taxes for complex or multi-leg journeys**.
- Applies **different rates for pre- and post-February 1998 flights**, reflecting possible policy shifts in the aviation sector.
- Provides **clear rules for charter flights**, with tax per emplanement.

This regulation ensures that air transportation taxes are **fair, transparent, and aligned with current travel practices**, while maintaining revenue collection for the federal government under the *Excise Tax Act*.
