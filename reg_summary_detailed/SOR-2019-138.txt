**Detailed Summary of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Resolution Planning By-law**

---

### **Overview**

The **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Resolution Planning By-law**, adopted on **March 6, 2019**, and approved by the Minister of Finance on **April 10, 2019**, establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for **domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs)** to develop, maintain, and submit **resolution plans**. These plans are designed to ensure that, in the event of a bank failure, the financial system remains stable by enabling a **smooth, orderly resolution**—without causing widespread disruption or requiring public financial assistance.

This by-law is grounded in **section 11(2)(e)a and 11(2.01)c** of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (CDICA), and it came into force on **May 15, 2019**, following the implementation of *Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1*.

## **Key Definitions**

The by-law introduces several critical definitions to clarify scope and application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (CDICA). |
| **Bank Group** | Includes a domestic systemically important bank and its affiliates, any entity in which it has a substantial investment (as defined under the *Bank Act*), and any business enterprise operated jointly with others (e.g., joint ventures or special purpose vehicles). |
| **Critical Function** | An activity performed by a bank group entity for non-affiliated persons; its failure would adversely affect financial system stability or economic functioning in Canada. |
| **Critical Shared Service** | A shared service (internal or external) supporting one or more business units; its failure would lead to cessation or material risk to critical functions. |
| **Material Change** | Any significant change in the bank group’s legal structure, operations, critical functions/services, material legal entities, or applicable laws/regulations that requires updating the resolution plan. |
| **Material Legal Entity** | A legal entity or branch within the bank group that meets at least one of the following: <br> - Performs a critical function or shared service; <br> - Cessation of operations would prevent implementation of the resolution strategy; <br> - Is a member institution. |
| **Resolution** | The exercise of powers under paragraph 7(d) of the CDICA (or equivalent powers by foreign authorities). |
| **Resolution Plan** | A domestic systemically important bank’s plan outlining how its bank group will be resolved in a way that preserves financial stability. |

7. **Regulatory Requirements**  
   - A list of regulators involved.

   - Continuity of critical functions.

11. **Work Plan**  
   A detailed schedule outlining:
   - Activities for maintaining, validating, and testing the resolution plan;
