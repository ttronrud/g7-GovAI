### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

| **Military Personnel** | Members of a NATO party’s armed forces (including its civilian component) who are attached for administrative service with the Organisation. For this definition, “force” and “civilian component” have the same meanings as in Articles 1(a) and (b) of the *Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)*. |
| **Organisation** | Refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and subsidiary bodies established by the NATO Council under **Article 9 of the North Atlantic Treaty**, excluding military headquarters. |

### **3. Legal Capacity of the Organisation**
- The Organisation is recognized as having the **legal capacity of a corporation**.  
  This enables it to enter into contracts, own property, and be subject to legal obligations, consistent with international law and treaty obligations.

### **4. Privileges and Immunities Granted**

The Order grants specific privileges and immunities under the **Ottawa Agreement** (formally known as the *Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation*), which was adopted in 1961 and forms the legal foundation for the rights of personnel in NATO.

#### **(a) Foreign Representatives of Member States**
- Enjoy privileges and immunities under **Article 13** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- These rights are granted **only to the extent necessary** for the performance of their official duties.

#### **(b) Official Clerical Staff Accompanying Foreign Representatives**
- Enjoy privileges and immunities under **Article 14** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- These are also limited to what is necessary for carrying out official duties.

#### **(c) International Civilian and Military Personnel**
- Enjoy privileges and immunities under **Articles 18 and 19** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- These are granted **to the extent required for the exercise of their functions**.

#### **(d) Senior Personnel (Grade G22 or Equivalent Rank)**
- International civilian personnel at **Grade G22 or above** and military personnel of **equivalent rank** enjoy the privileges and immunities under **Article 20** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- This provision applies only when necessary for the performance of their duties.

#### **(e) Temporary Personnel Assigned to DIANA**
- Personnel temporarily assigned to **DIANA (Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic)** — a subsidiary body established under Article 9 of the NATO Treaty — are granted privileges and immunities under **Articles 18 and 19** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- This ensures that temporary staff can perform their roles without undue legal or administrative barriers.

> **Note**: DIANA is a key innovation-focused entity within NATO, and this provision recognizes its operational importance.

#### **(f) Family Members of Personnel**
- Family members forming part of the household of:
  - Temporary personnel,
  - International civilian personnel,
  - Military personnel  
  are entitled to the privileges and immunities set out in **paragraphs (b) and (d) of Article 18** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- This includes rights such as exemption from certain local laws, protection from arbitrary interference, and access to certain services.

#### **(g) Experts**
- Experts (as defined in Article 21 of the Ottawa Agreement) who are:
  - Nationals of a NATO party,
  - Employed on missions on behalf of the Organisation  
  are granted privileges and immunities under **Article 21**.
- These rights are limited to what is necessary for the performance of their expert functions.

#### **(h) Canadian Citizens**
- Canadian citizens are **not granted privileges and immunities beyond those specified in Articles 19 and 23** of the Ottawa Agreement.
- This reflects a principle of **non-discrimination** and ensures that Canadian citizens do not receive broader benefits than other nationals, while still allowing for limited protections under the agreement.

---

### **5. Purpose and Limitations**

- **Privileges and immunities are not personal benefits**.  
  They are granted **in the interest of the Organisation** to facilitate its operations, promote neutrality, ensure effective functioning, and maintain diplomatic and administrative continuity.

- **Waiver of Immunity**:
  - Under **Article 22 of the Ottawa Agreement**, the Organisation has the **right and duty to waive immunity** if:
    1. The immunity would **impede the course of justice** (e.g., in criminal or civil proceedings), and  
    2. The waiver does **not prejudice the interests of the Organisation**.
  - This provides a mechanism for accountability and legal compliance without undermining the operational integrity of the Organisation.
