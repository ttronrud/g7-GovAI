**Detailed Summary of the Brokering Permits Regulations (S.C. 2006, c. 13, s. 115; R.S. 1985, c. E-19)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Brokering Permits Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued under the authority of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA), specifically pursuant to **paragraph 12(a)(a)** of that Act. These regulations establish the detailed requirements for applying for a **brokering permit**, which allows individuals or organizations to act as intermediaries in the export or import of certain goods or technologies that are subject to export controls due to their potential for misuse (e.g., in weapons, dual-use technologies, or sensitive items).

These regulations were enacted to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with Canada’s international obligations—particularly in relation to the control of sensitive items—by requiring comprehensive and specific information from applicants during the brokering permit application process.

### **Conclusion**

The *Brokering Permits Regulations* represent a critical component of Canada’s export control regime. By mandating detailed, transparent, and technically accurate information in brokering applications, they help ensure that sensitive goods and technologies—especially those with potential for misuse—are not diverted to unauthorized or high-risk end-users. These rules are essential for upholding national security, international non-proliferation standards, and Canada’s compliance with global trade and arms control agreements.

They reflect a balanced approach: enabling legitimate commercial brokering activities while maintaining robust controls to prevent the illicit flow of sensitive materials.
