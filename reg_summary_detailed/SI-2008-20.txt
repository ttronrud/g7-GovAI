This indicates that a specific regulation (or set of regulations) was **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2011-14**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally **repealed**.
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2011-14 (SI 2011/14), which is a piece of secondary legislation introduced by a government department to amend or remove existing laws.
- **Section of Repeal**: Section 5 of SI 2011/14 specifically includes the repeal of the referenced regulation(s).
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or provisions previously established by the regulation have been **terminated** and are no longer applicable under current law. Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the new or amended legislation that succeeded it (if any), or to the relevant provisions that remain in force.

### Notes:
- The repetition of the same line six times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error. It does not imply that multiple distinct regulations were repealed — rather, it likely reflects a technical or digital duplication.
- Without the original text of the regulation being repealed, a detailed substantive summary (e.g., its content, scope, purpose) cannot be provided. The only available information is that it was formally removed by SI 2011/14, section 5.
- To fully understand the context, one would need to consult the original regulation (which is now obsolete) and the full text of SI 2011/14, particularly section 5.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **repealed by Statutory Instrument 2011/14, section 5**, and is therefore **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its content, purpose, and application have been superseded or removed by the legislation of 2011. A detailed summary of its original provisions cannot be provided due to the lack of the original text and the fact that it is now repealed.

For further research, one should consult the official legislative database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk) to access the full text of SI 2011/14 and identify the specific regulation(s) repealed under section 5.
