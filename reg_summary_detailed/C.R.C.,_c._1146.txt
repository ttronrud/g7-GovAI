**Detailed Summary of the *Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Storage Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Storage Regulations** and may be cited as such. These rules establish safety, design, location, and operational standards for the storage of **anhydrous ammonia** (dry ammonia gas in liquid form) on railway property.

> **Note**: Anhydrous ammonia is *not* the same as aqua ammonia, which is a solution of ammonia in water.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several critical terms used throughout:

- **Anhydrous Ammonia**: Liquid ammonia gas (not dissolved in water).
- **Design Pressure**: Equivalent to *Maximum Allowable Working Pressure* (MAWP) as defined in the **ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code**.
- **Filling Density**: A percentage calculated by dividing the maximum allowable weight of anhydrous ammonia in a tank by the water capacity of the tank (measured at **60°F**) and multiplying by 100. This ensures safe loading without overfilling.
- **Main Track**: A track operated under timetable, train order, or block signaling; used for regular train operations.
- **Owning or Operating Company**: The entity that owns or operates the facility, as authorized by the Commission through a railway company.
- **Private Track**: A track not owned by the carrier, either because it's leased or used exclusively by a user under written agreement—treated as equivalent to ownership.
- **Team Track**: A railway track used for loading/unloading by **multiple companies** or users.
- **Shall** = Mandatory requirement  
  **Should** = Recommendation (not enforceable)

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
- Applies to **stationary bulk storage facilities** for anhydrous ammonia located on **railway right-of-way or leased land** under the jurisdiction of the Commission.
- Applies to:
  - New installations
  - Additions or modifications to existing installations
- **Effective Date**: February 1, 1965
- **Exception**: Installations already in operation before February 1, 1965 must comply with these regulations, and if ordered by the Commission, must also meet requirements for **location, construction, and design**.

> **Exemption Clause**: Installations with a total water capacity **not exceeding 2,000 Imperial gallons** (measured at 60°F) are exempt from this Part, provided they meet all other applicable requirements.

---

#### Required Profile Content:
- Elevation of installation relative to:
  - Loading/unloading track
  - Main track within 200 feet of nearest tank
- A **second profile** is required if:
  - Drainage direction needs to be shown
  - Major features require clearer depiction

#### Notes/Legends Must Include:
- Evidence from the **Provincial Fire Marshal** or local authority that they have **no objection** to the installation (e.g., signed plan or letter)
- Statement that **tank design** has been approved by the **Pressure Vessel Inspection Branch** of the province before fabrication
- Size, contents, and water capacity (in Imperial gallons) of all tanks
- Type and construction of buildings (pumphouses, compressor houses, etc.)
- Type of motive power (e.g., electric, diesel) for pumps/compressors
- Whether tracks are **team tracks** or **private tracks**

> After approval, the railway must **retain copies of all drawings** for the **life of the facility** and for **at least two years after decommissioning**.

---

### **5. Minimum Distances from Rail Tracks and Structures**
All storage tanks must be located at **minimum distances** from rail tracks and other structures:

| Feature | Minimum Distance |
|--------|------------------|
| From **any track** (measured from gauge side of rail to nearest point on tank shell) | **20 feet** |
| From **main track** | **50 feet** (measured from gauge side of nearest rail to tank shell) |
| From **adjacent track not serving installation** | Same as main track (50 feet if adjacent track is main track; 20 feet otherwise) |

> **Note**: For **provincial highways**, recommended distance is **half** the distance required for main tracks.

---

### **6. Distances from Nearby Buildings and Public Areas**
#### For Tanks > 2,000 Imperial Gallons:
- **300 feet** from:
  - Stations, office buildings, or other public assembly places on railway property
  - Schools, hospitals, theatres, residential areas, or similar places of public assembly
- **150 feet** from:
  - Engine houses, railway shops, grain elevators, or similar buildings

#### For Tanks ≤ 2,000 Imperial Gallons:
- **50 feet** from public assembly buildings (stations, schools, hospitals, etc.)
