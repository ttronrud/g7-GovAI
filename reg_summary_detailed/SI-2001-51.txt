The regulation in question is a formal administrative transfer of authority within the Canadian federal public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. Here is a detailed summary:

---

**Title of Regulation:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of The Leadership Network

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of specific parts of the public service between different government offices or departments.

**Subject of Transfer:**  
The Leadership Network — a component of the federal public service responsible for developing, supporting, and managing leadership talent within the departmental and organizational structure of the federal government.

**Transfer Details:**  
- The control and supervision of The Leadership Network are being transferred from the **Prime Minister** to the **President of the Treasury Board**.  
- This transfer involves not only administrative oversight but also strategic direction, policy development, and operational management of the Leadership Network.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
1. **Alignment with Treasury Board Responsibilities:**  
   The President of the Treasury Board is the principal officer responsible for overseeing the management of the federal public service, including human resources, performance, and leadership development. This transfer places leadership talent development under a more centralized and service-wide governance structure, ensuring consistency in leadership standards across departments.

2. **Enhanced Service-Wide Leadership Development:**  
   By moving leadership oversight to the Treasury Board, the government aims to strengthen a coordinated, national approach to identifying, developing, and deploying public service leaders. This supports the broader goals of public service reform, accountability, and effectiveness.

3. **Improved Accountability and Oversight:**  
   The President of the Treasury Board has established reporting lines and accountability mechanisms to the Minister of Public Services and Procurement, as well as to the Governor in Council. This ensures that the Leadership Network operates under clear governance and performance expectations.

4. **Strategic Integration with Public Service Reform:**  
   The move reflects a broader effort to modernize the public service by strengthening internal capacity, promoting diversity in leadership, and aligning leadership pipelines with national priorities and organizational goals.

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the text, such transfers typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon formal notification to relevant stakeholders.

**Key Stakeholders Affected:**  
- The Prime Minister (as the former holder of control)  
- The President of the Treasury Board (as the new holder of control)  
- Public service leadership programs, training initiatives, and talent development units within the Leadership Network  
- Departmental heads and human resources officers who implement leadership programs

**No Change in Functionality:**  
The actual operations, programs, and services delivered by The Leadership Network remain unchanged. The transfer is purely a shift in administrative and supervisory responsibility, not a reorganization of personnel or functions.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a strategic realignment within the federal public service to strengthen leadership development at a national level. By transferring oversight of The Leadership Network from the Prime Minister to the President of the Treasury Board, the government ensures that leadership talent development is integrated into the broader public service management framework, enhancing consistency, accountability, and service performance across departments.
