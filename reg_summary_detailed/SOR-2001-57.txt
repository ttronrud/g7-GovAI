**Detailed Summary of the Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to:

- **Section 435.1a** and  
- **Paragraph 463(a)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCAA)*.

These provisions empower the federal government to establish specific rules governing the types of information that must be treated as **supervisory information** and are subject to confidentiality requirements for cooperative credit associations (CCAs) and their affiliates.

The regulations are formally enacted under:
- **S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 117** (amendment to the CCAA)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 48** (original enactment)

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Define what constitutes **prescribed supervisory information** for cooperative credit associations (CCAs) and their affiliates.
- Establish clear rules regarding **confidentiality** of such information.
- Ensure that supervisory bodies (e.g., the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) can effectively monitor and regulate CCAs by protecting sensitive financial and operational data from unauthorized disclosure.

This framework supports effective **prudential supervision**, risk management, and regulatory oversight while balancing the need for transparency in certain circumstances.

### **3. What Constitutes Supervisory Information?**

#### **A. For the Association Itself (Under Section 435.1 of the CCAA)**

The following information is classified as **prescribed supervisory information** and must be kept confidential:

1. **Financial Condition Ratings**  
   - Any rating assigned by the **Superintendent** to assess the financial health of the association.  
   - Any other rating that is **substantially based on information obtained from the Superintendent** (e.g., creditworthiness, risk exposure, capital adequacy).

2. **Stages of Intervention**  
   - Any stage of intervention assigned to the association based on the **Guide to Intervention for Federal Financial Institutions**.  
   - This includes early warning signals, corrective actions, or intervention steps taken when an association faces financial distress or systemic risk.

3. **Orders, Agreements, or Directions**  
   - Any **order** issued under **subsection 409(3)** of the CCAA (e.g., winding up, restructuring).  
   - Any **prudential agreement** entered into under **section 438.1** (e.g., capital requirements, governance changes).  
   - Any **direction** issued under **section 439** (e.g., operational restrictions, reporting obligations).

4. **Reports and Recommendations**  
   - Any **report prepared by or at the request of the Superintendent** during annual or special examinations or supervisory reviews.  
   - Any **recommendation made by the Superintendent** based on those reviews.  
   - Includes **correspondence** between the Superintendent and the association’s directors or officers related to these reports or recommendations.

> These items are considered critical to assessing financial stability and regulatory compliance and are therefore protected under confidentiality rules.

#### **B. For Affiliates of the Association**

If the association has an **affiliate** (e.g., a bank, insurance company, or holding company), the following rules apply:

The supervisory information for the affiliate is determined based on applicable federal regulations governing that type of financial institution:

| Type of Affiliate | Relevant Regulation |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Bank (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations* |
| Authorized Foreign Bank (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* |
| Insurance Company (subject to Insurance Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations* |
| Trust and Loan Company (subject to Trust and Loan Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* |
| Bank Holding Company (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* |
| Insurance Holding Company (subject to Insurance Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* |

> This ensures that the regulatory framework is consistent with the specific supervisory standards applicable to each type of affiliate.

### **4. Confidentiality Requirements**

#### **General Prohibition on Disclosure (Section 3 and 4)**

- **An association shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose any information referred to in Section 1 (i.e., the prescribed supervisory information)**.
- This includes:
  - Ratings
  - Intervention stages
  - Orders, agreements, or directions
  - Reports and recommendations

> The confidentiality requirement applies to all forms of disclosure—written, oral, electronic, or otherwise.

#### **Permitted Exceptions to Confidentiality**

Under specific conditions, disclosure is allowed:

1. **Disclosure to Affiliates, Directors, Officers, Employees, Auditors, Securities Underwriters, or Legal Advisors**

     - Its **auditors**
     - **Securities underwriters**

2. **Disclosure of Material Facts or Changes (Paragraph 1(1)(c))**  
   - An association or its affiliate may disclose information under **paragraph 1(1)(c)** (which includes reports, ratings, or intervention stages) **if**:
     - The information contains a **material fact or material change**.
     - Such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., provincial or federal securities regulations).
   - This exception allows for compliance with market transparency obligations while still protecting sensitive internal supervisory data.

> This provision balances regulatory confidentiality with public accountability and investor protection under securities laws.

### **Conclusion**

The *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* establish a clear, legally grounded framework for managing the flow of sensitive financial and supervisory data within cooperative credit associations and their affiliates. By defining what constitutes supervisory information and setting strict confidentiality standards, the regulations:

- Strengthen financial oversight,
- Protect the integrity of the cooperative credit system,
- Ensure timely intervention in cases of financial distress,
- And maintain compliance with both prudential and securities law requirements.

These regulations reflect a balanced approach—protecting confidential information while allowing necessary disclosures for accountability and market transparency.
