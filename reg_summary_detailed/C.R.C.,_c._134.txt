**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Turkey Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
This regulation is formally titled the *Alberta Turkey Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader legislative framework of Alberta’s agricultural marketing regulations.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in its application:

- **"Act"**: Refers to *The Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of Alberta* (French: *Loi*). This is the primary legislation that establishes the legal foundation for the regulation of agricultural product marketing in Alberta, including turkeys.

- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to the *Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board* (French: *Office de commercialisation*), an entity established under the Act to oversee and regulate the marketing of turkeys in Alberta. Its role includes setting prices, managing market conditions, and ensuring fair practices among producers.

- **"Turkey"**: Defined as any turkey—regardless of variety, grade, or class—that is **raised or kept for slaughter within the Province of Alberta** and is **sold for slaughter**. This definition establishes the scope of the Order, limiting its applicability to turkeys produced and marketed within Alberta’s jurisdiction.

---

**3. Regulatory Authority and Scope**  
The Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board is granted specific powers to regulate the **interprovincial and export trade** of turkeys. This means the Board can manage how turkeys are marketed beyond Alberta’s borders and in trade with other provinces or internationally.

Importantly, the Board is authorized to **exercise all or any powers** it would have under **Section 11.1 of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act**—specifically those related to local marketing of turkeys—**in the context of interprovincial and export trade**. This allows the Board to apply similar mechanisms (e.g., pricing, classification, levies) to out-of-province and export markets as it does domestically.

**4. Powers to Impose Levies and Charges**  
A central component of the Order grants the Commodity Board the authority to:

- **Make orders** that:
  - Fix **levies or charges**;
  - Impose such levies or charges;
  - Collect them from individuals or entities engaged in **the production or marketing of turkeys** within Alberta.

- **Classify producers into groups** based on factors such as scale of operation, type of production, or marketing activity.  
- **Set different levies or charges** for different producer groups. For example, small farms may be charged less than large-scale operations.

This classification ensures that the financial burden is distributed fairly and proportionally, taking into account the varying capacities and roles of producers.

---

**5. Purpose and Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through levies and charges are not restricted in their use. The Commodity Board may use these funds for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to act as a financial buffer during market downturns);
- **Payment of expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of turkeys (e.g., marketing costs, price fluctuations, or poor market conditions);
- **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among turkey producers.  
  This means that if some producers benefit from high sales prices during a given period, the Board can redistribute those surplus funds to others who may have experienced lower returns, promoting equity in the industry.

- The Board may apply these adjustments or equalization measures **over specific periods or timeframes** it determines, allowing flexibility in response to market dynamics.

---

**6. Legal Basis and Enforcement**  
The powers granted in this Order are derived from **Section 3 of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act**, which empowers the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of agricultural products. The Order operationalizes this authority specifically for turkeys in the context of interprovincial and export trade.

The Board may issue binding orders that apply to **persons and property located within Alberta**, ensuring that the regulatory framework is enforceable within the province.

---

**7. Significance and Objectives**  
The Alberta Turkey Order aims to:

- Ensure stable and equitable market conditions for turkey producers;
- Provide financial protection during volatile market periods;
- Facilitate fair competition and market access in interprovincial and export markets;
- Promote long-term sustainability of the turkey industry in Alberta by managing price volatility and risk-sharing.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Alberta Turkey Order* is a targeted regulatory tool that empowers the Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board to manage the marketing of turkeys beyond provincial borders. By allowing the Board to classify producers, impose tiered levies, and use collected funds for reserves, loss coverage, and revenue equalization, the Order strengthens the resilience and fairness of the turkey industry in Alberta. It reflects a balanced approach to market regulation—protecting producers while enabling efficient trade and export participation.
