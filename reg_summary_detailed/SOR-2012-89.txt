**Detailed Summary of General Export Permit No. 43 – Nuclear Goods and Technology to Certain Destinations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
This permit is issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada**, under **subsection 7(1.1)a of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA)**.  
- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - *S.C. 2004, c. 15, s. 56*  
  - *R.S., c. E-19* (the Export and Import Permits Act)

This provision allows the Minister to issue general export permits for specific goods and technologies when they are deemed to serve legitimate international purposes and do not pose a risk to national security or non-proliferation objectives.

---

### **2. Permit Number and Effective Date**
- **Permit Number**: General Export Permit No. 43 (GEP-43 or LGE-43)  
- **Effective Date**: The day on which it is officially registered with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFIT).

---

### **3. Definitions**
Key terms used in the permit:

- **Eligible Destination**:  
  A list of countries to which nuclear goods or technology may be exported under this permit. These include:
  - Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,  
  - Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,  
  - Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,  
  - Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal,  
  - Republic of Korea (South Korea), Spain, Sweden,  
  - Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States.

> *Note*: Exports are only permitted to these countries. No exports to countries on the **Area Control List** (which includes countries deemed high-risk due to proliferation concerns) are authorized.

- **Guide**:  
  Refers to the *Export Control List (ECL)*, specifically **Section 1**, which provides detailed descriptions and classifications of controlled goods and technologies. The "Guide" defines what constitutes a "nuclear good or technology" and categorizes them by group.

---

### **4. Scope of the Permit**
Under this permit, **any Canadian resident** may export from Canada to any eligible destination:

- Any **good or technology listed in Group 3** of the Schedule to the Export Control List — **provided** that:
  - It is **not** one of the items listed in **any other group** of the Schedule.
  - It is **not** specifically prohibited under **item 3-2.1.1 or 3-2.1.2 of the Guide**.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> Paragraph (1)(a) of the EIPA does not apply if the export of goods or technologies from *any other group* in the Export Control List is authorized by a separate permit issued under subsection 7(1.1) of the EIPA.

This means that even if a particular item falls under a different group (e.g., dual-use or chemical weapons-related), it may still be exported under this permit *only if* a specific permit covers that item.

---

### **5. Prohibited Exports**
This permit **explicitly does not authorize**:
1. Exports to any country listed on the **Area Control List** (e.g., countries with known nuclear proliferation risks or non-compliance with international obligations).
2. Exports of goods or technologies **not intended for end-use in an eligible destination**.

> This ensures that exported items are used solely for peaceful, non-military, and non-proliferation-sensitive purposes within the designated countries.

---

### **6. Conditions of the Permit**

#### **(a) Mandatory Registration and Contact Information**
Before making the **first export in a calendar year**, the exporter must submit the following information to the **Export Controls Division (ECD)** of DFIT:
- Full name, address, telephone number, and fax/e-mail address of the exporter.
- In the case of a corporation:  
  - Name and contact details (address, phone, fax, email) of a designated contact person.

> This enables DFIT to monitor compliance and maintain a record of exporters.

#### **(b) Requirement for Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Licence**
All exports must be accompanied by a **valid licence issued by the CNSC** under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*.  
- This licence must be presented to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** **before or at the time of export**.

> This ensures that nuclear materials or technologies are only exported when they are legally and safely authorized under Canadian nuclear safety regulations.

#### **(c) Recordkeeping Requirements**
Exporters must retain detailed records for **six years** after the calendar year in which the export occurred. These records must include:
1. The **item in the Guide** that describes the good or technology exported.
2. The **quantity and value** of each item exported.
3. The **date of export**.
4. The **eligible destination** to which it was exported.
5. The **name and address** of the recipient.

> These records are essential for audits, compliance checks, and potential investigations into export activities.

#### **(d) Reporting Obligations to DFIT**
Exporters must respond within **15 days** of receiving a written request from the Export Controls Division with the following information:
- A **description of each good or technology exported**, including the relevant **item number in the Guide**.
- The **quantity and value** of each export, **grouped by country of destination**.

> This allows DFIT to monitor export patterns and ensure alignment with national security and non-proliferation policies.

#### **(e) Customs Reporting Requirement**
If the exported good or technology is subject to reporting under the **Customs Act**, the exporter must insert either:
- **“GEP-43”** or  
- **“LGE-43”**

in the appropriate field of the required customs form.

> This ensures that the export is properly tracked through customs systems and linked to the general permit.

### **7. Purpose and Policy Context**
This permit is designed to:
- Facilitate **peaceful international cooperation** in the fields of nuclear energy, medicine, and research.
- Support **scientific and technological exchange** with countries that have strong regulatory frameworks and a commitment to peaceful uses of nuclear technology.

### **8. Key Limitations and Safeguards**
| Limitation | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| Excludes exports to Area Control List countries | Prevents access to high-risk nations |
| Excludes items in other groups of the ECL | Avoids unauthorized dual-use or sensitive items |
| Excludes non-eligible end-use | Ensures goods are not diverted to military or prohibited uses |

### **Conclusion**
General Export Permit No. 43 (GEP-43) provides a **structured, transparent, and secure framework** for Canadian exporters to share nuclear goods and technologies with select, vetted countries. It balances the benefits of international scientific collaboration with the imperative to prevent nuclear proliferation and ensure national and global security.

It is a **non-exclusive, general permit** that applies to a wide range of Group 3 items in the Export Control List — but with strict conditions, oversight, and compliance obligations to ensure responsible use.

This permit is a key tool in Canada’s export control regime, reinforcing its role as a responsible steward of nuclear technology in the global community.
