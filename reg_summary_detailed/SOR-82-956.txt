**Detailed Summary of the Special Status Order, 1982**

**Regulatory Authority and Context:**

The *Special Status Order, 1982* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act* (COCD Act), specifically pursuant to **subsection 45(6)** of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources—to declare certain individuals, corporations, or entities as having a "special status" for the purposes of determining ownership and control in the context of Canadian ownership and control assessments.

The primary objective of such declarations is to provide a legal mechanism for recognizing entities that, due to their unique structural, historical, or economic characteristics, may not be subject to standard ownership and control determinations under the Act. This allows for a more nuanced and equitable assessment of control, particularly when an entity is closely tied to a Canadian jurisdiction, a Crown entity, or a government-owned enterprise.

**Purpose of the Order:**

The Order serves to formally recognize specific entities as having a "special status" within the meaning of subsection 45(6) of the COCD Act. This special status may affect how ownership and control are evaluated in regulatory, financial, or policy contexts—particularly in relation to foreign investment, national security, or economic policy considerations. It ensures that these entities are not treated as foreign-controlled or subject to the same scrutiny as other private corporations, especially if they are deemed to have significant Canadian ownership, operational ties, or strategic importance.

**List of Entities Declared to Have Special Status:**

The following entities are officially declared to have special status under this Order:

1. **Caisse de dépôt et de placement du Québec (CDPQ)**  
   – A major Quebec-based pension fund and one of Canada’s largest institutional investors.  
   – Declared to have special status due to its significant role in Canadian financial markets, its public mandate, and its long-standing investment in Canadian energy and infrastructure.  
   – The designation recognizes its Canadian character and its non-commercial, public-interest orientation.

2. **Canterra Energy Ltd.**  
   – A Canadian energy company involved in exploration and development of oil and gas resources.  
   – Declared to have special status due to its Canadian ownership structure and its role in the domestic energy sector.  
   – This recognition may influence how foreign investors or entities assess control over Canterra in the context of Canadian ownership rules.

3. **Nova Scotia Resources (Ventures) Ltd.**  
   – A provincial-level energy venture company operating primarily in Nova Scotia.  
   – The declaration acknowledges its regional significance and strong ties to the Canadian energy sector, particularly in Atlantic Canada.  
   – This status may provide protection or exemption from certain ownership thresholds that would otherwise apply.

4. **Petro-Canada Limited**  
   – A Canadian state-owned energy company established under the federal government’s ownership framework.  
   – Declared to have special status due to its status as a Crown corporation and its direct link to the federal government’s energy policy.  
   – This recognition reinforces its distinct legal and operational status, shielding it from standard private ownership control rules.

5. **Petro-Canada Exploration Inc.**  
   – A subsidiary or affiliated entity of Petro-Canada Limited, focused on exploration activities.  
   – Given its operational link to Petro-Canada and its Canadian ownership, it is similarly recognized under special status.  
   – This ensures consistency in ownership and control assessments across related entities.

6. **Société québécoise d’initiatives pétrolières (SQIP)**  
   – A Quebec-based oil and gas initiative company, established to promote energy development in Quebec.  
   – Declared to have special status due to its regional focus, government support, and role in advancing Canada’s energy diversification.  
   – This status supports its role as a key player in the Canadian energy landscape.

7. **Exploration SOQUIP Inc.**  
   – A company involved in oil and gas exploration, likely operating in partnership with or under the oversight of Quebec-based energy initiatives.  
   – Recognized for its Canadian roots, operational focus, and alignment with national energy strategies.  
   – The special status helps ensure it is not subject to foreign control scrutiny under standard ownership rules.

**Legal and Policy Implications:**

- **Exemption from Standard Ownership Rules**: Entities declared under this Order are generally exempt from the application of standard ownership and control thresholds that would otherwise apply to foreign-owned or private corporations.
- **Enhanced Canadian Sovereignty**: The Order supports national interest objectives by reinforcing the Canadian government’s control over key energy and investment entities.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: While these entities are granted special status, the Order maintains transparency by listing them explicitly and providing a clear legal basis for their designation.
- **Policy Consistency**: The declaration aligns with broader federal and provincial energy strategies, particularly in promoting domestic energy development and ensuring energy security.

**Citation and Legal Status:**

The Order is formally titled:  
**The Special Status Order, 1982**  
It may be cited as such and is binding under the authority of the *Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act*.

**Date and Issuance:**

The Order was issued on **1982**, reflecting a period of increased government involvement in energy sector regulation and national ownership policy. It was promulgated in response to evolving economic and geopolitical dynamics, particularly the need to ensure Canadian control over strategic energy assets.

**Conclusion:**

The *Special Status Order, 1982* is a foundational regulatory instrument that provides formal recognition to key Canadian energy and investment entities. By declaring these seven organizations as having "special status," the Order ensures they are treated differently in ownership and control assessments—affirming their Canadian character, strategic importance, and alignment with national energy and economic policy objectives. This mechanism remains relevant today as Canada continues to navigate energy security, foreign investment, and national control in critical sectors.
