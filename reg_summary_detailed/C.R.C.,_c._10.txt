### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |

### **3. Scope of Compensation**

#### **Eligible Situations for Compensation**
Compensation is payable **only** when:
- An **employee** dies or is injured **directly** as a result of a **non-scheduled flight** undertaken **in the course of their duties**, or
- A **civil aviation inspector** dies or is injured **as a result of a flight** undertaken for one of the following purposes:
  - Determining the competency of flight crew personnel;
  - Inspecting commercial air operations;
  - Monitoring in-flight cabin procedures.

> *Note: The flight must be directly related to the employee’s or inspector’s official duties.*

#### **Amount of Compensation**
The compensation amount is equal to the **pension** that would have been awarded to the deceased or injured person under the *Pension Act*, based on:
- **Schedule A or B** of the Pension Act (depending on the employee’s category),
- **Increased** by any applicable adjustments under **Part V.1** of the Pension Act (which accounts for inflation or other cost-of-living adjustments, similar to those applied in military service pensions).

> This amount is **equivalent to what would have been paid in the case of a peace-time military service injury or death**, providing a parallel compensation structure.

---

### **4. Exclusions from Compensation**

No compensation is payable in the following cases:
- If the death or injury is covered by **another Act** (e.g., workers’ compensation, disability, or pension schemes), **unless** the claimant **explicitly elects** to accept compensation under these regulations instead.
- If the injury or death results from:
  - A **self-inflicted wound**;
  - Any action by the individual that **endangered the safety** of the flight process.

> These exclusions emphasize that the regulations do not cover intentional or reckless behavior.

### **5. Recovery of Damages and Its Impact on Compensation**

If a legal liability exists (e.g., a third party is found legally responsible), and **damages are recovered** (paid to the claimant or their estate):

#### **Rule 1: Recovery Threshold**
- If **half of the recovered amount** is **greater than** the **capitalized value** of the compensation that would otherwise be payable:
  - **No compensation** is paid under these regulations.

> *Example:* If the capitalized value of compensation is $1 million, and half of the recovered damages ($500,000) exceeds that, no compensation is issued.

#### **Rule 2: Recovery Below Threshold**
- If **half of the recovered amount** is **less than** the capitalized value of the compensation:
  - Compensation is paid in an amount that, when capitalized, **equals the difference** between the recovered amount and the capitalized compensation.

> *Example:* If half the recovery is $400,000, and the capitalized value is $1 million, the difference is $600,000. Compensation is paid to cover the shortfall.

#### **Rule 3: Payment to Her Majesty**
- If any portion of the recovered damages is paid to **Her Majesty (the Crown)**:
  - Compensation is paid in an amount that, when capitalized, equals the amount paid to the Crown.
  - However, **this amount cannot exceed** the total compensation that would otherwise be payable under the regulations.

> This ensures that the Crown does not benefit from the recovery and that compensation remains within the bounds of the regulation.

---

### **6. Funeral Expense Compensation**

In addition to death or injury compensation, the regulations provide for **funeral expense reimbursement** in the following cases:
- An employee dies as a direct result of a non-scheduled flight in the course of duty.
- A civil aviation inspector dies as a result of a flight performed in the course of their official duties.

> The amount is equal to what would have been payable under the **Government Employees Compensation Act** *if* the claimant had not elected to accept compensation under these regulations and had instead made a claim under that Act.

> This ensures that funeral costs are covered regardless of the choice between Acts.

---

### **7. Administration and Enforcement**

- **Adjudication**: All claims must be adjudicated by the **Canadian Pension Commission**.
- **Payment**: All compensation payments are made directly by the **Canadian Pension Commission**.

> This centralizes the process, ensuring consistency, transparency, and uniformity in decision-making.

---

### **8. Key Principles and Intent**

The regulations aim to:
- Provide **fair and equitable compensation** to public servants and aviation inspectors who suffer death or injury due to work-related flights.
- Maintain a **parallel structure** to military service compensation (via Part V.1 of the Pension Act), recognizing the risks involved in aviation duties.
- Prevent **double compensation** by excluding claims already covered by other legislation, unless explicitly elected.
- Ensure **financial prudence** by adjusting compensation based on recoveries from third-party liability.
- Protect against **self-inflicted harm** or reckless conduct.
- Ensure **funeral costs** are covered, reflecting the human and financial impact of such tragedies.

### **Conclusion**

The *Flying Accidents Compensation Regulations* provide a **targeted, fair, and legally sound** mechanism for compensating public servants and civil aviation inspectors who suffer death or injury due to work-related flights. The regulations balance **financial responsibility**, **risk exposure**, and **equity**, while ensuring that compensation is not duplicated and is responsive to third-party liability. By aligning compensation with military service standards and incorporating recovery mechanisms, the rules reflect both the dangers of aviation work and the need for responsible, transparent compensation policy.
