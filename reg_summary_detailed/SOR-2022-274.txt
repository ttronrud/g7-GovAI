**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Order Prohibiting Certain Activities in Arctic Offshore Waters, 2022"**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

This regulation, formally titled *The Order Prohibiting Certain Activities in Arctic Offshore Waters, 2022*, is a legal instrument issued by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Northern Affairs**. It establishes a **prohibition on all oil and gas exploration and development activities** in specific **Canadian Arctic offshore waters**, under the authority of the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* and related statutes.

The Order is grounded in Canada’s commitment to environmental protection, Indigenous rights, climate change mitigation, and sustainable development in the Arctic. It reflects the broader policy framework established in the **United States-Canada Joint Arctic Leaders’ Statement (December 20, 2016)**, which declared that **all Canadian Arctic waters are indefinitely off-limits to future offshore oil and gas licensing**—a policy known as the **Arctic moratorium**.

---

### **2. Key Provisions and Legal Basis**

#### **a. Legal Authority**
- The Order is made under **subsection 12(1)b of the Canada Petroleum Resources Act (C.P.R.A.)**, which allows the Governor in Council to prohibit certain activities in frontier lands where the Minister of Northern Affairs has administrative responsibility for natural resources.
- It is supported by **Section 85(1) of the Canada Petroleum Resources Act (S.C. 2019, c. 19)**, which enables the government to impose moratoria on offshore resource development.
- The regulation is also referenced in the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act* (R.S., c. O-7) and the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* (R.S., c. 36, 2nd Supp.).

#### **b. Scope of Prohibition**
- **Prohibited Activities**: Any person—including **license holders** or **interest owners** listed in the Schedule to the Order—is **prohibited from commencing or continuing** any work or activity authorized under the *Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act*.
- **Geographic Scope**: The prohibition applies to **frontier lands situated in Canadian Arctic offshore waters**.
- **Administrative Responsibility**: The prohibition applies only to areas where the **Minister of Northern Affairs** has administrative responsibility for natural resources.

#### **c. Exclusions and Specificity**
- The Order does **not** apply to existing activities already underway before the date of registration.
- It specifically **does not** apply to activities that are already licensed or under active development, unless those activities are directly related to the moratorium zone.
- The prohibition is **not a blanket ban on all Arctic development**, but rather a **temporary moratorium** on new work or activities in designated offshore waters.

### **3. Policy Rationale and Background**

#### **a. The Arctic Moratorium (2016 Statement)**
- In December 2016, Canada and the United States jointly announced a moratorium on new offshore oil and gas licensing in the Canadian Arctic.
- This moratorium is **not permanent**; it is **reviewed every five years** through a comprehensive, science-based life-cycle assessment that includes:
  - Climate and marine science data
  - Indigenous knowledge and traditional practices
  - Socio-economic impacts on Indigenous communities and Northern populations
- The review process is designed to ensure that decisions about Arctic development are informed by **up-to-date scientific evidence**, **environmental sustainability**, and **Indigenous rights and perspectives**.

#### **b. Stakeholder Engagement**
- The **Inuvialuit Regional Corporation**, **Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated**, and the **governments of Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut** have jointly developed the assessment framework for the review.
- The government is actively engaging with:
  - Indigenous rights holders
  - Affected Northern communities
  - Environmental organizations
  - Scientific experts
  - Industry stakeholders
- This ensures that the review process is **inclusive, transparent, and culturally sensitive**.

---

### **4. Duration and Repeal**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (typically within days of publication in the Canada Gazette).
- It is **scheduled to be repealed on December 31, 2028**.
- This five-year timeline aligns with the **review cycle** established in the 2016 Joint Statement, allowing for a structured and timely evaluation of whether future offshore development should be permitted.

> **Note**: The Order is explicitly stated to be **repealed on December 31, 2028**, meaning that the moratorium will **automatically end** unless a new decision is made to extend or modify it through a formal review process.

---

### **5. Significance and Implications**

#### **Environmental Protection**
- The moratorium helps protect the fragile Arctic ecosystem from potential pollution, habitat disruption, and climate change impacts associated with oil and gas extraction.

#### **Climate Change Mitigation**
- By avoiding new fossil fuel projects, Canada is aligning with global climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.

#### **Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination**
- The Order recognizes and respects the rights of Indigenous peoples in the North, particularly the Inuvialuit and Inuit communities, who have long-standing relationships with the Arctic environment.
- The inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in the review process ensures that traditional ecological knowledge is valued and integrated into decision-making.

#### **Economic and Social Considerations**
- The prohibition prevents speculative investment in unproven Arctic reserves, reducing economic risks for private companies.
- However, it also raises questions about long-term energy security and economic opportunities for Northern communities.

#### **Policy Stability and Transparency**
- The five-year review cycle provides a clear, predictable path for future policy decisions, balancing caution with openness to future development if scientific and societal conditions warrant it.

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Order Prohibiting Certain Activities in Arctic Offshore Waters, 2022* is a **temporary, science-based, and stakeholder-informed moratorium** on new oil and gas exploration and development in Canadian Arctic offshore waters. It reflects Canada’s commitment to environmental stewardship, climate responsibility, and Indigenous rights in the Arctic region.

While it does not preclude future development, it ensures that any future decisions are made through a rigorous, transparent, and inclusive process that considers climate science, environmental impacts, Indigenous perspectives, and socio-economic outcomes. The five-year review cycle provides a balanced approach to managing the complex challenges of Arctic resource development.

**In short**:  
This regulation **prohibits new oil and gas activities** in Canadian Arctic offshore waters until **2028**, when the moratorium will expire unless extended based on a comprehensive, science- and community-driven review. It is a key step in Canada’s strategy to protect the Arctic environment and uphold Indigenous rights while preparing for future decisions on Arctic energy development.
