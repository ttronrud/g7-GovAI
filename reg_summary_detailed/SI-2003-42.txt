### 🔹 **Overview**
This is a bilateral social security agreement between **Canada and Sweden**, signed on **April 10, 1985**, and updated through a new agreement effective **April 1, 2003**, following changes in social security legislation and mutual cooperation needs.

## 🔍 **Key Provisions and Structure**

### 1. **Preamble and Entry into Force**
- The agreement entered into force on **April 1, 2003**, following:
  - Notification from both countries confirming compliance with all requirements.
  - A legal process under the *Old Age Security Act* (subsection 42(2)), which requires a 30-day sitting period after the Order in Council is laid before Parliament.
- The Order in Council (P.C. 2002-739) was first laid in May 2002, then again in October 2002 after Parliament was dissolved.
- After 30 days of the second laying, the Order came into force on **December 5, 2002**.
- The exchange of written notifications occurred on **December 18, 2002**.
- The agreement thus entered into force on the **first day of the fourth month after the month of notification**, i.e., **April 1, 2003**.

> ✅ This structure ensures that the agreement only comes into force once both parties have met all procedural and legislative conditions.
