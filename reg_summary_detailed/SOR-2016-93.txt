### **Summary of the Weed Seeds Order, 2016**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** issued the *Weed Seeds Order, 2016* under **subsection 4(2)(a)** of the *Seeds Act* (R.S., c. S-8).
- This provision grants the Minister the authority to designate certain plant seeds as "weed seeds" for regulatory purposes, including restrictions on their sale, distribution, or use.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary objective is to **identify specific plant species whose seeds are classified as "weed seeds"** under the *Seeds Act*.
- By designating these seeds as weeds, the regulation enables the government to:
  - Regulate their movement and sale.
  - Prevent their spread in agricultural and natural environments.
  - Protect crop yields and agricultural productivity by minimizing invasive or problematic plant species.

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

##### **(a) Designation of Weed Seeds**
- The seeds of the plant species listed in **Schedule I** of the *Seeds Regulations* are **specifically designated as "weed seeds"**.
- This classification applies to all **kinds or species of plants** listed in the schedule, regardless of whether they are currently cultivated or not.

##### **(b) Applicability by Schedule Table**
The regulation applies to various tables within Schedule I, with specific exclusions or additions:

| Table | Applicability | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Tables I to XIII** (except XIV and XV) | Applies to all tables | All listed weed species in these tables are considered weed seeds. |
| **Table XIV and XV** | Applies only to species in **Class 2** (and in addition) | These tables include species from Class 2, plus additional species specified in the order. |
| **Table XII** | Applies specifically to species in **Class 3** (and in addition) | Includes species from Class 3, plus any additional species specified. |

> **Note**: The inclusion of "and in addition" indicates that certain species beyond those already listed in the class are also considered weeds under this order.

##### **(c) Seeds of All Other Plants Not Listed**
- Any seeds of **plant species or kinds not listed in Schedule I** are **automatically considered weed seeds**.
- This broad provision ensures that **unlisted, potentially invasive species** are also subject to regulation if they are not already covered.

#### **4. Repeal Clause**
- The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, meaning that any prior versions or conflicting provisions related to weed seeds are **replaced or revoked** by this 2016 Order.
- This ensures legal clarity and consistency in the current regulatory framework.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The order **comes into force on November 1, 2016**.
- This date marks when the designation of the listed species as weed seeds becomes legally binding and enforceable.

### **Key Implications and Interpretation**

- **Regulatory Impact**: The designation of seeds as "weed seeds" triggers compliance requirements under the *Seeds Act*, such as:
  - Restrictions on sale, import, or export.
  - Labeling requirements.
  - Prohibitions on distribution in agricultural settings.
- **Environmental Protection**: Helps prevent the spread of invasive or problematic plants that could harm native ecosystems or reduce crop yields.
- **Agricultural Industry**: Farmers and seed dealers must ensure compliance by verifying seed sources and avoiding the use or distribution of listed weed species.
- **Flexibility**: The inclusion of "all other kinds or species not listed" provides a catch-all mechanism to adapt to emerging or newly recognized invasive species.

### **Conclusion**

The *Weed Seeds Order, 2016* is a targeted regulatory instrument that:
- Clearly identifies which plant seeds are considered weeds under Canadian agricultural law.
- Applies to both explicitly listed species and broader categories (including unlisted ones).
- Provides a structured, enforceable framework to manage weed seed dispersal and protect agricultural systems.

It is a critical tool in the ongoing effort to maintain crop health, prevent environmental degradation, and ensure the integrity of Canada’s seed supply chain.
