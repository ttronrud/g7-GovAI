### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, a federal law designed to protect and recover wildlife species at risk in Canada.

- The **Misty Lake Lotic Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)** is a distinct population of the threespine stickleback fish, recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.
  
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this species was developed and has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is the government’s publicly accessible database of species at risk and their associated recovery plans.

- This strategy identified specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — these areas are known as **critical habitat**.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **(a) Definition of Critical Habitat**
The Order formally **designates and defines** the **critical habitat** of the Misty Lake Lotic Threespine Stickleback. This critical habitat consists of specific physical and biological features within the natural environment that are essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

- The designated area is located in **Misty Lake**, specifically within its **lotic (flowing water)** sections — i.e., streams or running water environments — which are vital for the stickleback’s life cycle, including spawning, feeding, and shelter.

#### **(b) Legal Authority**
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) issued this Order **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of the Species at Risk Act.

- **Subsection 58(4)** authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat when it has been identified in a recovery strategy and is not located in a place that would be excluded under the Act.
- **Subsection 58(5)** allows the Minister to make such an order if the critical habitat is not located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA — which would otherwise exempt certain areas from critical habitat designation.

#### **(c) Exclusion of Prohibited Areas**
The regulation explicitly states that **no portion** of the critical habitat specified in the annexed Order falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.

- This provision is significant because subsection 58(2)(b) would otherwise exclude areas that are:
  - Already designated as a protected area under another law (e.g., a national park or wildlife reserve),
  - Located in a place where the government has already committed to protecting the species through other measures,
  - Or areas where the designation of critical habitat would not be necessary due to existing protections.

- Since the critical habitat of the Misty Lake Lotic Stickleback is **not within any such excluded category**, the Minister is authorized to proceed with designation.

### **3. Application of Subsection 58(1)**

- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of this species. This means that:
  - The designated critical habitat is legally recognized as essential for the species’ survival.
  - Any activity that may adversely affect this habitat is subject to regulatory review and may require a permit or mitigation under SARA.
  - The government is legally required to **avoid, minimize, or mitigate** adverse impacts on this habitat through development, land use, or other activities.

---

### **4. Effect and Enforceability**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official journal of federal regulations).
- Once registered, the designation becomes legally binding and enforceable under the Species at Risk Act.
- The critical habitat designation triggers **procedural and regulatory obligations** on federal and provincial governments, developers, and other stakeholders who may propose activities within or near the designated area.

---

### **5. Purpose and Significance**

- This Order serves as a **formal, legally binding step** in the recovery of the Misty Lake Lotic Threespine Stickleback.
- It ensures that the specific environmental conditions necessary for the species’ survival are protected from degradation or destruction.
- It provides a **clear baseline** for future conservation planning, scientific monitoring, and enforcement actions.
- It supports the broader goals of SARA: to prevent extinction, promote recovery, and ensure the long-term survival of endangered species.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the endangered Misty Lake Lotic Threespine Stickleback under the Species at Risk Act. It is based on a recovery strategy, confirmed through public registry inclusion, and issued with full legal authority because the habitat is not excluded under SARA’s provisions. The designation ensures that the unique and essential environmental features of this species’ habitat are protected from harmful human activities, thereby contributing directly to the species’ recovery and long-term survival.

This Order is a key component of Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and species recovery under federal environmental law.
