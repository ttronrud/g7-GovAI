### **Background and Context**

On **June 25, 1993**, by **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1485**, the control and supervision of the **Passport Office** was transferred from the **Department of External Affairs** to the **Department of the Solicitor General**. This move was part of a broader administrative restructuring aimed at aligning responsibilities with departmental mandates and improving operational efficiency.

The transfer was formally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on page 3231, under the reference **SI/93-139**.

### **Nature of the Current Regulation**

This regulation, issued by the Governor General in Council, serves as a **reversal or reallocation** of that earlier transfer. It states that:

> "His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, is pleased hereby to transfer to the Department of External Affairs the control and supervision of that portion of the public service in the Department of the Solicitor General known as the Passport Office."

### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Authority**:  
   The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which grants the Governor General in Council the power to transfer control and supervision of public service functions between departments.

2. **Action Taken**:  
   The control and supervision of the **Passport Office** — specifically, the portion of the public service within the **Department of the Solicitor General** — is being **transferred back** to the **Department of External Affairs**.

3. **Effective Date**:  
   While not explicitly stated in the text, such orders typically take effect immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*, unless otherwise specified.

4. **Purpose**:  
   The reversal appears to reflect a policy shift or reconsideration of the administrative structure of passport services. It may indicate:
   - A return to the original intent of placing passport services under the Department of External Affairs, which historically oversees immigration, citizenship, and international relations.
   - A recognition that passport administration is more appropriately aligned with external affairs functions (e.g., international travel, diplomatic relations, and border management).
   - A reevaluation of the operational efficiency or policy coherence of placing passport services under the Solicitor General’s department.

5. **Scope**:  
   The transfer applies only to the **Passport Office** — a specific component of the public service — and not to other functions or departments.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Administrative Reorganization**: This regulation demonstrates the flexibility of Canada’s public service restructuring mechanisms, allowing for adjustments in departmental responsibilities based on evolving government priorities.
- **Functional Alignment**: By returning the Passport Office to the Department of External Affairs, the government ensures that passport issuance and related services are managed within a department that has direct oversight of international travel and citizenship matters.
- **Continuity and Accountability**: It reinforces accountability and coordination between passport services and broader external affairs policy, such as visa processing, travel advisories, and international agreements.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **reversal of a prior administrative transfer** under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. It formally returns the **control and supervision of the Passport Office** from the Department of the Solicitor General back to the Department of External Affairs. The action is legally sound, authorized by statute, and reflects a strategic realignment of public service responsibilities to better serve national policy objectives related to international engagement and travel management.

This transfer underscores the dynamic nature of public service governance in Canada and the government’s ability to adjust departmental responsibilities in response to policy, operational, or strategic considerations.
