### 🔹 **3. Key Amendments: Replacement of Article 25 – Exchange of Information**

The most significant change in the protocol is the **complete replacement of Article 25** of the original 1976 Convention with a new, more robust version.

#### 🔍 **New Article 25 (Exchange of Information) – Key Provisions**

| Provision | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Scope of Information Exchange** | The competent tax authorities of Canada and Singapore shall exchange information that is **foreseeably relevant** to: <br> - Implementing the provisions of the Convention, or <br> - Administering or enforcing domestic tax laws (including those on income, capital gains, etc.). <br> This applies **only when such taxation is not contrary to the Convention**. |

| **2. No Restrictions from Articles 1 and 2** | The exchange of information is **not limited** by the confidentiality or privacy provisions in Articles 1 and 2 of the original Convention. This ensures broader access to information for tax enforcement purposes. |

| **3. Treatment of Information as Secret** | Any information received under this article shall be treated as **confidential** and **secret**, just like information obtained under domestic law. |

| **4. Disclosure Restrictions** | Information may only be disclosed to: <br> - Tax assessors, collectors, enforcement officers, <br> - Courts, administrative bodies, or <br> - Authorities involved in appeals or tax oversight. <br> These entities must use the information **only for tax-related purposes**. <br> Disclosure may occur in **public court proceedings or judicial decisions**, provided it does not breach confidentiality. |

| **5. Limitations on Obligations** | A Contracting State **shall not be required to**: <br> - Carry out administrative measures inconsistent with its own laws or administrative practices; <br> - Supply information that is **not obtainable under domestic law** or in the normal course of administration; <br> - Disclose information that would reveal **trade secrets**, **commercial processes**, or **professional secrets**; <br> - Disclose information that would be contrary to **public policy (ordre public)**. |

| **6. Obligation to Supply Information (Even Without Domestic Interest)** | If one country requests information, the other must use its **information-gathering mechanisms** to obtain it — **even if it has no domestic tax interest in that information**. |

> ⚠️ **Critical Note**: This obligation is **not absolute** — it is **subject to the limitations in paragraph 3**. However, a country **cannot refuse** to provide information simply because it is held by a **bank, financial institution, nominee, or fiduciary** (e.g., a trustee or agent).  
> ✅ This means that **ownership interests** (e.g., beneficial ownership) can still be disclosed even if held through intermediaries.

| **7. Notification and Entry into Force** | Each country must notify the other via **diplomatic channels** when its domestic procedures for implementing the protocol are completed. <br> The protocol enters into force **30 days after the later of these two notifications**. |

| **8. Duration and Applicability** | The protocol remains in force **as long as the original 1976 Convention remains in force**. <br> It applies **whenever the Convention itself is applicable** (i.e., when tax treaties between the two countries are in effect). |
