**Detailed Summary of the “SeaRose FPSO” Remission Order, 2004**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to grant remission of customs duties in specific cases. This particular order, known as the *“SeaRose FPSO” Remission Order, 2004*, is a formal legislative instrument designed to relieve certain importers of customs duties related to a specific offshore oil platform.

**2. Purpose of the Remission**  
The primary objective of this remission is to **offset customs duties** that would otherwise be payable by Husky Oil Operations Limited and Petro Canada in respect of the **hull and turret portion** of the *SeaRose FPSO* (Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel).  

- The *SeaRose FPSO* was imported into Canada as part of the **White Rose offshore oil project**, located in the North Sea.  
- The remission applies specifically to the **customs duties on the hull and turret components** of this vessel, which are critical structural and operational elements of the FPSO.

---

**3. Eligible Parties**  
The remission is granted to two specific companies:  
- **Husky Oil Operations Limited**, Calgary, Alberta  
- **Petro Canada**, Calgary, Alberta  

These entities are recognized as the **importers** of the hull and turret portion of the SeaRose FPSO and are therefore eligible for the duty remission under this Order.

**4. Scope and Amount of Remission**  
The remission covers the **customs duties that were paid or were payable** under the Customs Tariff Act in relation to the specified components.  
- The amount of remission is **equal to the actual customs duties** imposed on the hull and turret portion of the vessel.  
- This means that the companies are not required to pay these duties again; the government is effectively refunding the amount already paid or waiving it entirely for the specified components.

---

**5. Conditions for Eligibility and Compliance**  
To qualify for the remission, the importers must meet the following two conditions:  

**Condition 1: Submission of Required Evidence**  
- The importers must provide **such evidence as may be required by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** to verify their eligibility for remission.  
- This evidence may include documentation such as:  
  - Import manifests  
  - Commercial invoices  
  - Technical specifications of the hull and turret  
  - Proof of ownership or contractual responsibility  
  - Details of the project (e.g., White Rose offshore oil project)  
- The CBSA retains the authority to assess the validity and sufficiency of this documentation.

**Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**  
- A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue** **prior to April 1, 2007**.  
- This deadline is critical and establishes a **time-bound administrative window** for claiming the benefit.  
- Failure to submit the claim by this date will result in the loss of the remission entitlement.

---

**6. Effective Date and Enforcement**  
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette or officially published.  
- This means that the remission is legally effective from the date of registration, and the importers may begin to act upon it (e.g., filing claims) from that point forward.

---

**7. Legal and Policy Context**  
This remission is part of a broader policy framework aimed at:  
- Supporting **strategic energy infrastructure development** in Canada’s offshore oil sector.  
- Encouraging investment in major energy projects by reducing the financial burden on key importers.  
- Recognizing the **special circumstances** of large-scale, capital-intensive offshore projects, where the cost of importing specialized equipment can be significant.  

Such remissions are typically granted under special circumstances, such as national energy security, economic development, or technological innovation, and are not available for routine commercial imports.

---

**8. Key Takeaways**  
- The remission is **specific** to the *SeaRose FPSO* hull and turret components.  
- It is **limited in time**—claims must be submitted before April 1, 2007.  
- It requires **verification and documentation** from the CBSA.  
- It is a **one-time, project-specific** benefit tied to a major offshore oil initiative.

**Conclusion**  
The *SeaRose FPSO Remission Order, 2004* is a targeted, legally grounded exemption from customs duties designed to support the development of Canada’s offshore oil infrastructure. It reflects a government strategy to facilitate large-scale energy projects by reducing import costs for essential components, while maintaining accountability through clear eligibility criteria and a strict deadline for claim submission. The Order remains valid only within its specified parameters and is not applicable to other vessels or projects.
