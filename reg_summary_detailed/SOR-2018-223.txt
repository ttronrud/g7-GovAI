**Detailed Summary of the CPTPP Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision enables the Canadian government to implement tariff preferences under the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)*  
  - *S.C. 1997, c. 36*  

These provisions provide the legal foundation for establishing and administering tariff preferences for goods originating in CPTPP member countries.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define two central terms used throughout:

#### **Minimal Operation**  
Refers to specific, non-value-added activities that do not alter the essential characteristics of a product. These operations are considered "minimal" and do not count as a "production process" for determining origin under the CPTPP rules.

Examples include:
- Ensuring preservation of goods during transport and storage (e.g., refrigeration, drying).
- Packaging, re-packaging, breaking up consignments, or preparing goods for retail sale (e.g., placing goods in bottles, cans, bags, boxes).
- Mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially change the product’s nature or quality.
- Collection of goods to form sets, assortments, kits, or composite goods (e.g., assembling a toy kit).
- Any combination of the above.

> **Purpose**: To exclude routine, non-essential processing from being counted as a "production process" that could affect the origin of goods.

#### **Originating Goods**  
A good is considered *originating* if it qualifies as such under the **CPTPP Rules of Origin Regulations**. This means the good has been produced in a CPTPP country through processes that meet the origin criteria (such as sufficient value addition or use of locally sourced inputs).

> **Key Point**: Only goods that are *originating* under the CPTPP rules are eligible for tariff preferences.

### **3. Eligibility for CPTPP Tariff Preferences**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, originating goods exported from a CPTPP country are entitled to preferential tariff treatment **if** they are shipped to Canada under one of the following conditions:

#### **Scenario 1: Direct Shipments (No Third Country Involvement)**  
Goods are shipped directly from a CPTPP country to Canada **without passing through a non-CPTPP country**, either:
- On a **through bill of lading**, or  
- Without a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** showing:
  - The full shipping route
  - All points of shipment and transshipment before arrival in Canada

> This ensures transparency and prevents circumvention of origin rules.

#### **Scenario 2: Shipments via a Non-CPTPP Country**  
If goods pass through a **non-CPTPP country**, the importer must provide, upon request:
1. Documentary evidence showing:
   - The complete shipping route
   - All points of shipment and transshipment before entry into Canada  
2. A **copy of customs control documents** that prove the goods remained under customs control during their stay in the non-CPTPP country.

> **Purpose**: To ensure that goods do not undergo unauthorized processing or re-exportation in a non-member country that would disqualify them from origin status.

> **Note**: The requirement of customs control documentation is critical — it confirms the goods were not subject to de facto processing or re-exportation in a non-CPTPP country.

### **4. Tariff Treatment for Eligible Goods**

Once the origin and shipment conditions are met, the goods are eligible for **one of the following tariff rates**, whichever is **most favorable**:

| Option | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **(a)** | The CPTPP tariff applicable to the **CPTPP country where the last production process** (excluding minimal operations) occurred. |
| **(b)** | The **highest rate** of the CPTPP tariffs applicable to the **CPTPP country where any production process** occurred. |
| **(c)** | The **highest rate** of the CPTPP tariffs applicable to **any CPTPP country**. |

> **Rule of Choice**: The importer benefits from the **most favorable (lowest) tariff rate** available under the CPTPP framework.

> **Tariff Reference**:  
The applicable CPTPP tariff rates are found in the **"Tariff Treatment / Other" column** of the **List of Countries** in the **Schedule to the Customs Tariff**. Each CPTPP member country has a designated tariff rate based on its trade relationship with Canada.

> Example: If a product is last produced in Japan, and Japan's tariff rate for the product is 0%, that rate will apply — even if a higher rate applies to other CPTPP members.

### **5. Effective Date and Registration Requirements**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation Act** (Chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada 2018) comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures alignment with the broader implementation timeline of the CPTPP agreement.

> **Note**: These regulations were effective as of **December 30, 2018**, as referenced in **SI/2018-101 and SI/2018-108**.

### **6. Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Trade Among CPTPP Members** | Enables lower tariffs on goods originating in CPTPP countries, encouraging cross-border trade. |
| **Ensure Origin Integrity** | Prevents fraud or misrepresentation by requiring verifiable documentation for shipments. |
| **Simplify Compliance** | Defines clear, standardized procedures for determining eligibility and tariff application. |
| **Support Canadian Industry** | Helps Canadian exporters and importers access cheaper, more competitive goods from CPTPP partners. |

### **7. Practical Application Example**

**Scenario**:  
A manufacturer in Vietnam produces a plastic container. The container is shipped to Canada via a third country (e.g., Singapore), which is not a CPTPP member.

- The shipment passes through Singapore.
- The importer must provide:
  - A full shipping route (e.g., Vietnam → Singapore → Canada)
  - Proof that the goods remained under customs control in Singapore (e.g., customs clearance documents)
- The last production process occurred in Vietnam (a CPTPP country).
- The tariff rate applicable to Vietnam in the CPTPP schedule is 0%.

✅ The goods qualify for the **0% tariff** under the CPTPP agreement.

### **Conclusion**

The **CPTPP Tariff Preference Regulations** establish a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework for granting preferential tariff treatment to goods originating in CPTPP countries. By defining what constitutes a "minimal operation," specifying conditions for direct or indirect shipments, and outlining the most favorable tariff options, these regulations:

- Facilitate fair and predictable trade flows among CPTPP members,
- Protect the integrity of origin rules,
- Support economic integration within the region,
- And provide Canadian importers and exporters with clear compliance pathways.

These regulations are a cornerstone of Canada’s implementation of the CPTPP, promoting competitiveness and trade efficiency in the Pacific region.

**Final Note**: The regulations are designed to balance trade benefits with regulatory rigor, ensuring that only genuinely originating goods receive tariff advantages.
