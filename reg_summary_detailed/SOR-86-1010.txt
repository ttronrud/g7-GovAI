**Detailed Summary of the Sale of Goods Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Sale of Goods Regulations* (S.C. 1986, c. 1), commonly referred to as the **Sale of Goods Regulations**, were enacted under the authority of the *Customs Act* to establish a formal framework for the **sale of abandoned, forfeited, and detained goods** by the Government of Canada. These regulations provide procedural rules governing how such goods are marketed, bid upon, and ultimately sold—either through public auction or public tender.

The regulations came into force on the date that the relevant provisions of the *Customs Act* (specifically paragraph 142(1)(c), subsection 146(2), and paragraph 164(1)(i)) came into effect, following a public notice and opportunity for stakeholder input.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- **Section 164(3) of the Customs Act**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in *Part I of the Canada Gazette* to allow interested parties to make representations.
- **Paragraph 142(1)(c)**: Grants the Minister of National Revenue authority to dispose of goods abandoned or forfeited to the Crown.
- **Subsection 146(2)**: Authorizes the Minister to make regulations for the sale of such goods.
- **Paragraph 164(1)(i)**: Provides the Governor in Council with the power to make regulations under the Act, based on the Minister’s recommendation.

These provisions collectively empower the government to regulate and manage the sale of specific types of goods held by customs authorities.

---

### **Scope of Application**
The Regulations apply to the following types of goods:
1. **Abandoned goods** – Items surrendered to Her Majesty in right of Canada under the *Customs Act*.
2. **Forfeited goods** – Goods whose forfeiture has become final under the Act.
3. **Detained goods** – Goods held under **subsection 97.25(1)** of the *Customs Act*, which typically involves goods detained for reasons such as suspected violations of customs laws.

**Exclusions**:
- The regulations **do not apply** to:
  - Spirits
  - Specially denatured alcohol
  - Wine
  - Raw leaf tobacco
  - Tobacco products

> This exclusion ensures that certain regulated or sensitive items are not subject to these public sale procedures.

---

### **Sales Basis**
All goods sold under these regulations must be sold on an **“as is, where is” basis**.  
This means:
- The buyer assumes all risks related to condition, value, and quality.
- There is **no guarantee** of fitness for a particular use.
- No warranties, representations, or guarantees are provided by the Government or customs authorities.

---

### **Public Auction or Public Tender**
The government may choose to sell goods through either:
- **Public auction** (open bidding in real time)
- **Public tender** (written submissions submitted by interested parties)

Both methods are governed by strict procedural rules.

---

### **Cancellation of Sale**
If:
- **No bid or tender is received**, or  
- The **chief officer of customs determines that none of the bids/tenders are acceptable**,  

Then the sale may be **cancelled**, and the goods will be **held for a future sale**.

This provides flexibility in ensuring that goods are not sold at a price below market value or under unsatisfactory conditions.

---

### **Public Tender Procedures**
Specific rules govern the process of public tenders:

1. **Advertising Requirements**:
   - Tenders must be advertised in a form and manner **directed by the Minister of National Revenue**.
   - The Minister may specify where, when, and how the advertisement should be published (e.g., in official gazettes, newspapers, or online platforms).

2. **Submission Requirements**:
   - All tenders must be **in writing**.
   - Submitted in **sealed envelopes**, clearly marked “tender.”
   - Envelopes remain sealed until the **designated closing date**.

3. **Opening of Tenders**:
   - Envelopes are opened **in the presence of at least two customs officers** to ensure transparency and prevent fraud or manipulation.

4. **Tie-Breaking Rule**:
   - If **two or more tenders are submitted at the same amount**, the **first tender received** is given priority.

5. **Notification of Acceptance**:
   - The **chief officer of customs must issue a written notice** to the person whose tender has been accepted.

---

### **Timeframe for Completion of Sale**
- The person who receives notice of acceptance must **complete the sale within seven days** of receiving the notice.
- If they fail to do so:
  - The chief officer may **cancel the sale** to that person.
  - The government may then **accept any other tender** or proceed with a new sale.

> This ensures that sales are not indefinitely delayed and that the government does not lose revenue due to non-compliance.

---

### **Role of the Chief Officer of Customs**
The **chief officer of customs** (defined as the manager of the customs office where the goods are held or detained) has key responsibilities, including:
- Organizing and managing the sale process
- Receiving and evaluating bids or tenders
- Deciding whether to accept or reject offers
- Notifying successful bidders
- Cancelling sales when necessary

This role ensures that the sale process is administered by a qualified and accountable official within the customs system.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**
1. **Transparency**: Clear procedures for public bidding ensure fairness and accountability.
2. **Efficiency**: Provides a structured process to liquidate non-recoverable or abandoned goods.
3. **Revenue Recovery**: Enables the government to recover value from goods that would otherwise remain in storage indefinitely.
4. **Legal Compliance**: Aligns with the *Customs Act* and ensures consistency with established customs procedures.

---

### **Significance and Impact**
- These regulations provide a **clear, standardized process** for the disposal of goods that are no longer in use or legally recoverable.
- They protect both the government and potential buyers by establishing **transparent, fair, and legally binding procedures**.
- They serve as a **critical tool** in customs administration, helping to reduce the burden of unsold or unclaimed goods on government resources.

### **Conclusion**
The *Sale of Goods Regulations* (S.C. 1986, c. 1) establish a comprehensive, fair, and legally grounded framework for the sale of abandoned, forfeited, and detained goods under the *Customs Act*. By setting clear rules for public auction and tender processes—including advertising, bid submission, evaluation, and enforcement of timelines—the regulations ensure that such sales are conducted transparently, efficiently, and in the public interest. The rules also protect the integrity of the process through mechanisms like sealed tenders, independent oversight, and time-bound obligations for successful bidders.

These regulations remain a foundational element of Canada’s customs asset management and disposal system.
