*Issued under Section 548a of the Bank Act, S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 35(1); Amended by S.C. 1991, c. 46*

---

### **Overview**

The *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* are a set of rules established by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **Section 548a of the Bank Act**. These regulations impose specific restrictions on the types of securities transactions that authorized foreign banks may engage in within Canada. The primary objective is to protect Canadian financial markets and ensure that foreign banks do not engage in activities that could pose systemic risks or undermine market integrity—particularly in areas involving primary distribution and secondary market trading of securities.

The regulations came into force on **June 28, 1999**.

### **Key Prohibitions: What Authorized Foreign Banks Cannot Do**

An **authorized foreign bank** (a foreign bank licensed to operate in Canada under the Bank Act) is **prohibited from dealing in securities** in Canada to the extent that such dealings involve:

1. **Primary Distribution of Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**  
   – The initial sale of equity (shares or ownership interests) or warrants related to such equity by a company.

2. **Secondary Market Trading in Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**  
   – Buying or selling shares or warrants on the secondary market (i.e., after the initial offering).

3. **Primary Distribution of Debt Obligations of a Body Corporate or Warrants Therein**  
   – The first-time issuance of bonds or other debt instruments by a corporation, or warrants linked to such debt.

4. **Acting as a Selling Agent in Connection with the Distribution of Mutual Funds**  
   – Representing or facilitating the sale of mutual funds to investors.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These prohibitions apply to *all* securities dealings that fall under these categories, regardless of whether the transactions are direct or indirect.

### **Exceptions: What Authorized Foreign Banks *Can* Do**

Despite the above restrictions, the regulations explicitly **do not prohibit** authorized foreign banks from engaging in certain securities activities—specifically:

#### 1. **Dealing in Securities for Own Account or for Accounts Administered by the Bank**
- An authorized foreign bank may buy or sell securities **for its own account** or for **accounts it manages** (e.g., client portfolios).
- This includes investment activities such as trading in equities, debt instruments, or derivatives, as long as the transactions are not part of a primary distribution or agent-based sales effort.

#### 2. **Providing Investment Counselling and Portfolio Management Services**
- The bank may offer advisory services to clients (e.g., recommending investments, managing investment portfolios).
- This includes providing financial advice and portfolio strategies, which are not considered "dealing" in the prohibited sense.

### **Permitted Activities (Where Restrictions Do Not Apply)**

Even within the broader category of securities dealings, the following activities are **explicitly allowed**:

| Permitted Activity | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Primary distribution of debt obligations or warrants of government or public utility entities** | Includes debt issued by: <br> - The Government of Canada or a province/municipality or their agencies; <br> - A public utility directly or indirectly owned by a Canadian government; <br> - A foreign government or its political subdivisions or agencies; <br> - An international agency of which Canada is a member (e.g., World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, etc.). |
| **Primary distribution of money market securities** | Includes short-term debt instruments like commercial paper, Treasury bills, or repurchase agreements. |
| **Primary distribution of debt obligations or warrants of the foreign bank itself or its affiliated entities** | If the debt is guaranteed by the foreign bank. |
| **Primary distribution of shares or ownership interests of the foreign bank** | The bank may issue its own shares. |
| **Unsolicited participation in secondary market trading** | If the trade is conducted through a **registered securities broker** (under a provincial securities law or foreign jurisdiction). The term "unsolicited" means the bank is not actively soliciting or promoting the trade. |
| **Acting as a selling agent for mutual funds** | Only in connection with **corporate-sponsored accounts** for: <br> - Pension plans; <br> - Deferred profit-sharing plans; <br> - Retirement plans; <br> - Other similar capital accumulation plans. |
| **Acting as a member of a selling group** | In connection with the underwriting of securities issued by a **body corporate other than the foreign bank itself**. |
| **Effecting private placements of securities** | On the same basis as a member of a selling group participates in an underwriting. This allows for non-public, direct sales to qualified institutional investors. |
| **Primary distribution of debt obligations or warrants in respect of syndicated or consortium loans** | Includes securitized debt instruments (e.g., bonds backed by loan pools or asset-backed securities) issued through a group of lenders. |

> ✅ These exceptions are designed to allow authorized foreign banks to participate in certain essential financial markets while preventing them from engaging in activities that could lead to market distortion or competition with domestic institutions.

### **Key Regulatory Principles**

- **Market Protection**: The restrictions aim to preserve the role of Canadian domestic institutions (such as Canadian banks and investment dealers) in primary market distribution and to prevent foreign banks from gaining undue influence in key areas.
- **Distinguishing Between "Dealing" and "Services"**: The distinction between *dealing* (buying/selling securities) and *services* (advisory, portfolio management) is crucial. Only the former is restricted.
- **Focus on Primary Distribution**: The prohibitions center on primary offerings (first-time sales), not secondary trading (post-issue trading), especially when such trading is conducted through registered brokers.
- **Exclusions for Government and Publicly Owned Entities**: Foreign banks are permitted to participate in the distribution of debt from entities with strong public or sovereign backing—especially those tied to Canada’s national interests.

---

### **Jurisdiction and Enforcement**

- These regulations are administered under the **Bank Act**, which governs the operations of foreign banks in Canada.
- The **Minister of Finance** and the **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)** are responsible for enforcement and oversight.
- Violations could result in penalties, including fines or revocation of licensing.

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Market Stability**: By restricting foreign banks from participating in primary equity and debt offerings, the regulations help maintain a level playing field and protect Canadian investors.
- **Encourages Domestic Participation**: Domestic institutions are given priority in key capital markets, which supports national economic development and investor confidence.
- **Balanced Approach**: The rules are not absolute—they allow participation in government-backed, public utility, and institutional debt markets, reflecting a pragmatic balance between openness and protection.

### **Conclusion**

The *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* establish a carefully calibrated framework that:

- **Prohibits** authorized foreign banks from engaging in primary market distribution and acting as selling agents for mutual funds in most cases;
- **Permits** them to trade securities for their own or clients’ accounts, provide investment advice, and participate in certain government- or institution-backed securities;
- **Exempts** specific types of debt (e.g., sovereign, public utility, money market, syndicated loans) and secondary market activities conducted through registered brokers.

This regulatory approach ensures that foreign banks can operate in Canada while respecting the integrity and stability of Canadian financial markets—particularly in sensitive areas like equity issuance and mutual fund distribution.
