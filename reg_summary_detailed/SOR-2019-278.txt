Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, the *CIFTA Tariff Preference Regulations*, including its context, definitions, key provisions, and enforcement mechanisms.

## **Detailed Summary of the CIFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- **Issuance**: The regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.
- **Legal Authority**: The power to issue these regulations stems from **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**.
- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** – Provides the enabling provision for the regulation.  
  - **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – Original source of the regulation (repealed or amended in subsequent legislation).

> This means the government has the authority to establish specific tariff preferences for goods originating from certain countries under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA), based on the rules of origin and trade conditions.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Originating** | Means that goods qualify as originating in the territory of a **Party** (a country party to CIFTA) under the **Rules of Origin** set out in the *CIFTA Rules of Origin Regulations*. This is the essential criterion for eligibility for tariff preferences. |
| **Non-Party** | Refers to countries or regions that are **not parties to CIFTA** and include: <br> - Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) <br> - Member States of the European Union (EU) <br> - Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan <br> - Mexico <br> - United States of America |

> These definitions are critical in determining whether goods can benefit from tariff preferences when shipped through or into non-Party territories.

---

### **3. Eligibility for Tariff Preference under the Canada-Israel Agreement**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff**, **originating goods** are entitled to the benefits of the **Canada-Israel Agreement Tariff** under specific conditions depending on the shipping route.

#### **Scenario 1: Goods Shipped Directly from Israel or Another CIFTA Beneficiary (No Third Country Involvement)**

If goods are shipped directly to Canada from:
- **Israel**, or
- Another **CIFTA beneficiary** (a country party to CIFTA),

**and**:
- They are transported via a **through bill of lading**, **OR**
- There is **no through bill of lading**, but the **importer provides documentary evidence** upon request that shows:
  - The full shipping route
  - All points of shipment and transshipment before entry into Canada

➡️ **Result**: The goods qualify for tariff preference (i.e., reduced or zero tariffs).

> This ensures that direct trade between CIFTA members and Canada is protected and facilitated.

---

#### **Scenario 2: Goods Shipped Through a Non-Party Territory**

For goods **not listed in Chapters 50 to 63 of the List of Tariff Provisions** (i.e., most goods, excluding certain categories like machinery, vehicles, etc.) that are shipped through a **non-Party**:

The importer must provide, upon request by a customs officer, **documentary evidence** that:
- The goods did **not undergo further production** in the non-Party territory, **except for minor processing**, **OR**
- Any processing in the non-Party **did not increase the transaction value** of the goods by more than **10%**.

> This prevents "tariff evasion" by ensuring that goods aren't artificially revalued through processing in non-Party countries.

> **Note**: The 10% value threshold is a strict rule to prevent the use of non-Party processing to circumvent tariff preferences.

---

#### **Scenario 3: Goods Listed in Chapters 50 to 63 of the List of Tariff Provisions**

These are specific goods (e.g., machinery, vehicles, certain industrial equipment) that are subject to **additional scrutiny** due to their value or nature.

For such goods shipped through a **non-Party**, the importer must provide:
1. **Documentary evidence** showing:
   - The full shipping route
   - All points of shipment and transshipment prior to importation
2. **A copy of customs control documents** that prove:
   - The goods remained **under customs control** throughout their time in the non-Party territory

> This requirement ensures transparency and compliance with customs regulations during transit through non-Party countries.

> The "customs control" requirement is a key safeguard to prevent goods from being re-exported or processed without proper oversight.

---

#### **Scenario 4: Goods Shipped Through Another Country (Not a Non-Party)**

If goods are shipped through a country that is **not a non-Party** (i.e., a CIFTA party or a country with reciprocal trade agreements):

The importer must provide, upon request:
1. Documentary evidence of:
   - The full shipping route
   - All points of shipment and transshipment
2. A copy of **customs control documents** proving the goods remained under customs control during their stay in that country

> This ensures that even when goods transit through a CIFTA partner country, the rules of origin and customs control are maintained.

---

### **4. Repeal of Previous Regulations**

- The **prior version of the CIFTA Tariff Preference Regulations (SOR/97-64)** is **repealed**.
- This indicates that the current regulations represent an **updated and more precise framework** for applying tariff preferences under CIFTA, reflecting changes in trade policy, international agreements, and administrative clarity.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day the **Act to amend the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act and to make related amendments to other Acts** (Chapter 6 of the Statutes of Canada, 2019) comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures alignment with broader legislative reforms and provides a clear timeline for implementation.

> **Note**: As of **September 1, 2019**, these regulations were in force (referenced in SI/2019-77).

## **Summary of Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Fair Trade** | Ensures that goods originating in CIFTA partner countries (like Israel) receive tariff benefits when entering Canada. |
| **Prevent Tariff Evasion** | Restricts the use of non-Party countries to artificially increase transaction value or reprocess goods to avoid tariffs. |
| **Ensure Transparency** | Requires detailed documentation (e.g., bills of lading, customs records) to verify shipping routes and customs control. |
| **Protect Canadian Industry** | Supports domestic industries by reducing import costs from trusted partners under the CIFTA framework. |
| **Align with International Agreements** | Reflects Canada’s obligations under the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) and maintains compliance with WTO and bilateral trade rules. |

---

## **Conclusion**

The *CIFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* establish a **clear, rules-based system** for determining when goods from Israel or other CIFTA beneficiaries are eligible for preferential tariff treatment when entering Canada. The regulations emphasize:

- **Origin verification** through rules of origin,
- **Transit transparency** via documentary evidence,
- **Value thresholds** (10%) to prevent manipulation,
- **Customs control documentation** to ensure compliance.

By repealing outdated provisions and aligning with updated legislation (2019), the regulations modernize Canada’s approach to trade preferences under CIFTA, promoting fair competition, transparency, and adherence to international trade principles.

---

> **Note**: These regulations apply only to goods that are **originating** under CIFTA rules and are **not applicable** to non-originating goods or goods from non-Party countries unless otherwise specified in the broader tariff framework.
