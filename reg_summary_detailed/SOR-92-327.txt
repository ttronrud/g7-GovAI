**Detailed Summary of the Affiliated Persons (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

The *Affiliated Persons (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were enacted on **June 1, 1992**, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **Section 166 of the Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**. These regulations establish a clear and comprehensive framework defining when a **natural person is considered "affiliated" with a trust or loan company**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **promote transparency, prevent conflicts of interest, and ensure financial accountability** in the operations of trust and loan companies. By identifying affiliated persons, the regulations help regulators and companies detect potential risks such as self-dealing, over-leveraging, or improper use of company resources.

These regulations are particularly relevant in the context of **related-party transactions**, where financial relationships between a company and individuals or entities may compromise sound governance or prudent lending practices.

### **Key Definitions**

#### 1. **"Act"**
Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which provides the legal basis for regulating trust and loan companies in Canada. This regulation operates under the authority granted by Section 166 of that Act.

#### 2. **"Indebtedness"**
Defined broadly to include:
- Commercial paper
- Acceptances (e.g., promissory notes accepted by banks)
- Lines of credit that have been drawn upon
- Margin loans made to a **director or officer** of the company

> *Note:* This definition ensures that not only formal loans but also short-term, flexible financing instruments are included in the assessment of financial relationships.

#### 3. **"Not in Good Standing" (in respect of a loan)**
A loan is deemed "not in good standing" if **any of the following conditions apply**:
- Any payment of **principal or interest is 90 days or more overdue**
- Interest is **not being accrued** on the lender’s books due to doubt about repayment (i.e., the lender considers the loan uncollectible)
- The interest rate has been **reduced** by the lender because the borrower is deemed financially weak

> *Purpose:* This criterion flags loans that are at high risk of default, which may indicate financial instability or poor creditworthiness.

#### 4. **"Significant Borrower"**
A natural person or entity is considered a *significant borrower* if their total indebtedness (principal amount) exceeds the **greater of** the following thresholds:

##### For a **Natural Person**:
- **$200,000**, **or**
- **One fiftieth of one per cent (0.2%)** of the company’s regulatory capital

> Example: If a company has $10 million in regulatory capital, 0.2% equals $20,000. So, a person with a loan of over $200,000 or over $20,000 would be considered a significant borrower.

##### For an **Entity**:
- **$500,000**, **or**
- **One twentieth of one per cent (0.5%)** of the company’s regulatory capital, **or**
- **25% of the value of the entity’s assets**

> Example: If an entity has $2 million in assets, 25% equals $500,000. So, if the entity has indebtedness exceeding $500,000, or 0.5% of regulatory capital, or $500,000 in asset value, it qualifies.

> *Purpose:* This definition allows for both absolute dollar thresholds and proportional benchmarks based on the company’s size or the entity’s size, ensuring fairness across different business scales.

### **Affiliation Criteria (Section 166 of the Act)**

A **natural person is affiliated with a company** if any of the following conditions apply:

#### 1. **Employment Relationship**
- The person is an **officer or employee** of the company or an **affiliate** of the company.

> *Implication:* Employees, especially those in senior roles, are automatically considered affiliated, regardless of their financial involvement.

#### 2. **Significant Shareholding**
- The person has a **significant interest in a class of shares** of the company.

> *Definition of "significant interest" is not defined here*, but in practice, this typically means ownership of a substantial percentage (e.g., 5% or more) of shares, or control over voting rights.

#### 3. **Substantial Investment in an Affiliate**
- The person has a **substantial investment** in an affiliate of the company.

> *Note:* "Substantial" is not defined numerically, but implies a meaningful financial stake (e.g., a large equity position or loan) in another company controlled or closely linked to the trust/loan company.

#### 4. **Significant Borrower Status**
- The person is a **significant borrower** in respect of the company (as defined above).

> *This directly links financial dependence to affiliation.*

#### 5. **Employment by a Significant Borrower**
- The person is an **officer or employee** of an entity that is a significant borrower of the company.

> *Example:* If a company lends $300,000 to a business owned by a person, and that business is a significant borrower, then the person working for that business is affiliated with the lending company.

#### 6. **Control of Entities with Significant Debt**
- The person **controls one or more entities** such that, if those entities were combined, their total indebtedness to the company or its affiliates would make them a **significant borrower**.

> *Purpose:* Prevents "indirect" affiliation through corporate structures. Even if a person doesn’t personally borrow, if they control a group of entities that collectively exceed the significant borrower threshold, they are considered affiliated.

#### 7. **Goods or Services Provided**
- The person provides **goods or services** to the company, or is a **partner or employee in a partnership** that provides such services, **if**:
  - The total annual billings to the company exceed **10%** of the person’s, partnership’s, or body corporate’s total annual billings.

> *Example:* A contractor who bills the company $100,000 annually and has total annual billings of $1 million would exceed the 10% threshold and thus be considered affiliated.

> *Note:* This criterion applies to both direct and indirect service providers, including partners or employees of entities that serve the company.

#### 8. **Loans Not in Good Standing or Related Employment/Control**
- The person has a **loan that is not in good standing** from the company or an affiliate.
- OR, the person is a **director, officer, or employee** of, or **controls**, an entity that has a loan not in good standing from the company or an affiliate.

> *Purpose:* Flags individuals with financially unstable or risky obligations to the company or its affiliates.

#### 9. **Spousal or Common-Law Partnership Affiliation**
- The person is the **spouse or common-law partner** of someone who meets any of the above criteria (a–h).

> *Purpose:* Extends affiliation to family members, recognizing that financial or operational ties may extend beyond the individual.

### **Key Implications and Practical Applications**

1. **Conflict of Interest Prevention**  
   The regulations ensure that affiliated persons are subject to stricter disclosure and approval requirements when engaging in transactions with the company. This helps prevent self-dealing, favoritism, or misuse of company resources.

2. **Transparency in Financial Relationships**  
   Companies must identify and disclose affiliations to regulators and stakeholders, promoting transparency in corporate governance.

3. **Risk Management**  
   By identifying individuals with significant debt or large financial interests, regulators can assess potential risks to the stability of the trust or loan company.

4. **Cross-Entity and Family Ties**  
   The rules account for both direct and indirect relationships (e.g., through subsidiaries, partnerships, or family members), ensuring a holistic view of affiliations.

5. **Proportionality and Fairness**  
   The thresholds (e.g., 0.2% of capital for individuals, 0.5% for entities) are designed to scale with the size of the company, avoiding disproportionate burdens on small or medium-sized institutions.

6. **Operational Clarity**  
   The clear definitions of "significant borrower," "not in good standing," and "affiliated" provide guidance for both companies and regulators in identifying and managing relationships.

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The term **"significant interest"** in shareholding is not explicitly defined, which may require interpretation or additional guidance from regulators.
- The **10% billing threshold** may be considered high for small service providers but may be appropriate for large-scale service relationships.
- The rules apply only to **natural persons**; entities are governed under separate criteria (e.g., significant borrower status).
- The regulations do not address **non-financial affiliations** (e.g., personal relationships outside of employment or debt).
