### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 5a of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act (FMIOA)**, as amended. It is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs**. This means that the federal government, through its foreign affairs department, has determined that the specific privileges and immunities granted are necessary and appropriate for the functioning of a particular international event.

The Order is formally referenced in the following statutes:
- **S.C. 2002, c. 12, s. 3 and 10** – These provisions establish the legal framework for the recognition and application of privileges and immunities for foreign missions and international organizations.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 41** – The original Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act, which provides the foundational legal basis for such orders.

This Order is a **temporary, specific instrument** designed to extend certain privileges and immunities to participants in a particular intergovernmental gathering — the North American Leaders’ Summit — in Canada.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes clear definitions to ensure legal precision and consistency:

- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act. This international treaty forms the basis for the privileges and immunities granted under this Order. It is a well-established legal instrument that protects the rights of diplomatic missions and officials.

- **Meeting**: Specifically defined as the **meeting of the Organization held in Montebello, Quebec, on August 20 and 21, 2007**. This is the central event for which the privileges are granted.

- **Organization**: Refers to the **intergovernmental conference known as the North American Leaders’ Summit**. This is a high-level policy forum involving leaders from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, aimed at advancing cooperation among the three nations.

### **3. Scope of Privileges and Immunities**

The Order grants **temporary privileges and immunities** to representatives from:

- The **United Mexican States** (Mexico)  
- The **United States of America** (U.S.)

These representatives are attending the **Meeting of the Organization** (the North American Leaders’ Summit) and are entitled to certain protections and rights **during a specific time period**.

#### **Time Period**
The privileges and immunities apply from:
- **August 18, 2007** (beginning)  
- To **August 23, 2007** (end)

This period includes the days leading up to and immediately following the summit, allowing for travel, preparation, and post-meeting activities.

#### **Scope of Rights**
The privileges and immunities granted are **limited to the extent required for the exercise of their functions** in relation to the Meeting. This means they are not granted broadly or indefinitely, but only as needed to perform their official duties during the summit.

The specific rights drawn from the **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations** are:

- **Section 11**: Protection of persons (e.g., immunity from arrest or prosecution for acts performed in the course of their official duties).
- **Section 12**: Immunity from civil and administrative liability (e.g., protection from lawsuits related to official acts).
- **Sections 14 to 16**: Protection of official communications, property, and the right to conduct official business without interference.

These provisions are derived from the **United Nations Convention**, which is widely recognized in international law and provides a model for diplomatic immunity.

### **4. Purpose and Justification**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Ensure that the representatives of Mexico and the United States can carry out their official duties during the North American Leaders’ Summit without undue interference or legal risk.
- Facilitate the smooth operation of a high-level intergovernmental meeting by providing legal certainty and protection for participants.
- Recognize the diplomatic nature of the event and align it with international standards for diplomatic immunity.

By applying the UN Convention’s framework, the Canadian government demonstrates respect for international norms and supports multilateral cooperation among North American nations.

### **5. Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government. This is standard practice for statutory instruments in Canada — registration in the *Canada Gazette* marks the official commencement of legal effect.

### **6. Limitations and Key Features**

- **Temporary in nature**: The Order is not a permanent grant of privileges. It is time-bound and event-specific.
- **Limited in scope**: Privileges are only granted to the extent necessary for the functions of the representatives during the Meeting.
- **Applicable only to Mexican and U.S. representatives**: Canadian officials or other participants are not covered.
- **Based on international treaty law**: The rights are derived from the UN Convention, not from Canadian domestic law, reflecting the international character of the event.

### **Conclusion**

The **North American Leaders’ Summit 2007 Privileges and Immunities Order** is a targeted, legally sound, and diplomatically appropriate measure that enables key foreign officials from Mexico and the United States to participate in a high-level summit in Canada without fear of legal action or interference. By invoking the well-established framework of the United Nations Convention on Privileges and Immunities, the Order ensures that the summit proceeds in a secure and professional environment, promoting effective intergovernmental dialogue and cooperation among North American leaders.
