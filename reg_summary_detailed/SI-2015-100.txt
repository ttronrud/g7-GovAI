**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2006-67 (February 6, 2006):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2006-67, which was originally issued on February 6, 2006. This order had previously established the Minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation prior to the 2015 change.  
   - By repealing this order, the Government removes the previous designation of the Minister responsible for Canada Post, effectively ending the legal basis for the prior ministerial assignment under that order.  
   - This action signals a structural shift in the governance and administrative oversight of Canada Post, aligning it with a new ministerial designation.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as Minister for Canada Post:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** as the official "Minister" for the purposes of the Canada Post Corporation Act.  
   - This designation is made under subsection 2(1) of the Canada Post Corporation Act, which defines the Minister as the person responsible for overseeing the operations and governance of Canada Post.  
   - The Minister is also formally appointed as a **member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal recognition of their role in the federal government’s executive structure and grants them the authority to act on behalf of the Crown in matters related to Canada Post.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- **Administrative Clarity and Accountability:** The change ensures a clear, current, and legally defined minister responsible for Canada Post, replacing a previous, outdated designation.  
- **Strengthened Oversight:** By assigning responsibility to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, the government integrates Canada Post’s operations more closely with broader public service and infrastructure governance.  
- **Continuity and Stability:** The repeal of the 2006 order avoids confusion or legal ambiguity in ministerial responsibilities, ensuring that Canada Post continues to be governed under a current and properly authorized ministerial framework.  
- **Formal Recognition:** The appointment as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council affirms the minister’s status and authority in the federal executive branch, enabling them to issue orders, make policy decisions, and represent the Crown in matters related to Canada Post.

**Context and Background:**

- This change occurred during a period of administrative restructuring in the federal government, reflecting a broader effort to streamline responsibilities across departments.  
- Prior to 2015, Canada Post had been under the purview of various ministers, with its oversight sometimes shifting between departments. The 2015 designation provides a stable and permanent ministerial assignment.  
- The move also reflects the government’s intent to align Canada Post’s management with the broader goals of public service efficiency, modernization, and accountability.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation marks a significant administrative update to the governance structure of Canada Post. By repealing an outdated ministerial order and formally designating the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as the Minister responsible under the Canada Post Corporation Act, the Government ensures clarity, continuity, and effective oversight of Canada Post’s operations. The designation also affirms the minister’s formal standing within the federal executive, enhancing the institution’s accountability and integration into the broader public service framework.
