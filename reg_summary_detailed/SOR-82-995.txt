The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision in question has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Title**: The specific regulation being referenced is not named in your input. However, the notation "SOR/2017-84, s. 1" refers to a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Order) published in 2017, specifically Order No. 84, section 1.

- **Repeal Action**: Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 formally **repeals** (withdraws or cancels) a prior regulation. This means that the regulation previously in force — which was likely issued earlier and may have governed a specific area such as licensing, safety standards, environmental protections, or financial regulations — is no longer valid or enforceable.

- **Legal Effect**: Once a regulation is repealed by another statute or order, it is considered **no longer in effect**. Any legal obligations, duties, or prohibitions previously established by the repealed regulation are **terminated**. Entities or individuals previously subject to it must now comply with any current, surviving regulations that address the same subject matter.

- **Purpose of Repeal**: Repealing a regulation typically occurs when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It is replaced by a more effective, modern, or comprehensive version.
  - It creates administrative or legal complexity.

- **Context of SOR/2017-84**: While the exact content of SOR/2017-84 is not provided, such orders are commonly issued by the Government of Canada to amend or update regulations under various federal departments (e.g., Health, Environment, Transport, or Finance). The repeal of a prior regulation in this manner is a standard administrative tool for regulatory modernization.

- **Importance of the Summary**: Since the regulation is **repealed**, it does **not currently apply**. Any legal, operational, or compliance considerations related to it must be based on **current, active regulations** that may have been introduced in its place or in a different form.
