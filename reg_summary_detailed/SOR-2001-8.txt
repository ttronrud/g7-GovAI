Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Order Binding Certain Agents of Her Majesty for the Purposes of Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)**

#### **Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- It is based on **paragraph 26(2)(a)** of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* (PIPEDA), which allows the Government of Canada to designate certain federal agencies or organizations as being subject to Part 1 of PIPEDA — the core privacy provisions governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.
- This provision enables the binding of specific agents (entities) to PIPEDA even when they are not otherwise covered by the *Privacy Act* or other federal privacy legislation.

#### **Purpose of the Order**
- To **bind specific federal agencies or organizations** to the privacy requirements of **Part 1 of PIPEDA**, despite the fact that these entities are **exempt from the general application of the Privacy Act** (which applies to federal government departments and agencies).
- The goal is to ensure that these entities comply with the same privacy standards as other public bodies, particularly in how they collect, use, and disclose personal information.

#### **Entities Bound by the Order**
The following two organizations are specifically bound by this Order to comply with Part 1 of PIPEDA:

1. **Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)**  
   - A federal corporation responsible for nuclear energy research, development, and safety.
   - The Order applies to AECL’s handling of personal information in its operations, including employee records, customer data, and data collected from individuals involved in nuclear programs or safety-related activities.

2. **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)**  
   - A federal Crown corporation responsible for broadcasting services (radio, television, and digital media).
   - The Order applies to CBC’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information related to audience members, employees, contributors, and other stakeholders.

> **Note**: These entities are not subject to the *Privacy Act*, which governs most federal government departments. Therefore, this Order ensures they are still subject to the privacy protections and accountability mechanisms established under PIPEDA.

#### **Effective Date**
- The Order **came into force on January 1, 2001**.
- This date marks the implementation of the privacy obligations for AECL and CBC under PIPEDA.

#### **Repeal Status**
- The regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2005-250, section 1** (Statutory Instrument 2005-250).
- This means that **the binding effect of the Order no longer applies** as of the date of repeal.
- The repeal indicates a change in policy or legislative direction — likely due to subsequent amendments to PIPEDA or the implementation of new privacy frameworks that rendered the specific binding of AECL and CBC unnecessary or outdated.

#### **Key Implications**
- **Privacy Compliance**: Before the repeal, AECL and CBC were required to follow PIPEDA’s principles, such as:
  - Purpose limitation
  - Accountability
  - Consent
  - Data minimization
  - Accuracy
  - Security
  - Limitation of use and disclosure
  - Openness
  - Individual access and correction rights
- **Regulatory Alignment**: This Order ensured that key federal institutions — particularly those with large public-facing operations (like CBC) or sensitive data handling (like AECL) — were held to the same privacy standards as other federal bodies.
- **Policy Evolution**: The repeal suggests that either:
  - The original scope of PIPEDA was expanded to cover these entities through other means (e.g., through broader application or new regulations), or
  - The need for a separate binding order was superseded by other legislative or administrative measures.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation was a significant step in extending PIPEDA’s privacy protections to two major federal institutions — AECL and CBC — that were previously outside the scope of the *Privacy Act*. It ensured that these organizations adhered to strong privacy principles in their operations. However, the regulation has since been **repealed**, meaning that the binding effect of PIPEDA on these entities no longer exists under current law. The repeal reflects evolving governance and privacy frameworks in Canada, and underscores the dynamic nature of privacy legislation.
