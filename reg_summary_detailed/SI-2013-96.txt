### **Key Provisions and Content**

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**  
   The control and supervision of the **International Experience Canada Program Unit** — a specific component within the **Global Business Opportunities Bureau** — is being transferred from the **Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD)** to the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI)**.

2. **Nature of the Unit**  
   The International Experience Canada Program Unit is responsible for administering the **International Experience Canada (IEC) Program**, a federal initiative that allows foreign nationals to come to Canada for temporary work and training opportunities. This program is designed to provide skilled individuals with the chance to gain Canadian work experience, contribute to the Canadian economy, and develop language and cultural skills.

3. **Administrative and Functional Shift**  
   This transfer signifies a strategic realignment of responsibilities within the federal public service. The IEC Program, although historically linked to foreign affairs and trade due to its international outreach, is now being managed under the jurisdiction of Citizenship and Immigration, reflecting the program’s primary focus on immigration, temporary foreign worker mobility, and integration into Canadian society.

4. **Legal Authority**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which empowers the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to reassign functions and responsibilities among departments, provided such transfers are recommended by the Prime Minister and are in the public interest.

5. **Purpose of the Transfer**  
   The reallocation aims to:
   - Improve coordination between immigration policy and labor market needs;
   - Enhance the efficiency and oversight of temporary foreign worker programs;
   - Align administrative functions with broader immigration policy objectives;
   - Strengthen the integration of international experience into Canada’s broader immigration and economic development strategy.

6. **Effective Date**  
   The transfer became effective on **August 31, 2013**. This means that from that date onward, all administrative, operational, financial, and policy-related responsibilities for the IEC Program Unit were transferred to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.

### **Context and Significance**

- This move reflects a broader trend in Canadian government restructuring to streamline immigration-related services and improve the delivery of temporary work programs.
- The IEC Program is distinct from the more well-known **Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)**, though it shares similar goals. IEC is often marketed as a more accessible and structured pathway for international students and skilled workers to gain work experience in Canada.
- By moving the unit to Citizenship and Immigration, the federal government ensures that the program is better integrated into the overall immigration and settlement framework, including language training, credential recognition, and post-arrival support.

### **Legal Citation**

- **Primary Statute:** *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, S.C. 2003, c. 22, section 207  
- **Relevant Section:** Paragraph 2(a)(a) – Authorizes the transfer of control and supervision of public administration functions between departments.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally transfers the administrative oversight of the **International Experience Canada Program Unit** from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, effective August 31, 2013. The change enhances policy coherence, improves program delivery, and reflects a strategic shift in how Canada manages temporary international work opportunities. It is grounded in constitutional and statutory authority and represents a key administrative adjustment within the federal public service.
