Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulatory Summary: Revocation and Designation of the Appropriate Minister under the Financial Administration Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically under **paragraph (c.1)** of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in **section 2** of the Act. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to designate a specific minister as the "appropriate Minister" for a particular statutory body or commission. The designation is necessary to ensure proper financial oversight and accountability in the management of funds allocated to such bodies.

**2. Revocation of Prior Order**  
The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1993-1452**, dated June 25, 1993. This prior order had previously established a designation or framework relating to the National Battlefields Commission, likely assigning a different minister or providing administrative instructions for financial administration. By revoking this order, the government formally removes the previous designation or administrative structure, thereby eliminating any prior ministerial responsibility or financial authority assignments tied to that order.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Communications**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of Communications** as the **"appropriate Minister"** with respect to the **National Battlefields Commission** for all purposes governed by the Financial Administration Act. This means that the Minister of Communications is now the designated minister responsible for:

- Approving financial expenditures of the National Battlefields Commission;
- Providing financial oversight and accountability;
- Ensuring compliance with financial administration rules and procedures under the FAA;
- Acting as the point of contact for financial matters involving the Commission.

**4. Purpose and Significance**  
The designation serves several key purposes:

- **Clarity of Responsibility**: It clearly assigns financial authority to a specific minister, avoiding ambiguity or overlap in financial oversight.
- **Accountability**: It ensures that the National Battlefields Commission operates under the financial supervision of a designated minister, enhancing transparency and accountability.
- **Policy Alignment**: The appointment may reflect a strategic decision to align the Commission’s operations with the priorities of the Department of Communications, possibly due to the Commission’s focus on heritage, historical preservation, or national identity—areas that may fall under the jurisdiction or mandate of communications or cultural affairs.

**5. Legal Effect**  
This regulation is effective from the date of publication in the Canada Gazette (Part II, page 3198, SI/93-106, 1993). It supersedes the prior Order in Council (P.C. 1993-1452) and takes effect immediately upon publication. It is binding on all relevant departments and officials involved in the financial administration of the National Battlefields Commission.

**6. Scope and Limitations**  
- The designation applies **only to financial administration matters** under the Financial Administration Act.
- It does not alter the statutory mandate, governance structure, or operational responsibilities of the National Battlefields Commission itself.
- The designation remains in force until formally revoked or amended by a subsequent order.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a formal and legally binding reorganization of financial oversight for the National Battlefields Commission. By revoking an outdated order and designating the Minister of Communications as the appropriate Minister under the Financial Administration Act, the government ensures that financial accountability is clearly assigned and aligned with current administrative priorities. It reflects a shift in ministerial responsibility that supports effective governance and transparency in heritage-related funding and operations.
