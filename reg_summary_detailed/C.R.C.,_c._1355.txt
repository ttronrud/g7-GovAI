## **Core Provisions and Timeline**

### **1. Transfer of Funds and Securities (Effective by September 30, 1973)**

- **Mandatory Transfer Deadline**: On or before **September 30, 1973**, the Authority must:
  - Pay **all moneys** (including accrued interest) in both the **Halifax Pilots’ Pension Fund** and the **Saint John Pilots’ Pension Fund** to the **Minister of Finance**.
  - Transfer **all securities** held in either fund (including accrued interest) to the Minister of Finance.

> ✅ This ensures that all assets from the legacy pilotage pension funds are consolidated into the national public service superannuation system.

---

### **2. Consolidation into the Superannuation Account**

- The **Minister of Finance** must:
  - Receive the funds and securities from the Authority.
  - **Pay all moneys** received into the **Superannuation Account**.
  - **Liquidate all securities** and pay the proceeds (realized value) into the Superannuation Account.
  - Complete all actions **by September 30, 1973**.

> ✅ This marks the formal integration of the pilotage pension funds into the broader public service pension framework.

---

### **3. Continuation of Pension Benefits (Post-Transfer)**

- Starting on the **first day of the month following September 30, 1973**, the Superannuation Account shall:
  - Pay out **all existing pension benefits** that were being paid from the Halifax or Saint John funds on that date.
  - Pay out **any additional pension benefits** that would have been due under the *Halifax By-law* or *Saint John By-law* as they existed on **February 1, 1973**, for pilots who:
    - Contributed under those by-laws;
    - Retired or were retired **before February 1, 1973**.

> 🔍 This provision ensures **continuity of pension rights** for pilots who retired prior to the transition date, protecting their entitlements under the old system.

---

### **4. Terms and Conditions of Pension Payments**

- All pension benefits paid under this regulation must be **subject to the same terms and conditions** as they would have been under:
  - Sections 26, 27, and 28 of the *Halifax By-law*;
  - Part II of the *Saint John By-law*,
  as those laws read on **February 1, 1973**.

> ✅ This preserves the original pension structure and eligibility rules, ensuring fairness and consistency in benefit calculation.

---

### **5. Recognition of Pensionable Service (as of February 1, 1973)**

Each employee is deemed to have **pensionable service under the Act** as of **February 1, 1973**, equal to the **most recent portion** of their service during which they contributed under either the Halifax or Saint John By-law.

This service is calculated based on the following assumptions:

- **Service Period**: The period of active service during which the pilot contributed under the By-law.
- **Contribution Rate**: The amount of contributions made is calculated using **twice the rate of contributions** applicable under the Act for a comparable period of public service.
- **Salary Assumption**: The salary used for calculating pension entitlements is equal to the **actual compensation** the pilot received during that service period.
- **Interest Assumption**: Interest is assumed to have been paid on contributions at a rate **equal to the interest rate** under the Act during that period, calculated from the **middle of each fiscal year** to **February 1, 1973**.

> 📌 This creates a fair and equitable way to value prior service under the old by-laws in terms of the new public service pension system.

---

### **6. Accumulated Contributions (Calculation and Treatment)**

For the purpose of determining pension entitlements, **accumulated contributions** are defined as:

> The total amount contributed to the Halifax or Saint John fund, **plus 3% annual interest**, compounded annually, calculated from the **middle of each fiscal year** during the period of active service until **February 1, 1973**.

> 💡 This interest rate (3%) is a fixed, conservative rate applied to ensure fair valuation of past contributions.

---

### **7. Excess Contributions (Bonus Payment)**

- If the **accumulated contributions** (calculated under subsection 5(2)) **exceed** the amount required to purchase the full pensionable service under subsection 5(1), then:
  - The **excess amount** is paid directly to the employee.

> ✅ This provides a **financial windfall** to pilots whose contributions were greater than what was needed to cover their service, recognizing their actual investment.

---

### **8. Optional Election to Purchase Remaining Service (Post-Transfer)**

If an employee has **unaccounted service** (i.e., service during which they contributed under the By-law that is not recognized as pensionable under subsection 5(1)), they may choose to **purchase that service** by paying a calculated amount.

#### Two Options:

| Option | Conditions |
|-------|------------|
| **(a)** Within 6 months of being informed of the remainder of service | Pay an amount equal to what would have been calculated under subsection 5(1), using the same methodology as in subsection 5(1). |
| **(b)** After 6 months | Pay an amount as if **Clause 5(1)(b)(iii)(K)** of the *Public Service Superannuation Act* applied to them. |

> ⚠️ Clause 5(1)(b)(iii)(K) likely refers to a provision allowing for special treatment or enhanced contribution rates for certain service periods.  
> This gives employees flexibility to "buy back" unused service, though only if they act within a defined window.

> 📝 This provision acknowledges that some service may not have been fully recognized and allows employees to **recoup value** through a financial contribution.
