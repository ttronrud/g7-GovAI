The regulation referenced — "[Repealed, SI/2018-80]" — indicates that the specific regulation in question has been officially repealed by a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2018, number 80.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the issuing authority, or the subject matter of the regulation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the original content of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a regulation is marked as "repealed," it means:

- The regulation is no longer in force.
- It has been formally replaced or removed by a new piece of legislation or statutory instrument.
- The repeal is typically published in the official government gazette (e.g., the Canada Gazette, the UK Statutory Instruments, or equivalent national publication).
- The repeal may be part of a broader legislative update to modernize, simplify, or align the law with current policy or legal standards.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

1. Full title of the repealed regulation (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2015").
2. The jurisdiction (e.g., United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, etc.).
3. The date of original enactment.
4. The specific provisions or areas it governed (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.).
5. The reason for repeal (e.g., redundancy, obsolescence, duplication, or replacement by new legislation).

Therefore, based on the information provided — only "[Repealed, SI/2018-80]" — the most accurate summary is:
