---

#### 🚫 No Reduction or Suspension:
- Benefits under the legislation of a Party **shall not be reduced, suspended, or cancelled** solely because the person resides in the other country.
- Benefits must be **paid in the territory of the other country**.

> This ensures **portability** and **non-discrimination** based on residence.

---

### 📅 **6. Determining Jurisdiction for Employment**

#### ✅ Employed Persons:
- An employed person working in a Party’s territory is **subject only to that Party’s legislation**.
- Exception: If the person works for the **same or related employer** in the other Party’s territory, they are subject only to the **first Party’s legislation** (as if working within its borders).
- **Assignment Limitation**: This coverage applies for **no more than 60 months** without prior approval from both competent authorities.

#### 🚢 Crew Members:
- A crew member who would otherwise be subject to both systems is:
  - Subject **only to Canada** if they **ordinarily reside in Canada**

### 📊 **7. Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

This section outlines **how creditable periods are counted** when a person has worked or lived in both countries.

#### 🇨🇦 Canada – Croatia Interaction:
- **If a person contributes to CPP or provincial pension plans while in Croatia**:
  - That period is **counted as residence in Canada** for the person and their **spouse/dependants** (if not employed/self-employed in Croatia).
- **If a person is subject to Croatian legislation while in Canada**:
  - That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada for the person or dependants (unless they are contributing to CPP or provincial plans).

> This reflects the principle that only **contributions** (not mere presence) count toward eligibility.

---

### 📈 **8. Eligibility Determination for Benefits**

#### ⚖️ Totalization of Creditable Periods:
- If a person lacks sufficient creditable periods under one Party’s system, eligibility is determined by **summing**:
  - Creditable periods under Canada and Croatia
  - Any periods completed under a **third country** with which both Parties have agreements (if applicable)

> This prevents denial of benefits due to gaps in coverage.

#### 🇭🇷 Croatia – Canada Interaction:
- **Old Age Pension (Croatia)**:
  - A **calendar year** of CPP creditable periods = **52 weeks** of Croatian creditable periods.
  - A **week** of CPP creditable periods (not part of a CPP year) = **one week** of Croatian creditable periods.

- **Disability or Survivor’s Pension (Croatia)**:
  - A calendar year of CPP creditable periods = **52 weeks** of Croatian creditable periods.

> This enables Croatian pension eligibility based on Canadian contributions.

---

### 🚫 **9. Exceptions and Limitations**

#### ❌ Minimum Period Requirement:
- If a person has **less than one year** of total creditable periods under a Party’s legislation, and **no right to a benefit exists under that legislation**, then:
  - The competent institution **does not have to pay** a benefit under this Agreement.

> Prevents partial or inadequate benefits from being issued.

#### 📉 Partial Pensions (Old Age Security):
- If a person is eligible **only through totalization**, the **amount of the Old Age Security pension or spouse’s allowance** is calculated:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based only on **CPP pensionable earnings**
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Multiplied by the **ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period** (but capped at 100%)

> Ensures fair, transparent calculation even when totalization applies.

#### 🇭🇷 Croatia – Benefit Calculation:
- If the amount cannot be determined from Croatian legislation:
  - Eligibility is assessed as if all periods were completed under Croatian law.
  - The **benefit amount** is calculated as the **ratio of Croatian creditable periods to total creditable periods**.
- If total periods **exceed the maximum allowed** under Croatian law:
  - Benefit is calculated as the **ratio of Croatian periods to the maximum period**.

> This prevents overpayment and ensures compliance with national caps.

#### 💰 Benefit Base:
- The benefit base is calculated **exclusively** on **Croatian creditable periods**.
