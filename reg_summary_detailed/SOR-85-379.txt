The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-167, s. 16]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2016-167, section 16**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it is no longer in force.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The regulation was repealed by **SOR/2016-167**, which is a *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* (a formal publication of amendments to federal statutes and regulations).
- **Section Repealed**: Section 16 of that regulation (SOR/2016-167) specifically removed or canceled the content of the previously existing regulation.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or provisions that were established under this regulation are **no longer applicable**. Legal entities, practitioners, or individuals relying on it must now refer to current, active regulations or other applicable statutes.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason is not provided in the text, repeals are typically implemented to:
  - Modernize or simplify legislation,
  - Resolve inconsistencies,
  - Replace outdated or redundant rules,
  - Align with new policy directions,
  - Improve clarity or administrative efficiency.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest a possible formatting or data entry error in the original source — the same repeal notice is listed multiple times, which is redundant and not typical in official legal documents.
- In official legal databases, such a repetition would not be meaningful; only one instance of the repeal is necessary.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer valid** and has been **officially removed** by **SOR/2016-167, section 16**. It should not be referenced or applied in any legal, administrative, or operational context. For current guidance, one must consult the most up-to-date version of the relevant statute or regulation, which may have been replaced or amended by subsequent legislation.

👉 **Recommendation**: If this regulation was part of a specific area (e.g., employment, environmental standards, financial services), consult the official government database (such as CanLII or the federal government’s legislation website) to find the current applicable regulation.
