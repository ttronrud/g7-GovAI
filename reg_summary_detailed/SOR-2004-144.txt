**Detailed Summary of the Marine Transportation Security Regulations (S.C. 1994, c. 40)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Marine Transportation Security Regulations* (MTSR), made under **section 5 of the Marine Transportation Security Act (MTSA)**, establish a comprehensive framework to ensure the security of Canada’s marine transportation system. These regulations implement the **International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code)**, which is incorporated into the **International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)**. The primary objective is to prevent, detect, and respond to threats that could compromise the safety and security of vessels, marine facilities, ports, and their interfaces.

The regulations define key terms, establish security levels (MARSEC), outline responsibilities of operators, and provide procedures for managing security breaches, suspensions of security documents, and appeals.

> - The definition of *international voyage* is defined by the vessel's interface with Canadian marine facilities: it begins at the last interface before departure and ends at the first interface upon return.
> - A reference to a UN number in Schedule 4 refers to goods listed in TDGR Schedule 1 or IMDG Part 3.
> - **No derogation** from seafarers’ welfare and labor rights exists unless there is an **immediate threat** to safety or security.

## **II. Security Levels (MARSEC)**

The regulations establish a tiered system of security levels based on threat assessment:

| Level | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MARSEC Level 1** | Minimum baseline security requirements. Must be maintained **at all times** unless a higher level is mandated by the Minister. Applies to all vessels and marine facilities under Part 2. |
| **MARSEC Level 2** | Enhanced security measures due to **heightened risk**. Implemented in accordance with approved security plans or procedures. |
| **MARSEC Level 3** | Immediate, heightened response to a **probable or imminent threat**, even if the target is not yet identified. Requires full implementation of approved security plans. |

> **Note**: Operators must maintain **MARSEC Level 1 at all times** unless a higher level is required by the Minister due to an assessed threat.

## **III. Access and Communication Requirements for the Public**

To ensure public access and service delivery, especially for travelers:

> The operator of a vessel or marine facility (other than a port administration under paragraph (a) or (b) of the port administration definition) must:
> - Provide **authorized screening** using methods that enable effective communication in **either official language** (English or French) when at least **5% of the traveling public** demands services in one of the official languages.
> - Provide **printed or pre-recorded materials in both official languages** if used during screening.
