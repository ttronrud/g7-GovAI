**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation is a **provincial designation order** issued under **subsection 6(1) of the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act*** (the "Act"), which was enacted to promote timely payment of contractors and subcontractors in federally funded construction projects. The Act establishes a federal framework to ensure that construction contractors and subcontractors are paid promptly, with clear time limits, interest provisions, and a mechanism for dispute resolution through adjudication.

The purpose of this specific regulation is to **designate certain provinces** as having established **regimes for contractor and subcontractor payment** that are **reasonably similar** to those set out in the federal Act. As a result, these provinces are recognized under federal law as being **equally capable of meeting the federal prompt payment standards**, thereby allowing the federal government to **exclude them from certain federal payment obligations** under the Act — specifically, where the province has already implemented comparable laws and adjudication processes.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Authority**: The regulation is issued under **subsection 6(1)** of the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act*.
- **Governing Provision**: Section 2 of the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Regulations* (the "Criteria, Time Limits, Interest and Circumstances") outlines the specific criteria that must be met for a provincial regime to be considered "reasonably similar" to the federal regime.
- **Decision-Making Body**: The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services) makes this designation based on an assessment of provincial laws and practices.

---

### **Key Criteria for Designation**

The Governor in Council determines that the designated provinces have enacted:

1. **A payment regime** that is **reasonably similar** to the federal Act, including:
   - Timely payment obligations (e.g., payment within a defined period after completion or submission of invoices).
   - Clear timelines for payment (e.g., within 30 days of invoice submission).
   - Mechanisms to ensure contractors and subcontractors receive payments without undue delay.

2. **An adjudication regime** that is **reasonably similar** to the federal adjudication process, which includes:
   - A formal, binding, and independent process for resolving payment disputes.
   - A timeframe for adjudication (e.g., within 14 days of request).
   - A process that allows for binding decisions without the need for court involvement.
   - The ability to enforce adjudicated decisions with interest and penalties for non-compliance.

These elements are evaluated against the standards set out in **Section 2 of the Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Regulations**.

### **Designated Provinces**

The following provinces are officially designated under subsection 6(1) of the Act:

- **Ontario**
- **Saskatchewan**
- **Alberta**

These provinces are recognized as having implemented **laws and administrative practices** that meet the federal benchmark for prompt payment and dispute resolution.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the day that **Section 387 of the *Budget Implementation Act, 2019, No. 1* (S.C. 2019, c. 29)** comes into force.
- If the Order is **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after** that date, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the designation is implemented in a timely manner and is aligned with the broader legislative schedule of the 2019 budget implementation.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

1. **Federal Payment Obligations**: Once a province is designated, **federal government projects** located within that province are **not required to apply the federal prompt payment rules** if the province already has a comparable regime. This reduces administrative burden and duplication of rules.

2. **Contractor Protection**: The designation ensures that contractors and subcontractors in these provinces still benefit from **timely payment and accessible dispute resolution**, as the provincial regimes are deemed to provide equivalent protection.

3. **Consistency and Fairness**: The regulation promotes **consistency across jurisdictions** by recognizing that provinces with strong, well-functioning payment and adjudication systems can operate under a similar standard to the federal system.

4. **Compliance and Oversight**: The federal government continues to monitor the effectiveness of these provincial regimes. If a province fails to maintain compliance with the standards, it may be re-evaluated for designation.

### **Reference and Updates**

- **Current Status as of December 9, 2023**: This regulation remains in force, as confirmed by **SI/2023-77** (Statutory Instrument 2023-77).
- The designation is **not permanent**; it is subject to review and can be revoked or modified if the provincial regimes fall below the required standards.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a key step in the federal government’s effort to **streamline and improve the construction payment environment** across Canada. By formally recognizing Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta as having implemented payment and adjudication systems that meet federal standards, the government ensures that contractors and subcontractors in these provinces are protected under a system that is both efficient and equitable. It reflects a **pragmatic, results-based approach** to regulatory implementation — one that respects provincial autonomy while maintaining national consistency in construction finance and accountability.

--- 

**In short**:  
This regulation designates Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta as provinces with payment and adjudication systems that meet federal standards under the *Federal Prompt Payment for Construction Work Act*, allowing federal projects in these provinces to operate under provincial rules rather than federal ones — all while ensuring contractors are paid promptly and disputes are resolved efficiently.
