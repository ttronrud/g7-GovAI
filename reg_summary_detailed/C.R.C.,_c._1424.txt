The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2007-86, s. 201]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by the **Statutory Instrument 2007-86**, specifically under section 201 of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
  
  The regulation in question was previously issued under the authority of a prior statute (likely related to the *Regulation of the Use of Radio and Television Frequencies* or a similar telecommunications or broadcasting framework, though the exact parent statute is not specified in your input). However, it was formally **repealed** on **March 15, 2007**, by **SOR/2007-86**, which is a *Statutory Instrument* (a type of secondary legislation in Canada).

- **Repeal Authority**:  
  The repeal was enacted under **section 201** of SOR/2007-86. This section explicitly removes or cancels the prior regulation, rendering it no longer in force or applicable.

- **Purpose of the Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They are superseded by newer, more comprehensive legislation.
  - They create inconsistencies or conflicts with current laws.
  - They are redundant or have been absorbed into another regulation.

  In this case, the repeal suggests that the regulation was either redundant, obsolete, or replaced by a more current and effective legal framework (such as amendments to the *Broadcasting Act* or *Telecommunications Act*).

- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - The regulation no longer applies to any legal or administrative context.
  - Any actions or decisions based on its provisions are no longer valid or enforceable.
  - Legal or regulatory compliance now follows the current, active rules that remain in force after the repeal.

- **Source of Information**:  
  The repeal is officially recorded in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada*, specifically in **SOR/2007-86**, which is accessible through the Government of Canada’s official legislation database (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).
