**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (Terra Incognita Act)**, which provides a legal mechanism for excluding certain strips of land from being deemed reserved to the Crown under specific land grants.

This provision allows for the **exemption of specific land strips** from Crown reservation, meaning that such land will **not be considered reserved** even if it is part of a land grant — thereby making it available for use or development by the grantee (typically a private individual or entity), rather than being held in trust or reserved for public or Indigenous purposes.

**Scope of the Order:**

The order specifically **exempts a strip of land measuring 30.48 meters (100 feet) in width** from being reserved to the Crown. This strip runs **from the ordinary high water mark to the shore of Shell Lake**, along the boundaries of several land lots located in the **Community of Inuvik**, Northwest Territories.

This strip is **not reserved to the Crown** despite being adjacent to or within the boundaries of the described land grants. As a result, the land within this 100-foot width is **not considered part of the Crown's reserved rights**, and thus is **available for use or disposition** by the grantee, unless otherwise restricted by other legislation or agreements.

**Specific Lots Affected:**

The regulation applies to the following land parcels (lots) located in **Block 91**, **Community of Inuvik**, **Northwest Territories**:

1. **Lots 1, 2, and 5**  
   - Located along Shell Lake.  
   - Referenced on **Plan of Survey of Record No. 3561** in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa.  
   - A copy of this plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office, Northwest Territories Registration District, Yellowknife**, under reference number **83732**.

2. **Lots 11-3 to 11-8**  
   - Located along Shell Lake.  
   - Referenced on **Plan of Survey of Record No. 466** in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa.  
   - A copy filed in the Land Titles Office under reference number **53770**.

3. **Lots 11-9 and 11-10**  
   - Located along Shell Lake.  
   - Referenced on **Plan of Survey of Record No. 1140** in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa.  
   - A copy filed in the Land Titles Office under reference number **60734**.

4. **Lots 11-11 to 11-18**  
   - Located along Shell Lake.  
   - Referenced on **Plan of Survey of Record No. 466** (same as above).  
   - A copy filed in the Land Titles Office under reference number **53770**.

> Note: The repeated use of the same survey plan (No. 466) for multiple lots indicates that this plan covers a broader survey area along Shell Lake, and the lots referenced are grouped under this single survey.

**Legal and Practical Implications:**

- **Removal of Crown Reservation**: The 100-foot strip from the high water mark to the shore is **no longer subject to Crown reservation**, which means it is not held in trust or protected by the Crown for public or Indigenous use.
- **Land Use Flexibility**: The strip is now **available for private use, development, or transfer**, depending on applicable land use laws and any existing agreements.
- **Impact on Indigenous Rights and Land Claims**: This regulation may have implications for Indigenous rights, particularly if the strip was historically or traditionally used by Indigenous communities. However, since the regulation is based on a statutory provision (paragraph 13(b)), it operates within the framework of Crown land administration and does not automatically override Indigenous rights or title — those would need to be addressed separately under the *Indian Act*, *Crown Lands Act*, or other relevant Indigenous rights legislation.
- **Survey and Record-Keeping**: The regulation relies on **official survey records** maintained in the Canada Lands Surveys Records and the Land Titles Office in Yellowknife. This ensures that the land description is legally precise and verifiable.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The likely purpose of this order is to **clarify land boundaries and resolve ambiguity** regarding the status of land adjacent to Shell Lake. It may have been issued to:
- Facilitate land development or access.
- Prevent disputes over land use or ownership.
- Reflect a change in land management policy or administrative interpretation.
- Address practical issues related to access, infrastructure, or property rights.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a **statutory land administration order** that removes a 100-foot strip of land (from the ordinary high water mark to the shore of Shell Lake) from Crown reservation for several specific lots in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. The affected lots are clearly identified by number and survey reference, and the order is supported by official survey records. While it enhances land availability for private use, it must be interpreted within the broader context of Indigenous rights, land claims, and environmental or cultural considerations that may exist in the region.

This order does not confer ownership or title to the land, nor does it override any existing Indigenous rights or interests — it only removes a specific reservation status under the Territorial Lands Act. Any future use or development of the strip must comply with relevant land use, environmental, and Indigenous engagement laws.
