### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### 1. **Prescribed Percentage of Voting Rights (Section 276(1)(d) of the Act)**  
- For the purpose of **paragraph 276(1)(d)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, the **prescribed percentage of voting rights** attached to all outstanding shares of a trust or loan company is **10%**.  
- This means that any shareholder holding **10% or more** of the voting rights in a trust or loan company is considered a "significant shareholder" under the Act.  
- This threshold is used to determine when certain disclosure or reporting obligations apply, particularly in relation to changes in control or transactions involving insider information.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that major shareholders are subject to heightened transparency and accountability when dealing with sensitive corporate information.

#### 3. **Prescribed Circumstances for Insider Trading (Section 276(6)(c) of the Act)**  
These regulations define specific circumstances under which a person (an "insider") may **lawfully** purchase or sell securities without violating insider trading rules — even if they acquired confidential information. The following are **exempted** (i.e., not considered insider trading):

- **Pursuant to a specific unsolicited order** to buy or sell securities:  
  If the insider acts as an agent based on a direct, specific, and unsolicited instruction from a third party (e.g., a client), and the order was not solicited by the insider or their affiliated entity, it is exempt.

- **Pursuant to participation in an automatic plan** (e.g., dividend reinvestment, share purchase plan):  
  If the insider entered into an automatic plan (such as a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan) **before** acquiring the confidential information, any transaction made under that plan is exempt.

- **To fulfill a legally binding obligation** entered into prior to acquiring the confidential information:  
  For example, a contract or commitment to buy or sell shares that existed before the insider learned of the confidential information.

- **Purchased or sold as agent or trustee** in circumstances described in (b) or (c):  
  This extends the exemption to transactions made in a fiduciary or representative capacity (e.g., acting as a trustee or agent) where the transaction is tied to one of the above legitimate, pre-existing obligations.

> **Purpose**: To prevent overly broad or punitive enforcement of insider trading rules by recognizing legitimate, pre-existing financial or contractual obligations that do not involve misuse of confidential information.

---

### **Effective Date**  
- These Regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the official Gazette.  
- This ensures that the rules are immediately enforceable upon publication, without delay.

### **Overall Purpose and Significance**

The *Civil Remedies (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* serve several key functions:

1. **Enforcement of Insider Trading Prohibitions**  
   - Establishes clear boundaries for what constitutes insider trading in trust and loan companies, especially during take-over events.

2. **Harmonization Across Jurisdictions**  
   - By aligning the definition of a "take-over bid" with provincial and federal securities legislation, the regulations ensure consistent enforcement across Canada.

3. **Protection of Market Integrity**  
   - Prevents the use of non-public information to gain an unfair advantage in share transactions, thereby maintaining fair and transparent markets.

4. **Fairness and Practicality**  
   - Provides reasonable exemptions for legitimate financial activities (e.g., automatic plans, pre-existing obligations) to avoid unjust penalties.

5. **Clear Thresholds**  
   - The 10% voting rights threshold helps identify significant shareholders who require greater disclosure and oversight.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s regulatory framework for trust and loan companies. They provide a **clear, jurisdictionally aligned, and practical approach** to addressing insider trading and misuse of confidential information — especially during take-over bids — while balancing enforcement with fairness and operational realism.

They reflect a balanced regulatory philosophy: protecting market integrity without unduly restricting legitimate financial behavior.

---

**Note**: These regulations are part of a broader system of corporate governance and securities regulation in Canada. They work in conjunction with the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, the *Securities Act* in various provinces, and other financial regulations to ensure accountability and transparency in the financial sector.
