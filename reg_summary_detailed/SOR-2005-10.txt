### **6. Initial Review by the Chief Justice**

Upon receiving the application, the **Chief Justice** performs two key assessments:

1. **Determine if s. 745.6(1) applies**:
   - If not applicable (e.g., the applicant is not eligible under the Code), the application is **dismissed**.

2. **If applicable**, the Chief Justice determines whether the applicant has shown a **reasonable prospect of success**.

   - If yes, the Chief Justice:
     - Gives **written reasons** for the determination.
     - **Designates a presiding judge** to conduct the hearing.
     - **Forward the application and proof of service** to that judge.

> The designation of the presiding judge must be in writing and filed with the prothonotary.

#### Closing Arguments:
- After evidence, both parties address the jury:
