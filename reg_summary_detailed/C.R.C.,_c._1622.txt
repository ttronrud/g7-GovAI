### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

#### **1. "Cross" (Croix)**
- Refers to the **Memorial Cross**, a specific design with the following features:
  - A **silver patonce cross** (a cross with a central upright and arms extending outwards).
  - Suspended by a **purple ribbon**.
  - At the **end of the upright**: a **crown**.
  - At the **foot** and at the **end of each arm**: a **maple leaf** (symbolizing Canada).
  - In the **center**, within a **wreath of laurel** (symbolizing honor and victory), the **Royal Cypher** of the reigning monarch.
  - **Engraved** with:
    - The **number**, **rank**, and **name** of the sailor or soldier being commemorated.

> This design serves both as a memorial and a personal memento, honoring the individual's sacrifice.

#### **2. "Minister" (ministre)**
- Refers to the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**.
- Holds administrative responsibility for determining eligibility and approving the issuance of the Cross.
- Acts as the official authority in assessing claims and verifying service and familial relationships.

#### **3. "Mother" (mère)**
- Defined as:
  - The **natural mother**, or
  - If not raised by her, the **woman who, in the opinion of the Minister, raised the sailor or soldier from childhood**.
- This definition recognizes both biological and custodial ties, ensuring that individuals who provided care and upbringing are acknowledged.

#### **4. "Sailor" (marin)**
- Includes any person who served during World War I in:
  - Any branch of the **Royal Canadian Naval Service**,
  - Any other **Naval Forces of His Majesty (the King)**, or
  - The **Naval Forces of an allied nation** during WWI.
- **Eligibility condition**: The sailor must have been:
  - Born or domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland, or
  - An **ordinary resident** of Canada or Newfoundland at any time between **August 3, 1904**, and the date they began serving.

> This ensures that only those with a meaningful connection to Canada or Newfoundland are included.

  - Born or domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland, or
  - An **ordinary resident** of Canada or Newfoundland between **August 3, 1904**, and the start of service.

> Similar to the sailor, this establishes a geographical and temporal link to Canada or Newfoundland.

#### **6. "Widow" (veuve)**
- Includes:
  - The **legal widow or widower** of the sailor or soldier.
  - Any person who is **pensionable as a widow** under the *Pension Act* due to the death of the service member.
  - Any person who, **if the Pension Act applied**, would have been deemed the widow.
- **Excludes**:
  - Anyone who was **divorced**, **judicially separated**, or **separated by written or other agreement** at the time of the service member’s death.

> This definition ensures that only those with a legally recognized or pension-eligible marital relationship are included.

- Defined to have the **same meaning** as in **subsection 3(1) of the Pension Act**.
- Ensures legal consistency with existing legislation regarding service and eligibility during the war.

### **Eligibility for the Memorial Cross**

A Memorial Cross may be issued **only** to the following persons, in this order of priority:

1. **To the mother**, if alive  
2. **To the widow**, if alive  
3. **If no mother or widow is alive**, then to the **eldest living child**  
4. **If no mother, widow, or child is alive**, then to the **father**, if alive  
5. **If no one in (a) to (d) is alive**, then to the **eldest living brother or sister** of the sailor or soldier  

> This hierarchy prioritizes the most directly affected family members, with a clear progression from maternal and marital ties to children and siblings.

### **Who Is Eligible for a Cross?**

A Cross may be issued in respect of a sailor or soldier who:

- Was **killed in action** during World War I  
- **Died while on active service** during World War I  
- **Died or died from causes attributable to service** during World War I — whether:
  - While serving on active duty, or  
  - Subsequent to discharge (i.e., due to illness or injury sustained during service)

> **Important Exception**:  
> If a person **died after discharge** from naval or military service, a Cross may **only** be issued to the **widow or her next of kin** **if** she was **married to the sailor or soldier at the time of discharge**.

> This exception reflects a distinction between deaths during active service and those resulting from long-term service-related conditions, ensuring that only those with a direct marital connection at the time of discharge are eligible.

### **Conditions for Issuance**

A Cross **shall not be issued** to any person unless they provide **proof of**:

1. The **death** of the sailor or soldier  
2. The **service** of the sailor or soldier during World War I  
3. The **eligibility** of the claimant (i.e., their relationship to the deceased as defined in the Order)

> This requirement ensures that all awards are based on verifiable facts and prevents misuse or unauthorized claims.

**Note**: This Order is part of a broader framework of commemorative legislation in Canada, including the *Pension Act* and other veterans' recognition programs. It is not a current active policy in the modern era (as Canada has moved toward more comprehensive recognition through national memorials, the Canadian Virtual War Memorial, and other initiatives), but remains historically significant and may still be referenced in archival or genealogical research.
