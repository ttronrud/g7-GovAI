The reference "[Repealed, SI/2012-30, s. 6]" indicates that a specific regulation was officially repealed by **Statutory Instrument 2012 No. 30**, under **section 6** of that instrument.

However, without the original text of the regulation that was repealed, a detailed summary cannot be provided — because the regulation itself is no longer in force.

### Interpretation and Summary:

- **Repeal Status**: The regulation referenced has been formally repealed. This means it is no longer valid or enforceable law.
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument (SI) 2012 No. 30, which was made under the authority of a parent act (not specified in your query).
- **Section 6 of SI 2012-30**: This section specifically contains the provision that repeals the targeted regulation. It typically includes a clear statement identifying the rule or provision being removed and may include reasons or transitional arrangements (if any).
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SI 2012 No. 30, which is generally the date of publication (likely 2012), unless otherwise stated.

### Why This Matters:
- Any legal or regulatory analysis based on this repealed regulation is outdated and must be replaced with current legislation.
- Entities (such as businesses, government agencies, or legal practitioners) must ensure they are operating under current, active rules to avoid non-compliance.

### Limitations of the Summary:
Since the original regulation is not provided, we cannot:
- Describe its content, purpose, or scope.
- Explain its impact on individuals or industries.
- Provide context on how it was replaced or what new regulation now governs the area.

### Recommendation:
To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, you would need to:
1. Identify the full title of the regulation that was repealed (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 200X").
2. Access the original text of that regulation, which may be found in:
   - The UK Statutory Instruments database (https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
   - The official legislation archive (e.g., via legislation.gov.uk or the National Archives)
3. Review the text of SI 2012 No. 30, particularly section 6, which may include a brief rationale for the repeal.
