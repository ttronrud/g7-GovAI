**Detailed Summary of the *Commercial Loan (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* (S.C. 1991, c. 45)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Commercial Loan (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*, made under the authority of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (the "Act"), serve to **define key terms** and **prescribe specific international agencies** in the context of commercial loans. These regulations are critical for determining when a loan qualifies as a "commercial loan" under subsection 449(1) of the Act, which governs the regulatory treatment of such loans—particularly in relation to capital adequacy, risk management, and reporting obligations.

The regulations are binding and may be cited as the **Commercial Loan (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**.

### **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

#### **1. Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which establishes the regulatory framework for trust and loan companies in Canada.
- The regulations apply specifically to **commercial loans** as defined in **subsection 449(1)** of the Act.
- The primary objective is to clarify the **conditions under which a loan qualifies as a "commercial loan"** and to identify **which international financial institutions are considered "prescribed international agencies"**.

---

#### **2. Definition of "Widely Distributed" (Key Criterion for Commercial Loan Status)**

Under subsection 449(1) of the Act, a commercial loan is defined as one that is **widely distributed**. The regulations provide a detailed, multi-factor test to determine whether a debt obligation or security meets this criterion.

##### **(a) For Debt Obligations (e.g., bonds, notes, etc.)**

A debt obligation is considered "widely distributed" if **at least one of the following conditions is met**:

1. **Holding Distribution Threshold**  
   At least **90% of the maximum authorized principal** of the debt obligations is held by **persons other than the company and its subsidiaries**.

2. **Initial Distribution Threshold**  
   The debt obligations were issued to **at least 25 persons other than the company and its subsidiaries** within **six months** of the first issuance.

3. **Continuous Issuance Threshold (Average Holders)**  
   If the debt obligations are issued continuously, there must be, on average, **at least 25 holders** other than the company and its subsidiaries.

4. **Initial Distribution Criteria (Meeting 3 out of 4)**  
   At the time of initial distribution, the debt obligations met **at least three** of the following four criteria:
   - The initial term was **less than one year**.
   - They were **rated by a rating agency**.
   - They were distributed through a **person authorized to trade in securities**.
   - They were distributed in accordance with an **offering circular, memorandum, or similar document**.

> ✅ *Note:* This provision ensures that loans issued to a broad, diversified group of investors (not concentrated within the issuing company or its affiliates) qualify as commercial loans under the Act.

##### **(b) For Other Securities (e.g., shares, equity instruments)**

A security qualifies as widely distributed if:
- It is **listed and posted for trading** on a **recognized stock exchange**, **or**
- A **prospectus** relating to the issuance of the securities was filed under the laws of **Canada, a province, or a jurisdiction outside Canada**.

> ✅ *Note:* This allows equity instruments to meet the "widely distributed" standard through public listing or formal prospectus filing—both of which indicate broad market exposure.

---

#### **3. Definition of "Maximum Authorized Principal"**

- This term refers to the **maximum amount of debt** that can be issued under the terms of a debt obligation or any related agreement.
- It is a **quantitative cap** that helps determine the scale of the debt and whether it is distributed widely.
- Example: If a company issues a bond with a maximum authorized principal of $100 million, and 90% of that ($90 million) is held by third parties, the condition in clause (a) above is satisfied.

#### **4. Prescribed International Agencies**

The regulations explicitly list the following international financial institutions as **"prescribed international agencies"**:

| Agency | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) | World Bank group; provides long-term financing for development projects |
| International Finance Corporation (IFC) | Supports private sector development in emerging markets |
| Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) | Promotes economic development in the Americas |
| Asian Development Bank (ADB) | Supports development in Asia-Pacific region |
| African Development Bank (AfDB) | Supports economic development in Africa |
| European Investment Bank (EIB) | Provides financing for infrastructure and development in Europe |
| Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) | Supports development in the Caribbean region |
| Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) | Provides financing for Nordic and Northern European projects |
| European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) | Focuses on transition economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia |
| Council of Europe Development Bank (CEDB) | Supports development in Council of Europe member states |

> ✅ *Note:* These agencies are **recognized as qualifying entities** in the context of commercial loans. This means that loans issued or guaranteed by these institutions may be treated differently under the Act—potentially exempting them from certain regulatory requirements or classifications.

---

#### **5. Definition of "Total Assets" (for sections 461 and 462)**

- For the purposes of **sections 461 and 462** of the Act (which relate to capital adequacy and risk-based capital requirements), **total assets** of a company at a particular time means:
  - The **sum of all assets** that would appear on the company’s balance sheet **as of that time**, prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out in **subsection 313(4)** of the Act.

> ✅ *Note:* This ensures consistency in financial reporting and capital adequacy assessments across trust and loan companies. The use of standardized accounting principles ensures comparability and transparency.

### **Purpose and Regulatory Significance**

These regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Clarify the Definition of "Commercial Loan"**  
   By defining "widely distributed," the regulations establish clear, measurable criteria to distinguish commercial loans (which are subject to specific regulatory oversight) from loans that are concentrated or internally held.

2. **Promote Market Transparency and Investor Protection**  
   The requirement that debt be distributed to at least 25 non-affiliated investors or meet certain disclosure standards ensures that commercial loans are not issued in a way that could concentrate risk within a small group.

3. **Facilitate International Transactions**  
   By listing specific international development banks as "prescribed agencies," the regulations recognize the role of global financial institutions in supporting cross-border lending and development finance, potentially simplifying regulatory treatment for loans involving such institutions.

4. **Ensure Consistent Financial Reporting**  
   The definition of "total assets" ensures that capital adequacy calculations are based on standardized, auditable financial statements.

### **Key Takeaways for Practitioners and Regulators**

| Key Point | Implication |
|--------|------------|
| A loan qualifies as commercial only if it meets the "widely distributed" test | Concentrated loans (e.g., issued to a few affiliates) do not qualify |
| The 90% holding threshold is strict | Requires significant dispersion of debt among third parties |
| Public offering or listing satisfies the widely distributed test | Even without a prospectus, listing on a recognized exchange qualifies |
| Loans involving prescribed international agencies are treated specially | May be exempt from certain capital or reporting requirements |
| Total assets are calculated per standard accounting principles | Ensures regulatory consistency and auditability |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Commercial Loan (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* provide a **clear, structured, and legally binding framework** for identifying commercial loans under Canadian financial regulation. By defining "widely distributed" and listing prescribed international agencies, the regulations ensure that only loans with broad investor distribution and transparency are classified as commercial loans—thereby enhancing financial stability, investor confidence, and regulatory oversight within the trust and loan company sector.

These rules remain in force as of the date of this summary and are an essential component of Canada’s financial regulatory architecture, particularly in relation to the activities of trust and loan companies engaged in lending to businesses and institutions.
