### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Levies Order (SOR/87-40, as amended)**

This regulation, known as the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Levies Order**, establishes a system of **levies and additional charges** on the marketing of broiler hatching eggs in Canada.

## **I. Background and Legal Authority**

### **1. Establishment of the Agency**
- The **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency (CBHEMA)** was established by the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation** (SOR/87-40) under subsection **16(1)(b)** of the *Farm Products Agencies Act*.
- The Agency was given the mandate to implement a **marketing plan** aimed at ensuring **orderly marketing** of broiler hatching eggs, preventing market oversupply, and stabilizing prices.

### **2. Legal Basis for the Levies Order**
- The proposed **Levies Order** falls under **paragraph 7(1)(d)** of the FPA Act, which allows for orders related to the implementation of a marketing plan.
- This order is classified as a **class of order** that requires approval from the **National Farm Products Council (NFPC)** under **section 2 of the Agencies’ Orders and Regulations Approval Order (C.R.C., c. 648)**.
- The **NFPC reviewed and approved** the proposed order, finding it necessary for the effective implementation of the marketing plan.

### **3. Approval and Enforcement**
- Based on this approval, the CBHEMA issued the **Levies Order** pursuant to:
  - **Paragraph 22(1)(f)** of the *Farm Products Agencies Act* (authority to issue orders for marketing purposes), and
  - **Section 8 of the Schedule** to the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation.

## **II. Key Definitions (Repealed in 2013 and 2015)**

> ⚠️ **Note**: Many definitions in this Order were **repealed** by amendments:
> - SOR/2013-253 (s. 1) and SOR/2015-242 (s. 1)
> - These include: *Agency, broiler hatching egg, chick, commodity board, dealer, export quota, interprovincial quota, marketing, non-signatory provinces, orderly marketing quota, producer, signatory provinces*

➡️ **As a result, the definitions are no longer active** in current law. The Order now operates without these specific definitions, relying instead on context and the broader regulatory framework.

## **III. Levies and Additional Charges**

### **A. Base Levies (Per Broiler Hatching Egg Marketed)**

| Province | Levy (per egg) |
|--------|----------------|
| Ontario | $0.009000 |
| Quebec | $0.012450 |
| Manitoba | $0.014960 |
| British Columbia | $0.020200 |
| Saskatchewan | $0.021400 |
| Alberta | $0.021400 |

> These levies apply to:
> - **Producers in signatory provinces** who market broiler hatching eggs in **interprovincial trade** or **export trade**.

### **B. Levy for Non-Signatory Provinces**

- A **base levy of $0.016568 per egg** applies to:
  - **Producers, dealers, or hatchery operators** in **non-signatory provinces** who market eggs into **signatory provinces** via interprovincial trade.

> This ensures that provinces outside the formal agreement (non-signatories) contribute to the marketing system when selling into signatory provinces.

---

### **C. Additional Charges (for Excess Marketing)**

These charges apply when a producer or operator exceeds their **quota**:

#### **1. For Signatory Provinces**
- An **additional charge of $0.175 per egg** applies when:
  - A producer markets more than their **interprovincial quota** or **export quota**.

> These quotas are set under the *Canadian Hatching Egg Producers Quota Regulations* and are designed to limit supply and maintain market stability.

#### **2. For Non-Signatory Provinces**
- An **additional charge of $0.175 per egg** applies when:
  - A producer, dealer, or hatchery operator markets more than their:
    - **Orderly marketing quota**, or
    - Their authorization under **subsection 3(3)** of the *Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg and Chick Orderly Marketing Regulations*.

> This prevents over-supply into signatory provinces and helps maintain balance in the market.

## **IV. Application and Duration**

- **Effective Date**: The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).
- **Expiration Date**: 
  - Subsections (1) and (2) (the base levies and additional charges) **cease to have effect on June 23, 2026**.

> This provides a **clear transition period** for the system, allowing for potential review, revision, or replacement.

---

## **V. Collection and Reporting Responsibilities**

### **1. Collection by Commodity Boards**
- The **Commodity Board** of each **signatory province** is appointed by the Agency to:
  - Collect the **base levies** (from producers) and **additional charges** (from producers exceeding quotas).

> This decentralized structure allows provincial oversight and local enforcement.

### **2. Collection by the Agency (Non-Signatory Provinces)**
- Producers, dealers, or hatchery operators in **non-signatory provinces** must remit:
  - Base levy ($0.016568)
  - Additional charges ($0.175 for excess)
  → To the **Agency directly**, not through a provincial board.

| **Producers in signatory provinces** (for excess charges) | Within **7 days** after marketing |
