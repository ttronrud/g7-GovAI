**Detailed Summary of the Fees in Respect of Mail Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 28, s. 30(3))**

---

### **Background and Legislative Authority**

The *Fees in Respect of Mail Regulations* were enacted under the authority granted by **paragraph 164(4)(a.2)** of the *Customs Act* and further authorized by **subsection 147.1(14)** of the same Act. These provisions allow the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board) to prescribe fees applicable to goods imported as mail, including the conditions under which such fees do not apply.

This regulatory instrument serves as a formal implementation of a public announcement made on **June 23, 1992**, which had previously outlined the proposed fee structure and exemptions for mail-imported goods. The regulations came into force on **July 1, 1992**, and are officially cited as the *Fees in Respect of Mail Regulations*.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a **fee structure for goods imported into Canada via postal mail**, ensuring a consistent and transparent method for collecting a small administrative fee from individuals and businesses sending goods by mail. The fee is intended to cover the administrative costs associated with processing and assessing mail-imported items.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. General Fee Structure**
- A **fee of $5 per item of mail** is charged for goods imported into Canada as mail.
- An "item of mail" is defined as a single postal package or parcel sent by mail, regardless of its contents or size.

> **Note**: This fee applies to all goods imported via mail, unless specifically exempted under the conditions outlined below.

#### **2. Exemptions from the $5 Fee**

The $5 fee **does not apply** in the following circumstances:

1. **Goods not subject to duties**  
   If **all the goods** in an item of mail are **not charged with customs duties**, then the $5 fee is waived.  
   → This applies when the goods are deemed to have no duty liability (e.g., due to low value or exemption under other customs rules).

2. **Goods for which all duties are remitted**  
   If the goods in the mail are **subject to duties**, but those duties are **fully remitted** (i.e., refunded or waived) by the Canadian customs authorities, the fee is not charged.  
   → This may occur in cases of humanitarian, diplomatic, or government-related shipments where duties are waived.

3. **Commercial goods with estimated duty value exceeding $3,300**  
   If the goods are **commercial goods** (defined below) and their **estimated duty value exceeds $3,300**, the $5 fee is not applied.  
   → This exemption is designed to prevent the imposition of a small fee on high-value commercial shipments, which may otherwise be disproportionately affected.

4. **Goods sent via Express Mail Service (EMS)**  
   If the goods are **sent by an Express Mail Service (EMS)** to Canada from a country that is a **member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)**, the $5 fee is waived.  
   → This exemption recognizes the special status and international agreements of EMS, which are often used for time-sensitive or high-priority shipments between UPU member countries.

### **Definition of "Commercial Goods"**

- **Commercial goods** are defined as goods imported into Canada for:
  - Sale
  - Any commercial, industrial, occupational, institutional, or similar use

> This distinction is critical because it determines whether the exemption based on value ($3,300 threshold) applies. Personal items or non-commercial goods (e.g., personal letters, gifts) are not considered commercial goods and are therefore subject to the $5 fee unless otherwise exempted.

### **Effective Date and Legal Citation**

- The regulations came into force on **July 1, 1992**.
- They are formally cited as: **Fees in Respect of Mail Regulations**.
- Legal references:
  - *S.C. 1992, c. 28, s. 30(3)* (source of enactment)
  - *R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)* (related statutory reference)

### **Key Implications and Policy Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fee Fairness** | The $5 fee is a small, standardized charge designed to be administratively manageable and equitable across mail shipments. |
| **Exemption Logic** | Exemptions are structured to avoid overburdening low-value, non-commercial, or high-value shipments, and to respect international postal agreements. |
| **Value Threshold** | The $3,300 threshold reflects a practical limit to prevent small fees from being applied to high-value commercial shipments. |
| **International Cooperation** | The exemption for UPU member countries using EMS acknowledges the role of international postal systems in facilitating cross-border trade. |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | By clearly defining when fees apply or are waived, the regulations reduce the need for discretionary decisions by customs officers. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Fees in Respect of Mail Regulations* establish a clear, rule-based framework for charging a $5 fee on mail-imported goods, while providing meaningful exemptions for specific categories of shipments. These exemptions—based on duty status, commercial use, value, and international postal service—ensure that the fee is both administratively efficient and equitable in practice.

The regulations reflect a balance between revenue collection and practical considerations in international trade and postal operations, and they remain a foundational piece of Canadian customs policy related to mail imports.
