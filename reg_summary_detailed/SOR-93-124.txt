**Detailed Summary of the Bolster and Sideframe Remission Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Bolster and Sideframe Remission Order is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is authorized under **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), which empowers the government to grant remissions (i.e., reductions or waivers) of customs duties on specific goods under certain conditions.

This Order may be formally cited as the **"Bolster and Sideframe Remission Order"**.

---

**2. Scope of the Remission**  
The Order grants a **remission of customs duties** that were paid or are payable under **Schedule I of the Customs Tariff** on the following goods:  
- **Railcar bolsters**  
- **Railcar sideframes**  

These items are specifically imported by **Ronsco Inc., Montreal, Quebec**.

Importantly, the remission applies only to goods imported by Ronsco Inc. and is limited to those used in a specific industrial conversion project.

**3. Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is not automatic and is subject to two key conditions:

**Condition 1: Purpose of Importation**  
The bolsters and sideframes must be used exclusively by **CN North America, Montreal**, in the **conversion of 525 boxcars** from a **70-ton capacity to a 100-ton capacity**.  

This conversion project takes place at two designated facilities:  
- The **Transcona shop in Winnipeg, Manitoba**  
- The **shop in Moncton, New Brunswick**  

The remission is only valid if the imported components are directly used in this specific upgrade project.

**Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**  
A formal **claim for remission** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **three years** of the date of importation of the goods.  

Failure to file such a claim within this three-year window will result in the loss of the remission benefit.

---

**4. Exclusions and Limitations**  
- The remission is **not available to other importers** or for other uses of bolsters and sideframes.  
- It applies only to the **specific 525 boxcars** being upgraded and only to the **components used in that conversion**.  
- The remission is conditional and does not constitute a general exemption or reduction in duties for similar goods.

**5. Purpose and Economic Rationale**  
This Order appears to support a strategic infrastructure upgrade by Canadian National Railway (CN) to increase the load capacity of its freight railcars. By upgrading 525 boxcars, CN enhances its rail network efficiency, reduces transportation costs, and improves freight capacity—benefiting both the rail industry and broader economic activity.

The remission of duties on specialized components (bolsters and sideframes) helps reduce the cost of capital-intensive rail infrastructure upgrades, making such projects more economically viable.

The Order underscores the balance between fiscal responsibility and strategic investment in national transportation capacity.
