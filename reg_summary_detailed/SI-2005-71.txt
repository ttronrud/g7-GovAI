The regulation you have provided is a formal government notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed and accurate summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Notice of Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued pursuant to **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which empowers the Minister of the Environment to acknowledge receipt of scientific assessments of species at risk conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions and Content:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments submitted by COSEWIC for species listed in the **Annex to this Order**. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of each species, including their risk of extinction, population trends, threats, and distribution.

2. **Purpose of the Assessment:**  
   COSEWIC, an independent scientific body, conducts peer-reviewed evaluations based on the best available scientific and commercial data. These assessments determine whether a species is at risk of extinction and, if so, which of the five official risk categories it falls into:
   - Extinct (EX)
   - Extinct in the Wild (EW)
   - Endangered (EN)
   - Threatened (TH)
   - Special Concern (SC)

3. **Legal Role of the Assessment:**  
   Under SARA, COSEWIC assessments are a critical step in the process of identifying species that may require protection under the Act. While COSEWIC does not make legal designations, its assessments provide the scientific foundation for the Minister of the Environment to determine whether a species should be listed as "endangered" or "threatened" under SARA.

4. **Annex to the Order:**  
   The species listed in the Annex are those for which COSEWIC has completed a formal assessment under the requirements of subsection 23(1) of SARA. This includes species that have been evaluated for their risk status and are now formally recognized as being at risk.

5. **Next Steps in the Process:**  
   Upon receipt of these assessments, the Minister of the Environment is legally required to:
   - Review the COSEWIC findings.
   - Consider the scientific recommendations.
   - Make a formal determination on whether to list the species under SARA (e.g., as endangered or threatened).
   - Publish the final listing decisions in the Canada Gazette.

6. **Regulatory Significance:**  
   This regulation serves as a procedural milestone in the conservation process. It confirms that the government has received and recognized the scientific input necessary to initiate formal protection measures under SARA. It does not itself impose conservation measures but sets the stage for legislative action.

7. **Date of Publication:**  
   The regulation was published in *Statutes Canada* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), indicating its official enactment and availability as part of the public legal record.

**Context and Importance:**

- This type of notice is common in the implementation of SARA, where scientific assessments are systematically reviewed and incorporated into legal protection frameworks.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to science-based conservation and transparent decision-making in protecting biodiversity.
- The process ensures that species at risk are identified and monitored through a rigorous, independent, and publicly accountable process.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally recognizes the completion and submission of COSEWIC assessments for species listed in the Annex. It marks a key step in the legislative process under the *Species at Risk Act*, enabling the federal government to proceed with scientific review and, ultimately, the potential listing of these species under SARA. While it does not create legal protections itself, it initiates the formal pathway toward conservation action, including habitat protection, recovery planning, and public awareness.

**Note:**  
This regulation is part of a broader framework of species protection in Canada and is typically followed by a listing decision by the Minister of the Environment, which may lead to the development of recovery strategies and action plans under SARA.
