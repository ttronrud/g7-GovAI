**Detailed Summary of the Translation Bureau Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Translation Bureau Regulations* establish the operational framework, responsibilities, priorities, and procedures governing the translation and interpretation services provided by the **Translation Bureau** of the Government of Canada. These regulations ensure that all official government communications—particularly in the context of bilingualism—are accurate, consistent, and efficiently delivered. The regulations apply to all departments of the federal government, including both Houses of Parliament and various agencies and commissions.

The Bureau is mandated to support the Canadian government’s commitment to **official bilingualism (English and French)**, while also facilitating the translation of materials in other languages when necessary and ensuring consistency in terminology and style across government publications.

   - Must cooperate with departments in revising documents prepared internally.
   - Must deliver translations or revisions in **legible form** to the requesting department.

2. **Language Standards**
   - Translations must conform to **"le français universel" (Standard French)** or **Standard English**, as appropriate, within the bounds of Canadian usage.

3. **Interpretation Services**
   - Provides interpretation services upon request, with priority given to parliamentary and committee needs.

4. **Technical Advice**
   - Offers guidance to department employees on translation, terminology, and style.

---

## **Priority Order for Translation Requests (Non-Urgent Cases)**

Translations are processed according to a strict priority order:

1. **Documents required to be published in both English and French**  
   - All Parliamentary documents (e.g., bills, speeches, reports)  
   - Official departmental documents and publications  
   - Speeches and press releases

2. **Handbooks and administrative directions** for internal use by departmental employees

3. **Documents required solely to assist individuals without working knowledge of both official languages**  
   - Includes personal correspondence or informational materials for non-employees

4. **Staff magazines** (lowest priority)

> ⚠️ *Note: This hierarchy ensures that core governmental functions and public accountability are prioritized.*

---

## **Time Management and Capacity Assessment**

- Upon receiving a translation request, the Bureau must:
  - Estimate the time required to complete the translation.
  - Determine whether its **normal facilities** can meet the deadline.

- If the Bureau determines it **cannot complete** the translation within the requested timeframe:
  - It must communicate with the **designated official** of the department to:
    - Request an extension of time;
    - Propose a change in translation priorities;
    - Negotiate alternative arrangements.

> This mechanism promotes accountability and ensures that urgent needs are not delayed without justification.

---

## **Translation of Non-English/French Languages**

The Bureau will translate documents into or from languages other than English or French **only if**:
1. The department has consulted the **International Translations Index** (maintained at the National Science Library, National Research Council); and  
2. A reasonable effort has been made to obtain an existing translation elsewhere.

> If a department lacks the capability to handle such translations, the Bureau will prepare the **final presentation** (typing, page-setting, printing, proofreading).

---

## **Engagement of Independent Contractors**

When the Bureau is overwhelmed by volume or complexity, and cannot meet demand:
- It may engage **professional translators or interpreters as independent contractors**.
- Such engagement is governed by the **Government Contracts Regulations** and must comply with any **security requirements**.

> This allows flexibility in meeting high-demand or specialized translation needs.

---

## **Responsibilities of Department Heads**

Each department head must:

1. **Eliminate unnecessary translation requests** based solely on an employee’s inability to read or write in English or French.

2. **Designate a single employee** (the designated official) to:
   - Communicate with the Bureau;
   - Receive and respond to translation and revision requests.

3. **Provide a five-year forecast** of translation needs annually, including:
   - Language-specific requirements (e.g., translating into or from Mandarin, Arabic, etc.).

4. **Include translation time** in production schedules for publications, with time determined in consultation with the Bureau.

5. **Supply two copies** of any bilingual document (in both English and French) to the Bureau’s **Terminology Centre** upon publication.

> These measures promote planning, accountability, and long-term consistency in bilingual output.

---

## **Submission of Translation Requests**

Departments must:
- Send documents to either:
  - The **Chief of the Translation Division** (if one exists within the department), or
  - The **Director of Production of the Bureau** (if no such division exists).
- Submit the request in a form **approved by the Superintendent of the Bureau**.
- Include **two copies of the request**.

Additionally, departments must:
- Specify the **maximum time available** for translation.
- Indicate any **security measures** required (e.g., classified or sensitive content).

---

## **Supporting Documentation**

All documents submitted for translation must include:
- Original and previously translated versions of similar texts;
- Documents that generated the current text (to avoid duplication);
- Pre-existing scientific or technical vocabularies;
- Sources of quotations, information, or references used.

> This enables the Bureau to conduct accurate and efficient terminological research.

---

## **Early Draft Submission for Technical Documents**

If a department is preparing a **scientific, technical, or specialized document**:
- It must send a **copy of the first draft** to the Bureau **upon completion**.
- This allows the Bureau to begin **terminological research** and ensure consistency in terminology.

> This proactive step prevents errors and ensures alignment with existing government standards.

---

## **Final Presentation and Responsibility**

- **Departments are responsible** for the final presentation of translations provided by the Bureau, including:
  - Typing, printing, page-setting, and proofreading.
- Departments **fully assume responsibility** for any changes made to the Bureau’s translations.

> This ensures departments maintain control over the final product and its presentation.

---

## **Support for Translation Divisions within Departments**

If a department has a **Translation Division**:
- The department must:
  - Provide suitable office space;
  - Acquire and make available reference materials (e.g., dictionaries, glossaries) as needed;
  - Provide stenographic and typing services during emergencies.

> This supports local capacity and reduces reliance on the central Bureau.

---

## **Priority for Parliamentary Interpretation Services**

- Interpretation services for **both Houses of Parliament and their committees** take **first priority**.
- All other interpretation requests are processed after this priority.

> This ensures the integrity and accessibility of parliamentary proceedings.

---

## **Preparation for Conferences Requiring Interpretation**

Departments must:
- Notify the Bureau **in writing** when preparing for a conference.
- Provide all relevant documentation: agendas, reports, speeches, working papers, and specialized vocabularies.

If the Bureau determines that the information provided is **insufficient**, it may limit interpretation services to those that **do not require special preparation**.

> This ensures that the Bureau can operate effectively and safely.

---

## **Conference Day Preparation**

Departments must:
- Organize a **pre-conference meeting** (the day before) between Bureau interpreters and conference specialists to familiarize interpreters with content.
- Provide and install **necessary equipment** (e.g., microphones, projectors) at the conference site.
- Arrange and pay for **travel and accommodation** for Bureau interpreters attending conferences outside Ottawa.

> This ensures high-quality, context-aware interpretation.
