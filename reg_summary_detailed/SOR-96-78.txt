Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, presented in clear, structured, and accurate language suitable for understanding the legal and historical context:

### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation: Designation of Certain Countries under the Visiting Forces Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The proclamation is issued under **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act (Chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985)**.
- This section grants the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government of Canada, acting through the Cabinet) the power to issue a **proclamation** designating one or more foreign countries as "designated states" for the purposes of the Act.
- The authority is exercised on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, the body responsible for advising the Governor General on matters of national policy and legislation.

#### **2. Date and Issuance**
- The proclamation was issued on **November 23, 1995**, by Order in Council **P.C. 1995-1969**.
- It was formally made public and affixed with the **Great Seal of Canada** on **December 28, 1995**.
- The Governor General at the time was **Roméo A. LeBlanc**, who served as Governor General of Canada from 1995 to 1999.

#### **3. Designated States**
The following seven countries are officially designated as "designated states" under this proclamation:
1. **Republic of Benin**  
2. **Republic of El Salvador**  
3. **Republic of Estonia**  
4. **Republic of Latvia**  
5. **Republic of Lithuania**  
6. **Republic of Nicaragua**  
7. **Romania**

These designations mean that the **Visiting Forces Act** applies to military forces from these countries when they are visiting or operating in Canada.

#### **4. Scope of Applicability**
- The **Visiting Forces Act** is declared applicable to the designated states **with one important exception**:
  - **Part VI of the Act is excluded**.
- This means that all provisions of the Act **except those in Part VI** apply to visiting military forces from these countries.
- The exclusion of **Part VI** is significant because that part typically deals with specific issues such as:
  - The rights and obligations of visiting forces in relation to Canadian law,
  - Jurisdiction and legal responsibilities,
  - The treatment of military personnel in civilian courts,
  - And potentially the legal status of military personnel during visits.

> Therefore, while visiting forces from these countries are subject to the general framework of the Act (e.g., rules on entry, stay, conduct, and security), they are **not bound by the specific provisions in Part VI**—which may involve more complex legal or jurisdictional matters.

#### **5. Purpose and Implications**
- The primary purpose of this proclamation is to **establish legal clarity** regarding the status and rights of foreign military personnel visiting Canada.
- It enables Canada to:
  - Regulate the entry, movement, and conduct of visiting armed forces,
  - Ensure that such forces operate under a defined legal framework,
  - Maintain national security and public order,
  - Provide consistency in how foreign military visits are governed.
- The designation applies to **all visiting forces** from these countries, whether temporary or extended, during their stay in Canada.

#### **6. Legal Effect and Public Notice**
- The proclamation is **binding on all persons** and entities affected by it.
- It is issued as a **public proclamation**, meaning that all Canadian citizens, government departments, military institutions, and foreign governments are required to take notice and act accordingly.
- The statement “Of All Which Our Loving Subjects and all others whom these Presents may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves accordingly” emphasizes the **legal enforceability** and **binding nature** of the document.

#### **7. Historical and Political Context (Inferred)**
- The designation of these countries in 1995 likely reflects:
  - Canada’s growing diplomatic and military engagement with post-Cold War Eastern European nations (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania),
  - Increased international cooperation in regional security and peacekeeping (e.g., in Central America with El Salvador and Nicaragua),
  - Canada’s role in supporting democratic transitions and regional stability.
- The inclusion of **Nicaragua** is notable, as it had a history of political instability and conflict during the 1980s (e.g., the Contra war), and Canada had been involved in various international efforts related to that region.
- The inclusion of **Benin** (a West African nation) may reflect Canada’s broader engagement with African countries during that period.

#### **8. Duration and Renewal**
- The proclamation does not specify an expiry date.
- Such designations are typically **ongoing** unless formally revoked or amended by a new Order in Council.
- The continued applicability of the designation depends on the ongoing relationship between Canada and the designated countries and the relevance of the Visiting Forces Act in those contexts.

### **Conclusion**
This 1995 proclamation is a **formal legal instrument** that:
- Designates **seven foreign nations** as "designated states" under Canada’s **Visiting Forces Act**,
- Applies the Act to those countries **except for Part VI**, which is excluded,
- Establishes a clear legal framework for the conduct of foreign military personnel visiting Canada,
- Reflects Canada’s international engagement during a period of post-Cold War realignment and diplomatic expansion.

It is a key example of how Canada uses domestic legislation to manage international military interactions, balancing national security with diplomatic relations.
