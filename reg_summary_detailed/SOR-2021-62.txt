**Detailed Summary of the Wreck Removal Convention Certificate Fee Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 1)**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The Wreck Removal Convention Certificate Fee Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. This action is authorized under **subsection 130(1) of the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act (WAHVA)**. The regulations establish a fee structure for the issuance of specific certificates related to the removal of wrecked, abandoned, or hazardous vessels.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to impose a mandatory fee for the issuance of a *Wreck Removal Convention Certificate* under specific provisions of the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act. This certificate is required to legally authorize the removal of vessels that are either wrecked, abandoned, or pose a hazard to navigation, safety, or the environment.

**3. Fee Amount and Application**  
- A fee of **$98** is payable to the Minister of Transport.  
- This fee applies specifically to applications for a certificate under **paragraphs 25(1)(a) and (c)** of the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act.  
  - **Paragraph 25(1)(a)**: Covers vessels that are wrecked or abandoned.  
  - **Paragraph 25(1)(c)**: Covers vessels that are hazardous due to their condition or location.  
- The fee is **due upon submission of an application** for the certificate. It is not a one-time administrative charge but is collected at the time of application processing.

**4. Who Must Pay the Fee**  
Any individual, entity, or organization seeking to obtain a Wreck Removal Convention Certificate under the specified sections of the WAHVA must pay the $98 fee. This includes private contractors, government agencies, or maritime operators involved in vessel removal activities.

**5. Effective Date**  
These regulations came into force on **April 1, 2021**. This means that all applications for certificates under the relevant provisions of the WAHVA made on or after that date are subject to the $98 fee.

**6. Regulatory Context**  
- The Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act provides a legal framework for managing vessels that pose risks to public safety, the environment, or navigation.  
- The issuance of a certificate ensures that removal activities are conducted in a regulated, safe, and environmentally responsible manner.  
- The fee helps cover administrative costs associated with processing applications, verifying compliance, and maintaining records related to vessel removal.

**7. Key Implications**  
- The fee serves as a financial mechanism to support the regulatory oversight of vessel removal.  
- It ensures transparency and accountability in the certification process.  
- It may also act as a deterrent against frivolous or unauthorized applications, as the cost of obtaining a certificate is clearly defined and non-negotiable.

**8. Enforcement and Compliance**  
- The fee is enforceable under the authority of the Minister of Transport.  
- Failure to pay the $98 fee may result in the application being rejected or delayed, and the certificate not being issued.  
- The fee is not refundable, even if the application is denied or withdrawn.

**Conclusion**  
The Wreck Removal Convention Certificate Fee Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 1) establish a clear, standardized fee of $98 for applications seeking a certificate under sections 25(1)(a) and (25)(c) of the Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act. These regulations ensure that the administrative process for vessel removal is financially sustainable and properly governed, with the fee collected at the time of application and effective from April 1, 2021. This regulatory measure supports Canada’s maritime safety and environmental protection objectives by enabling a structured, accountable system for the removal of hazardous or abandoned vessels.
