S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
**Title of Act:** Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act  
**Date of Enactment:** 2003 (as part of the Statutes of Canada)

**Summary of the Provision:**

This regulation transfers control and supervision of a specific component of the federal public administration from the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada** to the **Department of Transport**.

Specifically, the transfer involves the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the Office of Infrastructure of Canada, with respect to two designated Crown corporations:

1. **Canada Lands Company Limited**  
2. **Queens Quay West Land Corporation**

These entities are responsible for the management, development, and oversight of certain land holdings and land-related activities on behalf of the federal government.

**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

- **Nature of Transfer:**  
  The regulation does not transfer ownership or assets of the Crown corporations themselves, but rather **control and supervision** of the administrative functions related to their operations. This includes policy oversight, governance support, and administrative coordination.

- **Functional Scope:**  
  The transfer pertains to the **Crown Corporation Secretariat**, which historically provided administrative and operational support to Crown corporations. This includes functions such as financial management, human resources, compliance, and strategic planning.

- **Transfer of Jurisdiction:**  
  As of **February 6, 2006**, the Department of Transport assumes responsibility for the administrative oversight and supervision of these functions related to the two Crown corporations.

- **Rationale (Implied):**  
  The transfer aligns with broader government restructuring efforts to improve efficiency, accountability, and strategic coherence. Given that both Canada Lands Company Limited and Queens Quay West Land Corporation are involved in land development and infrastructure projects—particularly in transportation-related areas (e.g., land use for roads, transit, or port facilities)—placing their administrative oversight under the Department of Transport makes strategic and operational sense.

- **Legal Authority:**  
  The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows the federal government to reassign administrative responsibilities between departments based on policy objectives, efficiency, and service delivery needs.

---

**Impact and Implications:**

- **Administrative Reorganization:**  
  The Department of Transport now has responsibility for the internal administration and governance support of these two Crown corporations, potentially enabling better integration with transportation planning and infrastructure development.

- **Continuity of Operations:**  
  The day-to-day operations of the Crown corporations themselves are not disrupted. The transfer is primarily administrative, ensuring that oversight and policy direction are now aligned with transportation priorities.

- **Accountability and Reporting:**  
  The Crown corporations will now report to the Department of Transport in terms of administrative and operational governance, which may influence how decisions are made regarding land use, development, and public service delivery.

- **Interdepartmental Coordination:**  
  This move may enhance coordination between land management and transportation planning, particularly in areas such as urban development, transit corridors, and port infrastructure.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative realignment within the federal public service. By transferring the control and supervision of the Crown Corporation Secretariat functions related to Canada Lands Company Limited and Queens Quay West Land Corporation to the Department of Transport, the government strengthens the integration of land management with transportation infrastructure planning. The change reflects a strategic effort to streamline governance, improve efficiency, and ensure that land-related activities support national transportation goals.

The transfer took effect on **February 6, 2006**, and is a formal implementation of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, demonstrating the flexibility and adaptability of Canada’s federal administrative framework.
