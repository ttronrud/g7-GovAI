**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act**

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
The transfer of powers, duties, and functions is established under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (P.S.R.T.D.A.), specifically **paragraph 2(a)(a)**. This provision grants the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the authority to transfer certain responsibilities between federal ministers, including those related to public service functions and administrative duties.

This transfer is not a change in legislation but a reassignment of administrative responsibility within the federal government structure.

**2. Specific Transfer**  
Under the authority cited, the **Minister of National Revenue (MNR)** is transferring, to the **Minister of the Environment**, the powers, duties, and functions previously held under **Section 188 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA)**.

**3. Scope of the Transfer**  
Section 188 of the GGPPA empowers the Minister of National Revenue to administer and enforce the federal greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution pricing system. This includes, but is not limited to:
- The implementation and administration of the carbon pricing backstop (i.e., the federal carbon pricing framework);
- Oversight of the calculation and collection of carbon pricing fees;
- Enforcement of compliance with the carbon pricing regime;
- Administration of the carbon pricing system in provinces and territories that have not established a carbon pricing mechanism;
- Coordination with provincial and territorial governments to ensure alignment with federal policy;
- Monitoring and reporting on emissions and compliance with GHG pricing requirements.

By transferring these powers to the **Minister of the Environment**, the federal government is centralizing the administration of the carbon pricing system under a ministry that has a direct mandate related to climate change, environmental protection, and sustainability.

**4. Legislative References**  
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This is the original enabling provision under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act that authorizes such transfers of ministerial functions.
- **R.S., c. P-34**: Refers to the *Regulations of the Public Service*, which may contain procedural or administrative details related to the transfer process, though the specific reference here may be a general citation to the broader regulatory framework.
- **S.C. 2018, c. 12, s. 186**: This refers to a later amendment or legislative update to the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, likely reinforcing or clarifying the authority to transfer duties, particularly in the context of environmental policy and climate action.

**5. Policy and Strategic Rationale**  
This transfer reflects a strategic shift in federal governance to align environmental policy with climate action. By placing the administration of carbon pricing under the **Ministry of the Environment**, the government aims to:
- Improve policy coherence between climate policy and environmental regulation;
- Enhance interdepartmental coordination on climate change;
- Strengthen accountability and public communication around carbon pricing initiatives;
- Ensure that the implementation of the GHG pricing system is consistent with broader environmental goals, such as reducing emissions, promoting clean energy, and achieving net-zero targets.

**6. Implications**  
- The **Minister of National Revenue** will no longer be responsible for administering the carbon pricing system, though they may still retain other tax-related responsibilities.
- The **Minister of the Environment** now assumes direct responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the carbon pricing system, including enforcement, compliance, and reporting.
- The **Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)** will likely become the primary operational body responsible for executing the functions under Section 188.

**7. Effective Date and Implementation**  
While the specific effective date is not included in the citation, such transfers typically take effect upon formal publication in the Canada Gazette or through a government order. The transfer is generally implemented in accordance with administrative procedures and may include transitional arrangements to ensure continuity of operations.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization of federal environmental governance. It transfers key responsibilities related to the administration of Canada’s carbon pricing system—from the Minister of National Revenue to the Minister of the Environment—under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The move strengthens the government’s ability to implement climate policy effectively, ensuring that carbon pricing is managed by a ministry with a direct mandate for environmental outcomes.
