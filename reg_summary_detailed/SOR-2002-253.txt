This regulatory order formally extinguishes and replaces the application of certain provisions of the *Northwest Territories Waters Act* within the territory of Nunavut.

**Key Provisions and Legal Context:**

1. **Repeal of Applicable Regulations:**  
   All regulations that were enacted under either:
   - **Paragraph 33(1)(m)**: which typically relates to the regulation of water use, particularly in relation to the issuance of water rights or licensing for non-indigenous or commercial water use, or  
   - **Paragraph 33(1)(n)**: which may pertain to the regulation of surface water rights or the management of water resources in a manner that conflicts with Indigenous rights or traditional uses  
   
   ...are **declared to no longer apply in Nunavut**.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The Order is issued under **subsection 173(3)** of the *Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act*. This provision empowers the Nunavut Water Board to make orders that adjust or replace the application of federal or territorial water laws in Nunavut, particularly in light of the unique legal, cultural, and environmental context of the territory.

3. **Territorial Jurisdiction:**  
   This Order applies exclusively to **Nunavut**. It does not affect the application of the Northwest Territories Waters Act in the Northwest Territories or elsewhere in Canada.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate legal or governmental registry (e.g., the Office of the Registrar of Regulations or the Department of Justice). This is a standard administrative procedure to ensure legal certainty and enforceability.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Legal Continuity and Sovereignty:**  
  This Order reflects the transition of water management authority from the Northwest Territories to Nunavut, as Nunavut became a separate territory in 1999. It ensures that water laws are not retroactively applied from the Northwest Territories in a manner that may conflict with Nunavut’s distinct legal framework, Indigenous rights, or land-use principles.

- **Recognition of Indigenous Rights:**  
  By removing regulations that may have infringed upon traditional Inuit water use, hunting, fishing, or cultural practices, the Order supports the protection of Inuit rights and traditional knowledge in water resource management.

- **Administrative Clarity:**  
  The Order eliminates legal ambiguity and provides a clear, definitive statement that Nunavut operates under its own water governance framework, independent of the Northwest Territories’ regulatory regime.

---

**Conclusion:**

This Order is a foundational step in establishing a water governance system in Nunavut that is distinct, culturally appropriate, and consistent with the rights and responsibilities of Inuit communities. It formally ends the application of outdated or inappropriate provisions of the Northwest Territories Waters Act in Nunavut, ensuring that water management in the territory is governed by laws and regulations that are tailored to its unique social, environmental, and legal context.

**Note:**  
This Order is part of the broader legislative and administrative transition that occurred when Nunavut was established as a separate territory. It is not a standalone law but a regulatory instrument that implements the intent of the Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act.
