**Key Transfers of Control and Supervision (to the Department of International Trade)**

The regulation specifies that the following public service units and functions are transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to the Department of International Trade:

1. **International Business Development Branch**  
   - Full transfer of control and supervision of this branch, which was central to promoting Canadian exports, identifying market opportunities, and supporting Canadian businesses in global markets.

2. **Trade, Economic, and Environmental Policy Branch**  
   - *With exception*: Only the portions related to **environmental policy** are excluded.  
   - The remaining functions—including trade policy, economic policy, and other non-environmental aspects—are transferred.  
   - Notably, the **Chief Air Negotiator** is included, but only insofar as their role relates to trade policy and international business development (not aviation policy per se).

3. **Portions of the Communications Bureau and Executive Service Bureau**  
   - Specifically, those sections that support **international trade policy** and **international business development**.  
   - Includes the **Trade Communications Division**, which is responsible for public messaging, outreach, and communications related to trade initiatives and policies.

4. **International Academic Relations Division**  
   - Only the portions related to **international business development** are transferred.  
   - This includes activities involving academic partnerships that support trade, such as joint research, business incubation, or export promotion through academic networks.

5. **Arts and Cultural Industries Promotion Division**  
   - Only the parts related to **international business development** are transferred.  
   - This includes promoting Canadian arts and cultural industries as exportable goods and services, such as film, music, and design.

6. **Policy Planning Secretariat**  
   - Only those portions related to **trade policy** and **international business development** are transferred.  
   - This includes strategic planning, policy analysis, and formulation related to trade agreements and international commerce.

7. **Geographic Branches of the Department**  
   - Only those geographic branches (e.g., regional offices in Asia, Europe, or the Americas) that have **exclusive responsibilities in trade policy and international business development** are transferred.  
   - This ensures regional trade operations are now under the direct oversight of the Department of International Trade.

8. **Canadian Missions Abroad**  
   - Only those Canadian diplomatic missions (embassies, consulates, etc.) that have **exclusive responsibilities related to trade policy and international business development** are transferred.  
   - This includes trade missions, economic delegations, and business promotion activities conducted overseas.

9. **Trade Law Division**  
   - Fully transferred to the new Department of International Trade.  
   - This division handles legal frameworks related to trade agreements, dispute resolution, and compliance with international trade laws.

**Transfer of Ministerial Powers and Responsibilities**

In addition to the transfer of public service units, the regulation includes a significant **ministerial reorganization**:

- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs** is relieved of all powers, duties, and functions related to **international trade and commerce** within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  
- These responsibilities are **transferred to a new Minister for International Trade**, who is to be styled the **Minister of International Trade**.  
- This marks a formal separation of trade policy and diplomacy, reflecting a strategic shift to treat trade as a distinct and specialized area of government responsibility.

---

**Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

This regulation reflects a broader governmental strategy to:

- **Improve efficiency and focus** in trade policy by removing trade-related functions from a department primarily focused on diplomacy and foreign relations.
- **Enhance coordination** between trade policy development, business promotion, and international negotiations.
- **Strengthen Canada’s global trade competitiveness** by creating a dedicated department with specialized expertise in international commerce.
- **Clarify accountability** by assigning clear leadership (the Minister of International Trade) and operational oversight (the Department of International Trade) to trade policy.

---

**Exclusions and Limitations**

- Environmental policy remains under the purview of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  
- Summitry (e.g., G20, G7), participation in the **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)**, **Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)**, and the **International Assistance Envelope** are explicitly excluded from the transfer.  
  - This indicates that diplomatic and multilateral cooperation in broader development and global governance remains within the foreign affairs domain.

**Conclusion**

This regulation represents a pivotal moment in Canada’s public administration, signaling a formal shift in how international trade is governed. By transferring key trade-related functions and responsibilities to a new, dedicated Department of International Trade and appointing a Minister of International Trade, the government established a more focused, effective, and responsive structure for promoting Canadian exports, strengthening trade relationships, and advancing international business development. The separation of trade from diplomacy underscores a recognition that trade policy requires specialized expertise, distinct strategic goals, and a different operational framework than traditional foreign affairs.
