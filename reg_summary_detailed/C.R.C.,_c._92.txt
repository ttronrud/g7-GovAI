**Detailed Summary of the Lethbridge Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- **Official Title**: *Lethbridge Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- These regulations are formally cited as the **Lethbridge Airport Zoning Regulations** and serve to define land use restrictions around Lethbridge Airport in the Province of Alberta.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Lethbridge Airport**, located in Lethbridge, Alberta. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a benchmark for elevation and zoning. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 3,002 feet above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, **1,200 feet wide**, specifically designated for take-off and landing in a given direction. The primary strips referenced are **Runways 05-23 and 12-30**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the ends of the strip. At the **strip ends**, it extends **600 feet** on each side of the centerline. At the **outer ends**, 2,000 feet on each side of the projected centerline, measured **horizontally 10,000 feet from the strip ends**, and rising at a slope of **1 foot vertically per 7 feet horizontally**. The outer ends are located **200 feet above** the elevation at the strip ends. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane centered on and located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point (3,002 ft)**. This surface acts as the baseline for height restrictions. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane that rises from the **outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface**, extending upward and outward until it intersects with the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. The slope is **1 vertical foot per 7 horizontal feet**. |

> *Note: All surfaces are projected and visualized as part of Plan E.603 dated July 30, 1958, which is on file with the Department of Transport (Ottawa) and the Land Titles Office (Calgary).*

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, that are:
  - **Adjacent to or in the vicinity of Lethbridge Airport**,  
  - As **specifically described in Part II of the Schedule**.

- The regulated area is **not limited to the airport property itself**, but extends to surrounding land parcels that fall within the defined boundaries of the horizontal, approach, and transitional surfaces.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object,
- Whose **highest point exceeds the elevation** of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

#### **a) Horizontal Surface**
- A horizontal plane at **150 feet above the ARP (3,002 ft)**.
- The outer limits of this surface are defined by a **detailed, complex boundary description** in the regulations, which traces a long path through multiple sections and legal subdivisions across several townships and ranges.

> This surface forms the **primary height limit** for all developments within the regulated zone.

#### **b) Approach Surfaces**
- Extend from the **ends of Runways 05-23 and 12-30**.
- Dimensions:
  - **600 feet** on each side of the centerline at the **strip ends**.
  - **2,000 feet** on each side of the projected centerline at the **outer ends**, which are located **200 feet above** the elevation at the strip ends.
  - Measured **horizontally 10,000 feet from the strip ends**.
- These surfaces are designed to ensure **safe aircraft approach and landing** by providing a clear, unobstructed zone.

#### **c) Transitional Surfaces**
- Slope upward from the **outer edges of the strips and approach surfaces**.
- Slope ratio: **1 foot vertically per 7 feet horizontally**.
- These surfaces connect the approach surfaces to the horizontal surface, ensuring a smooth transition in elevation.

> All these surfaces are **projected and illustrated** on **Plan E.603 (July 30, 1958)**, which is an official record held by the Department of Transport (Ottawa) and the Land Titles Office (Calgary).

### **5. Excluded Area**

A specific area within the regulated zone is **exempt** from these height restrictions:

> **Excluded Land Description**:
- Begins at the **Southeast corner of Legal Subdivision 16, Section 4, Township 8, Range 21, West of 4th Meridian**.
- Proceeds westward along the southern boundaries of Subdivisions 16, 15, 14, and 13 to a point **660 feet from the southwest corner of Subdivision 13, Section 4**.
- Then moves south and parallel to the west boundary of Section 4.
- Proceeds west to the west boundary of Section 5.
- Moves north to a point **1,320 feet north of the southwest corner of Section 8**.
- Then moves east parallel to the southern boundary of Section 8.
- Proceeds north along a line parallel to the eastern boundaries of Sections 8 and 17, **1,320 feet from the east boundary of Section 8**.
- Continues east along a line parallel to the southern boundaries of Sections 17 and 16, **1,320 feet from the south boundary of Section 17**.
- Ends at the **Westerly limit of No. 5 Highway** as shown on Plan 3881 B.M.
- Then continues south along the **No. 5 Highway** and east along the boundaries of Sections 9 and 4 to the point of commencement.

> This excluded area is **not subject to the height restrictions** and is **not included** in the horizontal surface or other surface limits.

### **6. Legal and Administrative Notes**

- **Plan E.603 (July 30, 1958)** is the **primary reference document** for:
  - The location of the airport reference point,
  - The boundaries of the horizontal surface,
  - The approach and transitional surfaces.
- All plans referenced in the regulations are **on public record**:
  - **Plan E.603** → Department of Transport, Ottawa
  - **Plan 3881 B.M. and 816 E.Z.** → Land Titles Office, South Alberta Land Registration District, Calgary
- The **Minister** (original authority) was **revoked by SOR/93-401, Section 2**, indicating that the regulation may have been amended or replaced by later legislation.

### **7. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**:
   - To ensure that **aircraft can approach and land safely** without encountering obstructions.
   - The approach and transitional surfaces provide **clear flight paths** during landing and take-off.

2. **Zoning and Land Use Control**:
   - To prevent **unauthorized construction** that could interfere with airport operations.
   - To maintain **visual and physical clarity** in critical flight zones.

3. **Consistency with Aviation Standards**:
   - The design of the surfaces (e.g., 1:7 slope, 10,000-foot reach) follows **standard aviation safety practices** for approach zones.

### **8. Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Primary Height Limit** | 150 feet above the ARP (3,002 ft) — the horizontal surface |
| **Critical Zones** | Approach surfaces (600 ft and 2,000 ft) and transitional surfaces (1:7 slope) around Runways 05-23 and 12-30 |
| **Applicability** | All lands adjacent to or near the airport, as per the detailed boundary description |
| **Exclusion** | A specific area bounded by the No. 5 Highway and surrounding sections is exempt |
| **Legal Authority** | Based on Plan E.603 (1958), with official records maintained in Ottawa and Calgary |
| **Status** | Revoked in part (Minister revoked under SOR/93-401, s.2) — may be outdated or superseded |

### **9. Implications for Landowners and Developers**

- **All land within the defined boundaries** must comply with height restrictions.
- Any proposed construction (new buildings, towers, antennas, etc.) must be **evaluated against the elevation of the relevant surface**.
- Developers must consult **Plan E.603** and **local land records** to determine if their land falls within the regulated zone.
- **Excluded areas** (near No. 5 Highway) may allow for higher structures, but only if they do not interfere with airport operations.

### **Conclusion**

The **Lethbridge Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, geographically precise framework to **protect aviation safety** by limiting the height of structures
