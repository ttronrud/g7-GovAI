**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Context and Purpose:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet), revokes a previous Order in Council and establishes a new framework for the fee structure associated with the use of the **Police Information Retrieval System (PIRS)** by provincial and municipal police forces.

The core principle underlying the regulation is that **the cost of providing services or using facilities should be borne by the individuals or entities receiving those services**. In this case, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) operates the Police Information Retrieval System — a centralized database used by law enforcement agencies across Canada to access criminal records, offender information, and other relevant policing data.

Historically, provinces and municipalities had access to this system without being charged for its use. However, the Governor in Council determined that this arrangement was not sustainable from a financial perspective and that a fair and equitable cost-sharing model should be implemented. Therefore, the regulation shifts from a cost-free access model to one where **provincial and municipal police forces are required to pay a fee for using the PIRS**.

**Legal Authority:**

The regulation is grounded in **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, which grants the Governor in Council the power to authorize fees or charges for the use of federal services or facilities. This provision allows the federal government to establish financial mechanisms to ensure that users of federal resources contribute to the cost of those services.

The authority is exercised through the **Solicitor General of Canada**, who is tasked with prescribing the specific fee or charge to be levied on provinces and municipalities.

**Key Actions Taken:**

1. **Revocation of Previous Order:**
   - The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1985-1938**, dated June 13, 1985, and the associated notice published in the *Canada Gazette*, Part II, page 2796 (SI/85-110).
   - This prior order had established a framework allowing provincial and municipal police forces to access the PIRS without any charge. Its revocation effectively ends that precedent.

2. **Authorization to Prescribe Fees:**
   - The Governor in Council **authorizes the Solicitor General of Canada** to issue a new order that specifies:
     - The **amount of the fee or charge** to be paid by provinces or municipalities.
     - The **conditions under which the fee applies** (e.g., for use of the PIRS by police forces under provincial or municipal jurisdiction).
     - The **method of billing or collection** (though not detailed in this notice, it is implied that the fee will be set and administered through a formal process).

---

**Scope of Application:**

- The regulation applies to **provincial and municipal police forces** that are responsible for policing within their jurisdiction and that use the **Police Information Retrieval System (PIRS)** operated by the RCMP.
- The fee is payable **by the province or municipality** (not by the individual officers or agencies directly), as the responsibility for funding is assigned to the level of government that oversees the police force.

---

**Rationale and Implications:**

- **Financial Sustainability:** The fee ensures that the cost of maintaining, operating, and upgrading the PIRS is shared fairly among users, preventing undue financial burden on the federal government.
- **Equity and Accountability:** It promotes a principle of cost accountability — users of a service must contribute to its cost, which aligns with broader public administration principles.
- **Improved Resource Management:** By introducing a fee structure, the federal government can generate revenue to support ongoing investments in the system, including system enhancements, security, and data integrity.
- **Encouragement of Responsible Use:** A fee may also serve as a disincentive for excessive or unnecessary use of the system, promoting more efficient and targeted data access.

---

**Implementation Process:**

- The Solicitor General of Canada will issue a **new order in council** (to be published in the *Canada Gazette*) that:
  - Specifies the exact fee structure (e.g., per query, per month, or based on volume of use).
  - Defines the eligibility criteria for fee payment.
  - Outlines procedures for reporting usage and paying fees.
- This new order will become effective upon publication and will replace the previous cost-free access model.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation marks a significant shift in how the RCMP's Police Information Retrieval System is funded and accessed. By revoking the outdated 1985 order and authorizing a user-based fee model, the federal government ensures that the financial responsibility for using a critical national policing resource is appropriately shared. The move reflects a modern, accountable, and sustainable approach to public service funding, consistent with the principles of financial administration and equitable cost distribution.

This regulation is a foundational step in the ongoing development of a transparent, efficient, and financially responsible national policing information infrastructure.
