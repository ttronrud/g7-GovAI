**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Vancouver Lamprey (Entosphenus macrostomus) Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulatory instrument, known as the *Critical Habitat of the Vancouver Lamprey (Entosphenus macrostomus) Order*, is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk. The Act was enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29) and is further amended by subsequent legislation, including the 2015 amendment (S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).

The Order is made by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**, who holds the statutory authority under **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA to designate critical habitat for listed species.

### **2. Species at Risk**

The species in question is the **Vancouver Lamprey (*Entosphenus macrostomus*)**, a native, freshwater fish species found in the Pacific coast region of British Columbia. It is classified as **"Threatened"** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**, meaning it is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires specific conservation measures.

---

### **3. Basis for Designation**

The designation of critical habitat is grounded in the following key provisions:

- **Action Plan Inclusion**: The critical habitat for the Vancouver Lamprey was identified in a formal **action plan** developed for the species. This action plan has been formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to document the status and management of at-risk species.

- **Legal Requirement**: Under **subsection 58(1) of SARA**, the critical habitat of a listed species must be identified and designated if it is known to be essential for the survival or recovery of the species.

- **Exclusion of Prohibited Areas**: The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas where development or activities are exempted under certain conditions (e.g., areas where the species is not present or where no recovery is possible). By confirming that the critical habitat is not in such an excluded area, the Minister ensures that the designation is legally valid and enforceable.

### **4. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally designate specific geographic areas** as critical habitat for the Vancouver Lamprey.
- **Provide legal protection** to these areas, meaning that any development, activity, or alteration of the environment within these areas must comply with SARA’s requirements, including the need for environmental assessments and permits.
- **Support recovery efforts** by ensuring that the physical and ecological conditions necessary for the lamprey’s survival and reproduction are preserved.

---

### **5. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- The critical habitat identified in the Order is **legally binding** and comes into force on the day it is **registered in the Canada Gazette** (the official journal of federal legislation).
- The designation triggers obligations under SARA, including:
  - Prohibiting actions that would destroy or significantly alter the critical habitat without a permit.
  - Requiring federal agencies to consult with the Minister before undertaking projects that may impact the habitat.
  - Mandating that any proposed development or activity in or near the critical habitat undergo a **Section 58(5) assessment** to determine its impact on the species.

---

### **6. Significance of the Designation**

This Order represents a key step in the **conservation and recovery** of the Vancouver Lamprey, which faces threats from:

- Habitat degradation due to dam construction and water diversion
- Changes in water temperature and flow
- Pollution and sedimentation
- Invasive species

By legally protecting its critical habitat—such as specific river reaches, spawning grounds, and nursery areas—the Order helps ensure that the lamprey can continue to reproduce and sustain viable populations.

---

### **7. Public Access and Transparency**

- The Order is publicly accessible and is part of the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public awareness.
- Stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, scientists, environmental groups, and industry representatives, can access the designated areas and understand the legal implications of activities in those zones.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Vancouver Lamprey (Entosphenus macrostomus) Order*, issued on **February 13, 2020**, is a legally sound and ecologically significant step in protecting a threatened species under Canadian environmental law. It formally identifies and protects the essential environmental conditions required for the survival and recovery of the Vancouver Lamprey, in accordance with the Species at Risk Act. The Order reflects a commitment to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem-based management in Canada’s freshwater systems.

--- 

**Key Takeaways:**
- The Vancouver Lamprey is a "Threatened" species under SARA.
- Its critical habitat was identified in an action plan and is now legally designated.
- The designation is valid because it does not fall within areas excluded by subsection 58(2)b.
- The Order is enforceable and comes into force upon registration.
- It supports recovery by protecting essential ecological conditions.
