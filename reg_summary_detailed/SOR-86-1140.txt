**Detailed Summary of the Regulations and Rules of Procedure of the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act (S.C. 1996, c. 41)**  
*Ottawa, December 12, 1986*  
*[Repealed by SOR/2014-252, s. 2]*

---

### **Overview**

These Regulations and Rules of Procedure were enacted by the **Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB)** under **Sections 12 and 71 of the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act (PESSRA)**. They establish the procedural framework governing all proceedings before the Board, including complaints, certification of bargaining agents, revocation of certification, and requests for arbitration.

Importantly, these regulations are **no longer in force** as they were **repealed by SOR/2014-252, section 2**, which reflects a broader modernization and replacement of outdated staff relations mechanisms in the public service. However, this summary provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of what the regulations *originally* governed, for historical, legal, and policy understanding purposes.
