---

### **Overview**
The *Manitoba Milk Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order*, made under section 3* of the *Manitoba Milk Order*, *C.R.C., c. 155*, and pursuant to section 2 of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, establishes a strict regulatory framework governing the marketing of milk produced in Manitoba in **interprovincial and export trade**. This Order ensures fair pricing, equitable distribution of proceeds, and control over the marketing process to protect producers and maintain market stability.

The Order was issued on **August 1, 1990**, and is formally cited as the *Manitoba Milk Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order*.

---

### **Key Definitions**
- **Producer**: A person who produces milk in the Province of Manitoba.  
  (French: *producteur*)

---

### **Scope of Application**
- Applies to the **marketing of milk** in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (sale of milk to other provinces)
  - **Export trade** (sale of milk outside Canada)
- Applies to **persons and property located in Manitoba** involved in the marketing process.
- **Exemption**: Does **not apply** to milk sold in containers with a capacity of **20 litres or less** (e.g., small retail or household packaging).

---

### **Core Provisions**

#### 1. **Exclusive Marketing Channel – The Commodity Board**
- **No person may buy or purchase milk** from a producer except **through or from the Commodity Board**.
- **No producer may sell milk** directly to any buyer except **to or through the Commodity Board**.

> 🔍 *This creates a monopoly on the marketing of milk in interprovincial and export markets, ensuring that all milk sales are channeled through a single, regulated entity (the Commodity Board). This prevents direct market competition and ensures uniform pricing and fair distribution.*

---

#### 2. **Distribution of Proceeds from Milk Sales**
- The **Commodity Board** has the authority to **conduct pools** (i.e., manage and distribute funds) received from milk sales.
- After deducting:
  - All **necessary and proper disbursements and expenses**
  - Making **allowances for reserves** (e.g., future operational costs or emergencies)
- The remaining funds must be distributed to producers in a manner **proportional to**:
  - The **quantity** of milk delivered
  - The **quality** of milk delivered
  - The **grade** of milk delivered

> ✅ *This ensures that producers receive payments based on the value of their actual milk output, promoting fairness and transparency.*

---

#### 3. **Payment to Producers**
- The Commodity Board may make:
  - An **initial payment** upon delivery of milk
  - **Subsequent payments** until the producer receives their full share
- Payments are made in accordance with the distribution rules above.

> 💡 *This provides producers with timely access to funds, with full reimbursement of their share over time based on delivery records.*

---

#### 4. **Transportation Restrictions**
- **No person may transport milk** except:
  - To the **Commodity Board**, or
  - To a person **retained by the Commodity Board** to transport milk.
- **No person may deliver milk for transport** except to a person **retained by the Commodity Board**.

> ⚠️ *This prevents unauthorized or third-party transportation, ensuring that all milk movement is under the control and oversight of the Commodity Board. It helps maintain traceability, quality, and compliance with safety and marketing standards.*

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**
The Order aims to:
- Ensure **fair and equitable returns** for milk producers
- Prevent **market manipulation or exploitation** through direct sales
- Provide **predictability and stability** in pricing and revenue distribution
- Maintain **quality control** and traceability in interprovincial and export markets
- Protect the interests of small and medium-sized producers in a competitive market

---

### **Legal Basis**
- Section 3* of the *Manitoba Milk Order*, *C.R.C., c. 155*
- Section 2 of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* (which authorizes provincial boards to regulate marketing of agricultural products)

---

### **Significance**
This Order is a foundational piece of agricultural regulation in Manitoba, reflecting a model of **producer protection** through centralized marketing. It mirrors similar systems in other Canadian provinces and is designed to balance:
- Producer interests (fair returns, stable income)
- Market efficiency (controlled distribution, quality assurance)
- Government oversight (preventing fraud, ensuring transparency)

---

### **Limitations**
- Does **not apply** to small-volume packaging (≤20L), allowing for local retail sales.
- Does **not regulate** the production or processing of milk — only its **marketing and distribution**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Manitoba Milk Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order* establishes a comprehensive, producer-centered system for the sale and distribution of milk from Manitoba outside the province. By restricting sales and transportation to the Commodity Board and mandating payments based on quality, quantity, and grade, it ensures fairness, transparency, and economic stability for dairy farmers. While it limits market freedom, it protects producers from price volatility and unfair competition in interprovincial and export markets.

This regulation remains a key instrument in Manitoba’s agricultural policy framework, particularly in the dairy sector.
