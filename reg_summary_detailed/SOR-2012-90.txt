### **2. Scope and Purpose of the Permit**
This is a **General Export Permit (GEP-44)** that allows Canadian residents to export **nuclear-related dual-use goods and technologies** to designated countries, provided they meet specific conditions and restrictions.

#### **Key Objectives:**
- Facilitate the lawful export of dual-use nuclear-related items to countries deemed to have responsible nuclear governance and peaceful use commitments.
- Ensure compliance with international non-proliferation obligations (e.g., under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty – NPT).
- Maintain Canada’s regulatory oversight and accountability in nuclear exports.

### **3. Definitions**

- **Eligible Destination**:  
  A list of countries to which exports are permitted. These include:
  > Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

  *Note:* This list is defined as "destination admissible" under the regulation.

- **Guide**:  
  Refers to the *Export Control List (ECL) Guide*, which provides detailed descriptions of goods and technologies subject to export controls. The Guide is used to identify specific items, their categories, and their classifications (e.g., by item number).

---

### **4. Permitted Exports**

Under this permit, **any resident of Canada** may export from Canada to any eligible destination:

- Any good or technology listed in **Group 4** of the *Schedule to the Export Control List* (ECL), **excluding** the following specific items:

#### **Excluded Items (Not Permitted Under This Permit):**
- Item 4-1.B  
- Item 4-1.D  
- Item 4-1.E  
- Item 4-2.C.1  
- Item 4-2.C.2  
- Item 4-2.C.7  
- Item 4-2.C.10  
- Item 4-2.C.11  
- Item 4-2.C.13  
- Item 4-2.C.14  
- Item 4-3.B.3  
- Item 4-3.B.4  

> These items are typically associated with sensitive nuclear applications such as enrichment, reprocessing, or advanced reactor design — which are subject to stricter controls due to proliferation risks.

#### **Important Exception Clause:**
- If the export of goods or technologies from **other Groups** in the ECL (not Group 4) is authorized under a **specific permit issued under subsection 7(1.1)** of the Export and Import Permits Act, then **Paragraph (1)(a)** of the permit does not apply.  
  → This means that if a company has already obtained a separate permit for items in other groups (e.g., Group 1, 2, 3), they may export those items under that permit, even if not covered by GEP-44.

---

### **5. Prohibited Exports**

This permit **does not authorize**:

1. **Exports to countries listed in the Area Control List (ACL)**  
   → These are countries or regions considered high-risk for nuclear proliferation or with poor compliance records. Exports to such destinations are explicitly banned.

2. **Exports of goods or technologies not intended for end-use in an eligible destination**  
   → The export must be for **peaceful, legitimate end-use** within one of the eligible countries.  
   → Any use in a non-eligible country (e.g., for military or weapons development) is prohibited.

---

### **6. Conditions of the Permit**

Exporters must comply with the following **mandatory conditions**:

#### **(a) Initial Registration Requirement**
Before making the **first export in a calendar year**, the exporter must submit written information to the **Export Controls Division (ECD)** of DFIT, including:
- Full name and address  
- Telephone and fax numbers  
- Electronic mail address  
- In the case of a corporation:  
  - Name of a designated contact person  
  - Their address, phone, fax, and email  

> This ensures that DFIT maintains contact with exporters and can monitor compliance.

#### **(b) Nuclear Safety and Regulatory Compliance**
Before export, the exporter must present to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** a **valid licence** issued by the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*.  
→ This confirms that the goods or technology are legally authorized for export and that safety and security standards are met.

#### **(c) Recordkeeping Requirements**
All exports made under this permit must be documented and retained for **six years** after the year of export. Records must include:
- The **item number** in the Guide describing the exported good or technology  
- **Quantity** and **value** of each item exported  
- **Date of export**  
- **Eligible destination** to which it was shipped  
- **Name and address** of the recipient (importer or end-user)

> This ensures transparency and traceability of nuclear-related exports.

#### **(d) Reporting Obligations**
Exporters must respond within **15 days** of a request from the Export Controls Division with:
- A detailed list of all exports made under this permit during the specified time period  
  - Description of each good or technology  
  - Item in the Guide to which it corresponds  
  - Quantity and value, **by country of destination**

> This enables DFIT to monitor export patterns and detect potential misuse or non-compliance.

#### **(e) Customs Reporting Requirement**
If the exported item is required to be reported under the *Customs Act*, the exporter must insert the term:
- **"GEP-44"** or **"LGE-44"**  
  → in the appropriate field of the prescribed customs export form.

> This ensures that customs authorities are aware of the nature and origin of the export, particularly for nuclear-related dual-use items.

### **7. Cancellation Clause**
- This permit **comes into force on the day it is officially registered** with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  
- It is **not automatically canceled** unless revoked by the Minister for non-compliance, changes in policy, or international developments (e.g., new proliferation risks or changes in the eligible destination list).

---

### **8. Strategic and Policy Implications**

- **Dual-Use Oversight**: The permit targets goods and technologies that can be used for both civilian (e.g., medical or energy applications) and military (e.g., weapons development) purposes. Canada maintains strict controls to prevent misuse.
- **International Cooperation**: The list of eligible destinations includes key nuclear-capable nations with strong non-proliferation commitments, reflecting Canada’s role in global nuclear governance.
- **Compliance and Accountability**: The extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements ensure that Canada maintains full visibility and control over its nuclear exports.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Excluding specific high-risk items (e.g., enrichment, reprocessing) and banning exports to high-risk countries demonstrates a balance between economic opportunity and national security.

---

### **Conclusion**

**General Export Permit No. 44** is a carefully structured regulatory instrument that enables Canada to support international nuclear cooperation while upholding its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other international agreements. It provides a clear, transparent, and accountable framework for the export of nuclear-related dual-use goods and technologies to selected, responsible countries — all while maintaining robust safeguards against proliferation risks.

This permit is a key tool in Canada’s broader export control regime, ensuring that nuclear technology is shared responsibly and in alignment with global non-proliferation goals.
