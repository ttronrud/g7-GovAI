**Detailed Summary of the "Meetings and Proposals (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations"**

These regulations, made under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (the "Act"), provide specific procedural and administrative guidelines for meetings and proposals within cooperative credit associations. They are issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to several sections of the Act, including:

- Subsections 145(1)a, (1)3a, 146(1)b, 152(2)c and (3)c, 153(1)d, 160(6)e, and 463(1)f.

The regulations came into force upon registration and apply to all cooperative credit associations governed by the Act. The primary purpose is to ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in the processes related to member voting, record dates, proposal submissions, and voting mechanisms.

### 1. **Record Dates – Timing and Requirements**

#### For most actions under subsection 145(1) of the Act (excluding paragraphs (b) and (c)):
- The prescribed period between the **record date** and the day on which a particular action (e.g., a vote or decision) is taken must not exceed **60 days**.
- This ensures that members have sufficient time to be informed and to participate, while preventing undue delays.

#### For actions under paragraphs 145(1)(b) and (c) of the Act:
- The period between the record date and the meeting must be **at least 21 days and no more than 60 days**.
- This provides a minimum notice period to ensure members have adequate time to prepare and respond, while still maintaining procedural efficiency.

#### Notice of Record Date:
- The association must give **at least seven days’ notice** before the date of the record date.
- This ensures members are properly informed about when their voting eligibility will be determined.

---

### 2. **Notice of Meetings (Section 146(1))**

- The notice to be sent to members prior to a meeting must be given **no less than 21 days and no more than 60 days** before the meeting.
- This establishes a reasonable timeframe for members to attend and participate in meetings, balancing accessibility with operational feasibility.

---

### 3. **Proposal Submissions (Section 152(2))**

- The **proposal** and the **statement supporting it** together must not exceed **500 words**.
- This limit ensures clarity, brevity, and focus, preventing overly complex or lengthy submissions that could confuse members or delay decision-making.

---

### 4. **Timeframes for Proposal Consideration**

#### Paragraph 152(3)(a): Time to Consider a Proposal
- The association must consider a proposal within **90 days** of its submission.
- This provides a clear and reasonable deadline for review, ensuring timely action without undue delay.

#### Paragraph 152(3)(c): Duration of Proposal Review
- A proposal may be submitted for review **up to two years** from the date of its initial submission.
- This allows for long-term planning and sustained advocacy, especially for proposals requiring extensive analysis or stakeholder consultation.

#### Paragraph 152(3)(d): Minimum Support Required for a Proposal

This rule establishes a tiered support threshold based on the number of prior annual meetings in which the proposal has been introduced:

| Number of Prior Annual Meetings | Minimum Support Required |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| First time introduced (1 meeting) | **3%** of total votes cast at the annual meeting |
| Introduced at two annual meetings | **6%** of total votes cast at its last submission |
| Introduced at three or more annual meetings | **10%** of total votes cast at its last submission |

> **Purpose**: These thresholds ensure that only proposals with significant member support are considered, thereby promoting democratic legitimacy and reducing the risk of frivolous or poorly supported motions.

#### Paragraph 152(3)(d): Duration of Proposal Support
- The support for a proposal must be maintained for a period of **five years** from the date of its last submission.
- This ensures continuity and stability in the review process and prevents frequent re-submission of the same proposal without sustained backing.

---

### 5. **Notification of Proposal Submission (Section 153(1))**

- The association must **notify the person who submitted the proposal** within **21 days** of receiving it.
- This ensures accountability and transparency in the process, allowing the submitter to know when their proposal has been received and is being processed.

---

### 6. **Voting by Electronic or Telephonic Means (Section 160(6))**

- A vote at a meeting may be conducted via **telephonic, electronic, or other communication facilities**, provided two conditions are met:
  1. The facility must enable votes to be **gathered in a manner that allows for subsequent verification** (i.e., the votes must be verifiable and auditable).
  2. The tallied votes must be presented to the association **without allowing identification** of how individual members or shareholders voted (i.e., anonymity must be preserved).

> **Purpose**: This provision supports modernization and accessibility, allowing remote participation while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the voting process.

---

### 7. **Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*), making them immediately applicable to all cooperative credit associations.

---

### Key Objectives of the Regulations

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Clear timelines for record dates, notices, and proposal reviews ensure members are informed and can participate meaningfully.

2. **Democratic Participation**  
   - Support thresholds and voting rules ensure that only proposals with broad member backing are considered, protecting against minority-driven decisions.

3. **Efficiency and Timeliness**  
   - Defined timeframes (e.g., 60 days, 90 days, 5 years) prevent procedural stagnation and ensure timely decision-making.

4. **Modernization and Accessibility**  
   - The allowance for electronic voting improves access for members who cannot attend in person, especially those in remote or rural areas.

5. **Integrity and Confidentiality**  
   - The rules on electronic voting safeguard both the verifiability of results and the privacy of individual votes.

### Conclusion

The *Meetings and Proposals (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* establish a balanced, transparent, and democratic framework for how cooperative credit associations handle member proposals and meetings. By setting clear time limits, support thresholds, and procedural standards, the regulations enhance governance, promote member engagement, and ensure that voting processes are both accessible and secure.

These rules are essential for maintaining trust in the cooperative model and ensuring that decisions reflect the true will of the membership.
