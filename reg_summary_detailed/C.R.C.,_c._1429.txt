The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*:

- **SOR/2007-86, s. 202** – This section was repealed multiple times in the list (repeated 9 times).
- **SOR/2005-139, s.3** – This section was also referenced once.

These references indicate that the regulation or provisions in question have been **officially repealed** by subsequent statutory rules.

### Detailed Summary:

The listed entries do **not** represent an active, current regulation. Instead, they are **repeal notices** indicating that certain sections of a prior regulation were formally removed from force and effect. Specifically:

1. **Repeal of SOR/2007-86, s. 202**  
   - This section was repealed by the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* on **March 23, 2007**, under the official publication *SOR/2007-86*.  
   - The repeal of Section 202 means that the specific legal provision previously contained in that rule is no longer in effect.  
   - The repetition of this repeal notice nine times in the list suggests a typographical or administrative error—likely a duplication due to a formatting or data entry issue—since repeal notices are not typically listed multiple times unless referencing different provisions or amendments.

2. **Repeal of SOR/2005-139, s.3**  
   - This section was repealed by *SOR/2005-139*, which was published on **October 14, 2005**.  
   - This indicates that a prior regulation (likely from an earlier year) had a section (s.3) that was formally removed from legal force on that date.  
   - This repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory review or consolidation effort.

### Conclusion:

The provided text **does not describe an active regulation**. Rather, it is a **list of repeals**, showing that:

- Specific sections of a prior regulation (likely related to licensing, safety, or compliance in a sector such as construction, transportation, or environmental management) were **officially canceled**.
- These repeals were enacted through statutory rules (SOR) in **2005 and 2007**.
- The repeated references to *SOR/2007-86, s. 202* appear to be an error or duplication—no additional legal content or substantive rule is present.
- The regulation referenced in the list is **no longer in force**.

### Final Note:
Because the regulation has been repealed, **no current legal obligations or requirements** are derived from the provisions previously listed. Any legal or operational impact would have been addressed by the replacement regulation (if any) or by subsequent amendments.

👉 **In short**: The provided text is a list of repeals—meaning the regulation has been formally canceled and is no longer valid. There is no active or enforceable regulation described here.
