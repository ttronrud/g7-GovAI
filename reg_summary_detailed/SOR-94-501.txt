**Detailed Summary of the *Coast Guard Radio Station Communications Charges Order, 1994***

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Authority**
This regulation establishes a formal framework for charging users for **ship/shore communications services** provided by **Coast Guard Radio Stations** in Canada. It was issued under two key legal authorities:

- **Paragraph 19(1)(b)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the Minister of Transport to prescribe fees for certain government services.
- **Order in Council P.C. 1994-641**, dated April 21, 1994, which authorized the Minister to establish charges for communications services delivered through Coast Guard radio stations.

The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Coast Guard Radio Station Communications Charges Order, 1994"**  
and came into force on **September 1, 1994**.

### **2. Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable Communications**
The Order applies to all communications that:
- Are **transmitted from a Coast Guard Radio Station to a ship**, or  
- Are **transmitted from a ship to a Coast Guard Radio Station**  
— **provided** the communication is not excluded under specific exceptions.

#### **Exclusions (Communications Not Covered)**
The following types of communications are **not subject to charges**:
- **AMVER reports** (a global ship tracking system for safety and emergency response) forwarded via Coast Guard stations.
- Communications related to:
  - Aids to navigation
  - Ice conditions or ice routing
  - Medical advice
  - Pollution incidents
  - Weather updates
  - Navigational hazards
  - Safety of life at sea
- Communications addressed to **any part of or individual member of the Canadian Coast Guard** that report:
  - Ship movement
  - Position
  - Condition

> These exclusions ensure that critical safety, environmental, and emergency functions remain free of user fees.

### **3. Fee Structure (Charges by Type of Communication)**

Fees are determined based on the **type of communication** (listed in Column I of the Schedule), the **duration or number of words** (Column II), and the **charge rate** (Columns III and IV).

#### **Fee Application Rules:**
- **For communications involving ships registered in or licensed by Canada, or transmitted from Canada:**
  - The fee is set in **Column III** of the Schedule.
- **For all other communications (e.g., foreign ships, international transmissions):**
  - The fee is set in **Column IV** of the Schedule.

> This distinction ensures that domestic and Canadian-flagged vessels are charged at a lower rate than international users, reflecting the greater reliance on Canadian maritime infrastructure and regulatory oversight.

---

### **4. Responsibility for Payment**

The party responsible for paying the charge depends on the **direction of the communication**:

| Direction of Communication | Paying Party |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Transmitted TO a ship** | The **originator** (i.e., the landline company that sent the message to the Coast Guard station) |
| **Transmitted FROM a ship** | The **owner of the ship** (defined as the operator of the vessel) |

> This clearly assigns liability based on who initiated or received the message.

---

### **5. Currency and Exchange Rate**

- All charges under this Order must be paid in **United States dollars (USD)**.
- The exchange rate used for conversion purposes is:
  > **1 United States dollar = 2.5374 gold francs**  
  (Note: This is a fixed conversion rate used for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The gold franc was a historical currency unit; this rate likely reflects a nominal or administrative conversion for fiscal consistency.)

> This ensures uniformity in financial processing, even though the actual transaction is in USD.

---

### **6. Key Definitions**

- **Coast Guard Radio Station**: A shore-based radio facility operated by the **Canadian Coast Guard** (e.g., coastal stations providing VHF, HF, or other radio services to vessels).
- **Originator**: The landline telecommunications provider from which a communication is received by the Coast Guard station.
- **Owner of a Ship**: The **operator or managing entity** responsible for the vessel (e.g., shipping company, charterer).

---

### **7. Practical Implications**

- **Vessels registered in Canada** benefit from reduced or lower fees when communicating with Coast Guard stations.
- **International vessels** face higher charges, reflecting the cost of providing services to non-Canadian users.
- The **exclusion of safety-related communications** ensures that essential maritime safety functions (like reporting hazards or pollution) remain accessible and free to all users, consistent with international maritime safety standards.
- The regulation supports **financial accountability** by clearly defining who pays, when, and how much.

---

### **8. Regulatory Context and Significance**

This Order:
- Introduces a **transparent and standardized fee structure** for ship-to-shore communications.
- Balances **government revenue needs** with **maritime safety and accessibility**.
- Aligns with broader financial administration principles under the *Financial Administration Act*, ensuring public accountability and consistency in service pricing.

It also reflects a shift toward **commercialization of certain government services**, while preserving critical safety functions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Coast Guard Radio Station Communications Charges Order, 1994* is a targeted, rule-based regulation that establishes fair and transparent charges for ship/shore radio communications. It applies to commercial and operational communications, excludes vital safety-related messages, and ensures that fees are paid by clearly defined parties using a consistent currency and exchange rate. The Order supports both revenue generation for the Canadian Coast Guard and the continued availability of essential maritime safety services.
