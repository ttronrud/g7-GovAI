**Detailed Summary of the Income Support Payment (Number of Weeks) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Income Support Payment (Number of Weeks) Regulations were issued by the **Minister of Employment and Social Development (MESD)**, acting with the **consent of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 8(2) of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act (CERB Act)**. This provision grants the Minister the authority to establish rules governing the administration of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), including specific operational details such as payment duration.

**Legal Citation:**  
- Statutory reference: *S.C. 2020, c. 5, s. 8*  
- Date of issuance: **June 26, 2020**  
- Place of issuance: **Gatineau, Quebec**

**Core Provision:**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to define the **maximum duration** for which income support payments under the CERB may be made to eligible workers.

Specifically, the regulations establish that:

> **The maximum number of weeks for which income support payments may be made to a worker is 28 weeks.**

This means that, under the terms of these regulations, no individual can receive CERB payments for more than **28 consecutive weeks**, regardless of the circumstances or the length of time a person is unemployed or unable to work due to pandemic-related reasons.

**Purpose and Context:**  
The 28-week limit was introduced to ensure the CERB program remains **fiscally sustainable** and **targeted** during the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the CERB was designed to provide short-term financial support to individuals who lost income due to the pandemic, the 28-week cap ensures that funds are not used for prolonged periods beyond what is necessary to address immediate economic hardship.

This cap applies to all individuals receiving CERB payments, including those who may have been temporarily unable to work due to illness, quarantine, or business closures.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** with the Canada Gazette. Since the regulations were issued on June 26, 2020, they became effective on that date, immediately impacting the administration of CERB payments.

**Key Implications:**  
- Eligible individuals must apply for CERB payments within the 28-week window.  
- Payments are not automatically extended beyond 28 weeks, even if a person continues to be unemployed or unable to work.  
- The 28-week limit is a **non-negotiable administrative rule** and is not subject to review or adjustment by the individual or the courts under normal circumstances.  
- The rule applies to all CERB recipients, regardless of the reason for unemployment or inability to work.  

**Note on Flexibility:**  
While the 28-week cap is firm, the regulations do not preclude the possibility of **temporary extensions** in exceptional circumstances (e.g., ongoing public health emergencies or economic disruptions), which may be considered through future amendments or emergency orders. However, no such extensions were formally introduced under these specific regulations.

**Conclusion:**  
The Income Support Payment (Number of Weeks) Regulations provide a clear, enforceable framework for the duration of CERB payments. By limiting support to a maximum of 28 weeks, the regulations balance the need for timely financial assistance with fiscal responsibility and program accountability during a national emergency. These rules were a critical component in ensuring the CERB program operated efficiently and transparently during the early stages of the pandemic response in Canada.
