### **Detailed Summary of the Brandon Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, formally **revokes the previous Brandon Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 76)** and replaces them with new, more specific zoning rules designed to ensure **safety, operational efficiency, and environmental protection** around Brandon Airport in Manitoba. The new regulations are established to manage land use and physical structures in the vicinity of the airport to prevent hazards related to aircraft operations—particularly during takeoff and landing.

---

## **1. Background and Legal Authority**

- **Section 4.5 of the Aeronautics Act** required that proposed zoning regulations be publicly published to allow for public comment.
- The proposed regulations were published in:
  - Two issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (August 22 and 29, 1987)
  - Two issues of the *Brandon Sun* (October 7 and 8, 1987)
- This provided a **reasonable opportunity for stakeholders** (e.g., landowners, residents, aviation authorities) to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.

> **Legal Basis**: The new regulations are enacted under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt or amend airport zoning rules.

---

## **2. Name and Scope of the New Regulations**

- **Title**: *Brandon Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands:
  - Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**
  - And directly under any portion of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

These areas are defined on **Brandon Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2307**, dated January 2, 1987.

## **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Brandon Airport, located in the vicinity of Brandon, Manitoba |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point used as a datum for elevation measurements. Located 152.4 m north and 904 m west along the centerline of runway 08–26. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | 405 meters above sea level |
| **Strip** | Rectangular area of the runway designated for takeoff/landing in a specific direction (e.g., runway 08–26 or 14–32). Includes runway and its immediate surroundings. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip (runway) to protect aircraft during approach. Different slopes and heights for different runways. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the sides of the strip and its approach surfaces to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 450 m above sea level), except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground—then it is set at **9 meters above ground level**. |

## **4. Restrictions on Construction and Development**

### **Prohibition on Structures**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including trees or natural growth) on land covered by these regulations  
- Where the **highest point** of such structure exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

> This ensures that no object (e.g., hill, building, tree) interferes with aircraft visibility or flight paths during critical phases like landing or takeoff.

### **Management of Natural Growth**
- If a **natural object** (e.g., tree, bush) exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the landowner or lessee to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This is a preventive measure to avoid obstructions and ensure flight safety.

### **Prohibition on Bird Attraction**
- No owner or lessee may use any land under these regulations for:
  - Disposal of **waste that is edible or attractive to birds**
- Purpose: To reduce bird strikes, which pose a serious safety risk to aircraft.

## **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces (Based on Zoning Plan E.2307)**

### **A. Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 08 (approach)** | - Inclined plane: 1 m vertical rise per 50 m horizontal<br>- Rises to a horizontal line 15,000 m from end of strip<br>- Outer ends: 2,400 m from centerline<br>- Horizontal line: 300 m above elevation at end of strip |
| **Runway 26 (approach)** | - Same as 08 (symmetrical)<br>- 1:50 slope<br>- 15,000 m horizontal distance<br>- 2,400 m from centerline<br>- 300 m above strip elevation |
| **Runway 14 (approach)** | - 1:25 slope (steeper than 08–26)<br>- Rises to horizontal line 3,000 m from end<br>- Outer ends: 330 m from centerline<br>- Horizontal line: 120 m above strip elevation |
| **Runway 32 (approach)** | - Same as 14 (symmetrical)<br>- 1:25 slope<br>- 3,000 m horizontal distance<br>- 330 m from centerline<br>- 120 m above strip elevation |

> These surfaces are designed to provide a **clear visual path** for pilots during approach, especially in poor visibility.

---

### **B. Outer Surface**

- A flat, imaginary surface located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (405 m = 450 m above sea level)**.
- **Exception**: If the ground is already higher than 45 m above ARP, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that even in areas with natural topography, there is a consistent safety boundary.

---

### **C. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **08–26** | 300 m wide (150 m on each side of centerline) | 2,101 m long |
| **14–32** | 60 m wide (30 m on each side) | 1,034.5 m long |

> These define the active areas where aircraft take off and land.

---

### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **08–26** | Inclined plane rising at **1:7** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) from lateral edges of strip and approach surfaces<br>Extends upward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface |
| **14–32** | Inclined plane rising at **1:5** (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal)<br>Extends from lateral edges to outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |

> These surfaces connect the approach zones to the outer boundary and ensure a smooth transition between the approach area and the outer surface.

---

## **6. Boundary of Outer Limits (Land Covered by Regulations)**

The boundary is defined by a **precise, legally described survey line** in the land titles of Manitoba. It traces a path across multiple sections and road allowances, including:

- Sections 19, 20, 17, 5, 36, 35, 34, 33, 3, 4, 9, 16, 22, and 23
- Includes **road allowances** (public rights-of-way) adjacent to major roads
- Ends at intersections with **Trans-Canada Highway No. 1**

> This boundary ensures that only land **in the immediate vicinity** of the airport is subject to strict zoning controls.

## **7. Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Flight Safety** | Prevents obstructions to aircraft during takeoff and landing by limiting structure heights and controlling natural growth |
| **Environmental Protection** | Prevents waste disposal that attracts birds, reducing bird strike risks |
| **Public Participation** | Public notice and comment process ensured transparency and stakeholder engagement |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Clear definitions and geometric descriptions of surfaces allow consistent enforcement and compliance |

---

## **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** is responsible for:
  - Enforcing the regulations
  - Requiring removal of excessive natural growth
  - Monitoring compliance with restrictions on waste disposal
- Landowners and lessees must comply with all restrictions; failure may result in penalties or enforcement actions.

## **Conclusion**

The **Brandon Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use around a major regional airport. By defining precise **approach, transitional, and outer surfaces**, and imposing strict **height and waste restrictions**, the regulations aim to:
