**Detailed Summary of the International Submarine Cable Licences Regulations (1998)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The *International Submarine Cable Licences Regulations* were enacted under **subsection 22(2) of the Telecommunications Act (S.C. 1993, c. 38)**, which authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations governing the issuance of international submarine cable licences. This action followed a **public consultation process** initiated under **subsection 22(4)** of the same Act. On **July 25, 1998**, a draft version of the proposed regulations was published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Industry.

After reviewing these submissions, the Minister of Industry recommended the adoption of the regulations, and the Governor General in Council formally enacted them.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a clear and transparent framework for issuing and managing **international submarine cable licences** in Canada. These licences are categorized based on the cable’s function—whether it terminates in Canada (connecting to domestic telecom infrastructure) or passes through Canada without connecting to domestic networks.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Telecommunications Act* (S.C. 1993, c. 38), the legislative foundation under which these regulations operate.

2. **Terminating Cable Licence**  
   A licence issued for the construction or operation of an international submarine cable that:
   - Extends between a point in Canada and a point outside Canada.
   - Is connected to, or intended to be connected to, telecommunications facilities within Canada.
   - Includes associated works or facilities (e.g., landing stations, terminals, or equipment).

3. **Through Cable Licence**  
   A licence issued for the construction or operation of an international submarine cable that:
   - Extends through Canada between points outside Canada.
   - Does **not** connect to telecommunications facilities in Canada.
   - Includes associated works or facilities.

> These definitions distinguish between cables that serve domestic connectivity (terminating) and those that merely pass through Canada (transit).

---

### **Eligibility and Licence Classes**

- A person may hold **one or both** of the following classes of licences:
  - A **terminating cable licence**
  - A **through cable licence**

- **Eligibility for a Terminating Cable Licence**:
  - The applicant must **control the administration and operation** of the international submarine cable in question.
  - This includes oversight of all associated works or facilities (e.g., cable landing stations, equipment, maintenance, and operations).

> This requirement ensures that only entities with direct operational control over the cable can obtain a licence that involves domestic connectivity.

---

### **Application Requirements**

An applicant must submit a **written application** to the Minister containing the following information:

| Requirement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Applicant’s Name and Address** | Full legal name and address of the applicant's head office. If no head office in Canada, the address in Canada where service can be provided. |
| **Corporate Information** | For corporations: province, state, or country of incorporation, and date of incorporation. |
| **Origin and Intended Route** | Details of the cable’s origin and destination, including the path it will take. For terminating licences, specific **connection points** to Canadian telecommunications facilities must be specified. |
| **Environmental Compliance** | Documentation proving compliance with the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act* (CEAA). This ensures environmental safeguards are met before cable deployment. |
| **Licence Term Request** | The requested duration of the licence, which **cannot exceed 10 years**. |
| **Capital Costs and Technical Capabilities** | Detailed information on the financial investment required and the technical capacity (e.g., bandwidth, transmission technology) of the cable and its associated infrastructure. |

> If **multiple parties** are involved in the construction or operation of the cable, the application must include the above information for **each party**.

### **Fees**

- **Initial Fee**:  
  A non-refundable fee of **$100** is payable at the time of filing, covering the **first year** of the licence term.

- **Annual Renewal Fee**:  
  A fee of **$100** is due for **each subsequent year** of the licence term.

- **Payment Deadline**:  
  The licensee must pay the annual fee to the Minister **on or before the anniversary** of the date the licence was issued.

> The fee structure is simple and consistent, with no tiered or escalating charges, and is designed to be accessible while ensuring ongoing revenue for regulatory oversight.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

The regulations include a **[Repeal]** clause indicating that any prior or conflicting regulations related to international submarine cable licensing are hereby **repealed**. This ensures legal clarity and prevents overlap or inconsistency with the new framework.

---

### **Commencement**

The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada. This means they are immediately effective upon official publication and registration, without a delay.

---

### **Key Regulatory Principles and Implications**

1. **Public Participation and Transparency**  
   The process of publishing the draft regulations and allowing public comment reflects a commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement in telecommunications policy.

2. **Environmental Responsibility**  
   Mandatory compliance with the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act* ensures that submarine cable projects undergo rigorous environmental review, protecting marine ecosystems and coastal communities.

3. **Operational Accountability**  
   The requirement that applicants control the administration and operation of the cable ensures that only responsible and accountable entities can operate cables that connect to Canadian telecommunications networks.

4. **Clarity in Licence Types**  
   The distinction between terminating and through licences enables Canada to regulate its **domestic connectivity** and **transit infrastructure** separately—important for both economic and security reasons.

5. **Simplicity and Predictability**  
   The clear, standardized application process and fixed fee structure provide predictability for investors and operators, encouraging investment in submarine cable infrastructure.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The **maximum licence term of 10 years** may limit long-term investment planning, though it allows for periodic review and renewal.
- The requirement for **full technical and financial disclosure** may pose challenges for smaller or emerging operators.
- The regulations do not address issues such as **cable security, cybersecurity, or data sovereignty**, which may require additional future provisions.

### **Conclusion**

The *International Submarine Cable Licences Regulations* of 1998 provide a foundational regulatory framework for managing international submarine cable infrastructure in Canada. By clearly defining licence types, setting eligibility criteria, requiring environmental compliance, and establishing a transparent application and fee system, the regulations support the development of reliable, secure, and sustainable global telecommunications networks while protecting Canada’s environmental and national interests.

These regulations remain a key piece of Canadian telecommunications policy, especially in the context of growing demand for global connectivity and the expansion of digital infrastructure.

> **Note**: While the text references "Telecommunications Acta" (a likely typo for *Telecommunications Act*), all references are consistent with the actual legislation, *S.C. 1993, c. 38*. The regulations are historical and may have been superseded or amended by later legislation (e.g., the *Telecommunications Act* amendments in the 2000s or subsequent environmental and digital policy updates). However, as of the date of this summary, they represent a significant milestone in Canada’s regulatory approach to submarine cable management.
