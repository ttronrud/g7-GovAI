This indicates that a particular regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2014-37**, specifically **Section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**:  
  The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or abolished) by Statutory Instrument 2014-37.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2014-37**, which is a piece of secondary legislation (a statutory rule or order) issued under the authority of a primary Act of Parliament. This SI was passed in 2014 and formally removed the provision referenced in the original regulation.

- **Section Repealed**:  
  The specific section that was repealed is **Section 5** of SI 2014-37. This means that the regulation previously governed by Section 5 of the original legislation (which is not named here) has been removed from the legal framework.

- **Implications**:  
  - Any legal obligations, definitions, duties, or rules previously established by the repealed section no longer apply.  
  - Legal entities, courts, or authorities are no longer bound by the content of that section.  
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative reform, consolidation, or modernization effort to streamline or replace outdated provisions.

- **Why It Was Repealed**:  
  While the original regulation is not provided, common reasons for repeal include:  
  - Obsolescence (e.g., outdated rules no longer relevant to current practice).  
  - Inconsistency with newer laws.  
  - Redundancy or overlap with other provisions.  
  - A desire to simplify the legal framework.  
  - A consolidation of rules into a more comprehensive or updated statute.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the original text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its removal was formally enacted under **Statutory Instrument 2014-37, Section 5**, which serves as the legal basis for the repeal. As such, any reference to this regulation in current legal or administrative contexts should be treated as obsolete.
