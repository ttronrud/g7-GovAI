## 🔍 **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, though now **repealed**, was designed to clarify and expand the scope of **removal allowances** under **section 40 of the Judges Act**. Its primary purpose was to ensure that judges, their spouses or common-law partners, survivors, or children receive financial support to cover reasonable and necessary expenses incurred during a relocation — including moving costs, housing, legal fees, and mortgage differences — when required to change residence due to judicial duties.

The regulation establishes:
- Clear definitions of key terms (e.g., former residence, new residence)
- A comprehensive list of eligible expenses
- Rules governing the valuation of former residences if sold below market value
- Procedures for determining fair market value through independent appraisals
- Time limits and exceptions for real estate market difficulties
- Requirements for documentation and Ministerial approval of claims

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation is **no longer in force** (repealed by SI/2003-143, s. 2), meaning it does not currently apply. However, its provisions may have influenced or been incorporated into subsequent policies or amendments to the Judges Act or related regulations.

## 🏡 Fair Market Value Determination (When Sale Price < Market Value)

### When a residence is not sold at fair market value
- The **difference between sale price and fair market value** is eligible as a removal allowance.

### How Fair Market Value is Determined
1. Two appraisers are appointed:
   - One by the judge, survivor, or estate
   - One by the Minister of Justice
2. Each submits an **appraisal report** using the official form:  
   → *Appraisal Report Home Ownership Units* (used by the Appraisal Institute of Canada)  
   → Or by *La Corporation professionnelle des évaluateurs agréés du Québec* (Quebec-recognized appraiser)

### Decision Rules Based on Appraisal Differences

| Difference | Outcome |
|---------|--------|
| ≤5% of higher appraisal | Fair market value = **average of the two appraisals** |
| >5% of higher appraisal | A **third appraiser** (appointed by Minister) is required |
| Third appraisal vs. first two: |
| - ≤5% of higher of first two | Fair market value = **average of two within 5%** |
| - ≤5% of each of first two | Fair market value = **average of all three** |
| - >5% of each of first two | Fair market value = **average or median**, whichever is greater |

### Final Notice
- Once determined, the **Minister of Justice issues written notice** to the claimant or estate of the fair market value.

---

## ⏳ Time Limits and Market Exceptions

| Rule | Details |
|------|--------|
| **Six-Month Deadline for Sale** | Former residence must be sold within **six months** of receiving notice of fair market value. |
| **Extension Possible** | If real estate market conditions are unfavorable (e.g., low demand, high prices), the **Governor in Council** may prescribe a **reasonable extension**. |

> This ensures that judges are not penalized due to external market forces.
