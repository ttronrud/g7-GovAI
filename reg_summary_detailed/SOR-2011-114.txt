### **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Syria) Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 17)**

The **Special Economic Measures (Syria) Regulations**, made under the *Special Economic Measures Act* (SEMA), are a set of legally binding Canadian sanctions targeting individuals, entities, and activities associated with the Syrian government and its supporters. These measures were introduced in response to the **grave breach of international peace and security** in Syria, particularly following the 2011 civil unrest and the subsequent conflict, which the Canadian government deemed to have the potential to trigger a serious international crisis.

## **I. Purpose and Background**

- **Policy Rationale**: The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) determined that the situation in Syria constitutes a **grave breach of international peace and security**, leading to or threatening a **serious international crisis**.
- **Legal Basis**: The Regulations are enacted under **subsections 4(1) to (3)** of the *Special Economic Measures Act*, which empowers the federal government to impose economic sanctions on individuals and entities linked to regimes that threaten international peace and security.
- **Objective**: To isolate the Syrian regime economically by restricting trade, financial flows, and access to goods and services, thereby applying targeted pressure to promote accountability and discourage support for human rights abuses and authoritarian governance.
