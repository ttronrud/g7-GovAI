The regulation you provided is a **set of provisions under the Migratory Birds Convention Act (MBCA)**, specifically outlining the establishment and management of **migratory bird sanctuaries** in Canada. However, it is important to note that **this regulation has been repealed**, as explicitly stated in the text:

> **[Repealed, SOR/80-738, s. 1]**  
> **[Repealed, SOR/80-738, s. 5]**

This means that **the full text of these rules is no longer in force** as of the date of repeal (likely effective January 1, 2025, based on SOR/2025-99). The repeal indicates that the current regulatory framework governing migratory bird sanctuaries has been replaced by newer legislation or regulations, most likely the **Migratory Birds Regulations, 2022**, which now supersedes the older versions.
