**Detailed Summary of the Certified Seed Potatoes Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Certified Seed Potatoes Regulations*

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Certified Seed Potatoes Regulations*.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Scope of Application:**  
   This regulation applies specifically to *certified seed potatoes* that are imported into the country under **tariff item 7120-1**. This tariff classification typically refers to potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) used for seed purposes, distinguishing them from regular food-grade potatoes.

2. **Mandatory Tag Requirement:**  
   Every bag or other container holding certified seed potatoes must be accompanied by a **CERTIFIED SEED POTATOES tag**. This tag is not optional and is a legal requirement for compliance.

3. **Issuance of the Tag:**  
   The tag must be issued by the **proper authority** of the **state or district** in which the potatoes were originally grown. This ensures that the certification is locally verified and tied to the specific agricultural jurisdiction responsible for overseeing potato production and seed quality.

4. **Certification Content:**  
   The tag must certify that:
   - The potatoes were **grown specifically for use as seed**.
   - They have been **approved for use as seed** in accordance with the **official rules and regulations** of the **government of the country of production**.

5. **Purpose of Certification:**  
   The certification serves to ensure that:
   - The seed potatoes meet established standards for quality, disease freedom, and genetic purity.
   - They are suitable for propagation and will produce consistent, high-quality potato crops.
   - The origin and compliance with international or national seed standards are verifiable.

6. **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
   Failure to affix a valid, properly issued certified tag to each container of imported seed potatoes may result in penalties, rejection of the shipment, or other enforcement actions under applicable import laws.

**Interpretation and Implications:**

- The regulation emphasizes **traceability** and **accountability** in the seed potato supply chain.
- It establishes a link between the **country of origin** and the **certification authority**, ensuring that seed quality is maintained through official oversight.
- The requirement that the tag be issued by a local (state or district) authority implies a decentralized, regionally responsible certification system, which supports local agricultural standards and monitoring.
- The certification must reflect compliance with the **official rules and regulations** of the producing country, indicating that international standards or national seed programs are respected and enforced.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Certified Seed Potatoes Regulations* establish a mandatory requirement for all imported seed potatoes under tariff item 7120-1 to carry a certification tag issued by a local authority in the country of origin. This tag confirms that the potatoes were grown and approved specifically for use as seed, in compliance with the official rules of the producing nation. The regulation ensures the integrity, quality, and traceability of imported seed potatoes, protecting both domestic agriculture and the viability of future crop production.
