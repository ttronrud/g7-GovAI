**Detailed Summary of the Mayo Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Context**

The **Mayo Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in official gazettes to allow public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Grants the Minister of Transport, upon recommendation, the power to adopt proposed zoning regulations.

The proposed regulations were:
- Published in **two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I*** on **February 18 and 25, 1995**.
- Published in **two successive issues of *The Whitehorse Star*** on **February 23 and 24, 1995**.

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, businesses, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally enacted the regulations.

### **2. Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Mayo Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10  
- These regulations govern land use and development near Mayo Airport in the Yukon Territory.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Mayo Airport, located in the vicinity of Mayo, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport’s centerline of runway 06–24, 739 meters from the threshold of runway 06. Its elevation is **499.6 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 06–24), designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches. Each has a **1:40 slope** (1 meter rise per 40 meters horizontal distance). They rise to a horizontal line 3,000 meters from the runway end, 525 meters from the centerline, and 75 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 544.6 m above sea level), extending to the outer boundary of the regulated area. However, **if this plane is less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to ensure safety and practicality. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area associated with runway 06–24. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,598 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until they intersect with the outer surface. These ensure a smooth transition between the runway zone and the outer surface. |

### **4. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all land**, including public road allowances, that is:
  - Adjacent to or in the vicinity of Mayo Airport.
  - Specifically defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.
- The outer boundary of the regulated area is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This means that any development within this 4-kilometer radius is subject to the zoning restrictions.

---

### **5. Development Restrictions**

A core principle of these regulations is **flight safety**. No person may:

- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures),  
**if the highest point of such structure exceeds**:

1. The **approach surfaces**  
2. The **outer surface**  
3. The **transitional surfaces**

These restrictions ensure that:
- Aircraft can approach and land safely without interference from tall structures.
- Visual and navigational clarity is maintained for pilots.
- Obstruction of flight paths—especially during takeoff and landing—is prevented.

---

### **6. Regulatory Plan Reference**

All geometric and spatial elements (ARP, approach surfaces, strip, outer surface, transitional surfaces, and boundary) are derived from the **Mayo Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3028**, dated **March 28, 1994**. This plan serves as the official technical blueprint for the zoning boundaries and elevations.

### **7. Key Safety and Design Features**

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **1:40 Approach Surface Slope** | Ensures that any obstacle within the approach path is below the aircraft’s glide path, preventing collisions. |
| **3,000 m Horizontal Distance** | Defines the horizontal reach of the approach surface, ensuring adequate clearance for aircraft approaching from both ends of the runway. |
| **75 m Elevation at End of Runway** | Provides a buffer zone at the runway threshold to account for terrain variations and aircraft descent. |
| **45 m Above ARP (544.6 m above sea level)** | Sets a uniform ceiling for the outer surface, ensuring consistent clearance across the airport’s perimeter. |
| **1:7 Transitional Surface Slope** | Gradually reduces the height of structures as they move away from the runway, easing the transition from high-risk zones to less critical areas. |
| **4,000 m Radius Boundary** | Defines the maximum reach of the regulation, protecting the airport’s operational zone from distant developments. |

### **8. Practical Implications**

- **Height Restrictions**: Any new construction (e.g., towers, homes, wind turbines, communication masts) must remain **below the defined surfaces**.
- **Existing Structures**: Even existing buildings must comply with current height limits; if they exceed the surfaces, modifications or removals may be required.
- **Zoning Clarity**: The regulation provides clear, measurable, and publicly accessible boundaries, reducing ambiguity in land use decisions.
- **Public Safety and Aviation Efficiency**: The rules are designed to protect aviation operations, especially in a remote location like Mayo, where air access is critical for emergency services, tourism, and transportation.

---

### **9. Conclusion**

The **Mayo Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive and technically precise set of rules designed to:

- Protect aviation safety at Mayo Airport by limiting vertical obstructions near the runway and approach paths.
- Provide a transparent, legally enforceable framework based on established engineering standards and public consultation.
- Balance land use development with the need for safe flight operations in a remote northern environment.

By defining clear elevation limits and geometric boundaries using standardized slopes and distances, the regulations ensure that the airport remains a safe and functional hub for air travel in the Yukon Territory.

**In essence**: These regulations establish a "no-tall-objects" zone around Mayo Airport, with precise, science-based height restrictions that prevent any structure from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach—ensuring both safety and compliance with national aviation standards.
