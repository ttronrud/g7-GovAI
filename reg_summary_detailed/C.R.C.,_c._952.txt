**Detailed Summary of the Indian Band Election Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Band Election Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Regulations") provide a comprehensive framework governing the conduct of **band elections** under the *Indian Act* (the "Act"). These regulations establish procedures for the nomination, voting, and counting of candidates for positions such as **Chief** and **Councillors** of an Indigenous band. They apply to all elections except **accelerated elections**, which are governed by a separate provision in subsection 11.1(1) of the Act.

The Regulations are designed to ensure **fairness, transparency, accessibility, and accountability** in the democratic process of electing band leadership, particularly for communities with reserves that may span multiple electoral sections.

## **Interpretation of "Ordinarily Resident"**

This section provides a clear, detailed interpretation of residency for electors on reserves with multiple electoral sections:

- **General Rule**: Ordinary residence is determined by all relevant facts of the case.
- **Primary Determinant**: The place where a person **sleeps**, as this reflects the place of habitual habitation.
- **Exception**: Even if meals or employment are elsewhere, ordinary residence remains where one sleeps.
- **One Place Only**: A person can have only one place of ordinary residence at a time.
- **Stability**: Temporary absence (e.g., travel) does **not** change or terminate ordinary residence.

> This ensures that residency is not based solely on temporary stays or work locations, protecting the integrity of voting eligibility.

## **Application of the Regulations**

- **Sections 4 to 11** apply to **all elections except accelerated elections**.
- These sections cover the full electoral cycle: from voter list preparation to vote counting and election outcomes.

---

## **Pre-Election Requirements (At Least 79 Days Before Election)**

### 1. **Voter List Preparation**
- If the band has assumed control of its membership (under Section 10 of the Act), the band must provide the electoral officer with a **complete list of electors**.
- If the band’s membership list is maintained in the Department (under Section 11), the **Registrar** provides the list.

#### Content of the Voters List:
- **For reserves with more than one electoral section**:
  - Names of band members eligible to vote for **Chief** (in alphabetical order).
  - Names of band members eligible to vote for **Councillors** (in alphabetical order).
- **For a single electoral section**:
  - All elector names in alphabetical order.
  - Each elector’s **band membership or registry number**, or **date of birth** if no membership.

> The list must be accurate and up-to-date.

### 2. **Verification of Names**
- On request, the electoral officer or deputy may confirm whether a name appears on the voters list.

### 3. **Revision of the Voters List**
The electoral officer may revise the list if:
- An elector is **omitted**.
- An elector’s name is **incorrectly listed**.
- A person **not qualified to vote** is included.

#### How to Demonstrate:
- To prove **omission or error**:
  - Evidence that the person is on the Band List or entitled to be added.
  - The person is at least **18 years old**.
  - The person is **qualified to vote** in band elections.
- To prove **inclusion of an unqualified person**:
  - The person is **not on the Band List** and not entitled to be added.
  - The person is **under 18**.
  - The person is **not qualified to vote**.

> This ensures only eligible voters are included.

### 4. **Last Known Addresses**
- At least 79 days before the election, the band must provide the **last known addresses** of all electors who **do not reside on the reserve**.

---

## **Nomination Process (At Least 30 Days Before Nomination Meeting)**

### 1. **Notice of Nomination Meeting**
The electoral officer must:
- Post the notice and list of electors in **at least one conspicuous place** on the reserve.
- Mail the notice and a **voter declaration form** to every elector who does **not reside on the reserve**.

#### Content of the Notice:
- Date, time, duration, and location of the nomination meeting.
- Date and location of the election and all polling places.
- Name and phone number of the electoral officer.
- Statement that **voting by mail-in ballot is permitted**.
- Instructions on how to nominate or second a candidate.
- Statement that electors may **agree to have their address shared** with candidates.

### 2. **Record Keeping**
- The electoral officer must record:
  - Names of electors to whom the notice was mailed.
  - Their addresses.
  - The date the notice was sent.

---

## **Nomination Procedures**

### 1. **Methods of Nomination**
An elector may nominate or second a candidate in one of two ways:
- **Written nomination** delivered or mailed to the electoral officer **before** the nomination meeting.
- **Oral nomination** at the nomination meeting.

> Mailed nominations not received by the deadline are **void**.

### 2. **Secondments**
- If the same person receives **two written nominations** for the same office, the second one constitutes a **secondment** of the first.

### 3. **Seconding at the Meeting**
- Any eligible elector present may second a nomination.

### 4. **Open Duration**
- The nomination meeting must remain open for **at least three hours**.

### 5. **Outcomes at the End of the Meeting**
- If only **one person** is nominated for Chief → that person is **declared elected**.
- If the number of nominated councillors ≤ number to be elected → those persons are **declared elected**.
- If more than the required number are nominated → an **election will be held** on the date specified in the notice.

> This prevents acclamation from being used in cases where multiple candidates are nominated.

### 6. **Notification to Nominated Candidates**
- As soon as practicable, the electoral officer must notify any nominated candidates who were **not present** at the meeting.

---

## **Withdrawal of Nomination**

- A candidate may **withdraw** their nomination **before polls close** by submitting a **written withdrawal**, signed in the presence of:
  - The electoral officer,
  - A justice of the peace,
  - A notary public, or
  - A commissioner for oaths.

#### Special Rules:
- If a **councillor** withdraws **less than 48 hours** before polls open → their name **remains on the ballot**.
- If **any other candidate** withdraws **less than 37 days** before the election → their name remains on the ballot.
- If a candidate **dies before polls close** → they are considered to have withdrawn.

> These rules prevent last-minute withdrawals from invalidating the election or removing candidates from the ballot.

---

## **Acclamation of Candidates**

If the office of Chief and all councillor positions are filled by **acclamation** (i.e., no contest), then:

- The electoral officer must:
  - Post a notice on the reserve.
  - Mail the notice to every elector who does not reside on the reserve.
  - State the names of those acclaimed.
  - Declare that **no election will be held**.

> In such cases, **Sections 5 to 11 do not apply**, meaning the formal election process is bypassed.
