**Detailed Summary of the In-Transit Steel Goods Remission Order**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *In-Transit Steel Goods Remission Order* is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This authority is derived from **Section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)), which empowers the government to establish remission orders for certain taxes or surtaxes in specific circumstances.

This order is part of a broader framework established under the **Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods** (SOR/2018-206), which was originally introduced in 1997 (S.C. 1997, c. 36) and later amended to address modern trade and economic conditions.

---

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this remission order is to **provide relief from the surtax** imposed on certain steel goods that were **in transit to Canada prior to October 25, 2018**. The surtax was originally introduced to address concerns related to the importation of steel products, particularly those that may have been subject to trade imbalances or strategic supply chain considerations.

By granting remission, the government acknowledges that goods that were in transit before the specified date may have been subject to administrative or logistical complexities, and that a retroactive tax burden on these goods could create undue economic or operational hardship for importers or transit operators.

**Conditions for Remission**  

Remission of the surtax is **only granted under the following conditions**:

1. **Import Date Requirement**:  
   The steel goods must have been **imported into Canada on or after October 25, 2018**.  
   → This ensures that the remission applies only to goods that entered Canada after the critical date, allowing for a clear temporal boundary between pre- and post-October 2018 importation.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**:  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** within **two years of the date of importation**.  
   → This establishes a strict deadline to ensure timely administrative processing and to prevent prolonged or indefinite claims.  
   → The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is the designated authority responsible for processing these claims, which reflects the integration of customs and emergency preparedness responsibilities in Canada’s regulatory framework.

**Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies specifically to:
- The **surtax** imposed under the *Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods* (SOR/2018-206).
- Goods that were **in transit to Canada before October 25, 2018**.

This means that the tax relief is not retroactive to goods that entered Canada before that date, nor does it apply to goods that were not in transit. The policy targets only those goods that were moving through international channels and ultimately arrived in Canada after the cutoff date.

**Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
→ This ensures legal certainty and immediate applicability upon official publication, allowing importers and stakeholders to act accordingly.

**Key Implications and Considerations**  
- **Economic Relief**: Provides financial relief to importers who may have faced unexpected surtax liabilities due to goods being in transit prior to the October 25, 2018 threshold.
- **Administrative Clarity**: Sets clear eligibility criteria and deadlines to streamline claim processing and reduce disputes.
- **Policy Timing**: The cutoff date (October 25, 2018) appears to align with a significant policy or regulatory review period, possibly reflecting a shift in trade policy or economic strategy related to steel imports.
- **Enforcement and Compliance**: The two-year deadline for claim submission emphasizes the importance of timely action and may discourage late or informal claims.

**Conclusion**  
The *In-Transit Steel Goods Remission Order* is a targeted, time-bound regulatory measure designed to alleviate the financial burden of a surtax on steel goods that were in transit to Canada before October 25, 2018, and were subsequently imported after that date. It ensures fairness and administrative efficiency by setting clear eligibility conditions and deadlines for claim submission. The order reflects a balance between fiscal policy objectives and practical considerations in international trade operations.

This regulation is an example of how Canadian government bodies use targeted remission orders to correct or mitigate unintended tax consequences in specific trade scenarios.
