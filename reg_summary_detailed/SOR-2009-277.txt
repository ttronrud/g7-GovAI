**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Order Designating Ontario for the Purposes of the Criminal Interest Rate Provisions of the Criminal Code*

---

### **Background and Purpose:**

This regulation is a formal **government order** issued by the **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Industry) to implement specific provisions of the *Criminal Code of Canada*—specifically, **section 347.1**—in the province of **Ontario**.

The key objective of this order is to **designate Ontario as a jurisdiction where the criminal interest rate provisions of the Criminal Code apply**, even though Ontario already has its own legislative framework (the *Payday Loans Act, 2008*) that regulates payday lending and limits the total cost of borrowing.

This designation is significant because it allows the federal criminal interest rate law to **apply in Ontario**, meaning that **charging interest rates above a prescribed legal limit** in a payday loan context can constitute a **criminal offence**, even if the interest is not directly charged in a traditional loan agreement.

---

### **Legal Basis:**

- The order is made under **subsection 347.1(3)a** of the *Criminal Code* (R.S.C., c. C-46, s. 347.1).
- The *Criminal Code* contains provisions that criminalize the **charging of interest rates exceeding a certain threshold** in financial transactions, particularly those involving short-term, high-cost loans.
- Section 347.1(3)a allows the Governor in Council to **designate a province** for the purposes of applying these criminal interest rate provisions, thereby aligning provincial financial regulations with federal criminal law.

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Designation of Ontario:**
   - Ontario is officially designated as a province where **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code applies**.
   - This means that **any person who charges interest in excess of the legally permitted rate** in a payday loan agreement may be subject to criminal penalties under federal law.

2. **Conditions for Effectiveness:**
   - The order **does not come into force immediately**.
   - It only takes effect on the **first day** when **both of the following are in force**:
     - The *Payday Loans Act, 2008* (S.O. 2008, c. 9), **except for sections 52 and 66 to 74**.
     - *Ontario Regulation 98/09*, **except for sections 37 and 38**.
   - This ensures that the federal criminal interest rate law only applies when Ontario’s **provincial regulatory framework is fully operational** and in place, providing a consistent and enforceable system of financial regulation.

3. **Exclusions in the Applicable Legislation:**
   - The *Payday Loans Act, 2008* and *Regulation 98/09* are **exempted from certain sections**:
     - **Sections 52 and 66 to 74 of the Payday Loans Act** are excluded — these sections likely deal with specific administrative or procedural matters (e.g., licensing, disclosure, or enforcement) and are not relevant to the criminal interest rate provisions.
     - **Sections 37 and 38 of Regulation 98/09** are excluded — these may relate to specific borrower protections or disclosure requirements and are not directly tied to interest rate limits.

---

### **Effective Date:**

- The order came into force on **December 15, 2009**.
- This date marks the first day when both the *Payday Loans Act, 2008* and *Regulation 98/09* (excluding the specified sections) were in full effect.

---

### **Significance and Implications:**

1. **Harmonization of Federal and Provincial Law:**
   - This order ensures that **Ontario’s financial regulation system** is aligned with **federal criminal standards** for interest rate abuse.
   - It strengthens enforcement against predatory lending practices by making **excessive interest rates a criminal offence**, not just a civil violation.

2. **Protection of Consumers:**
   - Payday loans are often associated with high interest rates and exploitative practices.
   - By applying criminal penalties for excessive interest, the regulation **protects vulnerable borrowers** from being overcharged or trapped in cycles of debt.

3. **Criminal Liability for Lenders:**
   - Any individual or entity (e.g., lenders, loan brokers, financial institutions) who charges interest above the legal limit in a payday loan may face **criminal charges**, including fines or imprisonment, under the *Criminal Code*.

4. **Provincial Regulatory Framework as a Foundation:**
   - The requirement that both the Act and Regulation be in force ensures that the federal criminal provisions are only activated in a **legally sound and consumer-protected environment**.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a **strong legal framework** to prevent predatory lending in Ontario by combining **provincial consumer protection laws** with **federal criminal penalties** for charging excessive interest. It reflects a proactive approach to financial regulation and consumer safety, ensuring that payday lending remains fair, transparent, and legally constrained.

The designation of Ontario under section 347.1 of the *Criminal Code* is a significant step in strengthening the province’s ability to combat high-cost lending and protect individuals from financial exploitation.

**Note:** This order is a **temporary, conditional designation** that only activates when Ontario’s specific legislative and regulatory framework is fully operational. It does not replace provincial laws but rather **enhances them** by introducing federal criminal sanctions for interest rate violations.
