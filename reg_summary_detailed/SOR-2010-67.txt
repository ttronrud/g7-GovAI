The *Wapusk National Park of Canada Park Use Regulations*, made under **section 16 and 17 of the Canada National Parks Act**, establish specific rules governing the use of Wapusk National Park in Manitoba. These regulations are designed to balance the protection of the park’s ecological integrity with the preservation of traditional Indigenous activities, particularly those related to resource harvesting, including hunting, trapping, and gathering. The regulations define key terms, outline permitted activities, set restrictions on access and use, and establish a framework for permitting, enforcement, and accountability.
