## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

On August 22, 1961, the Canadian government, by proclamation under Section 22 of the *Penitentiary Act*, officially designated three tracts of land as federal penitentiary lands. These include: (1) Field 13 at the Dominion Experimental Farm in Agassiz, BC (5.48 acres); (2) a parcel within the Camp Petawawa Reserve in Ontario (32.75 acres), bounded by railway and creek features; and (3) the South Half of Lots 27 and 28 in Quebec, including Lac Leblanc (200 acres). Each area is now formally recognized as a correctional facility — Agassiz, Petawawa, and Gatineau Correctional Camps — and is to be used for penitentiary operations. The proclamation serves as a legal and public notice, affirming federal control over these lands and their future use in the Canadian correctional system.

## 📚 Notes for Further Research

- The original *Penitentiary Act* (1952) was part of a broader reform movement in Canadian penal policy.
- These camps may have been established during a period of increased focus on rehabilitation over punishment.
- The Gatineau site, now largely repurposed, may have been used for short-term detention or specialized programs.
- Today, many of these facilities have been closed or restructured; Agassiz and Petawawa are no longer active as correctional camps.
