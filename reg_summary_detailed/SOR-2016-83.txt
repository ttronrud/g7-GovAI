**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Upper Fraser River Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
April 21, 2016  
Issued in Ottawa, Canada

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)* – S.C. 2002, c. 29  
Specifically, subsections 58(4) and 58(5), and subsection 58(1)

---

### **Background and Rationale**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*) Upper Fraser River population is officially designated as an **endangered species** under *Part 2 of Schedule 1* to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification reflects the species’ high risk of extinction in the wild due to habitat loss, degradation, and other threats.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal recovery strategy for this population was developed and approved by the Government of Canada. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.  
   This identified critical habitat has been officially **registered in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, making it publicly accessible and legally recognized.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas:**  
   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat** specified in this Order falls within areas referenced in **subsection 58(2)** of SARA.  
   Subsection 58(2) of SARA generally prohibits certain activities (such as development or alteration) in critical habitat unless authorized. By confirming that the critical habitat is not located in a place subject to specific prohibitions under that subsection, the government ensures that this Order can be implemented without conflicting with other legal constraints.

### **Legal Authority**

The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFOD) issued this Order **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Subsection 58(4)**: Grants the Minister the authority to designate critical habitat for a species listed under SARA.
- **Subsection 58(5)**: Requires that the designation be based on the recovery strategy and must be made publicly available.

This Order legally defines and confirms the **specific geographic areas** (annexed to the Order) that constitute the critical habitat for the White Sturgeon (Upper Fraser River population).

### **Scope and Application**

- **Applicability of Subsection 58(1):**  
  Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of this species. This means that **any activity that destroys, degrades, or otherwise interferes with the critical habitat** is prohibited unless authorized under a permit or exemption.

- **Critical Habitat Definition:**  
  The Order formally identifies and delineates the **geographic boundaries** of the critical habitat. These areas are essential for the species’ survival, including features such as spawning grounds, nursery areas, and migration corridors in the Upper Fraser River system.

- **Public Registry:**  
  The critical habitat designation is publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, ensuring transparency and enabling stakeholders (including Indigenous communities, researchers, industry, and the public) to understand where protection is required.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Government of Canada. This typically occurs within a few days of its publication in the *Canada Gazette*, making it legally enforceable immediately upon registration.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Conservation and Recovery:**  
  This Order is a key step in the recovery of the endangered White Sturgeon population. By legally protecting critical habitat, it helps preserve the ecological conditions necessary for reproduction, growth, and migration.

- **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
  The designation enables regulatory enforcement to prevent activities (e.g., dam construction, mining, land development, pollution) that could harm or degrade the habitat.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
  The public availability of the Order promotes collaboration with Indigenous groups, conservation organizations, and industry to develop co-management plans and sustainable practices.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation legally designates and protects the critical habitat of the endangered White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Upper Fraser River population under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with legal requirements, and ensures that essential ecological areas are preserved to support the species’ long-term survival. The Order is a critical tool in Canada’s broader biodiversity conservation strategy and reflects the government’s commitment to protecting endangered species and their habitats.
