**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**

**Statutory Authority:**  
Section 7(2) of *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)* — Made under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act*, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence and the Treasury Board.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation addresses and remedies overpayments that occurred in the Canadian Forces between **December 1, 1977**, and **December 31, 1994**, specifically involving members who were **reclassified from the general service officer (GSO) military classification to the pilot classification**. 

The primary objective is to **remit (i.e., refund) overpaid amounts**—including pay, allowances, annuities, or other benefits—resulting from an incorrect calculation of incentive pay during the reclassification process. It also extends to **beneficiaries** (such as dependents or survivors) who received excess death benefits or allowances due to the same error.

### **Key Provisions and Scope**

#### **1. Eligibility Criteria for Overpayment Remission**

- **Eligible Individuals**: Members of the Canadian Forces who:
  - Were **reclassified from the general service officer (GSO) classification to the pilot classification**.
  - Made the reclassification during the period: **December 1, 1977, to December 31, 1994**.

- **Cause of Overpayment**: 
  - The member received **pay, allowances, and/or benefits** (including annuities or other retirement benefits under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act*) that were **greater than what would have been paid** if the incentive pay had been correctly calculated according to the *Canadian Forces Administrative Order* governing transfers to pilot military occupation.

> This means the overpayment stemmed from a **misapplication of incentive pay rules** during the transition from GSO to pilot status.

#### **2. Remission of Excess Payments**

- The regulation **grants remission** (a formal refund) of the **excess amount** paid to eligible members.
- This includes:
  - Excess **pay and allowances**.
  - Excess **annuities or other benefits** under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act*.
- The remission applies **to the actual amount of the overpayment**, not a percentage or fixed sum.

#### **3. Interest on Remitted Amounts**

- Any **interest** that accrued on the overpayment during the period it was incorrectly paid is **also included** in the remission.
- This ensures that beneficiaries are not left with a financial burden due to delayed correction of the error.

#### **4. Extension to Beneficiaries (Death Benefits)**

- If a **person (such as a spouse, child, or other beneficiary)** received **death benefits or allowances** under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* that were in excess of what would have been paid had the incentive pay been correctly calculated under the pilot transfer rules:
  - The **excess amount is also remitted** to that person.
  - Interest on the excess amount, if any, is also included in the remission.

> This provision protects not only the service member but also their dependents or survivors who may have been financially impacted by the overpayment.

### **Legal and Administrative Basis**

- The regulation is enacted under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Minister of National Defence and the Treasury Board) to make orders to **remedy overpayments** in the public interest.
- The use of this authority reflects a commitment to **financial accountability and fairness** in military compensation systems.
- The decision is based on a **public interest rationale**, indicating that correcting past errors in pay calculations serves broader goals of transparency, equity, and trust in the Canadian Armed Forces’ financial administration.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Historical Correction**: Addresses a specific administrative error in military personnel classification and pay calculation that occurred over 16 years.
- **Equity and Fairness**: Ensures that members who were reclassified to pilot roles (a higher-earning, specialized occupation) did not receive benefits that were not justified by the correct incentive pay rules.
- **Beneficiary Protection**: Extends financial correction to dependents and survivors, ensuring that the error did not disproportionately affect families.
- **Administrative Clarity**: Provides a clear, legally grounded mechanism for remission, reducing ambiguity in claims and administrative processing.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a **corrective measure** to rectify overpayments made to Canadian Forces members and their beneficiaries due to a misapplication of incentive pay rules during reclassifications from general service officer to pilot roles between 1977 and 1994. It ensures that those who were overpaid—whether directly or through death benefits—receive a formal refund, including any interest, thereby restoring financial equity and upholding public trust in the integrity of military compensation systems.

It stands as a key example of how financial oversight and administrative corrections can be implemented in a structured, lawful, and compassionate manner within the Canadian public service.
