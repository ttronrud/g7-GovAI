**Detailed Summary of the General Brokering Permit No. 1 (S.C. 2018, c. 26, s. 8; R.S., c. E-19)**  
*Issued by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ottawa, June 17, 2019*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
This regulation establishes **General Brokering Permit No. 1**, issued under **section 7.1(2)(a)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA). It provides a streamlined authorization for individuals or organizations to act as brokers in the importation of certain goods and technologies listed in **Group 2 of the Export Control List** — specifically those subject to export controls due to their potential dual-use (civil and military applications) or strategic significance.

The permit enables authorized brokers to facilitate transactions involving such goods and technologies, provided they meet specific conditions related to end-use, compliance reporting, and recordkeeping.

---

### **2. Definitions**

- **Eligible Country**:  
  A list of 32 countries that are eligible for the importation of controlled goods and technologies under this permit. These include:
  - Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

  > *Note:* This list is defined as "pays admissible," meaning the goods may be imported into these countries for end-use within them, without requiring additional government approval under this permit.

- **Export Controls Operations Division (ECOD)**:  
  The division within the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) responsible for administering and enforcing Canada’s export control regulations. Brokers must communicate directly with ECOD as required by the permit.

---

### **3. Scope of Authorization**

Under this permit, **any person or organization** may broker:

#### a) Goods or technologies listed in Group 2 of the Export Control List  
- **Condition**: The goods or technology must be imported into an **eligible country** for **end-use within that country**.

#### b) Goods or technologies for end-use by the Government of Canada  
- **Condition**: The goods or technology must be intended for use by the Government of Canada (e.g., defense, security, or national infrastructure projects).

> **Important Limitation**:  
> Subsection 2(1) **does NOT authorize** brokering of goods referenced in **section 4.1 of the EIPA** (which typically refers to items related to firearms or explosives) unless:
> - The **country of end-use** AND **all transit countries** are listed on the **Automatic Firearms Country Control List (AFCCL)**.

This ensures that firearm-related items are subject to stricter international controls and only permitted when all relevant countries involved are on the approved list.

---

### **4. Mandatory Reporting and Information Requirements**

Brokers must provide **detailed written information** to the Export Controls Operations Division **before** engaging in any brokering activity during a calendar year.

#### Required Information (to be submitted in writing):
1. **Broker’s Personal Details**:
   - Full name, address, telephone number, email address, and fax number.

2. **If a Corporation**:
   - Business number assigned by the Minister of National Revenue.
   - Name and contact details (address, phone, email, fax) of a designated contact person.

> *Purpose*: To ensure accountability and traceability of all broker activities.

---

### **5. Periodic Reporting Requirements**

Brokers must submit a **detailed report** to ECOD within **30 days** after each six-month period ending on:
- **June 30**
- **December 31**

#### Report Must Include:
- Whether brokering occurred during the period.
- If brokering did occur:
  - Name, address, phone, email, and fax of:
    - The **seller** of goods/technology
    - The **buyer** of goods/technology
    - Any **other brokers, agents, or mandataries** involved
  - For each transaction:
    - Reference to the relevant **Brokering Control List** and the **item number** assigned in the *Guide to the Export Control List*
    - A **detailed, accurate description** of the good or technology:
      - Must clearly describe its **purpose and technical specifications**
      - Must avoid trade names, technical jargon, or vague terms that could obscure its true nature
    - **Quantity**, **total value**, and **unit value** (in Canadian dollars), grouped by **country of end-use**
    - A **detailed description** of the brokering activities conducted (e.g., coordination, negotiation, documentation)

> **Exception**:  
> A person or organization that provides the required information for the **six-month period ending December 31** is **not required** to submit a report for the **preceding six-month period** (i.e., the period ending June 30). This provides flexibility for those who complete their annual registration late.

---

### **6. Recordkeeping Obligations**

All brokers must **retain records** for **six years** after the year in which a transaction was brokered.

#### Records Must Include:
- Date (if any) when the goods or technology **moved from the country of export**
- Contact details of:
  - Seller
  - Buyer
  - Any other brokers or agents involved
- For each item:
  - Reference to the **Brokering Control List** and **item number**

---

### **7. Effective Date**

The permit comes into force on the day that **section 8 of S.C. 2018, c. 26** (the amendment to the *Export and Import Permits Act*) comes into effect.

> If the permit is **registered later**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

This aligns the permit with broader legislative changes made in 2018, including amendments to support Canada’s accession to the **Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)** and other export control reforms.

---

### **8. Key Regulatory Context and Implications**

- **Regulatory Framework**: This permit operates within the broader framework of Canada’s **Export and Import Permits Act** and the **Export Control List (ECL)**, which classifies goods and technologies based on their potential for misuse (e.g., in weapons, cyber, or dual-use applications).
- **Dual-Use Goods**: Group 2 of the ECL includes items with both civilian and military applications (e.g., advanced sensors, software, or components used in drones or communications systems).
- **Compliance Focus**: The regulation emphasizes **transparency**, **accountability**, and **traceability** through mandatory reporting and record retention. This helps prevent the diversion of controlled items to unauthorized or prohibited end-uses.
- **International Alignment**: By allowing brokering to eligible countries and restricting firearm-related brokering to countries on the AFCCL, the permit reflects Canada’s commitment to international arms control norms and the **Arms Trade Treaty**.
