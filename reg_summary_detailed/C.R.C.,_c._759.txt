**Detailed Summary of the Domestic Wine Spirits Remission Order**

**Title:**  
Domestic Wine Spirits Remission Order

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Domestic Wine Spirits Remission Order*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to provide a remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of excise duty for certain spirits used in the treatment or processing of domestic wine. Specifically, it grants a legal exemption from the excise duty that would otherwise be imposed and levied under the Excise Act.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Exemption from Excise Duty:**  
   The excise duty specified in subsection 1(1) of Part I of the Schedule to the Excise Act—which is typically imposed on the production, manufacture, or sale of spirits—is hereby *remitted* (forgiven or waived) in specific circumstances.

2. **Applicable Spirits:**  
   The exemption applies to *spirits* that are used in the *treatment of domestic wine*. This implies that the spirits are not being sold or consumed directly, but rather are being used as a processing agent or ingredient in the refinement, clarification, or stabilization of wine produced domestically.

3. **Time Limitation:**  
   The exemption is only available for spirits used *after September 18, 1975*. This establishes a clear temporal boundary—any use prior to this date is outside the scope of this remission.

4. **Place of Use:**  
   The spirits must be used in a *bonded manufactory*. A bonded manufactory is a facility where goods are stored under customs supervision, often for the purpose of manufacturing or processing, and where excise duties may be deferred or managed under specific regulatory conditions. This ensures that the use of the spirits is conducted in a controlled, regulated environment.

5. **Legal Basis:**  
   The remission is authorized under *Section 187 of the Excise Act*, which empowers the relevant authority (typically the Excise Commissioner or equivalent) to grant exemptions from excise duties in specified circumstances, including for industrial or domestic processing purposes.

**Interpretation and Implications:**

- The remission is not a general exemption for all spirits or all wine-related activities. It is narrowly tailored to:
  - Spirits used specifically in the treatment of *domestic wine*.
  - Use occurring *after September 18, 1975*.
  - Within a *bonded manufactory*, indicating a formal, regulated production environment.

- The exemption likely serves to:
  - Support the domestic wine industry by reducing production costs.
  - Encourage the use of domestically produced spirits in wine processing, thereby promoting local manufacturing and reducing reliance on imported spirits.
  - Align with broader policy goals of protecting domestic industries and supporting agricultural or beverage manufacturing sectors.

---

**Limitations and Exclusions:**

- The remission does *not* extend to:
  - Spirits used in non-domestic wine treatment.
  - Spirits used before September 18, 1975.
  - Spirits used outside of a bonded manufactory.
  - Spirits used for any purpose other than the treatment of domestic wine.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Domestic Wine Spirits Remission Order* provides a targeted exemption from excise duty for spirits used in the processing of domestic wine within bonded manufactories, effective from September 18, 1975, onward. This regulation supports the domestic wine industry by reducing the financial burden of processing, while maintaining regulatory oversight through the requirement of use in bonded facilities. It reflects a policy of encouraging domestic production and industrial use of locally manufactured spirits in the context of beverage processing.
