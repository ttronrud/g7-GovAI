### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Authority and Legal Basis**  
   - The designation is made under **paragraph 11(2)(a)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA).  
   - This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) the power to designate individuals as "deputy heads" of federal departments or agencies.  
   - The purpose of this power is to ensure effective governance, administrative oversight, and leadership structure within federal institutions.

2. **Subject of the Designation**  
   - The individual designated is the **Deputy Minister of the Department of Indigenous Services Canada**.  
   - This role is a senior leadership position within the department, responsible for supporting the Minister in the administration and delivery of Indigenous services.

3. **Designation as Deputy Head**  
   - The Deputy Minister is formally recognized as the **deputy head** of the Department of Indigenous Services Canada.  
   - This designation confers formal leadership authority and responsibility, including oversight of departmental operations, policy implementation, budget management, and strategic direction—particularly in the absence of the Minister or in a shared leadership model.

4. **Effective Date**  
   - The designation becomes effective on **November 30, 2017**.  
   - This means that from that date onward, the Deputy Minister holds the official title and responsibilities of deputy head under the structure of the federal government.

5. **Context and Purpose**

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This regulation is a **formal administrative order**, not a new law, but rather an implementation of existing statutory authority.  
- It reflects the federal government’s commitment to structured governance within departments, especially those dealing with culturally sensitive and complex issues such as Indigenous rights and reconciliation.  
- The designation does not create new powers or responsibilities beyond those already assigned to the Deputy Minister; it formalizes their role within the department’s leadership hierarchy.

### **Note on Date and Source**

- The regulation cites **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 8**, which is the *Financial Administration Act* as amended and enacted in 2003.  
- The section (s. 8) likely refers to the provision that enables the Governor General in Council to designate deputy heads.  
- The reference to **R.S., c. F-11** confirms that the Financial Administration Act is the governing statute.
