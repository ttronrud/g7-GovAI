### **Detailed Summary of the CHFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.  
This authority is derived from **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (a primary federal statute governing customs duties and trade regulations in Canada).  

This means that the Governor General, as the formal head of state, is empowered to make regulations based on the recommendations of the Minister of Finance, specifically in relation to trade rules under the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement (CHFTA).

#### **2. Regulatory Purpose**
These regulations establish and implement the **Rules of Origin** under the **Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement (CHFTA)**.  
Rules of origin determine which goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment under a free trade agreement by specifying the **national origin requirements**—that is, whether a product is "produced" or "manufactured" in a member country (Canada or Honduras) to be eligible for duty-free or reduced-duty treatment.

#### **3. Provisions with Force of Law**
The following provisions of the CHFTA are incorporated into Canadian law and have **full legal force and effect** in Canada:

- **Articles 4.1 to 4.3**:  
  These articles establish the general framework for rules of origin, including definitions of "originating goods," the principle of **substantial transformation**, and the **requirement of a minimum level of value addition** in the production process to qualify as originating.

- **Paragraph 1 of Article 4.4**:  
  This provision outlines the **rules for the treatment of goods originating in both Canada and Honduras**, particularly in cases involving **combined production** or **production in one country followed by processing in another**. It may include provisions for the **use of regional value content** or **production chain analysis**.

- **Articles 4.5 to 4.13**:  
  These articles contain the **detailed rules of origin** for specific product categories. For example:
  - Rules for **manufactured goods** (e.g., machinery, vehicles, textiles)
  - Rules for **agricultural and food products**
  - Rules for **processed goods** and **intermediate products**
  - Rules for **goods that undergo partial processing** or **assembly**
  - Rules for **duty-free treatment of certain components or subassemblies**

- **Annexes 4.1 and 4.5**:  
  These annexes provide **specific, product-specific rules of origin** that are tailored to certain industries or product types.  
  - **Annex 4.1** may contain detailed rules for **specific product categories** (e.g., automotive parts, electronics, textiles)  
  - **Annex 4.5** may include **exemptions, exceptions, or special rules** for certain goods or production methods (e.g., goods subject to specific thresholds or value content requirements)

These provisions are legally binding in Canada and must be followed by customs authorities when determining whether goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the CHFTA.

#### **4. Effective Date**
The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 43 of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.  
- This section is the legislative provision that **enables the implementation of the CHFTA** in Canadian law.  
- The effective date of the regulations is **October 1, 2014**, as referenced in the note.

**Exception**:  
If the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after October 1, 2014**, they will instead come into force on the **date of registration**.

This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely manner and are not delayed due to administrative processing.

#### **5. Reference to Official Gazette**
The regulation is referenced in **Supplement 2014-74 (SI/2014-74)**, which is the official **Statutory Instrument** (regulation) published in the *Canada Gazette*. This confirms that the rules were formally adopted and published in the official legal record.

### **Key Implications of the Regulation**

- **Tariff Benefits**: Canadian exporters and importers can benefit from **duty-free or reduced-duty treatment** for goods that meet the rules of origin, provided they are produced in Canada or Honduras and meet the required value-added thresholds.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Businesses must ensure that their goods meet the **origin criteria** defined in Articles 4.1–4.13 and the annexes to determine eligibility for preferential treatment.
- **Customs Enforcement**: Canadian customs authorities will apply these rules when assessing whether goods qualify as "originating" under the CHFTA.
- **Transparency and Clarity**: The detailed annexes provide clear, product-specific guidance to help businesses understand how to meet origin requirements.

### **Conclusion**
The **CHFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** are a critical component of Canada’s trade policy with Honduras. They legally codify the origin rules of the Canada–Honduras Free Trade Agreement, enabling Canadian businesses to access preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in either Canada or Honduras. The regulations, effective from **October 1, 2014**, provide a clear, enforceable framework for determining origin, ensuring consistency and fairness in trade policy implementation.
