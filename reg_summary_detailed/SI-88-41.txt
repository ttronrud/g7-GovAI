1. **Department**  
   Refers to the *Department of Fisheries and Oceans* (ministère).

2. **Direct Costs**  
   Includes all personnel, operating, and capital expenses directly attributable to providing a *special service* by the Department. These are costs that can be clearly linked to a specific service delivery.

3. **Government of Canada**  
   Defined as having the same meaning as "Department" under Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act — essentially, the federal government as a whole.

4. **Indirect Costs**  
   Costs not directly tied to a service but still attributable to its provision. These include shared overheads such as administrative support, utilities, or general management costs that are allocated to the service.

5. **Minister**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.

6. **Person**  
   Broadly defined to include:
   - Partnerships
   - Corporations
   - Universities
   - Other government entities *excluding* the Government of Canada itself.

7. **Special Service**  
   Any service, information, or use of equipment or facilities provided by the Department to a person related to:
   - Fishing industry infrastructure
   - Fisheries resource development and protection
   - Fisheries enhancement and support
   - Aquaculture support
   - Inspections
   - Charts and navigation
   - Oceanographic and marine science
   - Laboratories
   - Vessels
   - Hatcheries

8. **Whole Cost**  
   The total cost of providing a special service, calculated as the **sum of direct costs and indirect costs**.

### **Core Authorization and Fee Setting Principles**

#### **Section 3 – Full Cost Recovery (Whole Cost)**
- The Minister is authorized to prescribe a fee or charge **equal to the whole cost** of providing a special service to a person, **subject to the following conditions**:
  - The fee must not have a **serious detrimental effect** on the income of the service user.
  - The fee must not **reduce the use of the service** to an extent that undermines the **objective of providing the service** (e.g., ensuring access to vital marine data or inspection capabilities).
  - There is **no equivalent or similar commercial service** available in the market.

> This means that when all conditions are met, the Department can charge the full cost of providing the service — both direct and indirect — to ensure full cost recovery and sustainability.

#### **Section 4 – Partial Cost Recovery (Part of Whole Cost)**
- The Minister may prescribe a fee or charge **equal to only part of the whole cost** in **one or more of the following circumstances**:
  1. **Serious Detrimental Effect on User Income**  
     If charging the full cost would severely harm the financial viability of the user (e.g., a small fishing business or rural community).
  2. **Reduction in Service Use**  
     If full cost recovery would lead to a significant drop in service utilization, thereby undermining the service’s purpose (e.g., reduced access to scientific data or vessel inspections).
  3. **Availability of a Commercial Equivalent**  
     If a similar service is already available commercially at a lower or more accessible price.

> In such cases, the Minister must ensure:
> - **In circumstances (a) and (b)**: The fee should represent the **highest possible level of partial cost recovery** that is still acceptable given the constraints.
> - **In circumstance (c)**: The fee must be set **equal to the commercial rate** for the equivalent or similar service offered in the private market.

> This ensures fairness, affordability, and market alignment when a commercial alternative exists.

### **Special Provision for Registered Charities**

- The Minister may **waive** any prescribed fee or charge for a **special service provided to a registered charity**, as defined under the *Income Tax Act*.
- This provision recognizes the non-profit nature of charities and their critical role in supporting community-based fisheries, environmental protection, or education initiatives.

> The waiver is discretionary and applies only to registered charities, not to other types of organizations.

### **Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Recovery & Financial Sustainability** | Ensures the Department can maintain and fund essential services through appropriate fee structures. |
| **Equity and Accessibility** | Prevents overburdening vulnerable users (e.g., small businesses, rural operators) by allowing partial recovery when needed. |
| **Service Availability and Purpose** | Protects the core mission of the Department by preventing service underuse due to unaffordable fees. |
| **Market Alignment** | Encourages fair competition by aligning fees with commercial market rates when alternatives exist. |
| **Support for Non-Profit Sectors** | Provides financial access for charities involved in fisheries and marine conservation. |

### **Legal and Administrative Framework**

- The regulation operates under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which grants the federal government the power to establish fees for services provided by departments.
- The Minister has **discretionary authority** to set fees based on cost and policy considerations, but must justify decisions, especially when deviating from full cost recovery.
- All prescribed fees must be **transparent, reasonable, and clearly justified** in accordance with the terms outlined in the schedule.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **flexible, balanced, and principle-based framework** for fee-setting within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It allows for:

- Full cost recovery when the service is essential, widely used, and no viable commercial alternative exists.
- Partial cost recovery or fee waivers when users are financially vulnerable, service access is at risk, or commercial alternatives are available.

By balancing **financial sustainability** with **equity, accessibility, and service effectiveness**, the regulation ensures that the Department can maintain critical fisheries and marine services while remaining responsive to the needs of diverse stakeholders — including small operators, researchers, and charitable organizations.

This approach supports both **efficient public spending** and **inclusive access** to essential marine resources and services.
