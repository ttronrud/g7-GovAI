### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation is a targeted exemption issued under Section 76 of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA). Its purpose is to provide temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements that would otherwise apply to activities involving the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) — specifically, the Alberta population — when that population is added to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*.

Under SARA, species listed as at risk are protected from activities that could harm or threaten their survival. However, the Act also includes provisions to allow for reasonable exceptions in specific circumstances — such as when certain fishing or access activities are essential for public use or economic reasons — provided that those activities do not compromise the species’ recovery.

This exemption is designed to balance conservation goals with the practical realities of existing fisheries management and public access, particularly in Alberta.

### **Key Provisions of the Exemption**

Section 32 of SARA generally prohibits activities that could harm or interfere with a listed species. However, this Order **exempts specific licences, authorizations, and documents** from that prohibition **for a period of one year**, beginning on the date the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Alberta population) is formally added to Schedule 1 of SARA (the List of Wildlife Species at Risk).

The exemption applies **only to the following**:

1. **The Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**  
   – To the extent that they authorize **sportfishing** involving the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Alberta population).  
   – This means that sportfishing activities targeting or in areas where WCT are present are **not subject to the prohibitions under Section 32 of SARA** during the one-year exemption period.

2. **Licences issued under subsection 13(3) of the Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**  
   – These are specific fishing licences that may have been issued for certain types of fishing (e.g., for sport or recreation) related to the WCT.  
   – The exemption allows these licences to remain valid and enforceable, even though the species is now listed as at risk.

3. **The National Parks of Canada Fishing Regulations**  
   – To the extent that they authorize **fishing** activities involving the Westslope Cutthroat Trout.  
   – This means that fishing activities in National Parks of Canada that would otherwise be restricted under SARA are temporarily exempted during the one-year period.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Applicability:** The exemption applies **only** to the **Alberta population** of the Westslope Cutthroat Trout.  
- **Duration:** The exemption is **limited to one year** from the date the species is added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.  
- **Exclusions:** The exemption does **not** extend to:
  - Commercial fishing.
  - Activities involving habitat degradation.
  - Any other species not specifically identified.
  - Prohibitions related to the species’ protection in terms of breeding, migration, or habitat conservation.
- **Conditions:** The exemption is conditional upon the species being added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk. If the species is later reclassified or removed, the exemption would no longer apply.

---

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Conservation vs. Public Access:** This Order reflects a balance between protecting a species at risk and allowing continued public access to recreational fishing, which is a significant cultural and economic activity in Alberta and within Canada’s national parks.
- **Temporary Nature:** The one-year timeframe ensures that the exemption is not permanent and allows for monitoring of the species’ status and the impact of fishing activities on its recovery.
- **Regulatory Flexibility:** It demonstrates the flexibility built into SARA to allow for practical implementation of conservation measures while respecting existing regulatory frameworks.

### **Conclusion**

This Exemption Order is a carefully crafted regulatory measure that temporarily suspends the application of Section 32 of the *Species at Risk Act* to specific fishing authorizations and regulations involving the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Alberta population). It enables continued sportfishing under existing licence frameworks for one year, while ensuring that the species remains under formal protection and monitoring. The Order underscores the importance of adaptive management in species conservation, allowing for both ecological protection and public engagement in sustainable stewardship.  

**Note:** The Order is not a waiver of conservation obligations but rather a temporary exception to ensure that existing fishing activities do not become a barrier to the species’ recovery. Long-term recovery strategies will still require habitat protection, population monitoring, and potential future restrictions as the species’ status is evaluated.
