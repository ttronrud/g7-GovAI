### **Detailed Summary of the Proof of Origin of Imported Goods Regulations**

This regulation establishes the rules governing the **proof of origin** of imported goods in Canada, particularly in relation to **tariff treatment**—including preferential tariffs such as the General Preferential Tariff (GPT), Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN), and various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) like NAFTA, CIFTA, CEFTA, and CJFTA.

The regulation is **not required to be published under normal procedures** because it gives effect to a public announcement made on **October 27, 1997**, as permitted by **paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a of the Customs Act**. This means it is considered a "proposed regulation" that was already formally announced, and thus falls outside the standard publication requirement under subsection 164(3).

---

## **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- The regulation provides **specific procedures for proving the country of origin** of imported goods when such proof is required under **section 35.1 of the Customs Act**.
- It applies to all goods imported into Canada where **preferential tariff treatment** is claimed (e.g., under GPT, MFN, or various FTA agreements).
- It outlines **exemptions** and **alternative forms of documentation** that may be used to satisfy the origin requirement, depending on the type of goods, value, and trade agreement involved.
