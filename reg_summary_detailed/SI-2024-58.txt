### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Nature of the Change**
This regulation constitutes a **transfer of ministerial responsibilities** within the Canadian federal government. Specifically:
- The **powers, duties, and functions** originally assigned to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** are being **transferred** to the **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)**.

#### 2. **Legal Authority**
The transfer is authorized under:
- **Paragraph 2(a)a of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (PSRTDA)**.
  - This provision allows the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to reassign or transfer functions and responsibilities among federal ministers, particularly in the public service context.
  - It provides a formal mechanism for restructuring ministerial portfolios to improve efficiency, accountability, or administrative effectiveness.

#### 3. **Subject Matter of the Transfer**
The specific functions being transferred are those outlined in **Section 7 of the Emergency Management Act (EMA)**.
- Section 7 of the EMA typically grants the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness **primary responsibility for the coordination, oversight, and implementation of emergency management activities** across Canada.
- This includes responsibilities such as:
  - Developing and implementing national emergency management policies
  - Coordinating intergovernmental and interdepartmental responses during emergencies
  - Overseeing emergency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts
  - Establishing and managing the federal emergency management framework (e.g., through the Canadian Emergency Management League or the National Emergency Management System)

#### 4. **Receiving Minister**
- The **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)** now assumes these responsibilities.
- This reflects a **decentralization or functional specialization** of emergency preparedness functions, with the Minister of State acting as a senior official with focused authority in this domain.
- The Minister of State typically has **supporting or delegated authority**, but may not have the full scope of powers of the full Minister (e.g., budgetary or policy-setting authority), depending on the structure of the department.

#### 5. **Purpose and Rationale**
The transfer likely aims to:
- Improve **accountability and focus** on emergency preparedness by assigning it to a dedicated ministerial role.
- Enhance **operational efficiency** by aligning ministerial responsibilities with specific policy domains.
- Allow the **Minister of Public Safety** to focus on broader public safety issues (e.g., policing, security, border management), while the **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)** concentrates on emergency management and crisis response.

#### 6. **Legal and Administrative Impact**
- The transfer is **formal and legally binding**, as it is enacted through a statutory instrument under the authority of the Governor General in Council.
- It does **not alter the underlying legislation** of the Emergency Management Act (R.S., c. P-34), but rather adjusts the **executive implementation** of those provisions.
- The functions transferred remain within the **federal government’s emergency management framework**, ensuring continuity and legal compliance.

#### 7. **Historical Context**
- The regulation was first introduced in **2003 (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)** as part of broader public service restructuring efforts.
- It was **reaffirmed or updated in 2007 (S.C. 2007, c. 15)**, indicating ongoing government efforts to refine ministerial responsibilities in emergency management.
- This reflects a trend in Canadian federal governance to **streamline and specialize** ministerial portfolios in response to evolving national risks (e.g., natural disasters, terrorism, climate change).

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally transfers key emergency management responsibilities from the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** to the **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)**, based on the authority granted under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. The transfer is grounded in **Section 7 of the Emergency Management Act**, which defines the core functions related to emergency preparedness, response, and coordination.

By creating a dedicated ministerial role, the government enhances focus, accountability, and responsiveness in emergency management, aligning ministerial structures with modern governance needs. The regulation remains a key part of Canada’s institutional framework for managing national emergencies.
