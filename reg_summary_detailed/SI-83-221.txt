**Detailed Summary of the Air Transportation Tax Remission Order**

---

**1. Purpose of the Order**  
The *Air Transportation Tax Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of key federal ministers—namely, the Minister of National Revenue, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Transport, and the Treasury Board. It is made under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the government to issue orders to amend or modify taxes, fees, or other financial obligations as necessary for public policy or administrative efficiency.

The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e.,免除) the air transportation tax** imposed under the *Excise Tax Act* in specific circumstances involving international air travel.

**2. Legal Citation**  
The Order may be cited as the **Air Transportation Tax Remission Order**. This formal citation ensures clarity and consistency in legal references across government agencies, courts, and administrative bodies.

**3. Definitions in the Order**

Two key terms are defined to clarify the scope and conditions of the tax remission:

- **Technical Landing**:  
  A landing of an aircraft that occurs **solely to obtain ground services** required for the aircraft (such as refueling, maintenance, or crew changes).  
  *Note*: This type of landing does **not** involve passenger boarding or deplaning and is considered a necessary operational stop.

- **Transfer Stop**:  
  A stop at an airport where a passenger **deplanes solely to board a connecting flight**.  
  *Note*: This is a legitimate transfer point in international travel where passengers do not disembark for leisure or personal reasons but to continue their journey via a connecting flight.

These definitions are critical because they establish the **exclusions** from the remission eligibility—intermediate stops in Canada that fall outside of these two categories are not covered.

**4. Scope of the Remission**

The air transportation tax is **remitted (exempted)** for air transportation of a person under the following conditions:

> The transportation:
> - **Begins at a point in the taxation area outside Canada**, and  
> - **Ends at a point in the taxation area outside Canada**, **or**  
> - **Begins at a point in the taxation area outside Canada**, and  
> - **Ends at a point outside the taxation area**,  
>  
> **AND**  
> - **Does NOT include an intermediate stop at a point in Canada** other than a **transfer stop** or a **technical landing**.

**5. Key Conditions and Exclusions**

- ✅ **Eligible Travel**:
  - International flights that start and end outside Canada (e.g., a flight from London to Tokyo).
  - Flights that start outside Canada and end outside Canada (e.g., from Paris to Singapore).
  - Flights that start outside Canada and end outside Canada (e.g., from Toronto to Sydney), **provided** there are no intermediate stops in Canada that are not transfer stops or technical landings.

- ❌ **Not Eligible**:
  - Any flight that makes an **intermediate stop in Canada** (e.g., a layover in Toronto or Vancouver) **unless** that stop is:
    - A **transfer stop** (passenger deplanes to board a connecting flight), or
    - A **technical landing** (for aircraft services only, no passenger movement).
  - For example, a flight from New York to Tokyo that stops in Montreal for a 4-hour layover with no connection to a flight—this would **not qualify** for remission.

**6. Legal Basis and Authority**

The Order is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to issue regulations that modify or adjust taxes, fees, or charges, particularly when such actions are recommended by relevant ministers and serve a public interest.

This provision enables the government to respond flexibly to international travel patterns, economic considerations, or operational realities in air transport without requiring new legislation.

**7. Practical Implications**

- **Tax Relief for International Travelers**:  
  Passengers traveling internationally on flights that do not involve intermediate stops in Canada (except for transfer stops or technical landings) will not be required to pay the air transportation tax on their journey.

- **Support for Air Connectivity**:  
  The rule supports seamless international air travel by ensuring that passengers are not burdened with additional taxes when flying through non-stop or minimal-stop routes.

- **Administrative Clarity**:  
  By clearly defining what constitutes a "transfer stop" and a "technical landing," the Order provides clear guidance for tax authorities, airlines, and travel agencies on how to apply the exemption.

- **Revenue Management**:  
  The remission is likely intended to balance international trade, tourism, and aviation efficiency, while ensuring that the tax is not applied in ways that could discourage necessary international air movement.

**8. Conclusion**

The *Air Transportation Tax Remission Order* provides a targeted exemption from the air transportation tax for international air travel that avoids intermediate stops in Canada—except for those that are legitimate transfer stops or technical landings. This ensures fairness, operational realism, and administrative efficiency in the application of excise taxes on air travel. It reflects a nuanced approach to taxation that recognizes the realities of global air transport while maintaining revenue collection where appropriate.

This Order is a practical tool that supports international mobility and aligns with the broader goals of the Canadian government in promoting efficient, accessible, and equitable air transportation.
