**Detailed Summary of the CUFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CUFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended or referenced in the relevant statutes). This provision grants the Minister of Finance the authority to establish rules of origin for specific categories of goods, particularly those falling under the scope of the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA).

These regulations are part of the broader framework established by the **Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**, specifically section 34(1), which authorizes the creation of rules of origin to facilitate the application of preferential tariff treatment under the agreement.

**2. Definition of "Casual Goods"**

The regulations define **"casual goods"** as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use**. 

This means that casual goods are typically:
- Personal or non-commercial in nature,
- Not intended for resale or business operations,
- Often imported for private use (e.g., personal items, household goods, or items used by individuals in a non-commercial capacity).

Importantly, this distinction separates casual goods from goods that are part of a commercial or industrial supply chain, which are subject to different rules of origin under the CUFTA.

**3. Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Ukraine**

For **casual goods acquired in Ukraine**, the regulations establish a **simplified rule of origin** that allows such goods to be considered **originating in Ukraine** and thus eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (i.e., the "Ukraine Tariff").

The criteria for origin are as follows:

> A casual good acquired in Ukraine is considered to originate in Ukraine **if either**:
> 
> - The **marking of the goods complies with Ukraine’s marking laws** and **clearly indicates** that the goods are the product of **Ukraine or Canada**, **or**
> - The goods **do not bear any marking** or **no indication is present** suggesting that the goods are not the product of Ukraine or Canada.

This rule is designed to reduce administrative burdens for small-scale or personal imports by eliminating the need for complex origin documentation when the goods are clearly marked or unmarked in a way that implies Ukrainian origin.

**4. Effective Date and Implementation**

The regulations come into force on the date that **Section 36 of the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017) comes into force. 

However, if the regulations are **registered (published or formally adopted) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

This provision ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely and coordinated manner with the broader legislative framework of the CUFTA Implementation Act.

> **Note**: As of August 1, 2017, these regulations were in force (as referenced in SI/2017-37 — Statutory Instrument 2017-37).

**5. Purpose and Significance**

The purpose of these regulations is to:
- Facilitate **simplified origin determination** for casual goods imported from Ukraine,
- Promote **fair and transparent access** to preferential tariff treatment under CUFTA,
- Reduce compliance costs for individuals or small importers who may not have the resources to conduct complex origin assessments,
- Support the **economic integration** between Canada and Ukraine by enabling the free movement of personal or non-commercial goods.

By applying a straightforward marking-based rule, the regulations ensure that goods that are clearly Ukrainian in origin (either by marking or lack of contrary indication) are eligible for tariff benefits without requiring detailed production or processing history.

**6. Key Limitations and Considerations**

- The rule **only applies to casual goods**, not to goods imported for commercial or industrial use.
- The marking requirement is **based on Ukrainian marking laws**, meaning that the goods must conform to Ukraine’s labeling standards.
- The absence of a mark or any indication of non-Ukrainian origin is sufficient to qualify the goods as originating in Ukraine — a key simplification for personal or non-commercial imports.
- The rules do **not** apply to goods that are clearly labeled as being made in another country or that have evidence of processing outside Ukraine.

**Conclusion**

The *CUFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a **practical and accessible mechanism** for determining the origin of non-commercial goods imported from Ukraine. By relying on marking compliance or the absence of contrary indications, the rules streamline the application of preferential tariffs under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement, particularly for personal or private use goods. This simplification supports compliance while respecting the integrity of origin requirements under international trade agreements.

These regulations are an important component of Canada’s efforts to build a fair, efficient, and user-friendly trade regime with Ukraine, especially for small-scale or individual importers.
