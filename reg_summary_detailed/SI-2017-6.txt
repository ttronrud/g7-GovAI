The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-73" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 73 of 2018 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter of the regulation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the regulation that was repealed. Statutory instruments (SIs) are often technical, sector-specific, or administrative in nature — for example, they may relate to licensing, environmental standards, health and safety, or transport regulations.

In this case, the notation "Repealed, SI/2018-73" means:

- The regulation was originally issued in 2018 as Statutory Instrument 73.
- It has since been formally revoked or replaced by another legislation or amendment.
- The repeal is typically recorded in a later statutory instrument or through an amendment to the original enabling act.
- The repeal may have occurred due to redundancy, inconsistency with newer laws, or the need to align with updated policy or legal frameworks.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- The full title of the repealed SI (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2018").
- The sector or area it governed (e.g., road traffic, food safety, housing).
- The original purpose and key provisions.
- The date of repeal and the instrument that repealed it.

Since this information is not available in the current query, the most accurate response is:
