#### **4. Compliance Requirements When a Supply is Deemed to Have Been Made in Canada**

If a **non-resident person** supplies a publication (as defined above) and such supply is **deemed to have occurred in Canada** under **section 143.1** of the Excise Tax Act, the supplier must provide the **registration number** in one of the following ways:

| Method | Conditions |
|-------|-----------|
| **In the masthead** of the publication | If the masthead is on the first five pages. If not, it must appear on one of the first five pages. |
| **On the back cover** | Only if the address of the person appears on that cover. |
| **On the mailing label** | Attached to the publication when sent via Canada Post or courier. |
| **On the packaging** | On the outer packaging of the publication. |
| **On a separate document** | Accompanying the publication when sent to Canada Post or a customs officer. |

> ✅ **All of these methods are acceptable**, and the supplier must ensure **one of them is used**.

> ❗ **Critical Exception**:  
> If the person **does not yet have a registration number** at the time of mailing or courier delivery, they must provide **evidence** on a separate accompanying document (e.g., a letter or form) that they have **applied for a registration number**.

> 🔍 This ensures that even without a current registration, the supplier is still compliant and can obtain one promptly.

#### **5. Effective Dates and Transitional Provisions**

- **Sections 1, 2, subsection 4(1), and section 5** are deemed to have come into force on **January 1, 1993**.

> However, with **specific exceptions**:

1. **Before April 1, 1997**:
   - Any reference in **Section 1** of the Regulations to "(GST/HST)" must be read as "(GST)".
   - This reflects the historical transition from GST-only to GST/HST (after 1997 when HST was introduced in certain provinces).

2. **Before the publication of these regulations in the Canada Gazette**:
   - The reference to "**a person**" in the portion of **Section 4** (before paragraph (a)) must be interpreted as referring to a "**non-resident person**".
   - This ensures that the regulation applies correctly to non-residents from the outset, even before formal publication.

3. **Subsection 4(2)** (which likely outlines specific procedures or penalties) came into force on **November 26, 1997**.

> These transitional provisions ensure **legal continuity and clarity** during the implementation phase.

---

#### **6. Repeal Status**
- This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2014-248, section 10**.
- **Note**: While the regulation is officially repealed, it may still be referenced in existing compliance records or historical tax documentation. Any current compliance obligations related to this topic should be verified with **current regulations** or the **Minister of National Revenue**.
