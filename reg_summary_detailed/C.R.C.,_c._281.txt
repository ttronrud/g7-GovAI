**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Turkey Marketing Levies Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Saskatchewan Turkey Marketing Levies Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal instrument implementing specific financial and administrative provisions related to turkey marketing in the province of Saskatchewan.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Saskatchewan* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal framework under which the Commodity Board operates and enforces marketing regulations.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Saskatchewan Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board*, an entity established under the Act. It is responsible for overseeing the marketing of turkeys, managing quotas, and collecting levies on excess production.

- **Market Allotment**: The total quantity of turkey meat a producer is legally allowed to sell in intraprovincial, interprovincial, or export markets. This allocation is determined by the *Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations* and further adjusted by orders issued by the Commodity Board under the *Plan*.

- **Plan**: Known as *The Saskatchewan Turkey Producers’ Marketing Plan*, this is a comprehensive, periodically updated framework developed and amended under the Natural Products Marketing Act. It sets out the rules, objectives, and mechanisms for managing turkey production, distribution, and market access, including quota allocation and marketing strategies.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the actual raising or keeping of turkeys for slaughter within Saskatchewan. This includes farmers, poultry operations, and other agricultural businesses involved in turkey production.

- **Turkey**: Any turkey (regardless of breed, grade, or class) that is raised or kept in Saskatchewan specifically for slaughter and subsequently sold for that purpose.

---

**3. Levy on Excess Production**  
- Every producer who sells turkeys **in excess of their market allotment** must pay a levy to the Commodity Board.
- The levy rate is **$0.22 per kilogram of live weight** of the turkey sold beyond the allowed market allotment.
- This levy is in addition to any fees already established under the *Plan*.

> **Purpose**: The levy acts as a financial mechanism to ensure that producers do not exceed the market quota without contributing to the cost of managing supply and market stability. It helps control overproduction and supports equitable market access.

---

**4. Payment Obligations for Buyers**  
- Any person who purchases turkeys from a producer **must deduct the applicable levy** from the total payment due to the producer.
- The buyer is then **responsible for remitting the full levy amount** to the Commodity Board.
- The payment must be made **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.
- The payment must be made to the Commodity Board’s office in **Regina, Saskatchewan**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that the levy is collected efficiently and fairly, with the burden shifted to the buyer when the transaction occurs. It prevents producers from being the sole financial burden and promotes transparency in the supply chain.

---

**5. Payment Obligations for Producers (for Undeducted Levies)**  
- If a producer **fails to have the levy deducted by a buyer**, they are personally responsible for paying the levy.
- The producer must pay all such levies **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.
- The payment must also be made to the Commodity Board’s office in **Regina, Saskatchewan**.

> **Purpose**: This provision ensures that producers ultimately bear responsibility for levies on excess production, even if the buyer fails to deduct them. It provides a mechanism for accountability and compliance.

---

**6. Key Administrative and Compliance Features**  
- **Monthly Deadlines**: All levies must be paid within 30 days of the month in which the turkeys were sold (specifically, by the 15th day of the following month).
- **Centralized Collection**: All levies are collected at the Commodity Board’s office in Regina, ensuring a single point of accountability and administrative oversight.
- **Transparency and Enforcement**: The clear division of responsibility between producers and buyers promotes transparency and compliance. The Commodity Board has the authority to enforce these rules under the Natural Products Marketing Act.

---

**7. Policy Objectives and Rationale**  
The primary goals of this Order are:
- To manage turkey supply and prevent market oversaturation.
- To ensure fair distribution of market access among producers.
- To generate revenue to support marketing, quality control, and market development initiatives.
- To maintain price stability and promote sustainable turkey production in Saskatchewan.

By implementing a levy on excess production, the Order aligns with broader agricultural marketing principles, such as supply management and producer equity, commonly used in commodity markets.

**Conclusion**  
The *Saskatchewan Turkey Marketing Levies Order* is a critical regulatory tool that ensures responsible and sustainable turkey production and marketing in the province. It establishes a clear, enforceable financial mechanism—through a $0.22 per kg live weight levy on turkeys sold beyond market allotments—distributed between producers and buyers, with strict payment timelines and centralized collection. This structure supports market stability, promotes equitable access, and reinforces the role of the Commodity Board in managing Saskatchewan’s turkey sector under the framework of the Natural Products Marketing Act.
