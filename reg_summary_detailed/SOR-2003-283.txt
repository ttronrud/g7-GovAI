### **Detailed Summary of the Solvent Degreasing Regulations (Canada)**

The **Solvent Degreasing Regulations**, made under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), were issued by the Governor in Council on December 7, 2002, following a public consultation process and review by the National Advisory Committee. These regulations establish a **usage-based, consumption-tracking system** for certain solvents used in industrial degreasing processes to reduce environmental and human health risks associated with solvent use.

---

## **I. Background and Legislative Basis**

- The regulations were proposed under **subsection 332(1)** of CEPA 1999 and published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, allowing public comment and objection.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was given an opportunity to provide advice under **section 6** of CEPA.
- The Governor in Council concluded that the proposed regulations **do not overlap with other environmental or health legislation** and provide **adequate protection** to human health and the environment.
- Therefore, the regulations were formally enacted under **subsection 93(1)** of CEPA, with recommendations from both the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**.

## **II. Scope and Applicability**

### **What the Regulations Apply To**
- The regulations apply to the **use of specific solvents** listed in **Column 1 of Schedule 1**.
- These solvents are used in **specific degreasing processes** listed in **Column 2 of Schedule 1**.
- The use must occur in **equipment** classified as:
  - **Cold degreaser**: Equipment using liquid solvents via spraying, brushing, flushing, agitating, or immersion.
  - **Vapour degreaser**: Equipment using solvent vapour, which condenses on substrates to remove soils.

### **Exemptions**
The regulations **do not apply** to:
1. **Dry cleaning** of textiles, apparel, rugs, furs, leathers, or similar materials — *except during manufacturing*.
2. **Use of continuous scouring machines** in textile mills.

> ⚠️ This ensures that common textile cleaning operations are excluded from the regulatory scope.

## **III. Core Regulatory Requirement: Consumption Units**

### **Key Principle**
No person may use a solvent in a degreasing process in a quantity **exceeding the threshold** set in **Column 3 of Schedule 1**, **unless** they have a **consumption unit** issued by the Minister.

- A **consumption unit** represents **1 kilogram of solvent** that can be used **in excess** of the threshold.
- Each kilogram of solvent used **above the threshold** requires one consumption unit.

### **How Consumption Units Are Issued**

#### **Eligibility Conditions:**
To apply for consumption units for a given year:
1. The person must have used the solvent in the process in the **year immediately preceding** the requested year.
2. The request must be submitted to the Minister **before October 1** of that preceding year.
3. The request must be on a form provided by the Minister and include:
   - Information on solvent and process usage.
   - Documentary evidence supporting the claimed average annual consumption.
4. The person must be informed in writing by the Minister of their **average annual consumption**.

#### **Calculation of Consumption Units**
- The number of consumption units issued =  
  `(Average annual consumption × Percentage in Column 4 of Schedule 3)`  
  − `(Threshold in Column 3 of Schedule 1)`  
  − `(Any retired units under Section 5)`

> Example: If average annual consumption is 10,000 kg, threshold is 5,000 kg, and the percentage is 10%, then:
>  
> Units = (10,000 × 10%) − 5,000 = 1,000 − 5,000 = **–4,000 → zero units issued**

#### **Rounding Rules**
- If the result is **zero or negative**, **no units are issued**.
- If the result is **not a whole number**, it is **rounded to the nearest whole number**.
- If equidistant between two numbers, **round up**.

#### **Determining Average Annual Consumption**
The average is calculated based on the **last few years of use**:
| Usage Pattern | Average Calculation |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Used in **last year only** | That year’s usage |
| Used in **last two years** | Average of those two years |
| Used in **last three years** | Average of those three years |
| Used in **earlier years** (plus last three) | Person selects **three consecutive years** from the period in Column 5 of Schedule 1 and computes the average |

> This allows flexibility for businesses with fluctuating usage patterns.

## **IV. Consumption Unit Management**

### **Validity**
- Consumption units are **valid only for the year** they are issued.
- Cannot be carried forward or used in future years.

### **Retirement of Units**
- A person may **retire** a consumption unit (i.e., surrender it).
- Must submit a completed form (Schedule 4) with:
  - Name, address, contact details
  - Facility details
  - Reason for retirement
- Once retired, units **cannot be reissued**.

### **Transfer of Units**
- Units may be **transferred** to another person **for the same year and same degreasing process**.
- Transfer is **only allowed** after written approval from the Minister.
- Transfer requires:
  - **Joint application** by transferor and transferee.
  - Submission of information (Schedule 5) including:
    - Details of both parties
    - Solvent and process
    - Quantity to be transferred
    - Unexpended units available
- Conditions for approval:
  1. Transferor must have **unexpended units** for each unit being transferred.
  2. Transferee must **commit to use** the units in the same year and process.
- If the Minister discovers:
  - Transferor **lacked sufficient unexpended units**, or
  - Transferee **breached the commitment**,
  → The transfer is **cancelled**, and units are **returned to the transferor**.

> This ensures accountability and prevents misuse.

## **V. Reporting Requirements**

### **For Persons Using Solvents**
- Must submit a **report to the Minister** within **30 days after the end of the year**.
- Report must include:
  - Opening and closing inventory
  - Quantity supplied by sellers
  - Quantity transferred to other uses (on-site/off-site)
  - Quantity reclaimed/recycled on-site
  - Quantity sold or transferred to others
  - Quantity sent to waste management facilities
- Must **retain copies** of the report and supporting documents (e.g., shipping records) for **five years** after the end of the year.

### **For Sellers of Solvents**
- Must submit a **report within 30 days after the end of the year** of sale.
- Report must include:
  - Total quantity sold (with purchaser details and dates)
  - Quantity returned by purchasers
  - Quantity of **recycled or reclaimed solvent** sold or returned
- Must retain records for **five years** at their **principal place of business**.

> These reports ensure transparency in solvent flow and help track environmental impact.

## **VI. Submission and Compliance Requirements**

### **General Rules for Submissions**
- All applications, notices, and reports must be:
  - **Signed and dated** by:
    - A person authorized to act on behalf of a corporation, or
    - The individual submitting the document (in other cases).

### **Confidentiality**
- Applicants or parties may request **confidentiality** under **section 313 of CEPA**.
- Must state the **reason** for confidentiality (e.g., trade secrets, competitive advantage).
- The Minister may approve or deny such requests.

---

## **VII. Enforcement and Penalties**

### **Ministerial Discretion**
- The Minister may:
  - **Refuse to issue** a consumption unit, or
  - **Cancel** an existing unit,
  if false or misleading information is submitted.

### **Due Process**
- Before refusing or cancelling:
  - The Minister must provide **written reasons**.
  - The affected party must be given a **minimum of 30 days** to make **oral or written representations**.

> This ensures fairness and protects against arbitrary decisions.
