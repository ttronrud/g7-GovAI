**Detailed Summary of the War Claims Regulations (1952)**

---

### **Overview**

The *War Claims Regulations*, established under **Order in Council P.C. 4267 of 1952** and now formally revoked and replaced by this regulation, were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, pursuant to **The Appropriation Act, No. 4, 1952, Vote No. 696**. These regulations provide a comprehensive legal framework for the **payment of compensation to Canadian citizens and others who suffered losses or maltreatment during World War II**, particularly in the European and Far Eastern Theatres.

The regulations define the scope, eligibility, procedures, and priorities for compensation from the **War Claims Fund**, and establish the role of the **War Claims Commissioner** and the **Treasury Board** in administering and approving claims.

---

### **4. Payment of Compensation**

#### **(a) General Payment Authority**
- Payments may be made from the **War Claims Fund**, with **Treasury Board approval**, to a person or their representative, **if the War Claims Commissioner determines** they are eligible under the rules.

#### **(b) Maltreatment Compensation (Exceptional Authority)**
- **Even if not eligible under the rules**, the **Treasury Board may authorize payment** for maltreatment if it determines the claimant is eligible under the rules.
- The **Treasury Board determines the timing** of payments to reflect the **priority order** established in the rules.

#### **(c) Concurrent Payments from Other Sources**

  - Determine **what portion** of the award (if any) is to be paid from the War Claims Fund.
  - Set the **timing** of such payments.
- This ensures **no duplication** and prevents **undue delay** due to uncertainty about recovery from other sources.

## **8. Maltreatment Awards**

### **(a) European Theatre (SS, Gestapo, SD, Leadership Corps)**
- **Eligibility**: A person who was in **direct custody** of any of the listed organizations (designated as criminal by the Nuremberg IMT) and is **ineligible under the Sumner Commission test**.
- **Award**:
  - **Minimum 14 days** of custody: **$1 per day** (per diem).
  - **Less than 14 days**: Award is at the **discretion** of the War Claims Commissioner.
- **No double counting**: Receipt of a **disability pension under the Pension Act** does **not affect** eligibility or amount of maltreatment award.

### **(b) Far Eastern Theatre (Japanese POWs)**
- Former **prisoners of war of Japan** may receive **maltreatment awards** in **lump sum**, similar to civilian claims.
- These awards **include benefits under Article 16 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan**, which provides for compensation for certain wartime hardships.

## **9. Surviving Awards (Claims After Death)**

### **(a) Civilian Claims (with Death Claim)**
- If a **valid death claim** exists alongside a maltreatment claim:
  - The **benefits of the maltreatment award** (e.g., for survivors) are **not counted** in determining the **pecuniary loss** suffered by the deceased.

### **(b) Dependents of Service Personnel**
- If maltreatment caused death, but:
  - The deceased was a **prisoner of war (POW)**,
  - And a **death pension** is payable,
- Then the **maltreatment award** to the widow, dependent husband, child, or other dependent **shall be paid**, **without deduction** for the death pension.

---

## **10. Additional Payments**

- For **all individuals** for whom a maltreatment award was **authorized prior to the coming into force** of these regulations:
  - An **additional 50%** of the original award may be paid.
- **If the person is deceased**, the additional payment shall be made to a **designated beneficiary** by the Treasury Board.

---

## **11. Increases in Award Rates**

- For **new claims** (not previously authorized):
  - Paragraphs (a) and (b) (referring to per diem awards) are **interpreted as if "one dollar" were replaced by "one dollar and fifty cents"**.
- This results in a **50% increase** in the per diem rate for new claims.

---

## **12. Claims for Property Losses**

- **No claims** will be admitted from the War Claims Fund for property losses that have **already been compensated** under:
  - An Act of Parliament of Canada, or
  - A Governor in Council order.
- This prevents **duplicative or overlapping compensation**.

---

## **13. Priority Order for Claims**

The regulations establish a **clear hierarchy of payment priorities** based on the nature and severity of the claim:

| Priority Level | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Death, personal injury, maltreatment — **paid in full**; if fund insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 2 | Property losses up to **$2,500** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 3 | Additional property losses up to **$2,500** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 4 | Additional property losses up to **$5,000** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 5 | Additional property losses up to **$5,000** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 6 | Additional property losses up to **$15,000** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |

| 8 | Additional property losses up to **$50,000** — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |
| 9 | All remaining property losses — paid in full; if insufficient, **pro rata** |

> *Note: The priority order ensures that claims involving human suffering (death, injury, maltreatment) are paid first, followed by property losses in a tiered manner.*
