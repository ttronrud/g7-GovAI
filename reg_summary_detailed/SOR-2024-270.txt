### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Declaring that the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in Saskatchewan, 2025**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically under **subsection 10(3)** of the Act, which allows the Minister of the Environment to declare that certain federal environmental regulations **do not apply** in a province if equivalent or similar provincial regulations are already in force.

The regulation in question is the **Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector)**, which were originally developed under **subsection 93(1)d of CEPA 1999** to reduce emissions of methane (CH₄) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from upstream oil and gas operations.

The goal of the federal regulations is to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector — particularly methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential much higher than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.

However, in **Saskatchewan**, the provincial government has implemented its own environmental regulations that are considered **functionally equivalent** to the federal ones.

#### **2. Key Events Leading to the Order**

- **July 6, 2024**:  
  The Minister of the Environment published a **proposed Order** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the federal methane and VOC regulations **do not apply in Saskatchewan**.  
  This proposal was made under **subsection 332(1)a** of CEPA 1999, which provides for public consultation on such declarations.  
  The public was given the opportunity to:
  - File written comments supporting or opposing the proposed Order, or  
  - File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** to assess the objection and determine whether the federal regulations should apply.

- **December 3, 2024**:  
  The Minister of the Environment and the Government of Saskatchewan signed a **written agreement** titled:  
  *"Agreement on the Equivalency of Federal and Saskatchewan Regulations Respecting the Release of Methane from the Oil and Gas Sector in Saskatchewan, 2025"*  
  This agreement confirms that:
  1. **Saskatchewan’s existing laws** are **equivalent** to the federal regulations under **CEPA 1999, subsection 93(1)d**, regarding methane and VOC emissions from upstream oil and gas operations.
  2. Saskatchewan’s laws also include provisions **similar to sections 17 to 20 of CEPA 1999**, which pertain to the **investigation and enforcement of alleged environmental offences**.

- **July 6, 2024**:  
  The Minister also published a notice in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* under **subsection 10(4) and (5)** of CEPA 1999, informing the public that the agreement was available for review.  
  Again, the public was invited to:
  - Submit comments or  
  - File a **notice of objection** to the agreement.

- **November 16, 2024**:  
  The Minister published a **report** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* summarizing how all comments and objections received were reviewed and addressed.  
  This report ensured transparency and provided a record of public input and the government’s response.

#### **3. Final Decision and Legal Effect of the Order**

On the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** has formally issued the **Order Declaring that the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in Saskatchewan, 2025**.

##### **Key Provisions of the Order**:

- **Scope of Non-Application**:  
  Except for **federal works or undertakings**, the federal regulations on methane and VOC emissions from upstream oil and gas operations **do not apply** in Saskatchewan.  
  → This means that oil and gas companies operating in Saskatchewan are **not subject to the federal rules** on methane and VOC reductions, provided their operations are not federally funded or conducted under federal jurisdiction.

- **Equivalency Basis**:  
  The non-application is based on the **validity and equivalence** of Saskatchewan’s provincial laws, which are deemed to provide **substantially the same environmental protections** as the federal regulations.

- **Termination of the Order**:  
  The Order **ceases to have effect** on the day the agreement between the federal government and Saskatchewan **terminates** or is **terminated** under **subsection 10(8)** of CEPA 1999.  
  → This ensures that the federal regulations may re-apply in Saskatchewan if the agreement ends.

- **Repeal of the Order**:  
  The Order itself is **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled) once it ceases to have effect.  
  → This prevents the Order from remaining in force indefinitely and ensures it is only active during the term of the agreement.

- **Coming into Force**:  
  The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially recorded in the public register of instruments).

#### **4. Significance and Implications**

- **Environmental Protection**:  
  The decision recognizes that Saskatchewan has implemented effective, enforceable, and comparable environmental standards, reducing the need for federal intervention in provincial matters.

- **Provincial Autonomy**:  
  It reinforces the principle of **cooperative federalism** under CEPA 1999, where provinces can manage environmental regulation in their jurisdictions if they meet federal standards.

- **Climate Action**:  
  While the federal rules are not applied, Saskatchewan’s existing regulations still aim to reduce methane emissions — a key climate mitigation strategy — through provincial oversight and enforcement.

- **Transparency and Public Participation**:  
  The process included multiple stages of public consultation and reporting, ensuring accountability and public trust in the decision-making process.

- **Enforcement Framework**:  
  The agreement includes provisions for **investigating and prosecuting environmental offences**, ensuring that violations of environmental laws — including those related to methane emissions — can still be addressed through Saskatchewan’s legal system.

#### **6. Conclusion**

This Order is a **legally binding declaration** that the federal regulations on methane and VOC emissions from upstream oil and gas operations **do not apply in Saskatchewan**, due to the existence of **functionally equivalent provincial laws**. It is a result of a collaborative agreement between the federal and provincial governments, supported by public consultation and transparency.

The Order reflects a **pragmatic approach to environmental governance**, where provinces with strong, well-established environmental frameworks can operate independently of federal rules — as long as they meet or exceed federal standards. It also underscores the importance of **climate action, regional responsibility, and intergovernmental cooperation** in Canada’s environmental policy landscape.

---

> ✅ **Key Takeaway**:  
> Saskatchewan is **exempt from federal methane and VOC emission rules** in upstream oil and gas operations because it already has **equivalent provincial regulations** in place — a decision made through a transparent, consultative, and legally sound process under CEPA 1999.
