**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order Designating Nova Scotia for the Purposes of Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**

---

### **1. Background and Context**

This regulation is a **statutory order** issued under the **Criminal Code of Canada (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46)**, specifically under **section 347.1(3)a**, which allows the Governor in Council (the federal government) to designate a province for the application of certain **criminal interest rate provisions**.

The key background elements include:

- **Nova Scotia has existing legislative protections** for individuals who receive payday loans.
- These protections include:
  - **Limits on the total cost of borrowing** under payday loan agreements.
  - **Regulatory frameworks** established through the *Consumer Protection Act* and related regulations.
- The **Lieutenant Governor in Council** (a provincial authority) has formally requested that the federal government designate Nova Scotia to apply the federal criminal interest rate provisions to payday lending.

This order responds to that request by formally designating Nova Scotia as a jurisdiction where **federal criminal interest rate laws** (specifically, section 347.1 of the Criminal Code) will apply — even though these laws are typically not directly applicable in provinces with strong consumer protection legislation.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this order is to:

- **Apply the federal criminal interest rate provisions** (section 347.1 of the Criminal Code) to **payday lending activities in Nova Scotia**.
- Ensure that **any person who charges or collects interest exceeding the legal limit** on a loan (especially in the context of payday loans) can be prosecuted under federal criminal law — even if the province has its own consumer protection laws.

Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code makes it a **criminal offense** to charge or collect interest in excess of a prescribed rate, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. By designating Nova Scotia, the federal government confirms that these criminal provisions are enforceable in that province.

---

### **3. Key Legal Provisions Involved**

- **Section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**:
  - Prohibits charging or collecting interest in excess of a specified rate (the "maximum allowable rate").
  - In the context of this order, it applies to **payday loans**, which are typically short-term, high-interest loans.
  - The federal rate is set at **10% per annum** (as of the time of this order), and exceeding this rate constitutes a criminal offense.

- **Section 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code**:
  - Grants the Governor in Council the power to **designate a province** for the purposes of applying section 347.1.
  - This power is exercised here to extend federal criminal interest rate laws to Nova Scotia.

- **Consumer Protection Act (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 92)**:
  - Nova Scotia's provincial law that provides **consumer safeguards** for borrowers.
  - Key sections referenced:
    - **Sections 18B to 18S and 18U**: Establish rules on loan terms, interest rates, and borrower protections.
    - **Section 18U**: Authorizes the regulation of payday lending and sets limits on the total cost of borrowing.
  - These sections form the **provincial framework** that supports the federal designation.

- **Payday Lenders Regulations**:
  - Regulations made under section 18U of the Consumer Protection Act.
  - Set specific rules for payday lenders, including **maximum interest rates**, **loan amounts**, and **borrower disclosures**.
  - These regulations are critical to ensure that the provincial framework is operational and enforceable.

- **Order of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board (NSURB)**:
  - Dated **July 31, 2008**, under section 18T of the Consumer Protection Act.
  - This order likely sets **additional regulatory standards or enforcement mechanisms** for payday lending in Nova Scotia.
  - It serves as a **key component** of the conditions under which the federal criminal provisions are applied.

### **4. Conditions for Effectiveness**

The order **does not take effect immediately**. It comes into force only when **all of the following provincial laws and regulations are in force**:

1. **Sections 18B to 18S and 18U of the Consumer Protection Act**, as amended by *S.N.S. 2006, c. 25*.
2. **The Payday Lenders Regulations** (made under section 18U).
3. **The NSURB Order dated July 31, 2008** (under section 18T).

This ensures that:
- The provincial regulatory framework is fully operational.
- There is a clear, enforceable system of consumer protection in place.
- The federal criminal provisions are applied only in a context where borrowers are protected and lending practices are regulated.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The order comes into force at **12:00 a.m. Atlantic Time** on the **first day** when all three conditions above are in force.
- The **actual effective date** was **August 1, 2009**, as noted in the note at the end of the document.

---

### **6. Significance and Impact**

- **Federal-Provincial Cooperation**: This order demonstrates how federal and provincial governments can work together to protect consumers, especially in high-risk lending areas like payday loans.
- **Consumer Protection**: By applying federal criminal penalties for excessive interest, the order deters lenders from charging exorbitant rates, which can trap vulnerable borrowers in cycles of debt.
- **Legal Clarity**: It provides legal certainty that in Nova Scotia, charging interest above the prescribed rate is a **criminal offense**, not just a civil violation.
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: It enables federal authorities (such as the RCMP or prosecution services) to investigate and prosecute lenders who violate the interest rate limits, even if the lending activity occurs in a province with strong consumer protections.

---

### **7. Limitations and Scope**

- The application of section 347.1 is **limited to payday loans** and related lending practices.
- The order does **not override** the provincial consumer protection laws; rather, it complements them by adding a **criminal penalty** for interest rate violations.
- It applies **only in Nova Scotia** — other provinces are not designated under this order.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **strategic and protective measure** that strengthens consumer rights in Nova Scotia by combining provincial consumer safeguards with federal criminal enforcement. It ensures that payday lenders cannot exploit borrowers by charging excessive interest, thereby promoting financial fairness and reducing the risk of predatory lending practices.

By designating Nova Scotia under section 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code, the federal government affirms its commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitative lending, while respecting and building upon the province’s existing regulatory framework.
