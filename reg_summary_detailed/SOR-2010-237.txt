### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Exemption for Public Notices or Documents Regulations (Cooperative Credit Associations)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is grounded in specific provisions of the **Cooperative Credit Associations Act (Act)**:
  - **Section 487.14b** of the Act provides the legal basis for granting exemptions from public notice or disclosure requirements.
  - **Subsection 463(1)a** of the Act supports the power to make such regulations, particularly in relation to the exemption of certain notices or documents from public disclosure.

> This means the regulation is a **statutory instrument** created under the authority of existing legislation to provide practical guidance and flexibility in how public notices or documents are handled by cooperative credit associations.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- The primary purpose is to **grant an exemption** from the requirement to publicly disclose certain notices or documents under the Act.
- Specifically, it allows **cooperative credit associations** to **withhold or not issue public notices** for certain documents or communications, provided that the exemption does **not harm the interests of members, shareholders, or the public**.

> This exemption is intended to balance transparency with operational efficiency and confidentiality—especially in sensitive financial or internal matters.

---

#### **3. Key Provision: Prescribed Circumstances**
- For the exemption to be valid and lawful, it must meet the **prescribed circumstances** under **Section 487.14 of the Act**.
- These circumstances require that:
  - The exemption **does not prejudice**:
    - The rights or interests of **members** of the cooperative,
    - The interests of **shareholders**, or
    - The **public interest** in general.

> This ensures that while confidentiality is permitted, it is not at the expense of accountability, fairness, or transparency. The exemption must be narrowly tailored and justified.

---

#### **4. Scope and Application**
- The regulation applies to **cooperative credit associations** operating under the **Cooperative Credit Associations Act**.
- It governs the **issuance or publication of public notices or documents** that might otherwise be required to be made available to the public.
- The exemption may apply to internal communications, financial reports, or other documents that, if made public, could lead to unnecessary disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information.

> The regulation does not eliminate the need for transparency; rather, it allows for **limited exemptions** when public disclosure would cause undue harm or interfere with the functioning of the cooperative.

---

#### **5. Regulatory Timeline**
- The regulations **come into force on June 1, 2011**.
- This date marks the effective date when the exemption provisions become legally binding and applicable to cooperative credit associations.

> This ensures a clear transition period and allows associations time to adjust their internal procedures and compliance practices.

---

#### **6. Legislative Context and References**
- The regulation is part of a broader legislative framework established by:
  - **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 208 and s. 212** – These sections likely provide the enabling provisions or amendment authority for the regulation.
  - **S.C. 1991, c. 48** – This refers to an earlier enabling or foundational statute that may have laid the groundwork for the current exemption framework.

> These references confirm that the regulation is consistent with long-standing legislative intent to regulate cooperative credit associations while preserving flexibility in operational and disclosure practices.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a **legally sound and conditionally permissible exemption** for cooperative credit associations from the requirement to publicly disclose certain notices or documents. The exemption is **not absolute**—it is strictly limited by the requirement that it must not prejudice the interests of members, shareholders, or the public. By coming into force on June 1, 2011, it provides a clear, enforceable framework that supports both **operational discretion** and **public accountability** within the cooperative sector.
