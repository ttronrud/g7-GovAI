Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and structured summary** of the provided regulation — the *Coin-operated Devices (Streamlined Accounting Users) Remission Order* — including its purpose, key definitions, scope, conditions, and procedural requirements.

## **Detailed Summary of the Coin-operated Devices (Streamlined Accounting Users) Remission Order**

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**
- **Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Based on:** Recommendation from the Minister of National Revenue.
- **Legal Basis:** Subsection 23(2)a of the *Financial Administration Act*.
- **Purpose:** To provide a remission (i.e., a refund or cancellation) of certain excise taxes collected or collectible by registrants in relation to specific coin-operated devices, under special circumstances tied to the *Excise Tax Act*.

> This Order was made under the authority of the Financial Administration Act to promote fairness and administrative efficiency in tax collection, particularly for small businesses or users of streamlined accounting systems.

### **2. Key Definitions (Applicable in This Order)**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*. |
| **Eligible Claimant** | A registrant who has made an election under **Section 227 of the Excise Tax Act** that applies to a particular reporting period. This election typically relates to using a simplified accounting method (e.g., streamlined accounting) for certain supplies. |
| **Eligible Period** | The time frame from **January 1, 1991**, to **April 23, 1996**. This is the only period during which the remission applies. |
| **Eligible Supply** | A supply (e.g., a service or product) where, *if subsection 165.1(2) of the Excise Tax Act had been in effect at the time of the supply*, the tax payable under Division II of Part IX of the Act would have been **zero**. This means the supply was exempt from excise tax under a hypothetical rule. |
| **Net Tax** | Has the same meaning as defined in **Division V of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** — generally the final amount of tax due after deductions, credits, and adjustments. |
| **Person** | As defined in subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act — includes individuals, corporations, and other legal entities. |
| **Registrant** | A person who was registered under the Excise Tax Act at any time during the eligible period (January 1, 1991 – April 23, 1996). |
| **Reporting Period** | The tax period (e.g., monthly, quarterly) in which a registrant files tax returns, as defined in subsection 123(1) of the Act. |

### **3. Scope of the Remission**

#### **What is Remitted?**
- A registrant is entitled to a **full remission** (i.e., refund or cancellation) of **any amount of excise tax** that was:
  - Collected or collectible (in advance or otherwise),
  - In respect of **eligible supplies**,
  - Made during a **reporting period** that:
    - Begins **within the eligible period** (January 1, 1991 – April 23, 1996), and
    - During which the registrant was an **eligible claimant** (i.e., had made the election under Section 227).

> In simpler terms: If a business (registrant) used the streamlined accounting rules (election under s. 227) during the 1991–1996 window and made a supply that would have been tax-exempt under a hypothetical rule (s. 165.1(2)), and paid tax on it, the tax paid is now being refunded.

### **4. Reduction of Remission Amount**

The remission is **not automatic** — it is reduced by certain amounts under specific conditions:

> The amount of remission granted is **reduced** by the total of all amounts that were:
- Collected or collectible as tax under Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act,
- In respect of eligible supplies,
- And that are **included in the net tax** for the reporting period,
- **If**:
  1. The net tax is a **positive amount** (i.e., the registrant actually owes tax),
  2. **No assessment** of that net tax has been made under **Section 296** of the Excise Tax Act **before** the registrant files the remission application,
  3. And such an assessment **cannot be made** at or after the time of filing due to **Section 298** of the Act (which may prevent assessment due to administrative or procedural limitations).

> **Interpretation:** If the registrant still owes a positive net tax (after credits, deductions, etc.), and that tax has not been assessed, then the remission is reduced by that outstanding tax. This prevents a full refund if the registrant still has a valid tax liability that has not been formally assessed.

---

### **5. Remission of Interest and Penalties**

- If a registrant has **already paid interest or penalties** on any amount for which a remission is granted, **those interest and penalties are also remitted**.
- This ensures that the financial burden of interest and penalties is not retained even after the tax is refunded.

> This is a significant benefit — it protects registrants from additional costs beyond the tax itself.

---

### **6. Application Process and Deadlines**

- An eligible claimant must file a **written application** for remission with the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- The application must be submitted **not later than two years after the date this Order is made**.
  - The Order was made on **April 23, 1991** (as indicated by the citation: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)).
  - Therefore, the deadline for applications was **April 23, 1993**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This deadline is strict. Applications filed after April 23, 1993, are **not eligible**, regardless of the circumstances.

---

### **7. Exceptions to Remission**

- The remission **does not apply** to any amount that has already been:
  - **Rebated** (returned),
  - **Credited** (credited to the registrant’s account),
  - Or **remitted** (paid) under the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act*.

> This means that if the tax was already refunded or paid in a prior transaction, it is not eligible for remission under this Order.

## **Why This Order Matters**

This regulation:
- Provides **financial relief** to businesses that operated coin-operated devices (e.g., vending machines) during a specific period.
- Recognizes that under the *Excise Tax Act*, certain supplies were **exempt from tax** under a rule that was not in effect at the time of supply (s. 165.1(2)).
- Corrects a potential over-collection of tax by allowing a refund when the tax was not actually due.
- Supports the use of **streamlined accounting** by ensuring that businesses using simplified methods are not penalized for tax obligations that should not have applied.

It reflects a broader principle in tax policy: **fairness, accuracy, and administrative efficiency** — especially in cases where tax rules were applied inconsistently or where businesses relied on specific exemptions.

## **Conclusion**

The *Coin-operated Devices (Streamlined Accounting Users) Remission Order* is a targeted, time-bound tax relief measure designed to correct overpayments of excise tax on specific supplies (coin-operated devices) made during 1991–1996 by registrants who used streamlined accounting. It ensures that businesses are not unfairly burdened with taxes that would have been zero under a hypothetical exemption rule. However, the remission is not automatic and is subject to conditions related to net tax, assessment status, and timely application.

**Final Note:** This Order is now **historical** — it was enacted in 1991 and expired in 1993. It no longer applies to current or future tax periods. Its
