**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Critical Habitat of the Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Framework**
This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **Part 2 of Schedule 1**, which designates certain wildlife species as endangered. The Roseate Tern (*Sterna dougallii*) is one such species listed as **endangered** under this provision.

SARA provides a legal framework for the protection and recovery of at-risk species, including the identification and protection of their **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.

---

### **2. Background and Context**

- **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**:  
  A formal recovery strategy for the Roseate Tern was developed and includes a detailed description of its **critical habitat**. This information has been officially registered in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the scientific basis for critical habitat designations.

- **Exclusion of Critical Habitat Under Section 58(5)**:  
  Section 58(5) of SARA mandates that **any portion of critical habitat located within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)** of the Act must be **excluded** from the formal order designating critical habitat.  
  This provision typically applies to areas that are **under the jurisdiction or management of another federal department**, such as those managed by Parks Canada or Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Fisheries and Oceans Canada – "Fishery").  
  The exclusion ensures that federal authorities do not inadvertently impose regulatory obligations on lands already under the control of other departments.

- **Consultation Requirement (Section 58(9))**:  
  The Minister of the Environment, as the competent minister responsible for SARA, is required by **section 58(9)** to **consult with other competent ministers** when a proposed order would affect lands under the jurisdiction of another department.  
  In this case, the Minister of the Environment consulted with the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, recognizing that a portion of the Roseate Tern’s critical habitat lies within areas managed by that department.

### **3. Purpose of the Order**
The purpose of this **Critical Habitat of the Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) Order** is to:
- Legally designate and protect the **critical habitat** of the Roseate Tern,
- Ensure that the habitat remains intact and accessible for the species’ survival and recovery,
- Comply with the procedural and legal requirements of SARA, including consultation and exclusion of areas under the jurisdiction of other federal departments.

### **4. Designated Critical Habitat Areas**

The Order designates the following areas as critical habitat for the Roseate Tern, **excluding** areas that fall under the jurisdiction of the Sable Island National Park Reserve of Canada:

#### **Area 1: Country Island, Nova Scotia**
- The entire **Country Island** (a known nesting site),
- Plus an area extending **200 meters seaward** from the **mean high tide line**.

> *Rationale*: This area supports breeding and nesting activities of the Roseate Tern and is essential for its population viability.

#### **Area 2: North Brother Island and South Brother Island, Nova Scotia**
- For each island, an area extending **200 meters seaward** from the **mean high tide line**.

> *Rationale*: These islands are known tern nesting sites, and the 200-meter buffer ensures protection of adjacent foraging and nesting zones from coastal disturbances.

#### **Area 3: Sable Island Nesting Colonies**
- Any area within a **200-meter perimeter** of each individual **nesting colony** of any species of tern on Sable Island (including the Roseate Tern),
- **Excluding** any area that lies within the **Sable Island National Park Reserve of Canada**, as defined in **Schedule 2 of the Canada National Parks Act**.

> *Rationale*: This provision protects tern colonies from habitat degradation, while recognizing that certain areas are already protected under national park status and therefore not subject to additional critical habitat designation.

### **5. Legal Basis and Authority**

This Order is made under:
- **Section 58(4)**: Authority to make orders designating critical habitat,
- **Section 58(5)**: Requirement to exclude critical habitat from areas designated under subsection 58(2)(b) (i.e., lands under the authority of another minister),
- **Section 58(9)**: Requirement to consult with other competent ministers when the order may affect lands under their jurisdiction.

The Minister of the Environment, as the lead minister for species at risk and also responsible for Parks Canada, exercised this authority after fulfilling all required consultation obligations.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette, following the completion of the legal registration process.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Significance**

- **Conservation Protection**: The Order provides legal protection to key breeding and foraging areas of the Roseate Tern, which is an endangered species with a declining population.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: The regulation demonstrates intergovernmental cooperation between the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, ensuring that land-use decisions do not interfere with species recovery.
- **Scientific Basis**: The designation is grounded in the recovery strategy, which is publicly accessible and scientifically validated.
- **Exclusion of Protected Areas**: By excluding areas within the Sable Island National Park Reserve, the Order respects existing conservation designations and avoids duplication of protections.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This regulation is a critical step in the recovery of the Roseate Tern by formally identifying and protecting its essential habitat. It reflects a balanced approach to conservation that:
- Respects existing land management jurisdictions,
- Ensures compliance with SARA’s procedural requirements,
- Supports the long-term survival of a vulnerable species through targeted habitat protection.

It serves as a model for how federal environmental legislation can be implemented in a collaborative, science-based, and legally sound manner.
