## **5. Repayment Obligations (When Certain Events Occur)**

The issuer must repay amounts to the Minister under specific circumstances. The repayment amount is the **lesser of**:

- The **fair market value** of the RDSP’s property immediately before the event, or  
- The **assistance holdback amount** of the RDSP immediately before the event.

### **Events Triggering Repayment**

1. **Termination of the RDSP**
2. **Plan ceases to be an RDSP** due to application of **paragraph 146.4(10)(a)** of the Income Tax Act (e.g., plan is closed or dissolved)
3. **Death of the beneficiary**  
   *(Note: This section was repealed in 2021, c. 23, s. 95 — see below)*

> **Important Note**: This section **does not apply** if the event occurs **after the beneficiary reaches 59 years of age**.

---

### **Special Rule for Death of a Beneficiary (Specified Disability Savings Plan)**

If the RDSP is a **specified disability savings plan** and the beneficiary dies:

- The issuer must repay **any portion of grants or bonds** paid into the RDSP within the **10-year period before death** that **remains in the plan** at the time of death.

> This ensures that funds not used are returned to the government.

> **Exception**: This rule does **not apply** if the event (e.g., death) occurs **after the beneficiary reaches 59 years of age**.

---

### **Repayment if Beneficiary Ceases to Be DTC-Eligible**

If a beneficiary **ceases to be DTC-eligible** and one of the following events occurs:

- Termination of RDSP  
- Plan ceases to be an RDSP  
- Disability assistance payment is made  

Then the issuer must repay the lesser of:

- Fair market value of the RDSP at the time of the event  
- A **formula-based amount**, which varies based on the beneficiary’s age and timing of DTC-eligibility loss.

#### Formula Breakdown:

| Scenario | Repayment Amount |
|--------|------------------|
| **Before age 51** | Total grants and bonds paid within 10 years before DTC loss, minus repayments during that period |
| **Between age 50–59**, and DTC loss occurred **before age 50** | Grants and bonds paid during a period ending before DTC loss, minus repayments during that period |
| **Between age 50–59**, and DTC loss occurred **after age 49** | Grants and bonds paid from 10 years before event to day before DTC loss, minus repayments |
| **After age 59** | Nil |

> The repayment is made from the grants and bonds paid **within the applicable period**, in the **order they were paid**.

> **Exception**: This rule does **not apply** if the disability assistance payment is made **after age 59** or in the year the beneficiary turns 60, **provided** the total disability assistance payments in that year are ≤ the amount prescribed under **paragraph 146.4(4)(l)** of the Income Tax Act.

## **6. Repayment for Disability Assistance Payments**

When a **disability assistance payment** is made to a beneficiary:

- The issuer must repay the **least of**:
  1. **$3 for every $1** of disability assistance payment made  
  2. Fair market value of the RDSP immediately before the payment  
  3. Assistance holdback amount immediately before the payment  

> Repayment is made **from grants and bonds** paid into the RDSP within the **10 years before** the payment, in the **order of payment**.

> **Exception**: This rule **does not apply** if the disability assistance payment is made **after age 59**.

#### Special Case: Beneficiary is No Longer DTC-Eligible

If the beneficiary is
