The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the same statutory instrument:

> [Repealed, SI/2013-53, s. 5]

This indicates that a specific provision (section 5) of **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2013-53** has been **repealed** — that is, formally removed or cancelled — by the same instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

**Statutory Instrument:** SI 2013-53  
**Section Repealed:** Section 5  
**Date of Repeal:** 2013 (as per the SI)  
**Nature of Change:** The provision contained in Section 5 of SI 2013-53 is no longer in force.

#### What Does "Repealed" Mean?
Repeal means that a law, rule, or regulation previously in effect has been officially cancelled or revoked. It is typically done to:
- Remove outdated or obsolete provisions,
- Correct errors,
- Align with new legislation,
- Avoid legal confusion or conflict.

In this case, **Section 5 of SI 2013-53** was formally removed from the legal framework by the same instrument (SI 2013-53), meaning it no longer applies.

#### Key Points:
- The repealing section (s. 5) is self-referential — it repeals itself, which is common in legislative instruments when a provision is being removed.
- The instrument SI 2013-53 is likely a secondary legislation (e.g., a regulation or order) passed by a government body to implement or amend a broader act.
- The repeal is effective from the date the SI came into force (typically specified in the instrument; not provided here).
- Since the provision is now repealed, it has **no current legal effect** and cannot be cited or applied in any legal or administrative context.

#### Possible Context (Inferred):
While the specific content of Section 5 is not provided, SI 2013-53 may relate to areas such as:
- Environmental regulation,
- Health and safety standards,
- Licensing or compliance procedures,
- Administrative or procedural rules.

Without the full text of SI 2013-53, the exact subject matter of the repealed section cannot be determined. However, the repealing of section 5 suggests that the original regulation was either:
- Outdated,
- Overridden by newer legislation,
- Found to be inconsistent or unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text — Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2013-53 — has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in force**. This means it does not apply to current legal or regulatory practice. The repeal was enacted through the same instrument (SI 2013-53), which effectively removes the section from the legal system. Any reference to this section in current legal interpretation or compliance must be disregarded.

> **Note:** For a more precise understanding of the original content of Section 5, access to the full text of SI 2013-53 (e.g., via the legislation database of the relevant jurisdiction, such as Canada, UK, or another country) is required. The repeated entries suggest a technical or formatting error in the source document, where the section was listed multiple times in a summary or index.
