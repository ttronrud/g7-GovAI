## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Access to Information Regulations (Prior to Repeal)**

### 📌 **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation was made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice** and the **Treasury Board**, under **subsection 77(1) of the Access to Information Act**.
- This means the regulation is a formal administrative instrument issued to implement and clarify the provisions of the Act, particularly regarding how requests for access to government records are processed.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These regulations were **repealed in 2018 (SOR/2018-38, s. 2)** and further elements were removed in 2023 and 2013. As of now, the current version of the regulations is governed by **the updated Access to Information Regulations (SOR/2023-156)** or other modernized versions. This summary reflects the **historical content**.

### 📚 **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Access to Information Request Form** | A standardized form prescribed by the designated Minister (under paragraph 70(1)(b) of the Act) for submitting a request to access government records. |
| **Act** | Refers to the *Access to Information Act* (commonly known as the "Access to Information Act"). |
| **Appropriate Officer** | The designated officer within a government institution whose title and address are published under paragraph 5(1)(d) of the Act. This officer is responsible for receiving and processing access requests. |

> These definitions establish the procedural and administrative framework for handling access requests.

---

### 📝 **3. Requesting Access to Records (Under Part 1 of the Act)**

#### ✅ How a Request Must Be Made:
A person must submit a request to the **appropriate officer** of the government institution that controls the record in one of two ways:
1. A **completed Access to Information Request Form**, or  
2. A **written request** that includes **sufficient detail** to allow the officer to identify the record.

> This ensures clarity and helps prevent vague or unactionable requests.

#### ❌ Insufficient Information:
- If the request lacks sufficient detail to establish that the requester has a right to access under **section 4 of the Act**, the institution **must request additional information** to verify the requester’s entitlement.

> This protects government institutions from processing requests that are not legally justified.

---

### 🔐 **4. Protection of Personal Information**

- If the record contains **personal information about the requester**, the institution **must require adequate identification** before disclosing the information.
- This requirement **does not apply** if the requester’s identity has already been confirmed (e.g., through prior communication or verification).

> This balances public access with privacy rights under the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)* and other privacy laws.

---

### 🔄 **5. Transfer of Requests Between Institutions**

- The **head of a government institution** may transfer a request to another institution within **15 days** of receiving it, **if**:
  - The record is under the control of the second institution, and
  - The head of the second institution **consents** to process the request within the time limits set by the Act.

> This allows for efficient handling when records are held across departments.

#### ⚠️ Limitation:
- A request **cannot be transferred to a third (or subsequent) institution** after being transferred once.

> Prevents abuse or circumvention of procedural rules.

---

### 💰 **6. Application Fee**

- Every person making a request under Part 1 of the Act must pay an **application fee of $5** at the time of submission.

> This fee helps cover administrative costs associated with processing requests. It is a standard feature of access to information regimes globally.

---

### 📂 **7. Opportunity to Examine vs. Copy a Record**

The head of a government institution may choose to provide **an opportunity to examine** a record instead of a copy under the following circumstances:

#### ✅ When Examination is Required:
- The record or part thereof is **so lengthy** that reproducing it would **unreasonably interfere with the institution’s operations**.
- The record is in a **form that does not readily lend itself to reproduction** (e.g., audio, video, complex data files).

#### ✅ When Examination is Required Due to Legal Prohibitions:
- Providing a copy is **prohibited by or under another Act of Parliament** (e.g., national security, privacy, or criminal law).

#### ✅ When a Copy is Required Instead:
- The record is a **disclosable part** of a larger record that would otherwise be refused disclosure, and it **cannot reasonably be separated** for examination.
- The record is in a **form that does not readily lend itself to examination** (e.g., a physical document stored in a sealed container).

> This flexibility ensures that access is both practical and operationally feasible.

### 🖥️ **8. Format of Copies (Under Subsection 4(2.1))**

If a person requests a copy of a record in a specific format (e.g., PDF, Word), the institution is **not required to provide it in that format** if:

- The record **does not exist in that format** within the institution, **and**
- The head of the institution determines that **converting the record to that format would be unreasonable**.

#### 📌 Factors Considered in Determining "Reasonableness" of Conversion:
1. **Cost to the institution** (labor, equipment, time)
2. **Potential degradation** of the original record (e.g., digital loss, image quality)
3. **Severability** – if only a part of the record is requested, whether it can be cleanly separated in the requested format
4. **Existence of alternative useful formats** within the institution
5. **Possibility of converting to another useful format**
6. **Impact on operations** of the institution
7. **Availability of personnel, technology, and equipment**

> This provision protects government institutions from being burdened with technically or financially unreasonable conversion tasks.

#### 📝 Outcome:
- If conversion is deemed unreasonable, the copy must be provided in:
  - A format **already available** in the institution, or  
  - A format where conversion is **reasonably feasible** based on the above factors.

> This ensures fair access while respecting institutional constraints.
