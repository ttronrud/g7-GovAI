**Summary of the Regulation:**

On November 4, 2015, the federal government formally transferred certain responsibilities and authorities related to **multiculturalism** from the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (DCI)** to the **Department of Canadian Heritage (DCH)**.

This transfer consists of two key components:

1. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The Governor General in Council transferred to the Department of Canadian Heritage the **control and supervision** of those portions of the federal public administration within the **Citizenship and Multiculturalism Branch** of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration that specifically relate to **multiculturalism**.  
   
   This means that the administrative oversight, day-to-day management, and operational responsibilities for multiculturalism programs, policies, and initiatives previously managed under the DCI are now placed under the authority of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

2. **Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions:**  
   The **Minister of Canadian Heritage** is granted the full **powers, duties, and functions** of the former **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** in all matters relating to multiculturalism.  
   
   This includes the authority to develop, implement, and enforce federal policies on multiculturalism, including funding, programming, intercultural dialogue, and the promotion of multicultural values across Canada.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- This reorganization reflects a strategic shift in how the federal government manages multiculturalism, aligning it more closely with broader cultural and social policy priorities.
- By moving multiculturalism responsibilities to the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government aimed to strengthen the integration of multiculturalism within national cultural policy, which is a core mandate of that department.
- The move also ensures that multiculturalism is better coordinated with other cultural initiatives, such as Indigenous rights, language policies, and diversity promotion, under a more centralized and cohesive framework.
- The transfer does not affect the core functions of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, such as immigration processing, citizenship services, or refugee resettlement. These remain under the original department.

**Background Context:**

The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* provides the legal mechanism for transferring administrative responsibilities between federal departments. Paragraph 2(a)(a) of that Act authorizes the transfer of duties related to public administration functions when it is in the public interest and serves broader policy objectives.

This specific transfer was part of a broader government effort to streamline and restructure federal departments to improve policy coherence, accountability, and effectiveness in addressing social and cultural issues.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation marks a significant administrative and policy shift, centralizing multiculturalism policy and operations under the Department of Canadian Heritage. It enhances the government’s capacity to promote and support multiculturalism as a national value, ensuring that it is integrated into broader cultural and social development strategies.

**Note:**  
The regulation does not affect the rights, obligations, or services provided to the public—only the administrative and ministerial oversight of multiculturalism-related functions.
