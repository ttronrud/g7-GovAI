**Regulation Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1985-2003 and Authorization of Ministerial Powers under the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance Context**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 7 of the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act** (*S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 172*). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to revoke previous orders and to authorize the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) to exercise specific regulatory powers in the context of fisheries restructuring.

**2. Revocation of Prior Order**  
The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1985-2003**, dated June 20, 1985.  
- **Reference**: P.C. 1985-2003  
- **Published in**: *Canada Gazette, Part II*, page 2961 (SOR/85-594)  
- **Purpose of Revocation**: The 1985 Order likely contained prior regulatory provisions or authorizations related to the management, ownership, or operations of certain fishery-related enterprises. Its revocation indicates a change in policy or administrative direction—possibly due to restructuring, legal challenges, or a shift in the governance framework of the fisheries sector.

This revocation effectively terminates any previous regulatory or operational authority granted under that order, clearing the way for new administrative arrangements.

**3. Authorization of New Ministerial Powers**  
In its place, the regulation **authorizes the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs)** to exercise the powers previously granted to the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** under the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act* in respect of the following three entities:

- **125459 Canada Limited**  
- **Fishery Products International Limited**  
- **125457 Canada Limited** (known as **NSHOLDCO Limited**)

**Key Points of Authorization**:
- The Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) is now empowered to perform the functions, make decisions, and enforce regulations that were previously reserved for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
- This transfer of authority reflects a **restructuring of responsibilities** within the federal government, likely to align with broader privatization efforts or to improve efficiency in managing fishery enterprises.
- The transfer is specifically limited to these three companies, indicating a targeted approach to restructuring rather than a broad overhaul of the fisheries regulatory framework.

**4. Strategic and Policy Implications**  
- **Privatization Context**: The involvement of the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) suggests that this action is part of a broader federal strategy to privatize or restructure state-owned or state-managed fisheries enterprises to enhance competitiveness, efficiency, or market responsiveness.
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: By transferring powers to a different minister, the government may be streamlining decision-making or leveraging expertise in privatization and regulatory affairs.
- **Continuity of Fisheries Oversight**: Despite the change in responsible minister, the core regulatory framework under the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act* remains intact, ensuring that fishery operations continue under legal and environmental safeguards.

**5. Effective Date and Legal Status**  
- The regulation is issued as a **proclamation** under the authority of the Governor General in Council, based on the Prime Minister’s recommendation.
- It becomes effective upon publication in the Canada Gazette (as such regulations typically do).
- It is a **binding legal instrument** with the force of law, modifying the regulatory landscape for the specified companies.

**6. Significance**  
This regulation marks a pivotal moment in the governance of Atlantic fisheries enterprises. By revoking outdated administrative directives and transferring regulatory authority to a minister with expertise in privatization, the government signals a shift toward a more market-oriented, efficient, and administratively streamlined approach to managing fishery-related businesses.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation effectively:
- Ends the legal validity of the 1985 Order (P.C. 1985-2003), which may have been outdated or inconsistent with current policy;
- Transfers key regulatory authority to the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) for three specific fishery companies;
- Supports the broader objectives of the *Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act*, including modernization, efficiency, and market-based management of fisheries enterprises.

It represents a significant administrative and policy shift, reflecting the federal government’s evolving approach to fisheries governance in the Atlantic region.
