### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the remission of GST, the following **four conditions** must be met:

1. **Acquisition Outside a Reserve**  
   The road vehicle must have been **acquired outside a reserve**.  
   → This means the purchase must have occurred in a non-reserve area of Quebec (e.g., urban or rural areas outside an official reserve).

2. **Personal Use and Consumption**  
   The vehicle must be acquired for the **personal use and consumption of the Indian**, not for commercial purposes.  
   → Exception: If the Indian is a **small supplier** (i.e., operates as a small-scale vendor or business), commercial use may be permitted, but only under strict conditions.

3. **Vehicle Not Delivered to a Reserve**  
   The vehicle must **not have been delivered to a reserve** at any time after acquisition.  
   → This ensures the vehicle remains in the hands of the Indian for personal use outside reserve territory.

4. **No Prior Rebate, Refund, or Remission**  
   The GST paid on the vehicle supply must **not have already been refunded, rebated, or remitted** under any other provision of the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act*.  
   → Prevents double benefits or misuse of the remission.

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is authorized under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make remissions or exemptions where it is in the **public interest**.
- The Minister of National Revenue makes the recommendation, indicating that the policy is implemented with administrative and fiscal oversight.

### **Policy Objectives and Public Interest Justification**

This regulation reflects a **sensitivity to Indigenous needs** and aims to:

- Reduce financial barriers to vehicle ownership among Indigenous peoples in Quebec;
- Support mobility and access to services (e.g., healthcare, education, employment) for Indigenous individuals;
- Recognize the historical and ongoing challenges Indigenous communities face in accessing transportation;
- Ensure that the remission is targeted and conditional, preventing abuse or misuse of the benefit.

---

### **Important Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes rail vehicles and electric wheelchairs** — these are not considered "road vehicles" under the definition.
- **No commercial use** (except for small suppliers) — the primary intent is personal use.
- **No delivery to a reserve** — vehicles must remain outside reserve areas.
- **No prior tax relief** — ensures the remission is a one-time, standalone benefit.

### **Conclusion**

The *Certain Road Vehicle Supply Remission Order* is a targeted, conditional tax relief designed to support Indigenous individuals in Quebec who purchased motor vehicles between December 1, 1998, and January 31, 2000. It emphasizes **personal use**, **geographic exclusivity (outside reserves)**, and **proper documentation** to ensure accountability and fairness.

It represents a significant step in recognizing the unique circumstances of Indigenous communities and aligning tax policy with broader social and economic equity goals.
