**Detailed Summary of the Pasta Remission Order 1988**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Pasta Remission Order 1988* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**. This action is grounded in **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4), which empowers the federal government to make orders for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of customs duties when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

The Order may be cited as the **Pasta Remission Order 1988**.

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **remit (cancel) customs duties** that were previously paid or would have been payable on certain types of pasta imported into Canada. The remission applies specifically to pasta made from **only flour and water**, which is considered a basic, essential food product. This measure aims to support affordability, promote food security, and provide economic relief during a period of rising food costs or public health concerns—particularly relevant in the context of the 1980s and 1990s.

**Scope of the Remission**  

1. **First Remission Period (January 1, 1988 – July 31, 1995)**  
   - Applies to pasta containing **only flour and water**.  
   - Imported under **Customs Tariff item 1902.19.90**.  
   - The customs duties paid or payable on such pasta during the period from **January 1, 1988, to July 31, 1995**, are hereby remitted.  
   - This provision covers a broad timeframe, allowing for retrospective relief on imports made over nearly eight years.

2. **Second Remission Period (On or after August 1, 1995)**  
   - Applies to the same type of pasta: **only flour and water**.  
   - Imported under **Customs Tariff item 1902.19.91**.  
   - The customs duties are remitted for all imports made **on or after August 1, 1995**.  
   - This provision reflects a shift in policy or tariff classification, possibly due to changes in trade practices or classification rules, and provides forward-looking relief.

> Note: Tariff items 1902.19.90 and 1902.19.91 are specific classifications under the Canadian Customs Tariff for pasta products. These items are likely designed to distinguish between different types of pasta (e.g., by form, processing, or added ingredients), with the key criterion being that the product contains **only flour and water**—indicating a simple, unadulterated form of pasta.

**Conditions for Claiming Remission**  

A claim for remission **must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue** within **three years** of the date of importation. This is a strict time limit and is governed by **section 4** of the Order (which is referenced throughout).  

- **Key Requirement**: The claimant (e.g., importer, distributor, or retailer) must file a formal application for remission **within three years** of the import date.  
- **Failure to file within this period results in forfeiture of the right to remission**, even if the pasta was imported during the specified periods.  
- This time limit ensures administrative feasibility and prevents claims from being made decades later without due process.

**Public Interest Justification**  
The Governor General in Council determines that the remission is in the **public interest**, suggesting that the measure serves broader societal goals such as:  
- Improving access to affordable, nutritious food.  
- Supporting food security, especially in low-income households.  
- Encouraging the importation of cost-effective food staples.  
- Aligning with public health or nutritional policy objectives.

**Conclusion**  
The *Pasta Remission Order 1988* is a targeted, policy-driven measure designed to alleviate the financial burden of importing basic, nutritious foodstuffs. By remitting duties on plain pasta imported during specific periods, the government promotes food affordability and access, particularly during times of economic or social strain. However, the requirement for timely claims ensures accountability and administrative oversight. This regulation remains a notable example of how Canadian government policy can respond to public interest concerns through targeted fiscal relief in the realm of food imports.
