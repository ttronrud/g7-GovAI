In general, when a regulation is "repealed" by a Statutory Instrument such as SI/2015-96:

- It means the regulation is no longer in force.
- The repeal is typically enacted to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated legislation.
- The repeal is published in the official government journal (e.g., the Canada Gazette, the UK Statutory Instruments, or the Gazette of India, depending on jurisdiction).
- The repeal may be part of a broader legislative reform or consolidation effort.

For example, if SI/2015-96 was a UK Statutory Instrument, it might have repealed a previous environmental, health, or transport regulation. If it was Canadian, it could have repealed a rule under a federal act.

Please provide the full title or subject of the regulation (e.g., "Regulation on Food Labeling," "Rules for Public Housing," etc.) so I can deliver a detailed, accurate summary of its content, purpose, scope, and implications before it was repealed.

Until then, the only factual detail available is:  
👉 The regulation was repealed by Statutory Instrument SI/2015-96.
