**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council (the Canadian executive branch), constitutes a formal legal instrument authorizing Canada’s participation in two foundational international financial institutions established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944: the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** and the **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)** — now known as the World Bank.

---

### **Background and Context**

The regulation is grounded in the **Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1945**, which was enacted to provide the legal framework for Canada’s accession to the IMF and IBRD. The Act authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to:

- Accept the agreements on behalf of Canada;
- Make appointments and issue orders and regulations necessary to fulfill Canada’s obligations under the agreements;
- Authorize the signing of instruments confirming Canada’s acceptance of the agreements in accordance with Canadian law.

The regulation builds upon this statutory authority and responds to specific provisions within the agreements themselves, particularly regarding the conditions under which the agreements enter into force and when Canada will become a member.

### **Key Provisions of the Agreements and Their Implications**

#### 1. **Entry into Force of the Agreements**
- **IMF Agreement (Article XX):**
  - The IMF Agreement enters into force when:
    - Governments representing **65% of the total quotas** (as listed in Schedule A) have signed the agreement;
    - Each of those governments has **deposited an instrument of acceptance** with the U.S. Government, confirming:
      - That they have accepted the agreement in accordance with their domestic law;
      - That they have taken all necessary steps to fulfill their obligations.
  - Membership in the IMF begins on the date of such deposit, **but only after the agreement has entered into force**.

- **IBRD Agreement (Article XI):**
  - The IBRD Agreement enters into force when:
    - Governments whose **minimum subscriptions total at least 65% of the total quotas** in Schedule A have signed;
    - Each such government has deposited an instrument of acceptance with the U.S. Government, confirming:
      - Acceptance under domestic law;
      - Implementation of all obligations.
  - Membership in the IBRD begins on the date of deposit, **but only after the agreement has entered into force**.

> This means Canada will not become a member of either institution until the global threshold of 65% of quotas is met and the required acceptance instruments are deposited — a process that was already underway in 1944.

### **Authorization for Canadian Participation**

The regulation explicitly authorizes:

#### 1. **Appointment of Lester Bowles Pearson**
- **Lester Bowles Pearson**, Canada’s Ambassador to the United States, is authorized to:
  - Sign the **Agreements for the IMF and IBRD** on behalf of Canada;
  - Transmit to the **Government of the United States** formal instruments of acceptance, stating that:
    - Canada has accepted the agreements in accordance with Canadian law;
    - Canada has taken all necessary steps to implement its obligations under the agreements.

> This delegation of authority is crucial because it allows Canada to formally join the institutions without requiring a full parliamentary or cabinet vote for each action, as the power is already conferred by the 1945 Act.

### **Legal Effect in Canada**

The regulation establishes that certain provisions of the IMF and IBRD agreements will **take effect as law in Canada** upon Canada’s membership in each institution:

#### a. **For the International Monetary Fund (IMF):**
- **On and after Canada becomes a member**, the following provisions of **Article IX** of the IMF Agreement — specifically **Sections 2 to 9 inclusive** — shall have the **force of law in Canada**.
- These sections likely cover:
  - Definitions of key terms (e.g., "member," "quota");
  - Procedures for voting and decision-making;
  - Rules on exchange rate arrangements and balance of payments;
  - Obligations of members to maintain exchange rate stability;
  - Procedures for financial assistance and safeguards.

> This ensures that Canada is legally bound by the operational and governance rules of the IMF from the moment it becomes a member.

#### b. **For the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):**
- **On and after Canada becomes a member**, the following provisions of **Article VII** of the IBRD Agreement — specifically **Sections 2 to 9 inclusive** — shall have the **force of law in Canada**.
- These provisions likely include:
  - The purpose and structure of the Bank;
  - Eligibility criteria for borrowing;
  - Conditions for loan disbursement;
  - Procedures for repayment and interest;
  - Rules on the use of funds for reconstruction and development projects.

> This ensures that Canada is legally bound by the lending and development framework of the World Bank from the moment it joins.

### **Legal and Political Significance**

- **Concurrence by Key Ministers**: The regulation is not issued unilaterally. It is based on the **recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs** and **concurred in by the Minister of Finance**, reflecting a consensus across key departments — foreign affairs and finance — on Canada’s commitment to these international institutions.
- **Diplomatic and Economic Strategy**: Canada’s participation in the IMF and IBRD was a strategic move to:
  - Strengthen post-war economic stability;
  - Align with the global monetary system;
  - Participate in international development and financial oversight.
- **Legal Integration**: By giving specific sections of the agreements the force of law, Canada transforms international commitments into domestic legal obligations, ensuring enforceability and accountability.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a pivotal step in Canada’s integration into the post-World War II international financial architecture. It:

1. **Authorizes Canada’s formal accession** to the IMF and IBRD through the delegation of signing authority to Lester Bowles Pearson;
2. **Confirms Canada’s acceptance** of the agreements under Canadian law;
3. **Establishes domestic legal effect** for key operational and governance provisions of both institutions upon Canada’s membership;
4. **Provides a clear, legally binding pathway** for Canada to participate in global financial governance, ensuring compliance with international obligations and enabling future cooperation in monetary policy, economic stability, and development.

It reflects both the diplomatic and legal sophistication of Canada’s early post-war foreign policy and underscores the foundational role of international financial institutions in shaping global economic order.
