### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### **1. Exemption from Restrictions on Acquisitions by Canadian Banks**

For the purposes of **subparagraphs 468(3)(d)(ii)** and **930(3)(d)(ii)** of the Bank Act, the following provisions **do not apply** when determining whether a bank is permitted to acquire a **substantial investment** in another entity:

- **Subsections 468(4) to (6)** of the Bank Act

> 🔍 **Explanation**:  
> These subsections normally impose restrictions on banks acquiring substantial investments in other entities, particularly to prevent concentration of control or risk. However, this regulation **exempts** such restrictions when evaluating whether a bank may acquire a substantial investment under:
> - Subsection **466(2)** (acquisition of a substantial investment)
> - Paragraphs **466(3)(b)** or **(c)** (acquisition of control or substantial investment in a financial institution)
> - Subsection **466(4)** (acquisition of a financial institution)
> - Subsection **468(1)** or **(2)** (acquisition of control or substantial investment)

> ✅ **Effect**: A Canadian bank may acquire a substantial investment in another entity without being subject to the usual scrutiny or restrictions under subsections 468(4) to (6), provided the transaction falls within the scope of the above provisions.

- Hold a substantial investment in  
a **Canadian entity**

> ❌ **Section 522.22(1)** of the Bank Act normally applies to foreign banks and restricts their ability to acquire or hold control of Canadian entities, particularly to prevent systemic risk or undue influence.

> ✅ **Effect of the Regulation**:  
> This exemption means that **foreign banks** and **entities associated with foreign banks** are **not subject to the restrictions imposed by subsection 522.22(1)** when evaluating their ability to:
> - Acquire control of a Canadian entity
> - Hold a substantial investment in a Canadian entity  
> under:
> - Section **522.07** (acquisition of control)

> - Division 8 of Part XII of the Bank Act (which governs foreign bank activities and related controls)

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To promote financial market efficiency and integration** by allowing banks (both domestic and foreign) greater flexibility in acquiring investments, especially in financial institutions.
2. **To support cross-border financial cooperation** by removing unnecessary barriers for foreign banks to invest in or control Canadian financial entities.
3. **To ensure consistency** between the Bank Act’s investment rules and the broader financial stability framework, particularly in light of evolving financial market dynamics.
4. **To maintain prudential oversight** while allowing for strategic investments that support innovation, competition, and access to capital.

### **Limitations and Scope**

- The exemptions apply **only to specific types of transactions** under the Bank Act.
- The rules **do not eliminate all regulatory oversight** — other provisions of the Bank Act (e.g., capital adequacy, risk management, consumer protection) still apply.
- The exemptions are **targeted**, not general — they do not allow banks to bypass all restrictions on investments or control.
- The exemption applies **only when evaluating whether a transaction is permitted**, not to the actual conduct of the transaction.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **targeted exemption** from restrictive provisions of the Bank Act that would otherwise limit a bank’s ability to acquire a substantial investment in another entity — both domestically and internationally. It enhances the ability of Canadian banks and foreign banks to engage in strategic investments, while maintaining the integrity of financial regulation and systemic stability.

It reflects a policy shift toward **greater flexibility in financial market participation**, particularly in a globalized financial environment, while ensuring that prudential safeguards remain in place.
