**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Passenger Services Contract Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Railway Passenger Services Contract Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Railway Passenger Services Contract Regulations") are a set of administrative rules established by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **President of the Treasury Board**. These regulations govern the framework under which the **Government of Canada** enters into a contract with **VIA Rail Canada Inc. (VIA)** for the provision of railway passenger services.

The regulations were enacted under **Transport Vote 52d of the Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977**, which authorizes funding for railway passenger services. The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that:

- The provision of passenger rail services is financially sustainable,
- Public accountability and transparency are maintained,
- The government retains oversight over service quality, pricing, and cost structures,
- The operations of VIA are aligned with broader transportation policy objectives, and
- The financial incentives and cost controls are fair, transparent, and subject to appropriate governmental review.

### **Conditions for Contract Approval**

Before a railway passenger service contract can be entered into, the following conditions **must be met**:

1. **Treasury Board Approval**: The contract must be formally approved by the Treasury Board.
2. **Implementation Plan Approved by CN and CP**: VIA must submit an implementation plan for its involvement in passenger services, which must be jointly approved by Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific (CP)—the two major freight rail operators.
3. **Agreement with CN and CP on Cost Review**: VIA must reach an agreement with CN and CP such that any payments made to them (including financial incentives) are subject to a **review process** approved by the Minister. This review ensures that:
   - The actual costs incurred by VIA do **not exceed** those calculated using **CTC Order R-6313**, a standard developed by the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC).
   - The cost benchmark is **indexed** (adjusted annually) based on official CTC indices to account for inflation and economic changes.

> ⚠️ *This ensures that VIA does not overpay for services and that government funding remains aligned with fair, market-based cost benchmarks.*

### **Subsidiary Service Requests: Key Provisions**

A *subsidiary service request* is a formal, written request by the Minister to VIA to modify or expand service delivery. These requests are subject to strict conditions:

#### 1. **Pre-Request Planning and Projections**
- Before issuing a subsidiary service request, the Minister **must require VIA to submit**:
  - Detailed plans for the proposed service,
  - Financial projections (including revenue and cost estimates),
  - Proposed fare structures (if requested by the Minister).

#### 2. **Consultation on Fare Structures**
- The Minister may consult with:
  - Provincial governments,
  - Members of the motor carrier industry (e.g., bus companies),
  - Other relevant stakeholders.
- This consultation ensures that fare decisions consider regional economic conditions, competition, and public interest.

#### 3. **Treasury Board Approval Thresholds**
- **No subsidiary service request** may be issued without **Treasury Board approval** if:
  - It involves a payment exceeding **$10 million** in a single year, **or**
  - It relates to passenger services that are **substitutes or ancillary** to services on railway lines (e.g., shuttle services, regional connections).
- This threshold protects against unilateral or large-scale service expansions without proper fiscal oversight.

#### 4. **No Inconsistent Undertakings**
- Any subsidiary service request must **not contain undertakings that conflict with the terms of the main railway passenger service contract**.

#### 5. **Ministerial Limitations on Payments and Service Quality**
The Minister has the authority to impose limits on:
- **Maximum total payments** to VIA,
- **Pricing conditions** (i.e., caps or rules on how fares can be set),
- **Minimum level and quality of service** (e.g., frequency, reliability, comfort standards).

> ✅ This gives the government power to ensure service remains accessible, reliable, and affordable.

### **Mandatory Undertakings by VIA (Under the Contract)**

Every railway passenger service contract must include the following obligations by VIA:

1. **Compliance with Subsidiary Service Requests**  
   - VIA must comply with all subsidiary service requests issued by the Minister after consultation with the Minister.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - VIA must make its **financial accounts and records open to audit and inspection** by an authorized representative of the Minister.

3. **Reporting Requirements**  
   - VIA must provide **regular reports** to the Minister, containing information as required—such as performance metrics, financial data, passenger numbers, and service changes.

4. **Public Invitation to Tender Policy**  
   - VIA must adopt a **contract policy for public invitation to tender** that is acceptable to the Minister.  
   - This ensures that future procurement of services (e.g., equipment, maintenance) is done through transparent, competitive processes.

---

### **Prohibited Undertakings in the Contract**

No railway passenger service contract may contain any express or implied terms that:

1. **Require the Minister to pay VIA for costs incurred** (except for those covered under the **compensation method** in Section 7 of the contract).  
   - This prevents VIA from claiming reimbursement for operating expenses, which would undermine government control over spending.

2. **Preclude the Minister from participating in**:
   - Setting objectives,
   - Developing service concepts,
   - Establishing pricing policies,
   - Implementing service improvements.

> 🔍 This preserves the **government’s authority** to shape the direction of rail services in alignment with national transportation goals.

### **Payment Mechanism and Financial Incentives**

Payments to VIA under the contract or subsidiary service requests are governed by specific principles:

#### 1. **Financial Incentive Measures Are Allowed**
- Payments may include **financial incentives** designed to:
  - Encourage VIA to make **cost-effective decisions** (e.g., balancing passenger attraction with cost reduction),
  - Adjust payment terms **route-by-route** based on:
    - Competitive conditions (e.g., more competition on certain routes may reduce profitability),
    - Government policy goals (e.g., promoting rural access or environmental sustainability).

#### 2. **Payments Are Not Based on Actual Costs**
- Payments are **not calculated on actual operating costs** incurred by VIA.
- Instead, they are determined **at the time of contract or request** based on:
  - **Estimated costs** (e.g., capital and operating expenses),
  - **Estimated revenues**,
  - Subject to:
    - Minimum service quality standards,
    - Pricing conditions set by the Minister.

> 📉 This means VIA cannot claim "cost recovery" or "loss compensation" beyond the contracted amount.

#### 3. **Cost Cap Based on CTC Order R-6313**
- The estimated costs used to determine payments **must not exceed** those derived from **CTC Order R-6313**, which provides a standardized method for estimating railway operating costs.
- This cap is **subject to indexing** (annual adjustment) provided by the **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)** to reflect inflation and economic changes.
- **Exception**: Any cost estimate that exceeds the CTC benchmark **requires Ministerial approval** before being implemented.

> 💡 This ensures that VIA’s cost structure remains transparent, predictable, and aligned with industry standards—preventing cost inflation or overreach.
