**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–3**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
This exemption order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. This provision allows for the creation of temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.

The Order is formally titled:  
**Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–3**  
It was published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 2006, c. 9, s. 34, and is referenced under the *Regulations of Canada*, c. R-2 and S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2.

### **2. Scope of the Exemption**

#### **a. Exempt Entity**
The exemption applies specifically to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.

This means that the RCMP is authorized to conduct actions that would otherwise be prohibited under the Radiocommunication Act, including interference or obstruction of radiocommunications, during the specified period.

#### **b. Time Period**
The exemption is **temporary and time-limited**, running from:
- **June 21, 2010**, to  
- **June 28, 2010** (inclusive).

This narrow timeframe indicates a short-term, operationally specific need, likely tied to a particular security or safety event or emergency.

---

### **3. Geographical Limitation**

The exemption is **geographically restricted** to a defined quadrilateral area within the province of **Ontario**. The boundaries are defined by the following coordinates:

| Corner Point | Latitude | Longitude |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | 45°28′ N | 79°55′ W |
| 2 | 45°28′ N | 78°55′ W |
| 3 | 43°35′ N | 79°15′ W |
| 4 | 43°35′ N | 79°45′ W |

This region covers a portion of central and eastern Ontario, including areas near **Toronto, Ottawa, and surrounding regions**, particularly those relevant to national security operations (e.g., border zones, critical infrastructure, or high-risk zones).

> **Note**: The area is not a broad region but a precise, bounded zone, ensuring that the interference is confined to a specific location and minimizing unintended impact on broader radiocommunication services.

---

### **4. Conditions for Exemption**

The exemption is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

#### **a. For subsection 4(1) of the Radiocommunication Act**
- The radio apparatus must be **installed, operated, or possessed** specifically to:
  - **Interfere with or obstruct** a radiocommunication.
- Such interference must be carried out **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The purpose must be one of:
  - **Security**
  - **Safety**
  - **International relations**

> This ensures that the interference is not arbitrary or for commercial, recreational, or non-essential purposes.

#### **b. For paragraph 9(1)(b) of the Radiocommunication Act**
- Interference or obstruction must be carried out **for the purpose of security, safety, or international relations**.

> This aligns with the broader intent of the Act to protect lawful radiocommunications, while allowing exceptional measures during national emergencies or threats.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization**

A key requirement of the Order is that **every reasonable effort must be made** to:

- **Confinement to the smallest physical area**  
- **Limit to the fewest number of frequencies**  
- **Restrict to the minimum duration** required to achieve the intended objective

This principle reflects a **principle of proportionality and necessity**, ensuring that interference is not excessive or indiscriminate. It emphasizes that any disruption must be targeted, temporary, and justified by the urgency of the security, safety, or international relations concern.

---

### **6. Purpose of the Order**

The overarching objective of this exemption is to enable the **RCMP to carry out authorized interference or obstruction of radiocommunications** in a specific geographic area during a defined period, in order to:

- Protect national security (e.g., counter-terrorism, prevent espionage)
- Ensure public safety (e.g., during emergencies, natural disasters, or critical infrastructure threats)
- Support international relations (e.g., during diplomatic events or crisis management)

This is a **temporary and exceptional measure**, not a routine or permanent policy.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Department of Justice or the appropriate regulatory body. The registration date is not specified in the text but would typically be the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette* or official government register.

### **Conclusion**

The *Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–3* is a **targeted, time-limited, and geographically bounded exemption** that allows the RCMP to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications in a specific area of Ontario during a short period. The exemption is strictly limited to cases of **security, safety, or international relations**, and must be carried out in a manner that minimizes disruption to other users of the radio spectrum. It serves as a critical tool for national emergency response while maintaining regulatory integrity and public accountability.
