The regulation you have provided is a formal notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Below is a detailed and accurate summary of the text:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the completion of scientific assessments of wildlife species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of Assessments:**  
   The Governor in Council formally acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments conducted by COSEWIC for specific species listed in the annexed schedule. These assessments are required under subsection 23(1) of SARA and are central to the Act’s process of identifying species at risk.

2. **Purpose of the Assessment:**  
   The COSEWIC assessments evaluate the current status of each species—including its distribution, population trends, threats, and overall risk of extinction. These evaluations are based on scientific and technical data and are used to determine whether a species is at risk of becoming extinct in the wild.

3. **Legal Significance:**  
   Upon the Governor in Council acknowledging the assessments, the findings become part of the official basis for determining whether a species qualifies as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under the *Species at Risk Act*. This step is a prerequisite for any subsequent designation or listing of species under SARA.

4. **Process Flow:**  
   - COSEWIC conducts the scientific review and issues a status report.  
   - The Minister of the Environment recommends that the Governor in Council acknowledge the assessment.  
   - This regulation serves as the formal government action to recognize and accept the COSEWIC findings as valid and official.  
   - The listed species in the annexed schedule are then considered for formal listing under SARA.

5. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The regulation includes a schedule listing the species that have been assessed by COSEWIC. These species are subject to further evaluation and may be designated as at risk under the Act. The specific names and scientific classifications of the species are included in the schedule (not reproduced here, as it is annexed to the regulation).

6. **Effective Date:**  
   The regulation comes into force upon its making (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette), and the acknowledgment of assessments takes effect immediately.

**Implications:**

- This step initiates or confirms the formal listing process for species under SARA.  
- It triggers further federal actions, such as the development of recovery strategies, conservation measures, and protection under the Act.  
- It provides a transparent, science-based foundation for species protection in Canada.

**Note on Legal Context:**  
The *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29) is a key piece of Canadian environmental legislation designed to prevent the extinction of species at risk and to promote their recovery. COSEWIC plays a critical role as the independent scientific body that provides the authoritative scientific assessment upon which government decisions are based.

**In Summary:**  
This regulation formally recognizes the completion of scientific evaluations by COSEWIC for a list of species under the *Species at Risk Act*. By acknowledging these assessments, the federal government confirms the scientific basis for potential species listings, thereby enabling the next steps in conservation, protection, and recovery planning under SARA.

This summary is consistent with the structure and intent of SARA and the role of COSEWIC in the Canadian species at risk framework.
