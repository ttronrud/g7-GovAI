The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed by operation of law, 2014, c. 38, s. 5]"

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (or provision) was **repealed**—that is, officially canceled or abolished—by **operation of law** in the year **2014**, under **Act No. 38** (commonly referred to as "2014, c. 38"), specifically in **section 5** of that act.

#### Key Points:

1. **Repeal by Operation of Law**:  
   This means the regulation was not repealed by a formal legislative vote or a specific amendment, but rather through the automatic legal effect of a new law (in this case, Act 38, 2014). "Operation of law" implies that the repeal was a direct consequence of the enactment of the new legislation, without needing separate legislative action to remove the old rule.

2. **Year and Citation**:  
   The repeal occurred in **2014**, under **Chapter 38** of the Statutes of the relevant jurisdiction (likely a Canadian province or territory, given the format).  
   - "c. 38" refers to the chapter number of the act.  
   - "s. 5" refers to section 5 of that act.

3. **Multiple Instances**:  
   The statement appears three times, suggesting that either:
   - The same regulation was referenced in multiple sections or contexts, or
   - There was a formatting or duplication error in the original document.

4. **Legal Consequence**:  
   Once a regulation is repealed by operation of law, it is no longer in force. Any legal effect, obligations, or rights derived from it are extinguished. It is considered legally void from the effective date of the repeal.

5. **Jurisdictional Context**:  
   The citation format (e.g., "c. 38, s. 5") is typical of Canadian statutory law, particularly in provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, or others that use a similar legislative numbering system. The repeal likely pertains to a regulation under a provincial or territorial statute that was no longer needed or was superseded by new legislation.

---

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially and automatically repealed** in **2014** by **section 5 of Act No. 38**. It is no longer in legal effect. The repetition of the same repeal notice three times may reflect a technical or formatting issue, but it does not indicate multiple distinct regulations. As such, the provision is considered **inactive and void** under current law.
