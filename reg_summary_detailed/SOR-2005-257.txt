### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation provides a precise legal definition of the term **"settler"** as used in the context of **tariff item No. 9807.00.00** under the *Customs Tariff*. The tariff item pertains to the classification and duty treatment of certain goods, and this definition helps determine whether a person entering Canada qualifies as a "settler" — a category that may affect customs classification, duty obligations, or other regulatory considerations.

### **Definition of "Settler"**

For the purpose of tariff item 9807.00.00, the term **"settler"** means:

> *Any person who enters Canada with the intention of establishing, for the first time, a residence for a period of not less than 12 months.*

This definition is critical because it distinguishes individuals who are genuinely establishing a long-term presence in Canada from those who are temporarily present for other purposes.

### **Exclusions from the Definition of "Settler"**

The following categories of individuals are **explicitly excluded** from being considered "settlers" under this regulation:

1. **Persons entering Canada for employment purposes**  
   – If the individual enters Canada solely for the purpose of employment, and such employment is for a period **not exceeding 36 months**, they are not considered settlers.  
   – This exclusion ensures that temporary workers or those on short-term employment contracts are not classified as settlers, which could impact tariff treatment.

2. **Persons entering Canada for educational purposes**  
   – Individuals who enter Canada to study at an educational institution (such as a university, college, or training program) are not considered settlers.  
   – This recognizes that students are temporary residents with temporary status and do not intend to establish a permanent residence.

3. **Persons performing preclearance activities on behalf of the U.S. Government**  
   – Individuals engaged in **preclearance activities** under the **Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance** between Canada and the United States (signed March 16, 2015) are excluded.  
   – These activities are administrative and operational in nature, carried out by government personnel to facilitate cross-border transportation, and are not related to establishing a residence.

### **Key Features and Implications**

- **Residence Intent:** The definition hinges on the **intention to establish a residence** — not just physical presence.  
- **Minimum Duration:** The residence must be intended to last **at least 12 months**. This establishes a threshold for what constitutes a "settler" as opposed to a temporary visitor.  
- **First-Time Residence:** The term "for the first time" implies that individuals who have previously resided in Canada are not considered settlers under this definition, even if they return.  
- **Customs and Tariff Implications:** The classification as a "settler" may influence how goods are classified under tariff item 9807.00.00 — for example, whether certain goods are subject to specific duties, quotas, or restrictions.  
- **Clarity and Consistency:** The regulation provides clear boundaries to avoid ambiguity in determining who qualifies as a settler, reducing potential disputes in customs processing.

### **Repeal Note**

The regulation includes a note stating:  
> "[Repeal]"  
This likely indicates that the regulation is **repealed or superseded** by a later amendment or statute, though the specific repeal is not detailed in the provided text. It may suggest that this definition is no longer in force or has been replaced by updated provisions. However, without additional context, the exact nature or timing of the repeal cannot be confirmed from this excerpt.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a clear, legally binding definition of "settler" for tariff purposes under item 9807.00.00. It ensures that only individuals with a genuine, long-term intention to reside in Canada (for at least 12 months) are classified as settlers — while excluding those entering for temporary employment, education, or government-related preclearance duties. The regulation enhances transparency and consistency in customs classification and duty application, particularly in distinguishing between temporary and permanent residents.

**Note:** Given the date of enactment (1997) and the mention of a 2015 U.S.-Canada agreement, this regulation may be outdated or superseded by newer legislation. A thorough review of current tariff and immigration regulations would be necessary to determine its current applicability.
