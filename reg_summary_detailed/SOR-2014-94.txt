---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Rules of Procedure for Rail Level of Service Arbitration** are issued by the **Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** under **subsection 169.36(1)a of the Canada Transportation Act (CTA)**.  
- **Statutory references**:  
  - S.C. 2013, c. 31, s. 11  
  - S.C. 1996, c. 10  

These rules govern the procedural framework for resolving disputes between rail operators and shippers related to **level of service** (i.e., the quality, reliability, and performance of rail transportation services), particularly under **Division II of Part IV of the CTA**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Rules**
The primary objectives of these rules are:
- To enable parties to a dispute to reach a **commercially fair and reasonable resolution**.
- To ensure that disputes are resolved **justly, expeditiously, and inexpensively** through arbitration.
- To promote **efficiency, transparency, and accessibility** in the arbitration process.

- **Day**: A calendar day (including weekends and holidays).
- **Document**: Any information recorded or stored in any form (e.g., electronic, paper, audio, video).

### **4. Flexibility and Discretion of the Arbitrator**
The arbitrator is granted significant discretion to:
- **Dispense with or amend** any rule if doing so improves the efficiency or effectiveness of the process.
- **Extend or abridge time limits** (e.g., deadlines for submissions, hearings) before or after they expire, depending on circumstances.

> This flexibility ensures that the process can adapt to practical realities without compromising fairness.

---

### **5. Confidentiality Requirements**
- If any information related to the arbitration is to remain confidential:
  - All individuals who will have access to such information must **sign a confidentiality agreement** before gaining access.
- This protects sensitive business or operational data while maintaining the integrity of the process.

---

### **6. Language of Arbitration**
- If the parties agree on the official language (English or French), they must **notify the Agency in writing** along with each proposal.

- If a document is not fully received or is only partially received:
  - The sender must **deliver a paper copy as soon as feasible** upon request.

Strict rules apply to protect impartiality and ensure fairness:
- **No party or their counsel may speak directly to the arbitrator** without the presence of the other party or their legal representative.
