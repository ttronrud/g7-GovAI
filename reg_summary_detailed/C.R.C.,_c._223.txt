**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Wheat Order**

---

**1. Citation and Purpose**  
This regulation is officially titled the *Ontario Wheat Order* and serves as a legal instrument under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (referred to as the "Act"). It establishes specific rules and powers related to the marketing of wheat in Ontario, particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi). This foundational legislation provides the legal framework for regulating the marketing of farm products, including wheat.  
- **Board**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (Régie), an agency established under the Act to oversee the marketing of farm products, including wheat.  
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), a specialized body created under the Act to manage the marketing of wheat specifically.  
- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan or regulations developed under the Act governing the marketing of wheat. This includes any amendments made to such plans or regulations.  
- **Wheat**: Defined broadly as *wheat of every variety produced in Ontario* (blé), ensuring inclusivity across all types of wheat grown within the province.

**3. Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**  

Both the Board and the Commodity Board are granted broad regulatory powers over the marketing of wheat. Specifically, they may:  

- Regulate the marketing of wheat in **interprovincial and export trade**.  
- Exercise **all or any powers** that they would otherwise have in relation to the **local marketing of wheat within Ontario**, including powers related to pricing, distribution, and market controls — but **only with respect to persons and property located within Ontario**.  

This means that the Boards can apply local marketing rules and enforcement mechanisms to activities involving wheat that occur outside Ontario (e.g., sales to other provinces or foreign buyers), as long as those activities involve entities or assets within the province.

**4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant to Interprovincial and Export Trade)**  

This section outlines the specific authority granted to the **Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board** regarding levies and charges in the context of interprovincial and export marketing.

> **[Note: Section has been revoked — SOR/80-90]**  
> This is a critical point: The provision regarding the Commodity Board’s authority to make orders on levies or charges was **revoked** by *Statutory Order No. 80-90* (SOR/80-90). This means that the power to impose, classify, and collect levies or charges on wheat marketers — including the ability to group marketers and set different levies based on group membership — **no longer exists** under this regulation as of the date of revocation.

---

**5. Former Authority of the Commodity Board (Prior to Revocation)**  

*Before the revocation*, the Commodity Board had the following powers:

- **Make and enforce orders** setting **levies or charges** on persons engaged in the marketing of wheat (as defined in section 3 of the Act).  
- **Classify** these marketing persons into **different groups** (e.g., by size, type of operation, or market activity).  
- **Fix different levies or charges** for each group, allowing for differentiated financial obligations.  
- **Collect** these levies or charges from the relevant parties.  

These levies or charges were not merely administrative; they could be used for several key purposes, including:  
- **Creating reserves** (funds to be used in times of market downturns or price volatility).  
- **Covering expenses and losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of wheat (e.g., storage, transportation, or market fluctuations).  
- **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among wheat producers to ensure fair distribution of income derived from sales.  

For example, if wheat prices dropped during a particular season, the Commodity Board could use levies to create a reserve or distribute funds to producers to offset losses, thereby stabilizing the income of farmers.

**6. Current Status and Implications**  

- The **key power to impose and collect levies or charges** on wheat marketers has been **formally revoked**.  
- As a result, the Commodity Board **no longer has the authority** to:  
  - Classify marketers into groups.  
  - Set different levies or charges based on group membership.  
  - Use levies to fund reserves, cover losses, or adjust producer payments.  

This revocation likely reflects a shift in policy — possibly due to changing market conditions, a desire to reduce administrative costs, or a move toward more market-based or producer-led pricing models.

- The **overall regulatory framework** for wheat marketing remains in place under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* and the *Plan*, but the specific mechanism for financial levies has been removed.

---

**7. Conclusion**  

The *Ontario Wheat Order* provides a foundational legal structure for regulating wheat marketing in Ontario. While it originally empowered the Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board to impose and manage levies to support producer stability and market resilience, **this authority has been formally revoked** (SOR/80-90).  

As a result:  
- The Commodity Board no longer collects levies or charges from wheat marketers.  
- There is no longer a mechanism for group-based levies or financial equalization among producers.  
- The Board and the general Farm Products Marketing Board retain broader regulatory powers over interprovincial and export marketing, but the financial tools for producer support have been removed.  

This reflects a significant change in the governance and financial structure of Ontario’s wheat marketing system, shifting away from a producer-supported levy model toward a more market-driven or centralized regulatory approach.

**Recommendation for Stakeholders**  
Producers, marketers, and industry participants should be aware that any financial support or loss-sharing mechanisms previously tied to levies are no longer available under this regulation. Alternative funding or risk-mitigation strategies (such as crop insurance or cooperative arrangements) may need to be explored.
