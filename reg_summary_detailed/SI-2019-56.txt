It appears that you've started to provide a regulation for me to summarize, but the actual content of the regulation is missing. Could you please paste or include the full text of the regulation you'd like me to analyze and summarize in detail?

Once I have the regulation, I will provide a comprehensive, structured summary that includes:

- The purpose and scope of the regulation  
- Key definitions and terms  
- Applicable entities or jurisdictions  
- Required actions, obligations, or standards  
- Penalties or enforcement mechanisms  
- Relevant dates, timelines, or compliance deadlines  
- Any exceptions or exemptions  
- How it interacts with other laws or regulations  

Please share the regulation text so I can assist you effectively.
