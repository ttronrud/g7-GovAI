### **1. Purpose and Legal Authority**
These regulations establish rules governing traffic and pedestrian movement on the **"land side"** of airports — that is, areas of airport property not used for aircraft operations and accessible to the general public. The regulations were made under the authority of:

- **Section 2a of the Government Property Traffic Act**, and  
- **Section 4.9b of the Aeronautics Act**,  

on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.

The primary objective is to **ensure public safety**, **protect persons and goods**, and **maintain the efficient operation** of airport facilities by regulating vehicle and pedestrian traffic on land-based portions of airports.

These regulations apply to the **land side of airports listed in Schedules 1 or 2**.

Each airport in Schedule 2 has a designated **parking fine category** (column 1), which determines the applicable parking fines (column 3). This categorization helps enforce consistent and proportionate penalties based on airport size and location.
