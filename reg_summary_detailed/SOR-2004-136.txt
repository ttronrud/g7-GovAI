The provided text consists of four repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2015-142, s. 3]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2015-142, section 3**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Repealed**: The regulation in question was formally removed from legal effect through **SOR/2015-142, section 3**.
- **SOR/2015-142**: This stands for *Statutory Instrument 2015-142*, a document issued by the Government of Canada that contains amendments or repeals to existing laws or regulations.
- **Section 3**: This section specifically contains the legal provision that declares the repeal of the prior regulation.
- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been officially canceled and is not applicable under current law.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they are outdated, inconsistent with current policy, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation. The repeal in this case suggests that the prior rule was rendered obsolete or unnecessary by the changes introduced in SOR/2015-142.

### Important Notes:
- The original content of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided text, so a detailed summary of its substance (e.g., what it regulated, who it applied to, or what obligations it imposed) **cannot be provided** without access to the original regulation.
- The repetition of the same line four times may be a formatting or technical error in the source document, but it does not alter the legal meaning—each instance confirms the same repeal.

### Conclusion:
The entry "[Repealed, SOR/2015-142, s. 3]" means that a specific regulation was officially canceled by the Government of Canada through Statutory Instrument 2015-142, section 3. As a result, the regulation is no longer valid or enforceable. However, without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed description of its content or impact cannot be offered. To understand the full context, one would need to consult the original regulation prior to its repeal.
