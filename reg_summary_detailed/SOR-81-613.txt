### **Overview**

The *National Historic Parks Wildlife and Domestic Animals Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Wildlife and Domestic Animals Regulations") are a set of administrative rules established by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Treasury Board. These regulations govern the protection of wildlife and the management of domestic animals within **National Historic Parks of Canada**.

The regulations aim to:
- Protect native wildlife from disturbance, hunting, and harm.
- Prevent the introduction of non-native (exotic) species and domestic animals into protected areas.
- Ensure public safety and environmental integrity.
- Allow for limited, authorized exceptions for scientific, management, or operational purposes.

These regulations are enforceable within all **National Historic Parks** of Canada and are designed to align with broader conservation principles and environmental protection goals.
