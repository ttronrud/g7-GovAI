**Detailed Summary of the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Divestiture Regulations**

**Regulatory Background and Authority**  
The *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Divestiture Regulations* were issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under two key statutory authorities:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**: This provision empowers the Treasury Board to make regulations concerning the superannuation of public servants who transition from one employer to another due to divestiture or restructuring.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: This grants the Treasury Board the authority to make regulations relating to the administration of public service superannuation and related financial matters.

These regulations were enacted in **1992** (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22) as part of a broader policy to manage the transition of employees from the **St. Lawrence Seaway Authority (SLSA)** — a federal Crown corporation — to new employers following its divestiture.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), which governs the superannuation rights of public servants.
- **New Employer**: A person or entity that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, assumes the functions and responsibilities previously carried out by the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority. This includes any individual or organization acting on behalf of such a body.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

1. **Applicability**:
   - These regulations apply to individuals who:
     - Were **deemed to be part of the public service** under the *Divestiture of Service Transitional Coverage Regulations*;
     - **Cease to be employed in the public service** and **become employed by a new employer** on or **after April 1, 1999**.

2. **Exclusions**:
   - **Re-employment**: The regulations **do not apply** to individuals who later become re-employed by the new employer.
   - **Options under Section 3(2)**: Sections 4 to 9 (which may relate to transitional benefits or service credit) **do not apply** to individuals who have exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA.
   - **Pension and death benefits under Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 of the Act** only apply **on and after the date** a person ceases employment with the new employer.

---

### **Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **1. Extension of Option Period for Eligible Individuals**
- Despite the general rule that options under subsection **12(3)** (for early retirement) or **section 13.01** (for death benefits) are time-limited, this regulation provides an **extension**.
- If a person would have been eligible to exercise such an option under the PSSA **but for these regulations**, they may do so **no later than one year after ceasing employment** with the public service and beginning work with the new employer.
- This ensures that individuals who may have missed the original window due to transition circumstances still have a reasonable opportunity to access certain benefits.

#### **2. Deemed Non-Employment with the New Employer**
- If a person exercises an option under subsection (2) (presumably referring to an early retirement or exit option), they are **deemed not to have become employed by the new employer** for the purposes of:
  - These regulations;
  - Sections 83 to 99 of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations* (which govern pension and benefit calculations).
- As a result, they **lose entitlement** to any further options under subsection (1) upon ceasing employment with the new employer.

> This provision prevents double-counting or overlapping benefits and ensures clarity in benefit eligibility after a transition.

#### **3. Death Benefits for Survivors**
- Under **subsection 12(8)** of the PSSA:
  - The **surviving spouse and children** of a person who dies while employed by the new employer are entitled to a **return of contributions** (i.e., a refund of the employee’s contributions to the superannuation fund).
- Under **subsection 13(3)**:
  - Survivors are entitled to an **allowance** (similar to a survivor’s pension) as described in **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the Act.
  - This allowance is subject to the **same limitations** as those in subsections 12(4) and (5) of the Act (e.g., age, duration of service, or number of dependents).

#### **4. Child Allowance for Stepchildren or Adopted Children**
- Under **subsection 26(2)** of the PSSA:
  - A child who is **born to, adopted by, or becomes a stepchild** of a person during the period between:
    - The date the person **ceases employment in the public service**;
    - And the date the person **ceases employment with the new employer**,
  - Is entitled to an **allowance under Part I of the Act** (which governs family benefits).

> This provision ensures that family members formed during the transition period are not excluded from benefits.

#### **5. One-Year Period for Section 10(5)**
- Section 10(5) of the PSSA establishes a one-year period for certain benefits (e.g., family benefits or spousal allowances).
- In this regulation, the **one-year period begins on the date the person ceases employment with the new employer**, not on the date of leaving public service.

> This clarifies the start date for benefit eligibility, aligning it with the end of employment with the new employer.

#### **6. Pensionable Service and Age Determination**
- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with the **new employer** that begins on the date the person ceases public service and ends when they cease employment with the new employer.
- The **age of the person** for the purposes of pension eligibility (under sections 12 and 13) is the age on the day they **cease employment with the new employer**.

> These provisions ensure that service with the new employer is counted toward pension entitlements and that eligibility is based on the actual date of transition, not the date of leaving public service.

#### **7. Classification of Contributors**
- All individuals covered by these regulations are considered **Group 1 contributors** under the PSSA.
- Group 1 contributors typically include public servants who are employed in the federal government and are subject to the standard superannuation scheme.

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on April 1, 1999**.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To ensure a fair and orderly transition** of public service employees from the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority to new employers following its divestiture.
2. **To maintain continuity of superannuation rights** during and after the transition, including:
   - Retirement and early retirement options;
   - Survivor benefits;
   - Family benefits;
   - Pensionable service credit.
3. **To prevent gaps or inconsistencies** in benefit entitlements due to timing differences between leaving public service and joining a new employer.
4. **To clarify definitions and timelines** to reduce administrative confusion and ensure legal certainty for employees and pension administrators.

---

### **Significance and Practical Impact**

- Employees who transitioned from the SLSA to a new employer after April 1, 1999, were protected under these rules.
- The one-year extension for exercising options provided **greater flexibility** and **access to benefits**.
- The inclusion of stepchildren and adopted children during the transition period **expanded family protection**.
- The recognition of service with the new employer as pensionable service **ensures that transition periods are not lost**.
- The clear definition of "new employer" and the exclusion of re-employed individuals help **prevent benefit duplication or misapplication**.

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Divestiture Regulations* are a targeted, legally grounded set of rules designed to manage the superannuation transition of public servants who moved from the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority to new employers. They preserve the integrity of public service pension rights during a major organizational change, provide clarity on eligibility timelines, and ensure that both individual and family benefits are protected. The regulations reflect a careful balance between administrative efficiency and employee protection, consistent with the broader goals of the Public Service Superannuation Act.
