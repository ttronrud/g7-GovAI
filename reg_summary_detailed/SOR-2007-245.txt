### **Overview**

## **Core Principles and Objectives**

1. **Transparency and Access to Records**  
   - The Board or a manager has the right to access and obtain copies of all records related to the administration of local or other revenues.
   - The First Nation must provide access without delay upon request.

2. **Accountability and Oversight**  
   - The Board maintains control over records during co-management or third-party management.
   - Records must be returned to the First Nation upon termination of the arrangement.

3. **Preservation of First Nation Authority**  
   - The Board does **not** replace the council’s decision-making powers; it only acts **in the place of the council** under specific circumstances (e.g., paragraph 53(2)(a)) and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

4. **Path to Full Financial Autonomy**  
   - The regulations emphasize **recovery and restoration** of First Nation control through structured remedial planning and reporting.

5. **Cooperative Governance**  
   - The Board is required to work cooperatively with the First Nation council, tax administrators, and designated employees to enable the community to regain full responsibility over its finances.
