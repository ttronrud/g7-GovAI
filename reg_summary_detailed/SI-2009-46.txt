### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Action:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, has issued a statutory repeal order under the authority granted by the *Public Service Employment Act*.

**Key Provisions and Timeline:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2008-799 (April 25, 2008)**  
   - The Governor General in Council repeals **Order in Council P.C. 2008-799**, which was issued on April 25, 2008.  
   - This order was likely a regulatory instrument that defined or modified the roles, responsibilities, or appointment processes for certain public service positions, particularly concerning departmental and deputy head-level appointments.  
   - The repeal becomes effective on **July 1, 2009**.  
   - This action removes the legal authority and provisions of the 2008 Order from force and effect, meaning that any rules or definitions established in that Order are no longer valid.

2. **Repeal of Specific Paragraphs from the Public Service Employment Act**  
   - The regulation further repeals **paragraphs (b) and (c)** of the definition of "department" and "deputy head" in **subsection 2(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*.  
   - These paragraphs were likely outdated or inconsistent with evolving public service structures or governance frameworks.  
   - The repeal takes effect on **January 1, 2016**.  
   - This change simplifies or modernizes the legal definitions of key public service roles, ensuring alignment with current administrative practices.

3. **Legal Authority and Basis**  
   - The repeal is authorized under:
     - **Paragraph (b) of the definition "department"** and  
     - **Paragraph (b) of the definition "deputy head"** in **subsection 2(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act*.  
   - This authority allows the federal government to amend or remove provisions that no longer serve a functional or legal purpose.

4. **Reference to Supporting Legislation and Statutory Instruments**  
   - The regulation references:
     - **S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13** – This refers to the original enactment of the *Public Service Employment Act* (or related amendments), which may have established the framework for departmental and leadership definitions.
     - **SI/2008-44** – A Statutory Instrument from 2008 that may have introduced or modified definitions related to public service roles and could be linked to the 2008 Order in Council.

5. **Status of the Repeal**  
   - The repeal of Order P.C. 2008-799 is **fully effective as of July 1, 2009**, and is formally noted as **"Repealed, SI/2009-46"**, indicating that it was officially removed by a subsequent Statutory Instrument issued on April 27, 2009 (SI/2009-46), which confirms the repeal.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- The repeal of Order P.C. 2008-799 and the specific definitions in subsection 2(1) reflects a broader effort by the federal government to:
  - Streamline public service governance,
  - Remove outdated or redundant provisions,
  - Improve clarity in the definitions of key administrative roles (e.g., department and deputy head),
  - Align public service employment rules with modern organizational structures and accountability standards.

- By removing the 2008 Order and its associated definitions, the government ensures that current public service employment practices are based on up-to-date, transparent, and legally sound frameworks.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative update to the *Public Service Employment Act*. It formally repeals an outdated order and removes two specific definitions that were no longer relevant or appropriate. The changes take effect in two stages:
- **July 1, 2009** – for the repeal of Order P.C. 2008-799,
- **January 1, 2016** – for the removal of paragraphs (b) and (c) in the definitions of "department" and "deputy head."

These actions contribute to greater legal clarity, administrative efficiency, and alignment with contemporary public service management practices.
