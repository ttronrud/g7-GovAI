**Detailed Summary of the Indian Referendum Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Referendum Regulations* are a set of administrative rules governing the conduct of referendums under specific provisions of the *Indian Act* (Act). These regulations provide a detailed procedural framework to ensure that referendums—particularly those concerning band membership, designation, or surrender—are conducted fairly, transparently, and in compliance with legal standards.

The regulations apply only to referendums held under:
- Subparagraph 39(1)(b)(iii) of the *Indian Act*,
- Subsection 39(2) of the *Indian Act*, or
- Section 39.1 of the *Indian Act*.

These provisions typically relate to decisions about the designation of a band (e.g., changing from a status as a First Nation to a status as a reserve or other legal entity) or a surrender of reserve status.
