**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Equivalency Order**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation, known as the **Alberta Equivalency Order**, is a formal legal instrument issued under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)*, 1999 (as amended). It establishes that certain federal environmental regulations—specifically those made under **subsection 34(1) of CEPA**—do **not apply** in the **Province of Alberta**.

The Order is grounded in a **prior agreement** between the **federal Minister of the Environment** and the **Government of Alberta**, dated **June 1, 1994**. This agreement confirmed that Alberta already has **environmental laws and regulatory provisions** that are **functionally equivalent** to the federal regulations under CEPA's subsection 34(1). Additionally, it affirmed that Alberta’s existing laws provide **similar mechanisms** to those in CEPA sections 108 to 110 for investigating alleged environmental offences.

### **Legal Authority and Procedural Basis**

The Order is made under **subsection 34(6)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act*, which allows the Minister of the Environment to declare that certain federal regulations **do not apply** in a province where equivalent provincial legislation exists.

The Minister of the Environment:
- Published a **copy of the June 1, 1994 agreement** in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **July 23, 1994** (under subsection 34(7) of CEPA), confirming the existence of equivalency.
- Also published a **proposed Order** in the same Gazette on the same date (under subsection 48(1) of CEPA), outlining the specific regulations that would be excluded from application in Alberta.

This procedural step ensures transparency and compliance with CEPA’s requirements for provincial equivalency assessments.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

The Order **excludes the following federal regulations and provisions** from application in Alberta:

1. **Vinyl Chloride Release Regulations, SOR/92-631**  
   - Prohibits or limits the release of vinyl chloride gas into the environment.  
   - This regulation is **not applicable** in Alberta due to the existence of equivalent provincial controls.

2. **Secondary Lead Smelter Release Regulations, SOR/91-155**  
   - Regulates emissions of pollutants (such as lead and dioxins) from secondary lead smelting operations.  
   - Alberta’s environmental laws provide equivalent control measures, so this federal regulation is **not in force** in the province.

3. **Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans Regulations, SOR/92-267**  
   - Controls the discharge of chlorinated dioxins and furans from pulp and paper mills.  
   - Alberta has equivalent regulations governing these pollutants, so this federal regulation is **not applicable**.

4. **Specific provisions from the Pulp and Paper Mill Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulations, SOR/92-268**  
   - The following subsections and paragraphs are excluded:
     - **Subsection 4(1)** – Likely relates to reporting or recordkeeping obligations.
     - **Subsection 6(2)** – May pertain to emission limits or operational requirements.
     - **Paragraph 6(3)(b)** – Possibly addresses specific chemical or process controls.
     - **Sections 7 and 9** – May cover monitoring, reporting, or compliance procedures.
   - These provisions are **not applicable in Alberta** because the province has equivalent regulatory frameworks in place.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- **Avoid regulatory duplication** between federal and provincial governments.
- Recognize that Alberta has **sufficiently robust and effective environmental protection laws** that meet or exceed the standards set by the federal regulations under CEPA.
- Ensure that **provincial authorities** have full jurisdiction over environmental enforcement and compliance within their borders.

By declaring that these specific federal regulations do not apply, the Order:
- **Saves Alberta industry and regulatory bodies** from unnecessary compliance burdens.
- **Strengthens provincial environmental governance** by allowing Alberta to manage its own environmental risks using locally tailored, context-sensitive rules.
- Reflects the principle of **regulatory harmonization** and **shared environmental responsibility** between federal and provincial levels.
