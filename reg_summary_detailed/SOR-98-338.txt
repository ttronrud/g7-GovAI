### **Main Provisions**

#### **1. Remission Amount and Duration**
- The importer is entitled to a **remission of 97% of the customs duties** paid or payable under the *Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations*.
- This remission applies to the **temporary importation** of vessels engaged in coasting trade.
- The total period for which the remission can be claimed is **a maximum of 15 months**.

> **Note**: The remission is not a full exemption but a substantial reduction (97%) of the duties, which may still leave a small residual duty payable.

#### **2. Conditions for Eligibility**
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Vessel must operate under a coasting trade licence**  
   → The vessel must be legally authorized to operate in domestic coastal trade under the *Coasting Trade Act*.

2. **Vessel must be imported into Canadian waters between October 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997**  
   → The importation must occur within this specific timeframe. This establishes a historical window for eligibility.

3. **Claim must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of the Order coming into force**  
   → The deadline for filing a claim is **two years from June 11, 1998** (i.e., by **June 11, 2000**). This is a strict deadline to ensure timely processing and administrative feasibility.

4. **The importer must provide evidence or information proving entitlement**  
   → The claimant must submit documentation to demonstrate that all eligibility criteria are satisfied, including proof of:
   - Valid coasting trade licence,
   - Temporary importation within the specified period,
   - Compliance with vessel duty regulations.

---

### **Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on June 11, 1998**.  
- All claims must be filed no later than June 11, 2000.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- The Order is authorized under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**, which permits the Governor General in Council to make remissions of customs duties on specific grounds, particularly where such remission serves public interest or supports economic activity in a specific sector.
- It operates within the framework of the *Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations*, which already provide mechanisms for reducing or eliminating duties on vessels engaged in certain maritime activities.

---

### **Purpose and Context**
This remission Order appears to be a targeted policy measure aimed at:
- Supporting the **economic viability** of Alaska Marine Lines, Inc., a company involved in domestic maritime transport.
- Encouraging participation in **coasting trade** by reducing the financial burden of customs duties on temporary vessel imports.
- Promoting **domestic maritime activity** and regional connectivity, especially in remote or northern regions of Canada.

It reflects a broader trend in Canadian trade policy to support domestic transportation sectors through targeted duty relief, particularly for vessels operating within national borders.

---

### **Key Limitations and Notes**
- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond the specified importation window (October 1, 1996 – December 31, 1997).
- The **97% reduction** is substantial but not complete — a 3% residual duty may still be due.
- The **15-month maximum** limits the duration of the benefit, even if the vessel remains in service.
- The **two-year claim deadline** is firm and non-negotiable — failure to meet it results in loss of entitlement.
- The requirement for **evidence of compliance** ensures accountability and prevents abuse of the remission mechanism.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Alaska Marine Lines, Inc. Remission Order* is a **targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted** customs duty relief designed to support a specific maritime operator in Canada. It enables Alaska Marine Lines, Inc. to recover 97% of the customs duties incurred on the temporary importation of vessels used in domestic coastal trade, provided that the vessel operated under a valid coasting trade licence and the importation occurred between October 1996 and December 1997.

This Order underscores the flexibility of Canadian customs policy in addressing sector-specific needs, particularly in transportation and regional economic development, while maintaining clear administrative and legal safeguards.
