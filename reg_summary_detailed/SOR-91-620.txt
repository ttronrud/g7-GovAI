- **Effective Date**: **January 1, 1992**.
- **Citation**: These regulations are to be cited as the **Pension and Allowance Adjustment Regulations**.
- **Publication Note**: These regulations are **not published in the Canada Gazette**, indicating they may have been issued internally or in a supplementary form.

### **2. Core Objective**
To establish a standardized, transparent, and mathematically consistent method for adjusting the **basic pension amount** and related allowances annually, ensuring fairness and accuracy in pension calculations.

---

### **3. Annual Adjustment of the Basic Pension**

The basic pension is adjusted each year using the following rules, based on the provisions of subsection 75(1) of the *Pension Act*.

#### **Rule for Adjusting the Amount (Paragraph 75(1)(a) or (b))**
The amount (e.g., the pension base or formula-derived value) must be adjusted to the **nearest cent** using the following steps:

1. **Decimal Representation**:
   - If the amount has a fractional part of a dollar, it must be expressed as a **decimal fraction with at least three digits** after the decimal point (e.g., $123.456).

2. **Rounding Rules**:
   - **If the third digit after the decimal point is less than 5**:
     - Drop all digits after the second decimal place.
     - Example: $123.452 → $123.45 (rounded to two decimal places).
   - **If the third digit after the decimal point is 5 or greater**:
     - Increase the **second digit after the decimal point** by 1.
     - Drop all digits after the third decimal place.
     - Example: $123.455 → $123.46; $123.457 → $123.46.

> ✅ This method is known as **"rounding to the nearest cent with a three-digit intermediate precision"** and ensures consistency and fairness in rounding.

---

#### **Rule for Expressing the Quotient (Subparagraph 75(1)(a)(ii))**
The quotient (a ratio used in calculating pension increases) must be expressed as a **decimal fraction with at least four digits** after the decimal point.

1. **Decimal Representation**:
   - The quotient must be expressed with **four or more digits** after the decimal point (e.g., 0.03456).

2. **Rounding Rules**:
   - **If the fourth digit after the decimal point is less than 5**:
     - Drop all digits after the third decimal place.
     - Example: 0.03452 → 0.0345.
   - **If the fourth digit after the decimal point is 5 or greater**:
     - Increase the **third digit after the decimal point** by 1.
     - Drop all digits after the fourth decimal place.
     - Example: 0.03455 → 0.0346; 0.03458 → 0.0346.

> ✅ This ensures precision in the calculation of the adjustment ratio, using a **four-digit intermediate rounding rule**.

---

### **4. Determining the Percentage Adjustment (Subsection 75(3))**

The percentage increase applied to the pension is derived from the quotient calculated above. The process is as follows:

1. **Convert Quotient to Percentage**:
   - Multiply the quotient (expressed as a decimal fraction) by **100**.
   - Example: If the quotient is 0.0345, then 0.0345 × 100 = 3.45%.

2. **Subtract 100 from the Product**:
   - **100 is subtracted from the product** to obtain the actual percentage increase.
   - Example: 3.45% − 100% = **–96.55%** → This appears incorrect and suggests a **misstatement or error** in the regulation.

> ❌ **Critical Issue in the Text**:  
> The sentence *"100 shall be subtracted from the product obtained pursuant to paragraph (a)"* is **mathematically inconsistent** and **likely erroneous**.

#### **Correct Interpretation (Likely Intended Meaning)**:
The regulation probably intends to state that:
> *"The percentage increase is the quotient (as a decimal) multiplied by 100, and expressed as a percentage."*

In other words:
- The **quotient** (e.g., 0.0345) is converted to a **percentage** by multiplying by 100 → 3.45%.
- This is the **annual adjustment percentage** applied to the pension.

> ✅ Therefore, the phrase **"100 shall be subtracted from the product"** is a **mistake**. It contradicts the logic of percentage calculation.  
> This appears to be a **typographical or editorial error** in the original text.

> 🔍 **Conclusion**: The correct rule should be:
> - The percentage adjustment = (quotient × 100) → expressed as a percentage (e.g., 3.45%).
> - No subtraction of 100 is required.

### **5. Key Features of the Regulation**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Precision in Rounding** | Uses intermediate digit rounding (3 digits for amounts, 4 digits for quotients) to ensure accuracy before final rounding. |
| **Consistency** | Applies uniform rounding rules across all pension adjustments. |
| **Transparency** | Provides clear, step-by-step procedures for both amount and percentage adjustments. |
| **Annual Application** | The adjustment is applied every year on January 1, effective from 1992 onward. |
| **Legal Foundation** | Based on the *Pension Act*, specifically subsections 75(1) and 75(3), ensuring statutory compliance. |

---

### **6. Practical Implications**

- **For Pension Recipients**:
  - Pensions are adjusted annually based on a calculated percentage derived from a ratio.
  - The final pension amount is rounded to the nearest cent, ensuring no fractional cents are retained.
- **For Administrators**:
  - A standardized process is provided for calculating pension increases.
  - The rules prevent bias or inconsistency in adjustment decisions.
- **For Oversight**:
  - The clear, rule-based structure allows for auditability and transparency in pension adjustments.

### **7. Errors and Clarifications**

| Issue | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| **Incorrect Subtraction of 100** | The instruction to "subtract 100 from the product" is **mathematically incorrect** and **logically inconsistent**. It would result in negative percentages (e.g., 3.45% − 100 = −96.55%), which makes no sense in a pension increase context. |
| **Likely Typo** | The phrase is likely a **mistake in drafting**. The intended rule is: **"Multiply the quotient by 100 to obtain the percentage."** |
| **Recommendation for Correction** | The regulation should be revised to read:  
> *"The percentage referred to in subsection 75(3) of the Pension Act shall be the quotient expressed as a decimal fraction in accordance with paragraph 2(b), converted to a percentage in the following manner: the quotient shall be multiplied by 100."*  
> (No subtraction of 100 is required.) |

---

### **8. Conclusion**

The **Pension and Allowance Adjustment Regulations** (S.C. 1990, c. 43, s. 24(1) & (2)) provide a **clear, systematic, and mathematically sound framework** for adjusting pensions annually. The rules ensure:

- Accurate rounding to the nearest cent,
- Consistent application of adjustment ratios,
- Transparency in the calculation process.

However, a **critical error** exists in the percentage conversion step — the instruction to **subtract 100 from the product** is **incorrect** and **must be corrected** to reflect the standard practice of converting a decimal quotient to a percentage by multiplication.

> ✅ **Final Note**: The regulation is otherwise well-structured and represents a significant improvement over the 1974 order, offering greater precision and consistency in pension adjustments. However, it requires **correction of the erroneous subtraction rule** to be fully valid and functional.
