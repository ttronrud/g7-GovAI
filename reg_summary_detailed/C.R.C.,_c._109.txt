**Detailed Summary of the Sault Ste. Marie Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Sault Ste. Marie Airport Zoning Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and forms part of the official zoning framework governing land use around Sault Ste. Marie Airport in Ontario.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

Several critical terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Sault Ste. Marie Airport**, located in the **District of Algoma, Province of Ontario**.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A designated geographic point used as a benchmark for elevation calculations.  
  - Defined in **Part I of the Schedule**.  
  - **Deemed elevation**: 611 feet above sea level (for regulatory purposes, even if not precisely measured at the point).

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending outward and upward from each end of a runway strip.  
  - Slope ratio: **50 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically** (i.e., 1:50).  
  - The base of this surface is a horizontal line perpendicular to the runway centerline at the ends of the strip.  
  - Applies only to **runways 04-22 and 11-29**.  
  - Dimensions:  
    - 500 feet on each side of the runway centerline at the strip ends.  
    - Extends 2,000 feet on each side of the **projected centerline** of the runway at its outer ends.  
    - Outer ends are located **200 feet above the elevation at the strip ends**, and measured **10,000 feet horizontally** from the strip ends.

- **Horizontal Surface**:  
  An imaginary flat plane located **150 feet above the elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.  
  - This serves as a baseline for height restrictions across the entire airport zone.

- **Strip**:  
  A designated rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, specifically designed for takeoff and landing in a given direction.  
  - For runways 04-22 and 11-29:  
    - **Width**: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline).  
    - **Length**: 8,600 feet (as shown on Plan No. T2557).  
  - These dimensions are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the **outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface**.  
  - Slope ratio: **7 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically** (i.e., 1:7).  
  - Extends upward to intersect the **horizontal surface** or other transitional surfaces.  
  - Also shown on **Plan No. T2557, dated February 28, 1969**, held at the Department of Transport in Ottawa.

### **3. Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable Lands**
These regulations apply to all lands:
- Adjacent to or in the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie Airport.
- With outer limits described in a specific legal description:

> *Commencing at the northeasterly corner of Section 1, Township of Parke;  
> Thence westerly along the northern boundary of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and the northeast quarter of Section 5 to the intersection with Lake Superior’s waters edge;  
> Thence generally southeasterly, easterly, and northeasterly along Lake Superior and St. Mary’s River to the intersection with the eastern boundary of Section 12, Township of Parke;  
> Thence northerly along the eastern boundary of Section 12 and Section 1 back to the point of commencement.*

- These boundaries are illustrated on **Plan No. T2557**, dated February 28, 1969, and is on file with the Department of Transport in Ottawa.

#### **Exclusions**
- The regulations **do not apply** to lands that are part of the airport itself from time to time (i.e., active airport operations or official airport land use).

### **4. Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**

#### **General Rule (Section 5)**  
No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object **on any land to which these regulations apply**, if the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of the highest point**:

1. **Horizontal Surface**  
   - 150 feet above the ARP (611 feet above sea level).  
   - Acts as a general height ceiling across the entire airport zone.

2. **Approach Surfaces**  
   - Applies only to **runways 04-22 and 11-29**.  
   - Extends 500 feet on each side of the centerline at the strip ends.  
   - Extends 2,000 feet on each side of the projected centerline at outer ends (200 feet above strip ends, 10,000 feet from strip ends).  
   - This surface is designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by providing a clear zone free of obstructions.

3. **Transitional Surfaces**  
   - Connects the outer edges of the strip and approach surface to the horizontal surface.  
   - Provides a gradual transition to maintain visual and operational safety during approach and departure.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The approach surfaces and transitional surfaces are **not applicable** to other runways or areas outside 04-22 and 11-29.

#### **Exception (Section 5 – Limited Elevation Over Horizontal Surface)**  
A person **may** construct a building, structure, or addition **that exceeds the horizontal surface** in height — **but only if**:
- The structure’s **highest point does not exceed 30 feet above the land surface** at that location.

> This allows for minor structures (e.g., small sheds, signage, or low-height towers) to be built above the horizontal surface, provided they remain within a 30-foot limit above ground level.

---

### **5. Natural Growth and Removal Requirements**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land **exceeds** any of the defined surfaces (horizontal, approach, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring:
  - The **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove** the excessive growth.

> This ensures that natural features do not interfere with aircraft operations or safety zones.

---

### **6. Revocation Note**

- This regulation was **revoked** by **SOR/79-899, Section 1**.  
  → This is a **critical note**: The regulation is **no longer in force** as of the date of revocation.  
  → However, the summary above reflects the **content and structure of the regulation prior to revocation**.

> 🔍 **Interpretation**: While the regulation is officially revoked, it may still be referenced in historical or legal documents, or its provisions may have been incorporated into current airport safety or zoning policies. Any current enforcement would depend on whether the revocation has been formally superseded by a new regulation.

### **7. Key Runway Details (Runways 04-22 and 11-29)**

- **Runway 04-22**:
  - Direction: 04 (east-northeast) to 22 (south-southeast)
- **Runway 11-29**:
  - Direction: 11 (east-southeast) to 29 (south-southwest)

- **Dimensions**:
  - **Width**: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of centerline)
  - **Length**: 8,600 feet (as per Plan T2557)

- **Approach Surface Coverage**:
  - Defined with specific lateral and longitudinal dimensions based on the runway centerlines and their orientation.

---

### **8. Purpose and Rationale**

These regulations were designed to:
- Ensure **safety** during aircraft takeoff and landing by preventing obstructions in critical approach and departure zones.
- Maintain **clear visual and physical corridors** for pilots, especially in low-visibility or night operations.
- Provide **consistent, measurable height limits** across the airport perimeter.
- Protect the airport from **unauthorized or oversized structures** that could interfere with flight operations.
