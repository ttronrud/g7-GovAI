**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Prior Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally repeals **Order in Council P.C. 1979-1625**, issued on June 5, 1979.  
   - This earlier order had previously established the ministerial responsibilities for the IDRC.

2. **Designation of the Minister for International Development as the Minister for the IDRC:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister for International Development** as the official Minister responsible for the purposes of the *International Development Research Centre Act*.  
   - This designation means that the current Minister for International Development (a position within the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development or a related federal ministry) is now the designated minister under the Act.  
   - The Minister holds the authority to make decisions, issue directions, and perform administrative and policy functions related to the IDRC, including oversight, funding, and strategic direction.

3. **Purpose of the Change:**  
   - The update reflects a modernization of ministerial accountability and governance.  
   - It aligns the IDRC’s leadership with the current federal government structure, ensuring that the research center is properly integrated into the broader international development policy framework.  
   - It streamlines decision-making by assigning the IDRC’s ministerial responsibility to a dedicated minister, enhancing coordination between research, policy, and development programming.

**Effective Date and Legal Effect:**

- The repeal of P.C. 1979-1625 removes any prior ministerial designations or arrangements, and the new designation supersedes them.
