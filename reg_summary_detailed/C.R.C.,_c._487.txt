**Detailed Summary of the *Customs Drawback Shirting Fabrics Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Customs Drawback Shirting Fabrics Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish a framework for the **customs drawback** (a refund of duties) for **imported shirting fabrics** used in the manufacture of shirts in Canada, under specific conditions.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Canadian fabric** | A fabric woven in Canada, regardless of whether it contains imported materials. This includes fabrics made entirely or partially with foreign materials, as long as the weaving occurs in Canada. |
| **Imported fabric** | A fabric woven in any country other than Canada, whether or not it contains Canadian materials. Excludes: <br> - Fabrics imported free of duty; <br> - Fabrics that would qualify for drawback under other regulations. |
| **Manufacturer** | The owner of the fabric at the time it is used in the production of a shirt. This is the entity eligible to claim drawback. |
| **Shirt** | A man’s shirt or a boy’s shirt. Excludes shirts produced on order for Canadian government departments. |
| **Drawback period** | A time period selected by the manufacturer for claiming drawback. It must be one of the following: <br> - A 12-month period ending on January 1 of any year from 1979 to 1989; <br> - A 6-month period ending on July 1 or January 1 of any year from 1978 to 1989; <br> - A 3-month period ending on April 1, July 1, October 1, or January 1 of any year from 1978 to 1989. <br> *Note: The period must not have been previously selected by the manufacturer.* |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of National Revenue**, responsible for administering and enforcing the regulations. |
| **Total fabric consumption** | The sum of all Canadian and imported fabrics used by a manufacturer during a drawback period in the production of shirts. |

### **3. Special Provision: Deemed Canadian Fabric**
Despite the general definitions, **shirting fabrics listed in Order in Council P.C. 1973-7/2473 (issued August 21, 1973)** are **deemed to be Canadian fabrics**, even if they were woven abroad. This provision ensures that certain pre-existing fabric types qualify for drawback treatment as if they were domestically produced.

> *Purpose:* To support specific types of fabrics that were historically used in Canadian shirt manufacturing and to maintain continuity in the policy.

---

### **4. Drawback Eligibility and Rate**

#### **Eligibility**
A drawback is granted **only if**:
- The imported fabric was used in the manufacture of shirts during a valid drawback period.
- The claim is filed within **four years** of when the customs duties were originally paid on the imported fabric.

#### **Rate of Drawback**
The rate of refund depends on the **proportion of Canadian fabric** used in the production of shirts during the drawback period:

| Condition | Drawback Rate |
|---------|----------------|
| **Canadian fabric used ≥ 75% of total fabric consumption** | **100%** of customs duties (excluding duties under the *Special Import Measures Act* and surtax) |
| **Canadian fabric used < 75% of total fabric consumption** | **100% minus 2 percentage points for each percentage point below 75%** |

> Example:  
> If a manufacturer used only 50% Canadian fabric, the drawback rate would be:  
> 100% – (2 × 25%) = **50%** of customs duties (excluding applicable special duties and surtax).

> Example:  
> If 80% Canadian fabric was used → 100% rate applies.

> *Note:* The calculation applies to **all customs duties** paid on imported fabrics, excluding duties imposed under the *Special Import Measures Act* and surtax.

### **5. Inclusion of Knitted Fabric (Special Provision)**

For drawback periods during the calendar years **1978 to 1988 inclusive**, manufacturers may **elect** to treat up to **20% of knitted fabrics** used in shirt manufacturing as **Canadian fabrics**, provided:
- The knitted fabric was produced in Canada.
- The total amount of such knitted fabric used in the period does not exceed **20% of all knitted fabrics produced in Canada** during that period.

#### **Effect of Election**
- Any such knitted fabric elected under this provision is:
  1. **Deemed to be a Canadian fabric**;
  2. **Included in the manufacturer’s total fabric consumption** for the purpose of calculating the drawback rate.

> *Purpose:* To allow flexibility in the use of knitted fabrics (which are not typically covered under the standard definition of "woven fabric") and to encourage domestic production in the shirting industry during a transitional period.

---

### **6. Claim Process**

- A claim for drawback must be submitted using a **K32 Drawback Claim Form**.
- The claim must be filed with a **chief officer of customs**.
- The **Minister of National Revenue** may require the manufacturer to provide **evidence** (e.g., invoices, production records, material usage logs) to verify the validity of the claim.

---

### **7. Time Limit for Claims**

- No drawback will be paid **unless the claim is filed within four years** of the date the customs duties were paid on the imported fabric.
- This creates a **strict deadline** for claiming refunds, emphasizing timely action.

---

### **8. Effective Date**

- These regulations apply to **all customs duties paid on or after April 1, 1981**.
- This means that duties paid before April 1, 1981, are **not covered** by these rules, and any claims related to them would fall under earlier legislation or different rules.

### **Key Objectives and Policy Intent**

1. **Support Domestic Industry**  
   Encourage Canadian manufacturers to use Canadian-woven fabrics in shirt production by offering a financial incentive (drawback) when they use a significant portion of domestic materials.

2. **Promote Trade Balance**  
   Reduce reliance on imported shirting fabrics by making domestic alternatives more economically viable.

3. **Incentivize Use of Canadian Materials**  
   The tiered drawback rate (with a penalty for low Canadian fabric usage) acts as a direct incentive to increase the use of Canadian fabrics.

4. **Historical Continuity**  
   The inclusion of fabrics from Order P.C. 1973-7/2473 ensures that legacy fabric types remain eligible for drawback treatment, preserving policy stability.

5. **Flexibility in Fabric Types**  
   The knitted fabric exception (1978–1988) acknowledges that not all fabrics are woven, and provides a practical path for manufacturers to include knitted materials in their domestic fabric mix.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes**:
  - Shirts made for government departments (e.g., uniforms).
  - Fabrics imported free of duty.
  - Fabrics eligible for drawback under other regulations.
- **No drawback** if claim is not filed within 4 years of duty payment.
- **No drawback** if Canadian fabric usage is less than 75% without a reduced rate (penalized by 2% per percentage point below 75%).

### **Conclusion**

The *Customs Drawback Shirting Fabrics Regulations* are a targeted policy tool designed to **stimulate domestic fabric production** and **reduce dependency on imported shirting fabrics** in Canada. By offering a refund of customs duties based on the proportion of Canadian fabric used, the regulations create a financial incentive for manufacturers to increase domestic content in shirt production. The rules are structured with historical specificity (1978–1989), flexibility (knitted fabric inclusion), and strict compliance requirements (timely claims, documentation, and thresholds), making them both practical and policy-driven.

> **Note:** These regulations are largely historical, as they were enacted in the 1980s and are no longer in active use today. Modern customs drawback policies in Canada have evolved significantly, with broader eligibility and updated frameworks. However, this document provides a clear, detailed snapshot of how such a policy functioned in its original form.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence:**  
The *Customs Drawback Shirting Fabrics Regulations* allow Canadian manufacturers to claim a refund of customs duties on imported shirting fabrics used in shirt production, with the refund rate depending on the proportion of Canadian-woven fabric used—offering full refund if 75% or more is used, and reducing the refund by 2% for each percentage point below 75%, while also allowing limited inclusion of knitted fabrics produced in Canada during 1978–1988.
