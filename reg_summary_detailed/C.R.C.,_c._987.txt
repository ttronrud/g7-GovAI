**Detailed Summary of the *East Coast and Great Lakes Shipping Employees Hours of Work Regulations, 1985***

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, known as the *East Coast and Great Lakes Shipping Employees Hours of Work Regulations, 1985*, are a specialized set of rules under the *Canada Labour Code* (Act) that establish standards for working hours for seafarers employed on ships operating from ports in eastern Canada and the Great Lakes region. The regulations provide flexibility to accommodate the unique operational demands of maritime work while ensuring employee welfare and compliance with labor standards.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Labour Code*, which provides the legal framework for labor standards in Canada.
- **East Coast or Great Lakes Port**: Any port in Canada located east of the 96th meridian of longitude. This includes major ports such as Halifax, St. John’s, Montreal, Toronto, and ports along the Great Lakes (e.g., Detroit, Windsor, Sault Ste. Marie).
- **Employee**: A person employed on board a ship that operates from an East Coast or Great Lakes port and falls under the scope of the regulations.
- **Lay-day**: A paid day off work granted to an employee after working a certain number of days at sea. It is a key component of maritime work schedules.
- **Standard Hours of Work**: 
  - Maximum of **8 hours per day** and **40 hours per week**, unless exceptions apply due to operational needs or lay-day plans.

### **Main Provisions and Interpretation**

#### **1. Modification of Section 169 of the Canada Labour Code**
- The standard working hours rules under **Section 169** of the *Canada Labour Code* are modified specifically for employees working on ships operated by businesses within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament and engaged in shipping from East Coast or Great Lakes ports.
- This means that the general labor standards (like daily/weekly limits) are adjusted to reflect the realities of maritime employment.

#### **2. Standard Working Hours (General Rule)**
- Employees are subject to:
  - **No more than 8 hours per day**
  - **No more than 40 hours per week**
- These hours do **not need to be scheduled or worked consecutively**.
- Employees are entitled to **at least one full day of rest per week**, but **Sunday does not have to be the normal day of rest**.

#### **3. Exemption from Section 171 of the Act**
- Employees in this sector are **exempt from the application of Section 171**, which normally sets out rules on overtime pay and working hours for other workers. This exemption recognizes the unique nature of maritime work.

#### **4. Authorization of Exceptional Working Hours**
- Under certain conditions, employers or employer organizations may apply to the **Head of Compliance and Enforcement** for permission to alter standard working hours.
- **Conditions for Authorization**:
  - Must be justified by **operational requirements** of the shipping business.
  - Must not be **detrimental to employee welfare**.
  - Cannot exceed **40 hours per week on average** over the authorized period.
- The Head of Compliance and Enforcement may impose conditions on such authorizations.

#### **5. Averaging of Working Hours (for Irregular Schedules)**
- For employees whose work involves **irregular or unpredictable schedules** (e.g., due to long voyages or shifts), working hours can be averaged over a period **not exceeding 13 consecutive weeks**.
- **How Averaging Works**:
  - **Standard hours** are calculated as:
    - **520 hours** if the averaging period is 13 weeks (i.e., 13 × 40 = 520).
    - If a shorter period is chosen (e.g., 6 weeks), the standard hours are **6 × 40 = 240 hours**.
- Employers must **immediately notify** the Head of Compliance and Enforcement when adopting an averaging period, specifying:
  - The class of employees affected
  - The number of employees involved
  - The duration of the averaging period

#### **6. Reduction of Standard Hours for Holidays and Vacations**
- **General holidays, paid holidays, or annual vacations** reduce the standard hours of work:
  - **8 hours deducted per holiday or vacation day** (e.g., one day off = 8-hour reduction).
  - **No more than 40 hours can be deducted in any one week of annual vacation**.
- **During an averaging period**, the same rule applies:
  - For every paid holiday or vacation day not worked, **8 hours are deducted** from the standard weekly hours.
  - Again, **no more than 40 hours can be deducted per full week of vacation**.

#### **7. Reduction for Non-Payment Periods**
- If an employee is **not paid for 7 consecutive days** during an averaging period:
  - The standard hours are reduced by **40 hours for every 7-day period**.
- This protects employees from being penalized for periods of unpaid leave or lay-offs due to operational delays.

#### **8. Termination of Employment During Averaging Periods**
- **Voluntary Termination**:
  - If an employee resigns during an averaging period or before the end of a granted authorization, they are entitled to be paid at their **regular rate of wages for all hours worked** during that period.
- **Termination by Employer**:
  - If employment ends due to employer action during an averaging period, the employee is entitled to **overtime pay** at a rate of **not less than 1.5 times their regular rate** for any hours worked **in excess of 40 hours per week** (based on the number of weeks worked during the period).

#### **9. Lay-Day Plans**
- Employers may adopt a **lay-day plan**, which provides scheduled days off to seafarers.
- **Notification Requirement**: Employers must **notify the Head of Compliance and Enforcement** of the start of the lay-day plan.
- **Exemptions**:
  - **Sections 4(1) and 8** of the Labour Code (which normally govern standard working hours and rest periods) **do not apply** to employees under a lay-day plan.

#### **10. Lay-Day Entitlement and Working Hours**
- **Lay-day entitlements determine allowable working hours**:
  - **Entitled to at least 1.13 lay-days per day on board**:
    - Working hours may exceed 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
    - **Maximum daily hours: 12 hours**.
  - **Entitled to at least 0.4 lay-days per day on board**:
    - Weekly hours may exceed 40 hours.
    - **Maximum daily hours: 8 hours** (i.e., daily limits remain intact).
- These provisions allow for greater flexibility in workloads when employees are entitled to sufficient rest days.

#### **11. Maximum Lay-Day Accumulation**
- **No employee may accumulate more than 45 lay-days** in any period.
- This is a cap designed to prevent excessive rest and ensure continuous work for operational needs.

#### **12. Exceptional Circumstances and Permits**
- If the Head of Compliance and Enforcement determines, based on **exceptional circumstances** (e.g., natural disasters, emergencies, extended voyages), that **more than 45 lay-days** are reasonably necessary:
  - The Head may issue a **permit** authorizing an accumulation beyond 45 lay-days, for a specific period.
- Such permits are granted only after a **satisfactory determination** of necessity and justification.

### **Key Objectives and Principles**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Work-Life Balance** | Ensures employees get rest, with at least one full day off per week. |
| **Operational Flexibility** | Allows deviations from standard hours due to the nature of maritime work. |
| **Employee Welfare** | Prevents exploitation through strict limits on overtime, unpaid periods, and lay-day accumulation. |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Places clear responsibility on the Head of Compliance and Enforcement to ensure fairness and legality. |
| **Fair Compensation** | Guarantees fair pay during non-working periods and overtime during extended work. |

---

### **Significance and Context**

- These regulations were developed to address the **unique challenges of maritime employment**, where:
  - Work schedules are often irregular.
  - Voyages are long and unpredictable.
  - Crews may be required to work extended shifts or periods without rest.
- By introducing **lay-day systems and averaging**, the regulations balance **operational efficiency** with **employee well-being**.
- The exemption from general labor rules (like Section 171) reflects the recognition that traditional labor standards are not always applicable in seafaring.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No automatic rights to Sundays off**: Employees may rest on any day of the week.
- **No automatic overtime protection** unless specific conditions (e.g., termination by employer) are met.
- **Averaging period cap at 13 weeks** prevents indefinite averaging and ensures periodic review.
- **Lay-day entitlements are critical** — without sufficient lay-days, working hours remain strictly limited.

### **Conclusion**

The *East Coast and Great Lakes Shipping Employees Hours of Work Regulations, 1985*, represent a **balanced and practical approach** to regulating working hours in the maritime sector. They:
- Protect seafarers from excessive working hours,
- Allow flexibility for operational needs,
- Provide clear pathways for exceptions and special circumstances,
- And ensure fair compensation and rest
