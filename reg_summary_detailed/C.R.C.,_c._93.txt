**Detailed Summary of the London Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **London Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes spatial and elevation controls around London Airport (now part of the City of London, Ontario) to ensure aviation safety by restricting the height of structures and natural growth near the airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *London Airport*, located in the City of London, Province of Ontario. This is the primary site subject to the zoning controls.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation measurements. It is defined as the intersection of:
  - A line 250 feet northwesterly at right angles from the centerline of **Runway 05–23**, and  
  - A line 600 feet northeasterly at right angles from the centerline of **Runway 14–32**.  
  The ARP is **deemed to be at 898 feet above sea level** for all calculations under these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (i.e., the landing area). These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during landing and takeoff.  
  - **Runway 05–23 (05 and 23 approaches)**: 1:20 slope (1 foot vertical per 20 feet horizontal) rising to 325 feet above the end of the strip, over 6,500 feet horizontally. Outer ends extend 800 feet from the runway centerline.  
  - **Runway 08–26 (08 and 26 approaches)**: 1:50 slope (1 foot vertical per 50 feet horizontal) rising to 200 feet above the end of the strip, over 10,000 feet horizontally. Outer ends extend 2,000 feet from the centerline.  
  - **Runway 14–32 (14 and 32 approaches)**: Same as 08–26 (1:50 slope, 200 ft rise, 10,000 ft horizontal reach, 2,000 ft from centerline).  
  These surfaces are illustrated on **Department of Transport Plan No. T2868 (dated October 1, 1974)**.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An imaginary surface that forms a protective zone above the airport area. It consists of:
  - A flat plane at **150 feet above the airport reference point (898 ft = 1,048 ft above sea level)**.
  - If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, the surface is instead **30 feet above ground** to prevent overreach.  
  This surface defines the maximum allowable height for structures in the outer zones of the airport.

- **Strip**:  
  The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including runways and adjacent taxiways. Each strip is defined by:
  - **Runway 05–23**: 300 ft wide (150 ft on each side), 3,574 ft long.
  - **Runway 08–26**: 1,200 ft wide (600 ft on each side), 6,800 ft long.
  - **Runway 14–32**: 1,000 ft wide (500 ft on each side), 9,300 ft long.  
  These strips are also shown on **Plan No. T2868**.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of each strip and its associated approach surface, rising upward and outward until it meets either:
  - The outer surface, or  
  - The transitional surface of an adjacent strip.  
  The slope is **1:7** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal). This surface ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the broader outer zone, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or structure height.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, bounded by the outer limits described in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are formally incorporated into the airport infrastructure (e.g., active runways, taxiways, terminal buildings) are excluded from these restrictions.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- Construct or erect any building, structure, or object, or
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object,  
such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the point of location**:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This means that all man-made structures (including towers, antennas, trees, buildings, etc.) must remain **below or at the level** of these defined surfaces. The surfaces are designed to provide a safe buffer zone for aircraft during approach and departure phases.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Provisions**

If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that natural features do not create hazards to aircraft, particularly during low-altitude operations.

---

### **6. Regulatory Status and Enforcement**

- The regulation was **revoked by SOR/81-175, section 1**, indicating it is **no longer in force** as of that date.  
  ⚠️ **Important Note**: This is a critical point. While the summary includes the full text, the regulation has been officially **revoked** and is **not currently applicable**. This means the height restrictions and zoning rules described here are **no longer legally enforceable** in Ontario.

### **7. Visual and Reference Materials**

All key surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, and strips) are illustrated in **Department of Transport Plan No. T2868**, dated **October 1, 1974**. This plan serves as the official reference for boundary and elevation details.

### **Summary Table of Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Airport** | London Airport, City of London, Ontario |
| **Reference Point (ARP)** | Intersection of lines from runways 05–23 and 14–32; 898 ft AMSL |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Inclined planes (1:20 or 1:50 slopes) rising to 200–325 ft above strip ends, extending 800–2,000 ft from centerline |

| **Strips** | 05–23 (300 ft × 3,574 ft), 08–26 (1,200 ft × 6,800 ft), 14–32 (1,000 ft × 9,300 ft) |
| **Transitional Surface** | 1:7 slope from strip edges to outer surface or adjacent strip |
| **Application** | All lands adjacent to or near the airport (as per Part II of Schedule) |
| **Prohibited Actions** | Any structure or addition exceeding the defined surfaces in height |

### **Conclusion**

The **London Airport Zoning Regulations** were a comprehensive set of spatial and height controls designed to protect aviation safety by limiting the vertical extent of structures and vegetation near the airport. The regulation used precise geometric definitions (e.g., slopes, distances, elevation references) to establish safe approach and flight corridors.

However, the regulation has been **formally revoked** by the Ontario government (SOR/81-175, section 1), meaning it is **no longer legally binding or enforceable**. As such, it does not currently govern land use or construction near London Airport.

Any current zoning or height restrictions in the area would likely be governed by **modern aviation safety standards**, **local municipal bylaws**, or **federal regulations** (such as those under the *Aviation Safety and Security Act* or *Transportation Act*), rather than this historical regulation.
