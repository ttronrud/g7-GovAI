2. **Where the bank is fulfilling duties** related to:
   - Administration of an estate or trust; or
   - Acting as an agent (e.g., for clients in settlement or custody roles).

> This ensures flexibility for banks operating under different legal frameworks or performing non-core, fiduciary functions.

---

### **4. Record-Keeping Requirements**

#### (a) Procedures for Handling Assets
- A bank must maintain a **written record** of procedures for:
  - Handling and safeguarding its assets (e.g., physical storage, access controls, internal approvals).
- This record must be **shared with all directors, officers, employees, and agents** who have access to or involvement in asset handling.

> Purpose: Ensures transparency, accountability, and consistency in internal controls.

#### (b) Identification of All Securities
- The bank must maintain an **up-to-date record** that identifies **every security** it owns or holds.

> Ensures traceability and reduces risk of loss or misappropriation.

---

### **5. Custody of Securities**

  - The **bank itself**, or
  - An **authorized entity** such as:
    - A **custodian of securities**
    - A **depository**
    - A **clearing agency**

> This ensures that assets are not left in unsecured or unregulated hands.

#### Exceptions (Where Custody is Not Required):
The rule does **not apply** to securities that are:
- Under the **control of a government** in the jurisdiction where the bank operates;
- **Pledged** as collateral for the bank’s debt or potential debt;

### **7. Registration of Securities**

#### General Rule:

### **8. Holding Securities in Bearer or Non-Bank Name**

If a security is otherwise **adequately protected** against:
- Loss

- Destruction

Then the bank may:
- Hold the security in **bearer form** (where ownership is determined by physical possession), or
- Hold it in **registered form in a name other than the bank’s name** (e.g., under a nominee).

> This allows flexibility in certain secure environments (e.g., with electronic safeguards or trusted third-party custody), but only if the security is sufficiently protected.

---

### **9. Insurance Requirements**

#### (a) Insurance for Dishonest or Criminal Acts
- A bank must **acquire and maintain** one or more **bonds** (insurance policies) to indemnify the bank against losses arising from:
  - **Dishonest or criminal acts** by bank officers or employees.

> This protects the bank from internal fraud (e.g., embezzlement, misappropriation).

#### (b) Insurance for Physical Damage or Loss
- The bank must also maintain **insurance policies** to cover:
  - Damage to, destruction of, or mysterious disappearance of its assets;
  - Any other usual contingencies (e.g., fire, natural disaster, theft).

> Broad coverage to protect against both internal and external risks.

---

### **10. Conditions on Insurance Policies and Bonds**

#### (a) No Termination Without Notice
- Any bond or insurance policy acquired under section 10 **must not be cancelled or terminated** until **at least 30 days** after:
  - The **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** receives a written notice from either:
    - The insurer, or
    - The bank (insured)

> This provides a **cooling-off period** and allows time for review, audit, or appeal — protecting the bank from sudden loss of coverage.

#### (b) Adequate Coverage Amount
- The amount of the bond or insurance policy must be determined by the **bank’s directors**, based on:
  - The **nature and value** of the assets owned or held;
  - The **handling and safeguarding procedures** in place;
  - Any other factors that could affect the **potential extent of loss**.

> Ensures coverage is proportionate and realistic, avoiding both under-insurance and excessive costs.
