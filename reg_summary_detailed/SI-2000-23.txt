**Detailed Summary of the National Parks Land Rents Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act**, specifically **subsection 23(2.1)a**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board) to make orders remitting land rents in certain circumstances deemed to be in the **public interest**.

This particular order is a **land rents remission order** aimed at addressing the financial burden on leaseholders of public land located within **national parks** in Canada.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of the order is to **provide financial relief** to individuals or entities holding leasehold interests in public land situated within designated national parks. This relief is granted in the context of a **ten-year lease period beginning in the year 2000**, during which rental rates were being determined or adjusted.

The remission is designed to **offset the increase in rental rates** over the course of the ten-year period, ensuring that leaseholders are not disproportionately burdened by rising rents, especially in the early years of a lease when rental rates may be set at higher levels.

---

### **3. Who Is Eligible?**
The remission applies to:
- Every person who holds a **leasehold interest** in **public land**.
- The land must be situated within a **national park** listed in **Schedule I** to the *National Parks Act*.

This includes private individuals, companies, or other entities that have legally acquired or are operating under lease agreements with the federal government for use of land in national parks.

---

### **4. Conditions for Remission**
Remission is granted **only if**:
- The rent payable for the land has been **fixed or is due to be fixed** in the year **2000**.
- The fixed rent is for a **ten-year period beginning in 2000**, as defined by the applicable lease agreement and the *National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)*.

This means the lease must have been established or renewed with a fixed rental schedule that spans from 2000 to 2009.

---

### **5. Calculation of Remission Amount**
The amount of rent remitted is calculated as follows:

> **Remission = (Rental rate for the first year of the ten-year period) – (Rental rate for the last year of the ten-year period)**

In simpler terms:
- The remission is equal to the **difference between the initial rental rate (in 2000)** and the **final rental rate (in 2009)**.
- If the rental rate **increased** over the ten years, the remission will be **positive** and will reduce the total rent payable.
- If the rental rate **decreased**, the remission would be negative (but in practice, this would not result in a financial benefit under the order).

Thus, the order **only provides a benefit** when the rent **increased** over the ten-year period, and the remission compensates leaseholders for that increase.

---

### **6. Key Implications**
- **Public Interest Justification**: The Governor General acts on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board, indicating that the government believes this remission serves the public interest—likely by supporting sustainable land use, preserving park ecosystems, or maintaining the viability of lease operations.
- **Targeted Relief**: The order is not a general rent reduction but is specifically tied to lease agreements that began or were fixed in 2000 and spanned ten years.
- **Historical Context**: This regulation was enacted in **1991**, during a period when the federal government was adjusting land use policies and rental structures in national parks. It reflects a policy of balancing conservation goals with economic realities for leaseholders.

---

### **7. Legal and Regulatory Framework**
- The order is issued under the **National Parks Act** and the **National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations (1991)**.
- The *National Parks Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations* govern how leasehold agreements are structured, including rental terms, duration, and conditions for rent review or adjustment.
- The remission is not a general subsidy but a **specific, calculated adjustment** based on the actual rental rate changes over time.

---

### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The order **does not apply** to:
  - Leases not beginning or being fixed in 2000.
  - Leases not covering a ten-year period starting in 2000.
  - Leases that do not fall under the national park lands listed in Schedule I.
- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond the period of the lease or the year 2000.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *National Parks Land Rents Remission Order* (1991) provides a **targeted financial relief mechanism** to leaseholders of public land in national parks by remitting the difference between the initial and final rental rates over a ten-year lease period beginning in 2000. This ensures that leaseholders are not unfairly burdened by rising rents, while maintaining the integrity of conservation and land-use policies. It reflects a balanced approach to public interest, combining environmental stewardship with equitable treatment of land users.

This regulation is a **historical policy measure** and is no longer in force or applicable for leases beyond the 2000–2009 period. It may serve as a reference point for understanding how the federal government has historically managed land rental structures in national parks.
