**Detailed Summary of the *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under the authority of:

- **Section 607a** and **paragraph 668(a)(b)** of the *Bank Act* (Canada).

These provisions grant the Superintendent of Financial Institutions the power to prescribe what constitutes "supervisory information" related to authorized foreign banks operating in Canada. The regulations are designed to ensure that sensitive financial and operational data collected during regulatory oversight is properly managed, protected, and disclosed only under strict conditions.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- Define and prescribe **specific types of information** that are considered **supervisory information** in relation to authorized foreign banks.
- Establish **clear rules** governing when and how such information may be disclosed.
- Protect the **confidentiality** of sensitive data obtained through regulatory examinations and assessments.
- Ensure **transparency and accountability** while maintaining the integrity of the financial supervision system.

This framework supports effective oversight by the Canadian government, particularly in relation to foreign banks that operate in Canada, and ensures alignment with domestic financial regulation standards.

### **4. Supervisory Information for Affiliates of Authorized Foreign Banks**

The regulations extend their scope to **affiliates** of authorized foreign banks, defining which types of supervisory information apply depending on the nature of the affiliate.

An affiliate is considered to be subject to the same supervisory information rules **if it falls within the regulatory framework of a specific Canadian financial institution type**. The applicable regulations are:

| Type of Affiliate | Relevant Regulatory Framework |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Bank (under *Bank Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations* |
| Cooperative Credit Association (under *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* |
| Insurance Company (under *Insurance Companies Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations* |
| Trust and Loan Company (under *Trust and Loan Companies Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* |
| Bank Holding Company (under *Bank Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* |
| Insurance Holding Company (under *Insurance Companies Act*) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* |

> *Note:* This ensures that affiliated entities are subject to appropriate regulatory scrutiny and that supervisory information is consistent across the group.

### **5. Confidentiality Provisions**

#### a) **General Prohibition on Disclosure**
- Subject to **Sections 3 and 4** of the regulations (which typically govern exceptions), an authorized foreign bank **shall not directly or indirectly disclose** any information prescribed in Section 1 (i.e., supervisory information).

> *This ensures that sensitive supervisory findings remain confidential and are not used for commercial or competitive advantage.*

#### b) **Permitted Disclosure to Certain Parties**
- An authorized foreign bank **may disclose** supervisory information to:
  - Its **affiliates**,
  - Its **directors, officers, employees, auditors, securities underwriters, or legal advisors**,
  - Or to **those of its affiliates** — **provided** that:
    - The bank ensures that the information **remains confidential**.
    - Appropriate confidentiality agreements are in place.
    - No unauthorized use or dissemination occurs.

> *Purpose:* To allow internal management and external advisors to make informed decisions based on supervisory insights — without compromising regulatory confidentiality.

#### c) **Disclosure of Material Facts under Securities Laws**
- The authorized foreign bank or any of its affiliates may disclose information referred to in **paragraph 1(1)(c)** (i.e., orders, agreements, or directions) **if**:
  - The information contains a **material fact** or **material change**.
  - Such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., U.S. SEC, U.K. FCA, etc.).

> *Example:* If a Canadian foreign bank is required to file a disclosure under U.S. securities regulations due to a change in capital structure or risk exposure, it may disclose the relevant supervisory information.

> *Note:* This exception balances regulatory confidentiality with **market transparency and investor protection** under international securities frameworks.
