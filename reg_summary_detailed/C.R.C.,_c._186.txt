**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and serves to govern the marketing of flue-cured tobacco in Ontario, specifically in interprovincial and export transactions.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi), which provides the legal framework under which this regulation operates. This Act empowers the government to regulate the marketing of certain agricultural products, including flue-cured tobacco.

- **Buyer**: A person who purchases tobacco. This includes both individuals and organizations involved in the buying process.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Farm Products Marketing Act and the Marketing Plan. It acts as the central authority responsible for managing the marketing of Ontario-grown flue-cured tobacco.

- **Licensed Buyer**: A buyer who has received a formal licence from the Commodity Board to purchase tobacco. This licence is conditional and does *not* include buyers whose licences have been suspended or revoked.

- **Marketing Quota**: A specific quantity of tobacco allocated by the Commodity Board to an individual or entity. This quota defines how much tobacco that person may legally market (sell or export).

- **Plan**: The *Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Plan*, established under the Farm Products Marketing Act. This plan outlines the rules, objectives, and mechanisms for managing the marketing of tobacco, including quotas, pricing, and distribution. Any regulations made under this plan are incorporated into these regulations.

- **Tobacco**: Defined as *unmanufactured flue-cured tobacco produced in Ontario*. This excludes processed or manufactured tobacco products and limits the scope to raw, agricultural tobacco grown in the province.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **marketing of tobacco** in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (sales between Ontario and other provinces),
  - **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada),
- And to **persons and property located within the Province of Ontario**.

This means the rules do not apply to tobacco sold within Ontario for local consumption or to non-Ontario producers or buyers outside the province.

### **4. Core Provisions and Restrictions**

#### **4.1 Restriction on Who Can Buy Tobacco**
> *No person shall buy tobacco from any person other than the Commodity Board or a person to whom the Commodity Board has fixed and allotted a marketing quota.*

- **Only authorized parties** can purchase tobacco.
- The Commodity Board is the sole buyer for tobacco not allocated under a marketing quota.
- Any individual or entity not holding a marketing quota (i.e., not formally assigned one) is **prohibited from buying** tobacco.

#### **4.2 Restriction on Who Can Sell Tobacco**
> *No person shall offer to sell or sell tobacco to any person other than the Commodity Board or a licensed buyer.*

- Tobacco can only be sold to:
  - The Commodity Board, or
  - A licensed buyer (as defined).
- This prevents unregulated or unauthorized sales, ensuring that all tobacco flows through the official marketing system.

#### **4.3 Restriction on Where Sales Can Occur**
> *No person shall offer to sell, sell, or buy tobacco at any place other than a tobacco exchange operated by the Commodity Board.*

- All buying and selling activities must take place at a **tobacco exchange** operated by the Commodity Board.
- This ensures:
  - Transparency,
  - Fair pricing,
  - Centralized oversight,
  - Compliance with established market rules.

#### **4.4 Restriction on Transportation and Shipment**
> *No person shall ship or transport tobacco to any place other than a tobacco exchange operated by the Commodity Board unless he has prior written consent from the Commodity Board.*

- Tobacco may **not be transported outside** the designated tobacco exchange without explicit, written permission from the Commodity Board.
- This prevents unauthorized movement of tobacco, reduces risk of smuggling or loss, and ensures all tobacco remains under the Board’s control until it is properly marketed.

#### **4.5 Marketing Must Be on a Quota Basis**
> *All tobacco shall be marketed on a quota basis.*

- Every sale of tobacco must be tied to a **marketing quota** assigned by the Commodity Board.
- This ensures equitable access to the market and prevents overproduction or market distortion.

#### **4.6 Prohibition on Marketing Without a Quota**
> *No person to whom a marketing quota has not been fixed and allotted or whose quota has been cancelled shall market any tobacco.*

- Individuals or entities without a valid marketing quota are **strictly prohibited** from marketing tobacco.
- This protects the integrity of the quota system and ensures only those who have been formally approved can participate in the market.

#### **4.7 Quota Limits**
> *No person to whom a marketing quota has been fixed and allotted shall market any tobacco in excess of such marketing quota.*

- Marketing is strictly limited to the **amount specified in the quota**.
- Exceeding the quota is a violation of the regulations and may result in penalties or enforcement action.
