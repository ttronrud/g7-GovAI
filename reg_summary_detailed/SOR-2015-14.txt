### **Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Health**. It is grounded in specific provisions of the **Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 12** — specifically **sections 131, 132, 134, 136, and 137**. These sections likely pertain to economic measures, such as fiscal adjustments, public spending timelines, or policy implementation schedules, which require a defined reference date for their application.

The purpose of this Order is to **designate a specific day** that will serve as a key reference point for the operation of those sections of the Act.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Designation of the Reference Day**  
   The day fixed for the purposes of sections 131, 132, 134, 136, and 137 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 12, is **September 1, 2018**.  
   - This date serves as a benchmark for determining the timing of actions, obligations, or effects under those sections (e.g., when certain economic measures take effect, when reporting periods begin, or when eligibility thresholds are met).

2. **Effective Date of the Order**  
   The Order comes into force on:
   - The **first day** on which **both sections 114 and 115** of the **Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11** are in force;  
   - **Alternatively**, if the Order is registered (officially published and enacted) after that day, it will come into force on the **day of registration**.

   This provision ensures that the Order only takes effect when the foundational provisions of the earlier Act (No. 11) are operational, thereby aligning the implementation of this regulatory measure with broader legislative and administrative frameworks.

3. **Note on Current Status**  
   The Order is noted to have been in force since **February 11, 2015**, as confirmed by **SI/2015-5** (a Statutory Instrument issued in 2015). This indicates that despite being issued in 2014, the Order was formally activated and became operational later, likely due to the timing of the registration or the enforcement of the enabling legislation.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- This Order provides **clarity and certainty** in the application of economic policy provisions by establishing a definitive reference date (September 1, 2018).  
- It enables consistent interpretation and enforcement of sections related to economic planning, budgeting, or fiscal adjustments.  
- The effective date mechanism ensures that the Order does not operate prematurely, only when the enabling legislative framework (sections 114 and 115 of Act No. 11) is fully active, thus avoiding regulatory inconsistency or overlap.

---

### **Legal Context**

- The **Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 12** is a legislative instrument designed to implement economic policy measures, possibly related to fiscal responsibility, public investment, or cost-saving initiatives.  
- Sections 131–137 likely govern implementation timelines, reporting requirements, or financial obligations tied to specific economic actions.  
- The reference date (September 1, 2018) may mark the start of a fiscal year, a policy review period, or a deadline for compliance.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **technical and administrative instrument** that defines a critical date for the operation of key economic provisions in the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act. By fixing September 1, 2018, as the reference day and linking its effective date to the activation of earlier sections of the Act, it ensures legal coherence, procedural consistency, and timely implementation of economic policy measures. Though issued in 2014, the Order became operational in 2015 and remains in force as a binding statutory provision under the relevant legislation.

**Note:** This Order is not a policy decision but a procedural one, intended to support the implementation of broader economic reforms through clear timelines and defined reference points.
