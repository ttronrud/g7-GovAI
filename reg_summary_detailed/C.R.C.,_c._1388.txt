### **4. Scope and Application of the Regulations**

These regulations apply to applications for development incentives submitted under the following conditions:

1. **On or after registration date** (under section 6 of the Statutory Instruments Act) and **before April 1, 1974**, where the applicant has opted to be governed by these regulations under subsection 4(1).

2. **On or after April 1, 1974**, and within **two months** of registration, where the applicant has *not* opted out under subsection 4(2).

3. **More than two months after registration**, regardless of opt-in status.

> *Note: This establishes a phased transition from earlier rules to the 1974 Regulations.*

---

### **5. Foreign Investment Restrictions**

- The Minister **shall not authorize** a development incentive or loan guarantee to a **non-eligible person** under the *Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA)* unless that person has fully complied with FIRA requirements.

---

### **6. Product Eligibility for New Manufacturing/Processing**

A product will be considered "not previously manufactured or processed" only if:
- It is **significantly different** from any product being made or processed in the facility at the time of application or in the 3 years prior.
- It **cannot be economically produced** in the operation without acquiring additional assets.

> This ensures that incentives are not used to replicate existing operations or produce minor variations.

---

### **7. Capital Cost Eligibility and Timing**

#### **For incentives based solely on capital costs:**
- Capital costs must be for **eligible assets installed and utilized** in the facility **within 24 months** of the date the facility is brought into commercial production.

#### **For incentives based partly on jobs created:**
- Capital costs must include eligible assets installed and utilized **within 36 months** of commercial production.

> The 36-month window reflects the longer time needed to establish full employment.

---

### **8. Determination of Approved Capital Costs**

Approved capital costs are calculated by aggregating:

1. **Costs not exceeding fair market value** of each asset.
2. **Reasonable direct costs** of:
   - Designing, acquiring, constructing, transporting, installing, and insuring assets
3. **For leased machinery and equipment:**
   - Leased for economic life
   - Includes option to purchase at fair market value at exercise
   - Inclusion is allowed only if it results in a **lower leasing charge** to the applicant (i.e., promotes economic efficiency)

> Leased assets are eligible only if they meet strict criteria to ensure cost-effectiveness.

---

### **9. Excess Capital Costs**

- If capital costs exceed **125%** of previously approved costs, the applicant must obtain **prior Ministerial agreement** to include the excess.
- Without such approval, the excess cannot be counted.

> This prevents over-spending and ensures cost control.

---

### **10. Re-evaluation of Incentives Due to Significant Changes**

If the Minister determines that:
- The eligible assets installed or planned create a **significant change** from the original plan,
- Or there is a change in ownership, management, financing, location, plant size, or timing,

Then the Minister may **reconsider, amend, or withdraw** the previously authorized incentive.

> This provides a safeguard against deviation from original plans.

---

### **11. Job Creation Calculation**

The number of jobs created is calculated as:

- **Only those directly involved in manufacturing or processing** of products enabled by the facility.
- In the case of **expansion**:
  - Subtract the number of persons normally employed at the time of the application, or
  - The number reasonably expected to continue if expansion had not occurred,
  - Whichever is **lesser**.

> This prevents double-counting of existing jobs.

---

### **12. Job Counting Method (Man-Days and Facility Operation)**

To determine the number of jobs, the Minister may use one of two formulas:

**Option A (Third Year):**
> (Total man-days paid during third year) ÷ (Number of days facility was in operation during third year)

**Option B (Average of Second and Third Years):**
> (Average of man-days paid in years 2 and 3) ÷ (Average of days in operation in years 2 and 3)

> The Minister may adjust for relevant circumstances (e.g., seasonal variation, downtime).

---

### **13. Determining Incentive Amount**

The Minister must consider:
- Number of jobs created
- Wages and salaries paid (averaged over years 2 and 3)

Adjustments may be made for:
- Circumstances deemed appropriate by the Minister

**Exclusions:**
- Excessive wages or salaries
- Any increase in jobs or wages beyond **125%** of the authorized amount, **unless approved in advance** by the Minister.

> Prevents inflation of incentive amounts through unapproved wage increases.

---

### **14. Deemed Employment and Payroll Records**

- Man-days and wages paid by:
  - Assignees of the applicant
  - Contractors or service providers with management/service agreements  
  may be **deemed** as paid by the applicant.

- **Condition**: Applicants must maintain **adequate payroll records** to verify wages and salaries.

> Ensures transparency and accountability.

---

### **15. Working Capital Requirements**

- Working capital included in total capital costs is the **excess of current assets over current liabilities** (excluding loans), as determined by the Minister to be required for full production capacity.

> Ensures that operations have sufficient liquidity to operate effectively.

---

### **16. Capitalized Expenses**

- Capitalized expenses (non-fixed asset costs) may be included if:
  - Necessarily incurred in bringing the facility into commercial operation
  - Follow normal accounting practices and are treated as capital expenditures (not income charges)

> Ensures only legitimate, forward-looking investments are counted.

---

### **17. Repayable Incentives for High-Risk Undertakings**

A development incentive may be authorized for an undertaking only if:
- It has a **high risk of failure** but offers a **high potential return**
- The return would be too marginal without the incentive
- Adequate financing cannot be arranged through loan guarantees or other means
- A non-repayable incentive would not be justifiable or in the public interest
- The
