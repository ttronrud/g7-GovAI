**Detailed Summary of the African Union Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The African Union Privileges and Immunities Order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs**. This authority is derived from **paragraphs 5(1)(f)(a) to (h)** of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMOA).

- This legislative power enables the Canadian government to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations and their representatives, in accordance with established international law and treaty frameworks.
- The Order is formally enacted under **Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 12, Section 3(3)** and is referenced in **Statutes of Canada, 1991, Chapter 41**.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **recognize and grant specific privileges and immunities** to key officials and personnel of the **African Union (AU)**, ensuring they can carry out their duties effectively and without undue interference, in alignment with international diplomatic norms.

These privileges and immunities are structured to mirror those granted to diplomatic agents under international conventions—particularly the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations** and the **United Nations Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**.

### **3. Key Definitions**
Two foundational international instruments are defined in the Order:

- **United Nations Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the FMOA.

These conventions form the legal basis for the privileges and immunities granted under this Order.

- **Function-based immunity**: Privileges and immunities are granted only to the extent required for the **performance of official duties**.
- **Proportionality**: The level of immunity is commensurate with the role and responsibilities of the individual.
- **Non-absolute nature**: Immunities are not unlimited and are subject to legal and procedural safeguards (e.g., paragraph 20 of the UN Convention).

### **Conclusion**
The African Union Privileges and Immunities Order establishes a clear, legally grounded framework for protecting AU officials and experts while ensuring accountability and compliance with international standards. It enhances the AU’s ability to function effectively in diplomatic, administrative, and technical capacities—particularly in Canada and other jurisdictions where AU representatives may operate.
