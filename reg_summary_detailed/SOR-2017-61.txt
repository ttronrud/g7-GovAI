**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Background**

This regulation is issued under the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act (R.C.M.P. Pension Continuation Act)**, specifically **R.S.C. 1970, c. R-10**.

The order is prompted by a report under **Section 56** of the Act, which indicates that the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund** contains a significant surplus — substantially exceeding the amount required to adequately cover future pension obligations. This surplus suggests that the fund has sufficient financial capacity to support benefit increases without compromising long-term solvency.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**) issues this Order under **subsection 57(1)** of the R.C.M.P. Pension Continuation Act. This provision authorizes the government to adjust pension benefits when it is determined that the fund is in excess of required levels, allowing for equitable and sustainable benefit enhancements.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **A. Increase in Widow’s Pensions (Current and Prospective)**

- **Benefit Type**: Pensions paid to current and prospective widows of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) members.
- **Increase Amount**: **1.9%**
- **Effective Dates**:  
  - April 1, 2017  
  - April 1, 2018  
  - April 1, 2019  
- **Scope**: Applies to both existing widows and those who may become widows in the future under the plan’s eligibility rules.

> This adjustment ensures that surviving spouses receive a modest but meaningful increase in their monthly pension payments, reflecting inflation and the need for financial stability.

---

#### **B. Increase in Lump Sum Death Benefits (for Non-Widowed Former Members)**

- **Benefit Type**: Lump sum payments made upon the death of a former R.C.M.P. member who contributed to the pension plan, **and who is not survived by a widow**.
- **Increase Amount**: **1.9%**
- **Effective Dates**:  
  - April 1, 2017  
  - April 1, 2018  
  - April 1, 2019  

> This provision enhances financial support for the families of deceased members who do not have a surviving spouse. The 1.9% increase improves the lump sum payout, providing greater financial security to beneficiaries in such cases.

#### **C. Residual Amounts for Widows on Death (Deemed Increase in Contributions)**

This is a more complex and significant provision, involving a **deemed increase in the former member’s contributions** to the pension fund, which affects the residual benefits payable to a widow upon her death.

- **Residual Benefit Definition**: The amount paid to a widow after her death, based on the pension fund’s residual value (typically derived from the member’s contributions and the plan’s valuation rules).

- **Deemed Contribution Increases**:
  - If the widow dies in the **2018 plan year**: **1,298%** increase in the former member’s contributions  
  - If the widow dies in the **2019 plan year**: **1,325%** increase  
  - If the widow dies in the **2020 plan year**: **1,352%** increase  

> This mechanism effectively recalculates the residual benefit as if the former member had contributed significantly more during their service — a substantial increase (e.g., 1,300% means the benefit is calculated as if contributions were 13 times higher).  
>  
> **Purpose**: This provision is designed to ensure that widows receive a more generous residual benefit upon their death, especially in light of the fund’s surplus. It reflects a long-term commitment to protecting dependents of deceased members by enhancing the financial security of surviving spouses.

> **Note**: The "deemed increase" is not a real increase in actual contributions but a hypothetical adjustment used in the calculation of residual benefits. It does not affect the member’s actual pension or contributions but adjusts the benefit formula for the widow’s residual payout.

### **4. Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on **April 1, 2017**.
- If the Order is registered (officially published) **after April 1, 2017**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the benefit adjustments begin promptly, with a clear timeline for implementation.

---

### **5. Legal and Financial Implications**

- **Fund Surplus Utilization**: The existence of a surplus in the R.C.M.P. (Dependants) Pension Fund allows for this increase without jeopardizing the fund’s long-term sustainability.
- **Equity and Fairness**: The adjustments are targeted at key beneficiary groups — widows and dependents — providing financial relief and improved security.
- **Long-Term Benefit Design**: The progressive increase in deemed contributions (from 1,298% to 1,352%) over three years indicates a phased, forward-looking approach to benefit enhancement, potentially aligning with inflation or demographic changes in the R.C.M.P. workforce.

---

### **6. Key Observations and Interpretations**

- The 1.9% annual increase in pensions and lump sums is relatively modest and may be intended to reflect inflation or administrative adjustments, rather than a major restructuring.
- The **residual benefit adjustment** is the most significant and unusual aspect of the Order. A 1,300% deemed increase is extraordinarily high and suggests a deliberate effort to enhance the financial protection of widows, possibly in response to a review of the fund’s long-term obligations or to address underfunding concerns in prior years.
- The use of "deemed contributions" is a common tool in pension plans to adjust benefit calculations without altering actual contributions — it is a method of ensuring that benefits grow in line with the fund’s health and surplus.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a targeted and strategic use of a pension fund surplus to improve benefits for widows and dependents of former R.C.M.P. members. It includes:

- A modest, annual 1.9% increase in pensions and lump sums for widows and non-widowed deceased members (effective 2017–2019),
- A significant, progressive increase in the calculation of residual benefits upon a widow’s death, using a deemed contribution adjustment that rises from 1,298% to 1,352% over the 2018–2020 plan years.

The Order underscores the government’s commitment to ensuring financial security for the families of R.C.M.P. members, leveraging the fund’s surplus to deliver meaningful improvements in long-term benefits.

> **Final Note**: This Order is not a general pension reform but a specific, time-bound adjustment based on a fund assessment. It is binding under the authority of the R.C.M.P. Pension Continuation Act and applies only to the defined benefit categories specified.
