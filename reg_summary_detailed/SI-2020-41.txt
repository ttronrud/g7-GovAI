**Detailed Summary of the Remission Order in Respect of Non-residential Leases and Licences of Occupation Under the Administration of the Parks Canada Agency**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

This remission order is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11)**. It is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Treasury Board**. This provision allows the government to grant financial relief to certain parties in respect of lease and licence payments during a specified period, based on public interest considerations.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Remission**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **provide financial relief to non-residential leaseholders and licence holders** who were affected by economic disruptions during the period from **April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020** — a timeframe that coincided with the early stages of the global pandemic.

The remission aims to:
- Support commercial operators and businesses operating on or near Parks Canada-managed lands.
- Recognize that many of these entities would have qualified for the **Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program**, had the landlord or licensor been a private entity.
- Mitigate financial hardship caused by reduced foot traffic, closure of operations, or other pandemic-related impacts.

### **3. Scope of Eligible Payments**

The remission applies to **75% of the amounts** paid or payable by eligible persons during the period April 1, 2020 – September 30, 2020, in respect of the following types of obligations:

#### **(a) Rent under National Parks of Canada Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations**
- **Subsection 11(1)**: Rent for leases of land under the *National Parks of Canada Lease and Licence of Occupation Regulations*.
- **Subsection 15.1(2)**: Rent for lease amending agreements entered into under this regulation.

#### **(b) Fees under Licence of Occupation of Public Lands**
- Fees for licences granted under **Section 18** of the Regulations, **if**:
  - The licence permits commercial use of the land, **or**
  - The licence is referenced in **subsection 18(23)** of the Regulations (which may relate to specific commercial or special-use authorizations).

#### **(c) Rent under the Town of Banff Incorporation Agreement**
- Rent under **Article 9.1** of the *Town of Banff Incorporation Agreement*, dated December 12, 1989.

#### **(d) Leases or Licences under Federal Real Property Regulations**
- Amounts for leases under **subsection 4(1)** or licences under **paragraph 4(2)(a)** of the *Federal Real Property Regulations*, provided that:
  - The lease or licence permits **commercial or municipal use** of the real property administered by Parks Canada.

#### **(e) Leases or Licences in the Rouge National Urban Park**
- Amounts for leases or licences related to public lands in the **Rouge National Urban Park**, if:
  - The lease or licence permits **commercial use**, and
  - The lease was:
    - Entered into or issued under **subsection 13(1) of the Rouge National Urban Park Act**, **or**
    - Issued by the **Province of Ontario or a municipality**, and then **assumed by the Minister of the Environment**.

### **4. Pro Rata Calculation for Annual Payments**

If any of the above amounts are calculated on an **annual basis**, the remission applies to the **portion of the annual amount** corresponding to the period from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020.

- This is calculated on a **pro rata basis** (i.e., 6 months out of a 12-month year).
- For example, if a lease is charged $120,000 annually, the amount payable for the 6-month period would be $60,000, and 75% of that ($45,000) would be remitted.

---

### **5. Eligibility Criteria**

The remission is granted only to persons who meet **specific eligibility conditions**:

#### **(i) General Eligibility (Commercial Operators)**
- A person is eligible **if they would have qualified for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program** for small businesses **had the lessor or licensor not been the Government of Canada**.
- This means:
  - The business must have been a small business (as defined under CECRA).
  - The business must have been operating in a commercial capacity.
  - The landlord or licensor **must not have been the Government of Canada** — this exclusion ensures that government-to-government or government-owned leases are not covered.
- The eligible party must **submit a signed attestation** confirming their eligibility **no later than December 31, 2020**.

#### **(ii) Automatic Eligibility (Two Municipal Entities)**
- The **Corporation of the Town of Banff** is automatically eligible.
- The **Municipality of Jasper** is automatically eligible.

> Note: These municipalities are included regardless of whether they would have qualified for CECRA, likely due to their status as local government entities with long-standing leases or operations on Parks Canada land.

### **6. Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Residential leases or licences.
  - Non-commercial uses of land.
  - Leases where the use is not permitted for commercial purposes.
  - Payments made to the Government of Canada as a lessor or licensor.
- The remission is **only for the period April 1, 2020 – September 30, 2020**.
- The 75% remission is **not a full refund**, but a partial relief of the financial burden.

---

### **7. Implementation and Compliance**

- **Submission Deadline**: All applicants (except the two municipalities) must submit a **signed attestation of eligibility** by **December 31, 2020**.
- The attestation must clearly state:
  - The nature of the business or operation.
  - The lease or licence in question.
  - The commercial purpose of the use.
  - That the party would have qualified for CECRA had the lessor not been the Government of Canada.
- Parks Canada or the relevant administering authority will assess the submissions for compliance.

---

### **8. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council determined that it is **in the public interest** to provide this remission because:
- The pandemic caused significant economic disruption to commercial operations on federal lands.
- Many businesses operating in national parks and protected areas were forced to close or reduce operations.
- The government recognized that private businesses faced financial strain that could have led to long-term loss of operations or closure, thereby impacting tourism, local economies, and environmental stewardship.
- By providing targeted relief, the government supports both economic resilience and the sustainability of operations in protected areas.

---

### **9. Broader Implications**

- This regulation reflects a **flexible, targeted response** to a crisis, applying financial support where it is most needed — to commercial operators on federal lands.
- It serves as a **model for future relief measures** in public sector property management during emergencies.
- It highlights the **interplay between federal environmental policy and economic support**, balancing conservation goals with economic stability.

### **Conclusion**

This remission order provides **significant financial relief** to commercial operators and municipalities operating under leases or licences administered by Parks Canada during a critical period in 2020. By remitting **75% of lease and licence fees** for a 6-month window, the government supports economic recovery and operational continuity in key national parks and protected areas, while maintaining the integrity of environmental and land-use regulations.

It is a **targeted, conditional, and time-limited** measure designed to assist private sector actors who would otherwise have qualified for emergency rent assistance — but were excluded due to the government's role as lessor or licensor.

**Summary in One Sentence**:  
*The Government of Canada, through Parks Canada, remitted 75% of commercial lease and licence fees paid between April 1 and September 30, 2020, to eligible businesses and municipalities that would have qualified for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, provided they submitted an attestation of eligibility by December 31, 2020.*
