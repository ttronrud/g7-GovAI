**Detailed Summary of the Nardeux Canada Ltée Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Nardeux Canada Ltée Regulations* were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** and the **Treasury Board**. The regulations derive their legal authority from two provisions of federal appropriation acts:

- **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a of Appropriation Act No. 1, 1980–81**  
- **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1e of Appropriation Act No. 4, 1981–82**

These provisions authorize the government to provide insurance for certain loans made to specific enterprises to support high-technology development in strategic sectors.

The regulations came into force in **1980–1981** and were extended through **1981–1982**, as reflected in the statutory citations:
- S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 3  
- S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 9  

They may be cited as the **Nardeux Canada Ltée Regulations**.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**. This minister is responsible for administering the program and making decisions regarding insurance coverage under the regulations.

2. **Nardeux Canada Ltée**  
   A federally incorporated company with the name *Nardeux Canada Ltée*, whose **principal place of business is in Montreal, Quebec**. The regulations are specifically tailored to support this company’s activities.

3. **Private Lender**  
   Defined as any individual or entity that:
   - Is **not** the Government of Canada,
   - Is not a provincial government of Canada,
   - Is not an agency of any of the above (government or its agencies),
   - Is not a company effectively controlled by any such government or its agencies,
   - Is not a **municipal corporation**.

   This definition excludes public institutions and government-controlled entities, ensuring that only private-sector lenders can participate in the insurance scheme.

### **Core Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective is to **facilitate investment in high-technology development** by Nardeux Canada Ltée in two key areas:

- **Radio-protection**  
- **Radio-telecommunications**

To achieve this, the regulations establish a **government-backed insurance program** that protects private lenders against financial losses resulting from loans made to Nardeux Canada Ltée.

### **Insurance Coverage Details**

1. **Maximum Coverage Amount**  
   - The Minister may provide insurance for **up to 85% of each individual loss** incurred by a private lender.  
   - The **aggregate total** of all insured losses (across all private lenders and all loans) is capped at **$475,000**.  
     This means that even if multiple loans are involved, the total amount the government will pay under this scheme cannot exceed $475,000.

2. **Reduction of Insurance by Private Lenders**  
   - A private lender may **request a reduction** in the amount of insurance provided to them.  
   - This provision gives flexibility, allowing lenders to adjust their risk exposure based on their own financial or risk assessment criteria.

3. **Fees for Insurance**  
   - Private lenders must pay the Minister a **semi-annual fee**.  
   - The fee is **not to exceed 2% per annum** of the total amount of insurance currently in force for that lender.  
   - This fee is paid in advance and serves as a cost of accessing the insurance program.

### **Payment of Losses by the Government**

When a private lender demands repayment from Nardeux Canada Ltée and suffers a loss, the Minister will pay the private lender **only up to the lesser of two amounts**:

1. **100% of the amount of insurance in force on the date of the demand**  
   → This means the government will pay the full amount of insurance coverage that was active at the time the demand was made.

2. **85% of the actual loss incurred by the private lender**, but **not exceeding $475,000 in total**  
   → This ensures that the government does not cover more than 85% of the loss, and that the total payout across all insured events remains within the $475,000 cap.

> ✅ **Example**:  
> Suppose a private lender has $500,000 in insurance in force and suffers a $700,000 loss.  
> - The government will pay:  
>   - The lesser of:  
>     - $500,000 (100% of insurance in force)  
>     - 85% of $700,000 = $595,000  
>   → So, the payment is **$500,000** (the cap of insurance in force).  
> - Additionally, the total of all such payments across all lenders and loans cannot exceed $475,000.

### **Conclusion**

The *Nardeux Canada Ltée Regulations* represent a targeted, government-supported insurance mechanism designed to stimulate private investment in high-technology sectors by reducing the financial risk for private lenders. By capping both individual and aggregate losses, and requiring a modest fee, the program balances risk management with fiscal responsibility. It reflects a broader policy approach of using targeted financial instruments to support innovation and industrial development in strategic areas during the 1980s.

This regulation is a historical example of how federal governments have used insurance programs to promote technological advancement in specific industries through private-sector participation.
