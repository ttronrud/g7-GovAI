### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Increase in Maximum Appeal Amounts**
The regulation increases two key monetary thresholds that define the limits of informal appeals under the *Tax Court of Canada Act*:

- **For appeals involving a single taxpayer or a single assessment (paragraph 18(1)(a) of the Act, and subsections 18.11(2) and (3), sections 18.12 and 18.13):**  
  - The previous maximum amount of **$7,000** is **increased to $12,000**.  
  - This applies to appeals where the dispute involves a single assessment or a single taxpayer's tax liability.

- **For appeals involving multiple taxpayers or joint assessments (paragraph 18(1)(b) of the Act, and sections 18.1, 18.12, and 18.13):**  
  - The previous maximum amount of **$14,000** is **increased to $24,000**.  
  - This applies to cases involving joint assessments or multiple taxpayers, where the total liability or dispute value exceeds the single taxpayer threshold.

> These amounts represent the **maximum value of the tax liability or assessment** that can be subject to an informal appeal under the simplified (non-adjudicative) procedure of the Tax Court of Canada.

#### 2. **Applicability of the Amendments**
- The revised amounts apply **only to appeals instituted on or after September 1, 1993**.  
- Appeals initiated **before September 1, 1993**, are governed by the previous limits ($7,000 and $14,000).  
- This ensures a clear transition period, allowing the Tax Court system to adapt to the new financial thresholds without retroactive impact.

#### 3. **Scope of Application**
- **Sections 3 and 4** of the Regulations (which define the specific amounts and their application) are **only applicable to appeals filed on or after September 1, 1993**.  
- These sections clarify how the increased amounts are interpreted and applied in practice, particularly in determining whether an appeal falls within the informal procedure's jurisdiction.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Enhanced Accessibility:** By raising the cap from $7,000 to $12,000 and from $14,000 to $24,000, the regulation makes the informal appeal process more accessible to taxpayers with higher tax liabilities. This supports a more efficient dispute resolution mechanism, reducing the need to escalate to formal hearings.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Informal appeals are typically less costly and time-consuming than formal appeals. Increasing the financial threshold ensures that more taxpayers can resolve disputes without the burden of formal court proceedings.

- **Clarity and Consistency:** The regulation provides clear, codified limits that guide both taxpayers and CRA officers in determining whether an appeal qualifies for the informal procedure.

- **Administrative Efficiency:** By setting clear monetary thresholds, the Tax Court of Canada can manage its workload more effectively, prioritizing complex or high-value cases for formal review.

### **Conclusion**
The *Maximum Amounts for Informal Procedure Regulations* serve to modernize and expand the scope of the informal appeal process under the *Tax Court of Canada Act*. By increasing the maximum appeal amounts to **$12,000** (for single taxpayers) and **$24,000** (for joint or multiple assessments), and by applying these changes to appeals initiated on or after **September 1, 1993**, the regulation enhances access to fair and timely tax dispute resolution while maintaining the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the informal process.

This update reflects the evolving nature of tax liabilities and the need for a responsive, equitable, and practical dispute resolution framework.
