**Detailed Summary of the Public Service Part-time Regulations (Effective January 1, 1981)**

---

### **Background and Rationale**

The regulation is rooted in a decision by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** that it is **not practicable nor in the best interests of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)* to certain part-time employees. Specifically, the Commission determined that:

1. **Persons who are not ordinarily required to work more than one-third of the normal scheduled daily or weekly hours** of work (as established for similar positions) should be excluded from the full application of the PSEA.
2. **Persons previously covered under the *Part-time Employees Exclusion Approval Order* (C.R.C., c. 1350)** and the *Part-time Employment Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 1351), who work **more than one-third but not more than 15 hours per week**, should also be excluded from the full scope of the PSEA.

The Commission concluded that excluding these individuals from the more stringent employment provisions of the PSEA was both **practical and beneficial** to the Public Service, particularly given the nature of their work and staffing needs.

### **Key Legislative Actions**

On the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, **His Excellency the Governor in Council**:

1. **Revokes**:
   - The *Part-time Employees Exclusion Approval Order, C.R.C., c. 1350*
   - The *Part-time Employment Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1351*

2. **Replaces them with**:
   - A new **Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order** (referred to as the "Order")
   - A new set of **Public Service Part-time Regulations** (to be cited as the *Public Service Part-time Regulations*)

These new regulations came into effect on **January 1, 1981**, and establish a clear, structured framework for managing part-time employment in the Public Service.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Part-time worker** | A person who is *not ordinarily required to work more than one-third* of the normal scheduled daily or weekly hours of work established for persons doing similar work. |
| **Former part-time worker** | A person who was previously employed under the old *Exclusion Approval Order* and *Part-time Employment Regulations* (before January 1, 1981), and who worked **more than one-third but not more than 15 hours per week**. |
| **Order** | Refers to the new *Part-time Work Exclusion Approval Order* replacing the old one. |

> These regulations **only apply to persons to whom the Order applies** — i.e., those falling within the defined part-time thresholds.

### **Key Provisions and Operational Framework**

#### 1. **Recruitment and Appointment of Part-time Workers**
- When a department requires a part-time worker, the **deputy head** (a senior public service manager) must:
  - Recruit and select candidates from:
    - **Canadian Employment Centres** (public employment services)
    - **Public Service Commission Staffing Offices**
  - Upon selection, the deputy head may **appoint** the person to the position.

> This ensures a fair, transparent, and centralized recruitment process for part-time staff.

#### 2. **Call-Back List for Former and Current Part-time Workers**
- Departments where both **former and current part-time workers** are employed may:
  - Maintain a **call-back list** for a period determined by the deputy head.
  - Place on the list the names of individuals who have:
    - Performed their duties **satisfactorily**
    - Terminated their services before the end of their employment term
  - **Call back** those individuals when a suitable position becomes available at a level they are qualified for.

> This provision promotes **job stability, retention, and continuity**, especially for experienced part-time workers who may have been displaced or reduced in hours.

#### 3. **Notice Before Termination**
- Both **former part-time workers** and **current part-time workers** are entitled to **at least one day’s notice** before their services are terminated.

> This ensures **fair treatment and respect for employee rights**, even in part-time roles.

---

### **Delegation of Authority**
- A **deputy head** may delegate any of their powers, functions, or duties under these regulations to one or more persons within their jurisdiction.

> This allows for administrative flexibility and operational efficiency in managing part-time staffing across departments.

---

### **Scope and Limitations**

- These regulations **do not apply to all employees**.
- They are **limited to those individuals** who fall under the part-time threshold defined in the Order — specifically, those working **no more than one-third of the standard daily or weekly hours** (for similar work).
- The exclusion from the full application of the PSEA means that **certain employment protections and procedures** (such as those related to job security, promotion, or collective agreements) may not apply to these part-time workers to the same extent as full-time employees.

---

### **Policy Objectives and Implications**

1. **Practicality and Efficiency**:
   - The exclusion simplifies staffing and employment management for roles with low-hour requirements.
   - Avoids administrative burden of applying full employment laws to part-time roles that do not require the same level of commitment or oversight.

2. **Fairness and Stability**:
   - The call-back list and notice requirements ensure that part-time workers are not arbitrarily dismissed and are given opportunities to return to work when positions open.

3. **Workforce Flexibility**:
   - Allows departments to scale staffing up or down based on need without triggering full employment processes.

4. **Retention and Experience Utilization**:
   - Recognizes that experienced part-time workers can contribute valuable skills and knowledge, and provides mechanisms to retain them.

### **Conclusion**

The **Public Service Part-time Regulations (1981)** represent a targeted, pragmatic approach to managing part-time employment within the Canadian Public Service. By legally excluding certain part-time workers from the full reach of the *Public Service Employment Act*, while still providing protections such as notice of termination and call-back rights, the regulations balance **operational flexibility** with **employee fairness**.

This framework supports the Public Service’s need for adaptable staffing solutions while respecting the rights and contributions of part-time workers — particularly those who work fewer than 15 hours per week but are essential to departmental operations.

---

**In essence**:  
The 1981 Part-time Regulations create a **clear, equitable, and practical system** for hiring, retaining, and managing part-time employees in the Public Service — ensuring that flexibility does not come at the cost of fairness or stability.
