**Regulatory Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1672 and Designation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as Minister for the Canadian Space Agency Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Canadian Space Agency Act* (S.C. 1990, c. 13), specifically pursuant to Section 2 of that Act, which defines the role and responsibilities of the "Minister" in relation to the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) exercises this authority to amend the administrative structure and governance of the CSA.

**2. Revocation of Prior Order**  
The regulation formally revokes **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1672**, issued on August 18, 1993. This earlier order had previously established a specific designation or arrangement for the Minister responsible for the Canadian Space Agency. By revoking this order, the government removes the prior ministerial assignment and any associated provisions that were in effect at the time.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**  
The regulation designates the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** as the official "Minister for the purposes of the Canadian Space Agency Act." This means that, effective from the date of this regulation, the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology is the designated federal minister responsible for overseeing the Canadian Space Agency, including its operations, policy direction, budgetary matters, and strategic planning.

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
- This designation ensures continuity and clarity in the governance of the Canadian Space Agency by formally assigning responsibility to a specific minister.  
- It reflects a shift in ministerial portfolio responsibilities, likely in response to evolving government priorities, organizational restructuring, or the need for greater coordination between space policy and broader science and technology initiatives.  
- The designation aligns with the Canadian Space Agency Act’s requirement that a Minister be appointed to provide oversight and policy leadership.  
- It also ensures that the CSA operates under the authority of a minister with established expertise in science, technology, and industrial development.

**5. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- The regulation is issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, indicating it is a formal, high-level government decision.  
- It is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, under SI/93-172, on page 3711, which confirms its official status and legal effect.  
- The revocation of the prior order ensures that there is no conflicting or outdated ministerial assignment in force.

**6. Effective Date and Implementation**  
While the exact effective date is not explicitly stated in the text, such regulatory changes typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette, unless otherwise specified. The new designation would therefore become effective upon the date of publication (or the date of issuance, depending on administrative practice).

**Conclusion**  
This regulation streamlines and updates the ministerial oversight of the Canadian Space Agency by revoking an outdated ministerial designation and formally assigning responsibility to the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology. It strengthens the integration of space policy within Canada’s broader science and technology framework and ensures that the CSA is governed by a minister with relevant expertise and policy authority.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Revokes outdated ministerial assignment (P.C. 1993-1672).  
- Appoints the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as the official Minister of the CSA.  
- Ensures legal clarity, administrative coherence, and policy continuity.  
- Reflects a strategic realignment of science and space policy responsibilities in the federal government.
