**Detailed Summary of the Crown Corporation Corporate Plan, Budget and Summaries Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The regulation is issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada** under **paragraphs 126(a) and (b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. It serves to **repeal two outdated regulations**:

1. **Crown Corporation Corporate Plan and Budget Regulations**, made under decision **T.B. 802718 of July 23, 1986**  
2. **Crown Corporation Summaries Regulations, 1986**, made under decision **T.B. 804020 of December 18, 1986**

These older regulations were replaced by a new, more comprehensive set of rules that provide clearer, more consistent, and modernized requirements for the preparation, submission, and parliamentary presentation of corporate plans, budgets, and summaries for **parent Crown corporations**.

The new regulations are officially titled:  
👉 **Crown Corporation Corporate Plan, Budget and Summaries Regulations**  
They are published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, under **SOR/86-828 (1986)** and **SOR/87-37 (1987)**.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Definition of "Act"**
- "Act" refers to the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, which governs the financial management and accountability of federal institutions, including Crown corporations.

---

#### **2. Scope of a Corporate Plan**

A **corporate plan** of a parent Crown corporation must cover a **defined five-year period**, structured as follows:

- The **financial year in which the plan is submitted**  
- The **financial year immediately preceding** the submission year  
- The **five financial years following** the submission year  

👉 **Total coverage: 7 financial years**  
This structure ensures that plans provide both forward-looking strategic direction and historical context for performance evaluation.

> Example:  
> If a plan is submitted for the 2025 fiscal year, it must cover:  
> - 2024 (prior year)  
> - 2025 (current year)  
> - 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, and 2030 (next five years)

This extended timeframe supports long-term planning, risk assessment, and financial sustainability.

---

#### **3. Submission Deadlines**

- A parent Crown corporation must submit its **corporate plan**, **capital budget**, and **operating budget** (if required by the FAA) to the **appropriate Minister**  
- **Deadline**: No later than **eight weeks before the start of each financial year**

> Example:  
> For the 2025 financial year, the submission must be made by **no later than October 15, 2024** (assuming financial year starts January 1).

This ensures that budgets and plans are available to ministers and policy decision-makers in time to inform annual policy, funding, and oversight decisions.

---

#### **4. Handling of Unavailable Information**

If any information normally required in a corporate plan, operating budget, capital budget, or amendment is **not available**, the corporation must:

- Clearly **state the reasons** for the unavailability of that information  
- Include this explanation in the submitted plan, budget, or amendment

This provision promotes **transparency and accountability**, ensuring that decision-makers are aware of data gaps and limitations, rather than receiving incomplete or misleading information.

---

#### **5. Language Requirements**

- **Submission in both official languages**:  
  All corporate plans, operating budgets, capital budgets, and amendments must be submitted to the Minister **in both English and French**.

- **Graphs, tables, and calculations**:  
  These may be prepared in **only one official language** (either English or French).  
  This practical flexibility reduces administrative burden while maintaining compliance with bilingualism principles.

> Note: The requirement for bilingual submission applies to the **textual content** and **descriptive elements**, but visual elements (charts, tables) can be presented in one language.

---

#### **6. Parliamentary Summaries – Timing and Approval Conditions**

Summaries of corporate plans, budgets, or amendments must be laid before **each House of Parliament** (House of Commons and Senate) on **any of the first 30 days** after a House is sitting, **provided** that one of the following approvals has been obtained:

| Type of Summary | Approval Requirement |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Summary of a corporate plan or amended plan** | Approval of the plan by the **Governor in Council** under **section 122 of the FAA** |
| **Summary of an operating or capital budget included in a corporate plan** | Approval of the plan by the **Governor in Council** (same as above) |
| **Summary of an operating or capital budget (not part of a corporate plan)** | Approval of the budget by the **Treasury Board** under **section 123 or 124 of the FAA**, as applicable |

> This ensures that parliamentary scrutiny occurs only after formal government approval, aligning with the principle of **accountability and democratic oversight**.

> The summary must be presented within **30 days of the House beginning its session**, giving Parliament sufficient time to review and debate the financial proposals.
