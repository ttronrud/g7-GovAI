**Detailed Summary of the Debt Reserve Fund Replenishment Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 2005, c. 9*  
*Enacted under: First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act (the "Act") – subsection 84(5) and paragraph 89(c)*  
*Made by: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development*

### **1. Purpose of the Regulations**
These regulations establish a formal framework for **replenishing the Debt Reserve Fund** of the First Nations Authority when it has been depleted due to a borrowing member’s failure to make required payments. The primary objective is to ensure the financial stability of the Authority by requiring responsible repayment from borrowing members—particularly those who are "defaulting"—to restore the fund to a sufficient level.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act*, which provides the legal foundation for financial governance and accountability of First Nations in relation to borrowing and debt management.

- **Defaulting Member**: A borrowing member whose failure to make a payment under a borrowing agreement with the Authority has directly resulted in a reduction of the Debt Reserve Fund. This status triggers specific obligations and financial responsibilities under the regulations.

---

### **3. Determination of the Amount to Be Replenished (Section 2)**

Under **paragraphs 84(5)(a) and (b)** of the Act, the amount required to replenish the Debt Reserve Fund is defined as:

> *The balance of the debt reserve fund immediately before the first payment from that fund was made, excluding any prior payments that had already triggered replenishment requirements.*

This means that the calculation starts from the point when the fund was first reduced due to a default, and it reflects the actual shortfall at that moment—not cumulative or inflated by earlier adjustments.

---

### **4. Notice Requirements (Section 3)**

The Authority must provide **at least 90 days’ advance notice** to each borrowing member who has an unpaid loan before any payment is required to replenish the fund.

#### Key Elements of the Notice:
- Must clearly state:
  - The **total shortfall** in the debt reserve fund.
  - The **total amount** each borrowing member is required to pay, as determined under **Section 3**.
- Must identify **all defaulting members** and specify the **portion of the shortfall attributable to each**.

This ensures transparency, fairness, and opportunity for members to respond or seek clarification before financial obligations are enforced.

---

### **5. Formula for Calculating Repayment Amounts**

The amount payable by each borrowing member is calculated differently depending on their status:

#### A. For a **Defaulting Member**:
- The amount owed **must not exceed** the portion of the shortfall attributable to that member.
- This ensures that no defaulting member is required to pay more than their share of the fund’s loss.

#### B. For a **Non-Defaulting Borrowing Member** (with an unpaid loan):
The repayment amount is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Amount to be paid} = \left( \frac{\text{Unpaid loans of member}}{\text{Total unpaid loans of all members}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Total unpaid loans of defaulting members}}{\text{Total unpaid loans of all members}} \right) \times \text{Shortfall} - \text{Total payments by defaulting members}
\]

Simplified breakdown:
- The amount is proportionally allocated based on:
  - The member’s individual unpaid loans (relative to total unpaid loans across all members).
  - The proportion of unpaid loans held by defaulting members.
- The final amount is adjusted downward by the total amount already paid by defaulting members.

> This formula ensures that non-defaulting members contribute in proportion to their borrowing and the extent of default-related losses, promoting equitable distribution.

---

### **6. Critical Clarification on Liability**

Despite any payment made under **paragraph 3(a)** (i.e., the repayment under the formula), a **defaulting member remains fully liable** for:
- All amounts required under the original borrowing agreement with the Authority.
- This means that even if the member pays their share of the shortfall, they are still responsible for any outstanding principal, interest, or other financial obligations under the original loan terms.

This provision protects the Authority from partial relief and ensures full accountability for defaults.

---

### **7. Repeal and Amendments**

- The regulation was **repealed by SOR/2024-255, section 5**.
- This means that **as of the date of the repeal**, the Debt Reserve Fund Replenishment Regulations are **no longer in force**.
- The repeal suggests a potential update or replacement of the rules with new legislation or administrative guidance, possibly reflecting changes in financial oversight or policy priorities.

---

### **8. Coming Into Force**

- These regulations came into force on the day they were **registered** (i.e., officially published and adopted into law).
- However, due to the repeal, they are **no longer active** as of the date of SOR/2024-255.

| **Notice Period** | At least 90 days before payment is due. |
| **Notice Content** | Total shortfall, individual member obligations, list of defaulting members and their share. |
| **Payment Formula** | Defaulting members: capped at their attributable shortfall; others: proportional based on loan size and default exposure. |

### **Conclusion**

The Debt Reserve Fund Replenishment Regulations were designed to maintain financial accountability and stability within the First Nations financial system by establishing clear, transparent, and equitable mechanisms for restoring funds lost due to defaults. However, the regulations have been **officially repealed**, indicating a shift in policy or administrative approach. As such, while the principles of accountability and proportional repayment remain relevant, the specific rules governing fund replenishment under these regulations are no longer applicable.

> **Note to Practitioners**: Stakeholders should refer to current policy or updated regulations (e.g., post-2024 amendments) for current obligations related to debt reserve management and borrowing agreements with the First Nations Authority.
