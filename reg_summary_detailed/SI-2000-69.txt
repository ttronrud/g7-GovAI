Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled *"Indian Settlements Remission Order (2000)"*, issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, based on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and pursuant to subsection 23(2)a of the *Financial Administration Act*.

## **Detailed Summary of the Indian Settlements Remission Order (2000)**

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
- This regulation provides **tax remission** (i.e., a refund or cancellation of tax liability) for certain taxpayers and recipients of taxable supplies related to **Indian Settlements** in Canada.
- It is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make orders for the remission of taxes in the public interest.
- The decision to issue this order was made **on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**, indicating a policy-driven, revenue-considered approach to addressing tax obligations on Indigenous lands.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**
- The Order applies to **Indian Settlements** as defined in **Schedule 1**.
- An *Indian Settlement* refers to a specific geographic area named in **Column 1** of Schedule 1 and described in **Column 2** of that Schedule.
- The Order **remains in force until** all or part of the lands constituting the Indian Settlement are formally designated as a **reserve** by an order of the Governor in Council.
  - This means that as long as the land remains classified as an "Indian Settlement" (not a reserve), the remission provisions apply.

---

### **3. Definitions**
Key terms used throughout the Order:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Indian Settlement** | A named settlement listed in Column 1 of Schedule 1, with a description in Column 2. |
| **Reserve** | Has the same meaning as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. A reserve is a designated area of land set aside for Indigenous peoples under federal law. |
| **Tax (Income Tax context)** | Refers to taxes imposed under Part I, I.1, or I.2 of the *Income Tax Act*. |
| **Tax (Excise Tax context)** | Refers to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) imposed under Division II of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*. |
| All other terms | Carry the same meaning as in the relevant Act (Income Tax Act or Excise Tax Act), unless otherwise defined. |

### **4. Remission for Income Tax (Section 5 – Income Tax Remission)**

#### **What is remitted?**
- A taxpayer whose income arises from an Indian Settlement is entitled to **remission** of any tax, interest, or penalties **paid or payable** during a taxation year or fiscal period, **if**:
  - The amount of tax, interest, and penalties **actually paid** exceeds
  - The amount that would have been payable **if the Indian Settlement had been a reserve throughout the entire year/fiscal period**.

#### **Key Conditions:**
- The remission applies to **each taxation year or fiscal period** that begins **during or after** the date specified in **Column 2 of Schedule 2** for that particular Indian Settlement.
- The calculation compares the actual tax burden to what would have been the tax burden **had the settlement been a reserve** (i.e., treated as a legally designated Indigenous reserve under the Indian Act), which typically has different tax treatment.

> 💡 **Implication**: This effectively reduces or eliminates tax liability for income generated on Indian Settlements because the tax treatment of reserves is more favorable (e.g., certain exclusions or lower rates).

---

### **5. Remission for Goods and Services Tax (GST) – Section 6 (Excise Tax Remission)**

#### **Who is eligible?**
- A **recipient** of a taxable supply (such as goods or services) made **on or delivered to an Indian Settlement** on or after a specific date set out in **Schedule 2**.

#### **When does the remission apply?**
- For each item in **Schedule 2**, the remission applies based on:
  - **Column 3** (for supplies delivered *after* the date in Column 3)
  - **Column 4** (for supplies delivered *after* the date in Column 4)

> ⚠️ Note: The dates in Columns 3 and 4 are likely different for different Indian Settlements and may reflect phased implementation of the remission.

#### **What is remitted?**
- The amount by which the **tax paid or payable** by the recipient **exceeds** the tax that would have been payable **if the Indian Settlement had been a reserve**.

> Example: If a business sells goods to an Indian Settlement and pays GST, but the settlement is not a reserve, the tax is higher than it would be if it were a reserve. The excess tax is remitted to the recipient.

### **6. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

#### **For Individuals (Section 6 – Individual Claimants):**
- The tax **must not have already been**:
  - Rebated
  - Credited
  - Refunded
  - Remitted
  under either:
  - Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* (GST)
  - The *Financial Administration Act*
- A claim must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the tax was paid or became payable.

#### **For Persons Other Than Individuals (e.g., businesses, corporations):**
- The tax must **not have been previously rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted** under the same Acts.
- Two separate timelines apply:
  - For tax paid **on or after the date in Column 4** of an item in Schedule 2 but **before the date in Column 3**:
    - Claim must be made within **two years of the latter date (Column 3)**.
  - For tax paid **on or after the date in Column 3**:
    - Claim must be made within **two years of the date the tax was paid**.

> 🔍 This reflects a phased implementation strategy, allowing businesses more time to respond as the Order is rolled out across different settlements.

### **7. Key Principles and Impacts**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Interest Justification** | The Order is justified as being in the public interest, likely to support Indigenous economic development, reduce tax burdens on communities, and promote equity. |
| **Favorable Tax Treatment for Reserves** | Reserves are generally subject to different tax rules (e.g., exclusion of certain income, lower GST rates), so remitting the difference ensures fair treatment. |
| **Phased Implementation** | The use of different dates in Columns 3 and 4 of Schedule 2 allows the government to implement the remission gradually, avoiding sudden financial shocks. |
| **Prevention of Double Recovery** | The rule that remission is only granted if the tax has not already been refunded or credited prevents double benefits. |
| **Time Limits for Claims** | The two-year deadline ensures timely administration and reduces administrative burdens. |

### **8. Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 – Key Components**

- **Schedule 1**: Lists the names and descriptions of Indian Settlements eligible for this remission.
- **Schedule 2**: Contains the critical dates:
  - **Column 2**: The start date of the taxation year/fiscal period when remission applies (for income tax).
  - **Column 3 and 4**: The dates after which GST remission applies for taxable supplies (with different timelines depending on the settlement).

> Example:
> - For Settlement A: Income tax remission begins in 2000; GST remission applies to supplies delivered on or after January 1, 2002 (Column 3), with a claim deadline of 2 years after that date.
> - For Settlement B: GST remission begins on June 1, 2003 (Column 4), with a claim deadline of 2 years after the date of payment.

### **9. Legal and Policy Significance**

- This Order reflects a **policy of recognizing Indigenous land status** and adjusting tax treatment accordingly.
- It acknowledges that **Indian Settlements are not equivalent to reserves** in terms of legal status or tax obligations, and thus may face higher tax burdens.
- By remitting the difference, the government promotes **equity and reconciliation**, supporting the financial sustainability of Indigenous communities.
- It also demonstrates the **flexibility of federal tax policy** to respond to unique socio-legal circumstances.

---

### **10. Limitations and Exclusions**

- Remission **does not apply** if:
  - The tax has already been refunded, credited, or remitted under another provision.
- Remission **only applies to taxes directly related to the Indian Settlement**, not general income or unrelated transactions.
- The **two-year claim window** limits access to remission for those who delay filing claims.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Indian Settlements Remission Order (2000)* is a targeted, equitable, and legally grounded tax relief measure designed to:

- Reduce the tax burden on income and taxable supplies generated on Indian Settlements,
- Recognize the difference in tax treatment between Indian Settlements and reserves,
