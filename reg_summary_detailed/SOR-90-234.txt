**Detailed Summary of the Advance Income Tax Ruling Fees Order (SI/89-217, 1989)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Enacting Authority**: The Minister of National Revenue.
- **Legal Basis**:
  - **Paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: This provision grants the Minister of National Revenue the authority to make, amend, or revoke regulations relating to fees and charges associated with government services, including those provided by the Department of National Revenue (DNR).
  - **Order in Council P.C. 1989-1949 (September 28, 1989)**: This order provides the legal framework under which the Minister can issue or revoke fee regulations, including those concerning advance tax rulings.

- **Purpose**: To update and replace the outdated *Department of National Revenue (Taxation) Advance Rulings Fees Order* made on May 25, 1983 (SOR/83-485), which had been in effect for nearly a decade and no longer reflected current administrative or economic conditions.

---

### **2. Revocation of Previous Order**

- The **1983 Advance Rulings Fees Order (SOR/83-485)** is officially **revoked** by this regulation.
- This revocation ensures that the current fee structure is the legally binding and applicable one, replacing the previous framework that may have been inconsistent with evolving service delivery models or inflation adjustments.

### **3. New Fee Structure – Key Provisions**

The new regulation establishes a **time-based fee structure** for advance income tax rulings issued by the Department of National Revenue (now part of the Canada Revenue Agency – CRA).

#### **Fee Amounts by Period**:

| Period | Fee per Hour or Part of an Hour |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **April 1, 2022 – March 31, 2023** | **$221.24** |
| **As of April 1, 2023** | **$281.22** |

> **Note**: The fee applies **regardless of whether the request is withdrawn**. This means that even if a taxpayer cancels their request before a ruling is issued, the fee is still payable.

#### **Application of the Fee**:
- The fee is charged **per hour or part of an hour** spent by the Department in preparing the advance income tax ruling.
- The fee is **not capped** at a flat rate; it is directly tied to the time required to process the request.
- The time spent includes all activities related to the preparation of the ruling, such as analysis, consultation with experts, drafting, and review.

### **7. Key Differences from the 1983 Order**

| Feature | 1983 Order | 2023 Order |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Fee Structure | Likely a flat fee or non-time-based | Time-based (per hour or part of an hour) |

| Withdrawal of Request | Likely no fee or fee waived | Fee still payable even if request is withdrawn |
| Inflation Adjustment | Not explicitly addressed | Reflects inflation and cost of services over time |

### **8. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant update to the fee structure for advance income tax rulings in Canada. By introducing a **time-based fee model**, it aligns with modern administrative practices and ensures that the cost of providing complex tax advice is fairly and transparently recovered. The fee increases from $221.24 to $281.22 per hour starting April 1, 2023, reflect adjustments for inflation and rising operational costs. Importantly, the fee is **non-refundable** even if the request is withdrawn, emphasizing the principle of cost recovery for services rendered.

This Order is a key component of the CRA’s financial governance and service delivery framework, ensuring that taxpayers are informed and that the Department can sustain the quality and integrity of its advance ruling services.
