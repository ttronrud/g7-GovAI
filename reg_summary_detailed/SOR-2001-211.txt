- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (Inferred)**: While the specific content of the original regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated references suggest it was a standalone rule (likely related to a specific area of provincial administration, such as licensing, health, safety, or environmental standards) that was deemed obsolete or inconsistent with current legislation or policy.
- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - The regulation no longer applies to any legal or administrative process.

> ⚠️ Note: To fully understand the original purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to repeal (which may be archived in the Ontario Government’s legislative database or the Statutes of Ontario). Without that, only the status and repeal details can be confirmed.

If you can provide the **original regulation number or title**, I can assist in identifying its historical purpose or context.
