The regulation you have provided is a formal government notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Notice of Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which empowers the federal government to acknowledge receipt of scientific assessments of species at risk prepared by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Purpose:**  
This notice formally recognizes and confirms that the Government of Canada has received and accepted the scientific assessments completed by COSEWIC for a specific list of species identified in an attached schedule. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of species — such as whether they are at risk of extinction — based on scientific evidence including population trends, habitat conditions, threats, and other relevant biological and ecological factors.

**Key Components of the Regulation:**

1. **Recognition of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The regulation affirms that the assessments conducted by COSEWIC are officially recognized by the federal government. This is a critical step in the SARA process, as COSEWIC’s assessments serve as the foundation for determining which species are listed as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “special concern” under the Act.

2. **Trigger for Further Action:**  
   Upon receipt of these assessments, the Minister of the Environment is required to consider the findings and may proceed with the formal listing of species under SARA. This step may lead to the development of recovery strategies, protection measures, and other conservation actions.

3. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   By publicly acknowledging the assessments, the government demonstrates transparency in its conservation decision-making process. It also ensures that scientific input from COSEWIC is formally integrated into federal policy and legislation.

4. **Attachment of Schedule:**  
   The regulation references an “attached schedule” that lists the specific species for which COSEWIC has completed assessments. These species are typically those identified as being at risk of extinction or undergoing population decline, and the assessments provide the scientific justification for their inclusion in the SARA process.

5. **Legal and Procedural Significance:**  
   This notice is not a final listing decision, but rather a procedural milestone. It signifies that the government has reviewed and accepted the scientific evaluation, thereby setting the stage for potential formal listing, designation, or implementation of protective measures under SARA.

**Context within the Species at Risk Act (SARA):**

- **COSEWIC** is an independent scientific body that evaluates the status of wildlife species at risk in Canada.
- Under SARA, species must be assessed by COSEWIC before they can be listed as endangered, threatened, or special concern.
- Once the government receives and acknowledges the COSEWIC assessment, it can proceed to make a formal decision on listing, which may trigger legal protections, recovery planning, and funding for conservation efforts.

**Date and Source:**  
The regulation was published in *Statutes of Canada*, 2002, Chapter 29 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which is a compilation of federal statutes and regulations enacted in that year. This particular notice is part of the ongoing implementation of SARA to protect biodiversity in Canada.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as an official government acknowledgment that scientific evaluations of species at risk by COSEWIC have been received and are now part of the formal process for species conservation under the *Species at Risk Act*. It marks a critical step in the legal and scientific pathway toward protecting vulnerable wildlife species through federal action, recovery planning, and policy development.
