**Detailed Summary of the Approved Drug Screening Equipment Order**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Approved Drug Screening Equipment Order is issued by the Attorney General of Canada under **paragraph 254.01(b)a of the Criminal Code of Canada** (R.S.C., c. C-46). This provision grants the Attorney General the authority to approve specific equipment for use in detecting the presence of drugs in a person’s body, in accordance with the definition of “approved drug screening equipment” established in **section 320.11** of the Criminal Code.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary objective of this Order is to formally recognize and authorize the use of certain drug screening devices in law enforcement and legal contexts. Specifically, it ensures that only equipment meeting established standards is permitted to be used in the detection of drugs in individuals, thereby supporting consistency, reliability, and legal validity in drug-related investigations and proceedings.

**Approved Equipment:**  
The Order approves the following combinations of equipment for use in drug screening:

1. **Dräger DrugTest® 5000 and Dräger DrugTest® 5000 STK-CA, when used together**  
   - The Dräger DrugTest® 5000 is a portable, automated drug screening device capable of detecting the presence of several drugs in oral fluid (such as saliva).  
   - The Dräger DrugTest® 5000 STK-CA (Saliva Collection Kit – Canada Adapted) is the associated collection device used to collect oral fluid samples from individuals.  
   - The two components must be used in tandem: the collection kit is used to obtain the sample, and the device analyzes it.  
   - This combination is approved for use in official investigations, including those involving suspected impaired driving, public safety, or other law enforcement activities where drug presence is relevant.

2. **SoToxa™, Abbott SoToxa™ Test Cartridge, and Abbott SoToxa™ Oral Fluid Collection Device, when used together**  
   - The SoToxa™ is a brand of oral fluid drug testing system developed by Abbott Laboratories.  
   - The **SoToxa™ Test Cartridge** contains the reagents necessary to detect specific drugs (such as marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids) in a person’s saliva.  
   - The **SoToxa™ Oral Fluid Collection Device** is the tool used to collect the oral fluid sample.  
   - Like the Dräger system, this combination must be used as a complete set—collection device and test cartridge together—to be considered valid under the Criminal Code.

**Definition Context:**  
The approval is directly tied to the definition of “approved drug screening equipment” in **section 320.11 of the Criminal Code**, which defines such equipment as devices that are “designed to ascertain the presence of a drug in a person’s body” and that have been officially recognized by the Government of Canada. This definition is critical because it establishes legal standards for the admissibility and reliability of drug test results in court.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is made**, which is **August 22, 2018**. This means that from that date onward, law enforcement agencies, courts, and other authorized bodies may rely on the approved equipment listed above in drug screening operations, provided the equipment is used in accordance with the relevant guidelines and protocols.

**Key Implications:**  
- **Legal Validity:** Test results obtained using these approved devices are legally admissible in court, provided the testing was conducted properly and in compliance with applicable regulations.  
- **Standardization and Reliability:** By approving only specific, tested, and validated equipment, the Government ensures that drug screening is consistent, accurate, and scientifically sound.  
- **Public Confidence:** Clear approval of equipment helps build public trust in the integrity of drug testing procedures used in policing and legal processes.  
- **Exclusivity:** The Order does not approve all drug screening devices. Only the listed combinations are recognized under this regulation, and others must meet additional criteria to be considered.

**Conclusion:**  
This Approved Drug Screening Equipment Order serves as a formal, legally binding instrument that authorizes the use of two specific, scientifically validated systems—Dräger DrugTest® 5000/STK-CA and Abbott SoToxa™—for detecting drugs in oral fluid. It enhances the reliability of drug testing in Canadian law enforcement and legal proceedings by ensuring that only equipment meeting national standards is used. The Order is effective immediately upon issuance and is an essential component of Canada’s regulatory framework for drug detection in the criminal justice system.
