### **3. Scope of Privileges and Immunities**

The Order grants specific privileges and immunities to different categories of participants during the relevant period, based on their role and function in relation to the G7 meetings.

#### **A. Representatives of Foreign States (Ministerial Delegates)**  
These are government officials from foreign countries attending ministerial meetings. They are entitled to the following privileges and immunities **to the extent required for the performance of their official duties**:

- As provided in **Sections 11, 12, and 14 to 16 of Article IV of the UN Convention**:
  - **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., protection from arrest or prosecution in Canada for acts performed in the course of their official duties)
  - **Exemption from taxation** (in certain cases)
  - **Exemption from search or seizure** of personal property
  - **Freedom of movement** within Canada
  - **Exemption from certain customs duties and import restrictions**
  - **Protection of official communications and documents**

These protections are essential to allow foreign ministers to conduct official business without undue interference from Canadian authorities.

#### **B. Heads of International Organizations and Senior Officials**  
These include the heads (e.g., directors-general), alternates, and other senior officials of international organizations (e.g., WHO, IMF, UN agencies) participating in G7 meetings.

They are granted privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic agents under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**, as outlined in **Schedule I to the FMOA**. This includes:

- Immunity from criminal and civil jurisdiction in Canada
- Protection of official correspondence and communications
- Exemption from service of process
- Freedom of movement and access to facilities
- Protection of personal and official property

This ensures that senior international officials can perform their roles without fear of legal action or disruption.

#### **C. Other Officials of International Organizations**  
These are mid-level officials (e.g., department heads, technical staff) who are not heads or senior officials. They are granted the following privileges and immunities under **Section 18 of Article V of the UN Convention**:

- Immunity from legal proceedings only in relation to their official duties
- Protection of official documents and communications
- Exemption from certain administrative and financial obligations
- Limited freedom of movement and access to venues

These rights are proportionate to their role and are not as extensive as those granted to heads or senior officials.

#### **D. Experts Performing Missions for International Organizations**  
Experts (e.g., technical advisors, consultants, researchers) engaged by international organizations to support G7 meetings are granted the privileges and immunities set out in **Article VI of the UN Convention**. These include:

- Immunity from legal proceedings related to their official duties
- Protection of confidential information
- Freedom to travel and access meeting venues
- Protection of personal property used in the performance of duties

This ensures that technical and specialized personnel can operate effectively without legal barriers.
