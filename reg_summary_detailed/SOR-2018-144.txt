## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Cannabis Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Authority and Context**
The Cannabis Regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, under the following legislative provisions:

- **Section 30(1)a** of the *Food and Drugs Act*  
- **Section 55(1)c** of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*  
- **Section 139(1)** and **Section 161** of the *Cannabis Act*

These provisions grant the government the power to regulate cannabis in Canada, particularly in relation to **product classification, safety, labelling, licensing, and use**. The regulations are part of a broader legal framework that legalized cannabis for **medical, scientific, and recreational use** following the passage of the *Cannabis Act* in 2018.

> ✅ The regulations were updated over time (e.g., S.C. 2016, c. 9; S.C. 2017, c. 7; S.C. 2018, c. 16; S.C. 2019, c. 206) to reflect evolving standards, safety concerns, and regulatory clarity.

## 📜 **Key Regulatory Principles and Implications**

### 1. **THC Concentration Limits**
- **≤3% w/w THC** is the threshold for **edibles, beverages, non-solids, and solids**.
- **>3% w/w THC** defines **concentrates**, which are subject to stricter controls.
- The **"potential to convert"** accounts for the fact that **THCA (non-psychoactive)** can convert to **THC (psychoactive)** under heat or light — so products are assessed based on this transformation.

> 🔍 Example: A product with 2% THCA may have up to 2% THC after conversion — thus it qualifies as a low-THC product.

---

### 2. **Product Safety and Labelling**
- All **cannabis products** must be:
  - **Clearly labelled** (including THC/CBD content, durable life date, ingredient list).
  - **Free from contamination** (microbial, chemical, or biological).
  - Stored under appropriate conditions to maintain **durable life**.
- **Durable life dates** must be clearly marked — products cannot be sold after this date.

---

### 3. **Licensing and Access**
- Licences are required for:
  - **Cultivation**
  - **Processing**
  - **Distribution**
  - **Retail sale**
- Licence holders must maintain **security clearances**, especially for handling cannabis in research or medical settings.
