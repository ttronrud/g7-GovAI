**Detailed Summary of the CKFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *CKFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules of origin for specific types of goods under the Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA).

The regulation is formally referenced in:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** – This section authorizes the creation of rules of origin for goods under the CKFTA.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – The original framework or enabling legislation for tariff rules, likely providing foundational provisions for origin determination.

**Definition of "Casual Goods":**

The term **"casual goods"** is defined in the regulation as:
> *Goods other than goods imported for sale or for an industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use.*

This means that casual goods are **not intended for resale or for use in a business or industrial context**. Instead, they are typically:
- Personal items (e.g., gifts, household goods),
- Items imported for private consumption or personal use,
- Goods acquired for non-commercial or non-operational purposes.

This distinction is crucial because the rules of origin apply differently to casual goods compared to goods used in commercial or industrial settings.

**Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Korea:**

Casual goods that are **acquired in Korea** are considered to **originate in Korea** and are therefore **entitled to the preferential tariff treatment under the CKFTA** (i.e., the Korea Tariff) **if either of the following conditions is met**:

1. **The goods are marked in accordance with Korea’s marking laws**, and the marking:
   - Clearly indicates that the goods are the product of **Korea or Canada**.

   This ensures transparency and traceability of origin, allowing customs authorities to verify compliance with origin requirements.

2. **The goods do not bear any mark**, and **there is no indication** that they are not the product of Korea or Canada.

   In the absence of a visible mark, the lack of any indication of foreign origin (such as a label claiming to be from another country) is sufficient to establish that the goods are of Korean origin and qualify for preferential treatment.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** These rules apply **only** to goods acquired in Korea. Goods imported from other countries do not fall under this specific provision.

**Effective Date and Registration Provisions:**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 47 of the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.
- However, if a particular regulation (e.g., a specific rule or amendment) is **registered after that date**, it will come into force on the **date of its registration**.

This provision allows for phased implementation and ensures that new or updated rules are effective when formally published and approved.

> ✅ **Note:** These regulations were in force as of **January 1, 2015**, indicating that they were fully operational and applied to trade practices from that date onward.

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- Facilitate **preferential tariff treatment** for casual goods imported from Korea under the CKFTA.
- Simplify the origin determination process for non-commercial goods, reducing administrative burden for importers and consumers.
- Encourage **trade in personal or non-commercial goods** between Canada and Korea by removing unnecessary barriers.

By establishing a clear, accessible rule of origin—based on marking or lack of indication—the regulation supports fair and transparent trade practices while aligning with the principles of the CKFTA.
