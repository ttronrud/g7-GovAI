### **Detailed Summary of the United Nations Suppression of Terrorism Regulations**

These regulations are a Canadian implementation of **United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001)**, which established international measures to combat terrorism. The Canadian government enacted these regulations under the authority of the **United Nations Act**, specifically **Sections 2 and 3**, to ensure that the provisions of UN Resolution 1373 can be effectively applied within Canada.

---

## **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- **Purpose**: To enable Canada to enforce the measures set out in **UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001)**, which mandates member states to:
  - Identify and monitor individuals and entities involved in terrorism.
  - Prohibit transactions with such persons.
  - Freeze assets of known or suspected terrorists.
  - Prevent the financing of terrorist activities.
- **Legal Authority**: The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) enacted these regulations under:
  - **Section 2** of the *United Nations Act* (power to make regulations for implementing UN resolutions).
  - **Section 3** (power to make regulations to implement specific UN resolutions).

This ensures Canada aligns with international obligations to suppress terrorism in accordance with the UN Charter.

3. **Notice**: The Minister must notify the applicant immediately of any decision.

  - **Basic expenses** (e.g., food, housing, medical care), or

- **Basic expenses**: Within **15 working days** if the **1267 Committee does not oppose** the request.
