**Detailed Summary of the Search, Reproduction and Certification of Documents Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Search, Reproduction and Certification of Documents Regulations*

---

### **1. Citation and Key Definitions**

These regulations are officially cited as the *Search, Reproduction and Certification of Documents Regulations*. They establish the rules governing how importers, exporters, and authorized representatives may access, reproduce, and certify documents held by the Department of National Revenue (the "Department").

#### Key Definitions:

- **Copy**:  
  A *copy* refers to any reproduction—whether in physical, digital, or other forms—of a document contained in the Department’s files, or of an extract derived from such a document.

- **Department**:  
  The *Department* means the **Department of National Revenue**, which is responsible for customs and related administrative functions in the jurisdiction.

- **Document**:  
  A *document* is defined as any invoice, entry, or other customs form directly related to a specific **importation or exportation**. This includes official records generated during the movement of goods across borders.

- **Search**:  
  A *search* is the act of obtaining a document or specific information from the Department’s files in response to a formal request made by:
  - An importer,
  - An exporter, or
  - Any person lawfully acting on behalf of either party.

This process allows authorized parties to verify the accuracy of records or obtain details about past transactions.

### **2. Fees for Services**

The regulations establish specific fees for three core services provided by the Department:

#### **(a) Search Fee**  
- A fee of **$0.75** is charged for each **search** conducted to:
  - Obtain a document for perusal (review), or  
  - Confirm the accuracy of information appearing on a copy of a document submitted for certification.

> *Example*: If an importer requests to verify the contents of a customs entry form, the Department will charge $0.75 per such request.

#### **(b) Certification Fee**  
- A fee of **$0.75** is charged for each **certification** of a document.

> *Certification* typically involves the Department officially verifying and attesting to the authenticity or accuracy of a document (e.g., confirming that a particular invoice matches a recorded entry).

#### **(c) Reproduction Fee**  
- In addition to the above, a fee of **$3.00** is charged for the **reproduction** of a document by the Department.

> *Reproduction* means creating a copy (e.g., a printed or digital version) of the original document. This applies when the Department produces a copy for the requester.

> *Note*: The reproduction fee is separate from the search and certification fees.

### **3. Exemption Clause – No Fees for Foreign Government Requests**

**Exception to Fees:**  
*Notwithstanding* the fees outlined in Sections 3 and 4, **no fee** shall be charged for:
- A search,
- A reproduction, or
- A certification of a document

**if** the request is made at the **request of a foreign government**.

> *Purpose of exemption*: This provision supports international cooperation and facilitates cross-border trade and regulatory coordination. It ensures that foreign governments can access necessary documentation without incurring administrative costs, which is essential for diplomatic and trade-related agreements.

> *Example*: If a foreign customs authority requests verification of a Canadian export entry, the Department is required to provide the service free of charge.

### **Key Implications and Practical Applications**

| Service | Fee | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Search (to obtain or verify info) | $0.75 per request | Applies to perusal or verification of data |
| Certification of a document | $0.75 per document | Official attestation of accuracy or authenticity |
| Reproduction of a document | $3.00 per document | Covers copying of the original file or extract |
| Foreign government requests | **No fee** | Applies to all three services when requested by a foreign government |

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

These regulations aim to:
- Ensure transparency and accountability in the handling of customs documentation.
- Provide a clear, predictable, and fair fee structure for businesses and individuals accessing records.
- Balance access to information with the administrative costs of processing requests.
- Support international trade by enabling seamless cooperation with foreign authorities.

---

### **Important Considerations**

- Fees are **per instance** (e.g., each search, each certification, each reproduction).
- The Department may charge fees only when the service is provided to **importers, exporters, or their lawful representatives**.
- The exemption for foreign governments is **not automatic**—it applies only when the request is formally made by a foreign government entity.
- The regulations do not cover the cost of internal administrative work or data retrieval; the fees are designed to cover the direct costs of processing and providing the service.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Search, Reproduction and Certification of Documents Regulations* provide a clear, structured framework for how individuals and entities can access and verify customs-related records. They establish fair, transparent fees for search, certification, and reproduction services, while ensuring that international cooperation with foreign governments is supported without financial burden. This balance supports both domestic accountability and global trade efficiency.
