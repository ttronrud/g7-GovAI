**Detailed Summary of the *Goods for Ships and Aircraft (Excise) Drawback Regulations***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Goods for Ships and Aircraft (Excise) Drawback Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **subsection 46(1) of the Excise Tax Act**. This authority allows for the granting of *drawbacks* — that is, a refund or credit of excise taxes — on goods manufactured or produced in Canada, provided they are used in specific international maritime or aeronautical operations.

These regulations came into force on the day the **Customs Act** (excluding certain provisions — specifically paragraph 99(1)(b), subsections 99(2) to (4), and sections 192 to 194) came into effect. The regulations are formally cited as the **Goods for Ships and Aircraft (Excise) Drawback Regulations**.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to **encourage Canadian manufacturing and production** of goods that are used in the **equipment, repair, or reconstruction of ships and aircraft**, or in the **laying or repairing of oceanic telegraph cables** — all of which occur **outside Canadian territorial waters**.

By allowing a drawback (a tax refund), the government incentivizes Canadian producers to supply goods to international shipping and aviation industries, supporting domestic industry while ensuring that such goods are used in authorized, non-Canadian contexts.

---

### **Definition of Key Terms**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which provides the legal basis for tax drawback claims.
- **Ships’ stores**: Goods designated as such under the *Ships’ Stores Regulations*. These are not general cargo but specific items used in maritime operations (e.g., food, tools, spare parts, fuel, etc.).

---

### **Eligible Goods and Uses**

A drawback may be claimed for goods manufactured or produced in Canada that are used in one of the following three situations:

1. **Supplied as ships’ stores**  
   – For the **equipment, repair, or reconstruction** of ships or aircraft listed in the **Schedule** to the regulations.

2. **Used for equipment, repair, or reconstruction**  
   – Of specific ships or aircraft specified in the Schedule (e.g., ocean-going vessels, aircraft in international service).

3. **Delivered to a telegraph cable ship**  
   – Proceeding on an ocean voyage **outside Canadian territorial waters** for the purpose of **laying or repairing oceanic telegraph cables**.

> *Note*: The goods must be used strictly in these authorized international operations and not in Canada.

---

### **Who Can Claim a Drawback?**

Only two parties may apply for a drawback:

1. **The person who supplied the goods**  
   – In cases where goods are supplied as ships’ stores (paragraphs 3(a) and (c)).

2. **The person who used the goods**  
   – For the equipment, repair, or reconstruction of ships or aircraft listed in the Schedule (paragraph 3(b)).

> This means the supplier or the user (depending on the context) must be the claimant.

---

### **Application Requirements**

- An application for a drawback must be submitted in the **prescribed form**.
- It must be filed at the **excise office nearest the head office or a branch office** of the claimant.
- The application must be submitted **within four years** of the date when the excise taxes were originally paid.

> This four-year deadline is critical — failure to file within this window results in the loss of the right to claim the drawback.

---

### **Conditions for Granting a Drawback**

A drawback will **only be granted** if all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Use must be as described**  
   – The goods must have been **supplied, used, or delivered** as per paragraph 3(a), (b), or (c) **before** the application is filed.

2. **No prior use in Canada**  
   – The goods must **not have been used in Canada** for any purpose before being used in the authorized international operation.

3. **Integration into the vessel or aircraft**  
   – For goods used in **repair or reconstruction** of ships or aircraft (paragraph 3(b)):  
     → The goods must **become part of the ship or aircraft**, or part of its equipment.

4. **Telegraph cable ship requirement**  
   – For goods delivered to a telegraph cable ship:  
     → The ship must be **registered** and must be used **exclusively** for laying or repairing oceanic telegraph cables.

5. **Waiver of rights by third parties**  
   – The applicant must provide a **formal waiver** (in the prescribed form) from **all other persons entitled** to claim a drawback, refund, or remission of taxes.  
   → This ensures that no other party (e.g., a shipowner, a different user) can claim the same tax benefit, preventing double claims.

### **Eligible Vessels and Aircraft**

The following types of vessels and aircraft are eligible under the regulations:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ocean-going ships** | Operating or being repaired/reconstructed to operate **exclusively in international trade**. |
| **Foreign warships** | Within the meaning of the *Ships’ Stores Regulations* (e.g., non-Canadian military vessels). |
| **Telegraph cable ships** | As defined in the *Ships’ Stores Regulations* — used for laying/repairing cables. |
| **Aircraft operating exclusively in international flights** | Not used for domestic or mixed operations. |
| **Ships registered in a foreign country used for pleasure** | Only if they are not engaged in commercial or international operations. |
| **International aircraft** | As defined in the *Ships’ Stores Regulations*. |

> *Note*: The eligibility is strictly tied to **international operation** and **exclusivity** — goods used in domestic or mixed-use operations are not eligible.

---

### **Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- The regulations do **not apply** to goods used in Canada or for domestic purposes.
- The **four-year time limit** is strict — no extensions are implied.
- **No drawback is available** if the goods were previously used in Canada.
- **Third-party rights must be waived** — failure to do so results in denial of the claim.

---

### **Significance and Economic Impact**

- **Supports Canadian manufacturing**: Encourages domestic production of specialized goods (e.g., marine equipment, aviation parts) by reducing the cost of export to international operations.
- **Promotes international trade**: Facilitates the use of Canadian-made goods in global shipping and telecommunications infrastructure.
- **Ensures compliance and accountability**: The detailed conditions (use, integration, exclusivity, waivers) prevent misuse or abuse of the drawback system.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Goods for Ships and Aircraft (Excise) Drawback Regulations* establish a clear, structured, and conditionally governed mechanism for refunding excise taxes on Canadian-produced goods used in international maritime and aeronautical operations. By focusing on **specific, authorized uses** and imposing **strict eligibility and procedural requirements**, the regulations balance fiscal responsibility with economic incentives for Canadian industry.

This framework ensures that:
- Canadian producers benefit from tax relief,
- Goods are used exclusively in international operations,
- No double claims occur,
- The integrity of the excise tax system is preserved.

These regulations remain a key tool in promoting Canada’s industrial competitiveness in global shipping and aviation sectors.
