**Detailed Summary of the Exemption for Public Notices or Documents (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulations are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This means the government, through its executive authority, formally enacts the regulation based on advice from the Minister responsible for financial regulation.

The legal foundation for these regulations is found in two provisions of the **Trust and Loan Companies Act (Act)**:
- **Subsection 531(1)a** – Grants the Minister of Finance the power to make regulations to implement or clarify provisions of the Act.
- **Section 539.14b** – Provides the authority to issue specific exemptions for public notices or documents issued by trust and loan companies under certain conditions.

These provisions allow for flexibility in how companies comply with disclosure obligations, particularly when public notice or publication of certain documents is not strictly required under normal circumstances.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **grant an exemption** from the requirement to publish certain public notices or documents under **section 539.14 of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**.

Specifically, the exemption allows trust and loan companies to avoid the mandatory public disclosure of certain documents — such as financial statements, minutes of meetings, or other regulatory filings — **if the exemption does not prejudice the interests of shareholders or the public interest**.

This provision ensures that while transparency is a core principle of corporate governance, there are circumstances where full public disclosure may be impractical, unnecessary, or potentially harmful to the company’s operations or market stability.

**3. Key Provision: Prescribed Circumstances**

The regulations define the **prescribed circumstances** under which the exemption applies. According to the regulation:

> *"The exemption does not prejudice any of the shareholders or the public interest."*

This is a critical safeguard. The exemption is **only valid** if it does not harm:
- The rights or interests of shareholders (e.g., their ability to make informed investment decisions),
- The broader public interest (e.g., market integrity, investor confidence, or financial stability).

In other words, companies seeking to rely on this exemption must demonstrate that:
- The omission of a public notice or document is justified,
- The decision does not deprive shareholders of essential information,
- The public remains protected from potential harm due to lack of transparency.

This ensures that the exemption is not used as a loophole to avoid accountability or to obscure financial realities.

**4. Regulatory Timeline**

- **Date of Coming into Force**: The regulations **come into force on June 1, 2011**.
- This means that all trust and loan companies operating in Canada under the Trust and Loan Companies Act are subject to these rules from that date onward.
- Any prior disclosures or exemptions not governed by these rules are superseded by the new regulations.

**5. Legislative References**

The regulation is referenced in the following statutory instruments:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 449** – Provides the authority for the regulation’s enactment.
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 452** – Likely relates to the specific wording or scope of the exemption.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 45** – The original enabling legislation or foundational act that supports the regulatory framework.

These references confirm the long-standing legal basis for such exemptions and their integration into the broader financial regulatory regime.

**6. Scope and Application**

The regulations apply specifically to:
- **Trust and loan companies** operating in Canada under the Trust and Loan Companies Act.
- The exemption applies to **public notices or documents** that would otherwise be required to be published under section 539.14 of the Act.

Examples of such documents may include:
- Annual financial statements,
- Board meeting minutes,
- Notices of changes in management,
- Capital distribution plans.

However, the exemption is not blanket — it is conditional and must meet the "no prejudice to shareholders or public interest" test.

- **Balances Transparency and Confidentiality**: Maintains a balance between regulatory transparency and the need for operational discretion.
- **Protects Investor Confidence**: By requiring that the exemption not harm shareholder interests, the regulation upholds investor trust and accountability.
