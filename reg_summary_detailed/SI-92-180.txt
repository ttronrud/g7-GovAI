**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation (September 17, 1992) under the Referendum Act, Canada**

---

### **1. Legal Context and Purpose**

This document is an **official proclamation** issued by the **Governor General of Canada**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**, under the authority granted by **section 3(1) of the Referendum Act (Chapter 30 of the Statutes of Canada, 1992)**.

The primary purpose of the proclamation is to **call for a constitutional referendum** in Canada, specifically to **seek the public opinion of electors** on whether the Constitution of Canada should be renewed based on a particular agreement reached on **August 28, 1992**.

---

### **2. Legal Authority and Procedural Requirements**

- **Section 3(1) of the Referendum Act** empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting through the Cabinet) to issue a proclamation calling for a referendum if it determines that such a process is in the **public interest**.
- **Section 4 of the Act** establishes a key procedural requirement: **no proclamation can be issued before the referendum question has been formally approved** by both houses of Parliament.
- **Section 5 of the Act** governs the approval process for the referendum question. The text of the question must be passed by:
  - The **House of Commons**, and
  - The **Senate**, with concurrence.

This ensures democratic legitimacy and parliamentary oversight before a referendum is launched.

---

### **3. Approval of the Referendum Question**

- The referendum question was **approved by the House of Commons on September 10, 1992**.
- It was **concurred in by the Senate on September 15, 1992**.
- These approvals satisfied the legal requirement under Section 5 of the Referendum Act, allowing the Governor in Council to proceed.

---

### **4. Issuance of the Proclamation**

- On **September 17, 1992**, the Governor in Council issued **Order in Council P.C. 1992-2045**, which formally authorized the proclamation.
- The Governor in Council concluded that it was in the **public interest** to conduct a referendum on the constitutional renewal issue.
- This proclamation thus serves as the **formal legal instrument** that initiates the constitutional referendum process.

### **5. Content of the Referendum Question**

The question put to the public is:

> **“Do you agree that the Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the agreement reached on August 28, 1992?”**  
> (With options: **Yes** or **No**)

This question reflects a **constitutional renewal** process based on a **specific agreement** — the one finalized on **August 28, 1992** — which was the result of negotiations between the federal government and provincial leaders, particularly in the context of the **Meech Lake Accord** and its subsequent failure, and the broader effort to achieve constitutional reform.

### **6. Geographic Scope of the Referendum**

The referendum will be held among the following jurisdictions:

- **Provinces**:
  - Ontario
  - Nova Scotia
  - New Brunswick
  - Manitoba
  - British Columbia
  - Prince Edward Island
  - Saskatchewan
  - Alberta
  - Newfoundland
- **Territories**:
  - Yukon Territory
  - Northwest Territories

This list includes all provinces and territories **except Quebec**, which was **excluded** from the referendum. The exclusion of Quebec was a significant political decision, reflecting the province’s unique constitutional and political position, as well as concerns about the potential for division or lack of consensus in a national referendum.

### **7. Key Legal and Political Implications**

- **Constitutional Renewal**: The question does not ask for a general constitutional overhaul, but specifically about renewing the Constitution based on a pre-agreed framework (the August 28, 1992 agreement). This suggests a focus on **consensus-based reform**, rather than radical change.
- **Public Consultation**: The referendum represents a democratic mechanism to **involve citizens directly** in constitutional decisions — a significant step in Canadian constitutional development.
- **Legitimacy and Oversight**: The process follows strict parliamentary and legal procedures, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Historical Context**: This referendum was part of a broader movement in the 1990s to resolve constitutional issues stemming from the **failure of the Meech Lake Accord (1987)** and the **Charlottetown Accord (1992)**. The August 28, 1992 agreement was a compromise aimed at achieving a more inclusive and balanced constitutional framework.

### **8. Significance of the Proclamation**

- This proclamation marks the **first official call for a constitutional referendum** in Canadian history under the Referendum Act.
- It sets a precedent for future constitutional referendums by clearly outlining the **legal framework**, **procedural safeguards**, and **democratic legitimacy** required.
- It demonstrates the Canadian government’s commitment to **democratic participation** in constitutional governance.

---

### **9. Signatory and Authenticity**

- The proclamation is signed by **Ramon John Hnatyshyn**, who served as **Governor General of Canada** from 1992 to 1999.
- As Governor General, he acts as the **representative of the Crown**, issuing the proclamation on the advice of the federal Cabinet.
- The document is sealed with the **Great Seal of Canada**, confirming its legal authority and official status.

### **10. Conclusion**

This proclamation is a foundational legal instrument in Canada’s constitutional history. It formally establishes a **nationwide referendum** on whether to renew the Constitution of Canada based on a specific agreement finalized in August 1992. It reflects a democratic, transparent, and legally sound process that respects parliamentary authority, public input, and constitutional principles.

Although the referendum was **not ultimately held** (due to political and procedural developments, including the eventual withdrawal of the proposal), this proclamation remains a significant milestone in Canada’s journey toward inclusive constitutional reform.

---

**Note**: While the referendum was officially called, it was later **discontinued** or **not implemented**. The August 28, 1992 agreement was not adopted, and the constitutional reform process evolved through other mechanisms, including the eventual **2000 Charter of Rights and Freedoms amendments** and the **2004 Constitutional Accord**, though these were not directly tied to this specific referendum.

Nevertheless, the 1992 proclamation remains a key document in understanding the legal and democratic foundations of constitutional referendums in Canada.
