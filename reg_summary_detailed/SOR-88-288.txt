**Key Definitions and Scope**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and Health Contributions Act, 1977*. This is the foundational legislation that governs how federal and provincial governments share revenues and define the nature of taxes and fees.

2. **"Provincial tax or fee"**  
   The regulation interprets **paragraph (c)** of the definition of "provincial tax or fee" in subsection 34(1) of the Act. This paragraph typically includes taxes imposed by a province on specific transactions or activities, such as taxes on insurance premiums.

3. **Tax in Question**  
   The tax in question is the **Quebec provincial tax on insurance premiums**, levied under **Chapter III of the Retail Sales Tax Act (R.S.Q. c. I-1)**.  
   - This tax applies to certain types of insurance policies, such as life, health, and property insurance, and is collected by the Quebec government.  
   - It is not a federal tax or a general sales tax; rather, it is a targeted provincial levy on insurance premiums.
