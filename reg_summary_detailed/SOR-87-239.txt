### **Regulatory Title**

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**. This role is central to administering the insurance program and overseeing the implementation of the regulations.

2. **Private Lender**  
   Defined as any lender (or its assignee) that is **not**:
   - The Government of Canada,
   - The government of any province of Canada,
   - An agency of any such government (federal or provincial) or any company effectively controlled by such a government or its agency,
   - A municipal corporation.

   *Purpose*: To exclude public-sector entities and ensure that only private financial institutions or individuals participate in the insurance scheme.

3. **St. Marys Paper Inc.**  
   A company incorporated under Canadian law with its head office in **Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario**. The loan in question is intended to modernize its **supercalendered paper manufacturing facility**.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary objective is to **facilitate private investment** in a key industrial project by providing **insurance against financial loss** to private lenders who finance the modernization of St. Marys Paper Inc.'s facility.

By guaranteeing a portion of potential losses, the government reduces the risk for private lenders, thereby encouraging capital to flow into critical industrial upgrades.

---

### **Scope of Insurance Coverage**

- The insurance provided by the Minister covers **losses arising from a loan** made by a private lender to St. Marys Paper Inc. for the purpose of **modernizing its supercalendered paper production facility**.
- The insurance is **not a full guarantee** but a partial risk mitigation tool.

#### **Coverage Amounts**
- The maximum insurance payout is **90% of any net loss** incurred by the private lender.
- However, the total payout is capped at a **maximum of $15 million CAD**.
- This means:
  - If the net loss exceeds $15 million, the insurance will only cover up to $15 million in total.
  - The 90% threshold applies only to the net loss (after deducting recoveries or other recoverable amounts), not the gross loss.

> Example:  
> If the private lender incurs a net loss of $18 million, the insurance will pay:  
> 90% of $18 million = $16.2 million — but capped at $15 million.  
> → Final payout: **$15 million**.

### **Fee Structure for Private Lenders**

- Private lenders must pay an **annual fee** to the Minister.
- The fee is **at least 1% per annum** of the total amount of insurance currently in force.
- Payments are made **semi-annually in advance** (i.e., before the period begins).

> Example:  
> If a private lender has $10 million in insurance coverage, they must pay:  
> 1% × $10 million = $100,000 per year → $50,000 every six months, paid in advance.

> *Note*: The fee ensures ongoing government oversight and revenue for administrative costs, while also serving as a mechanism to limit excessive risk exposure.

### **Conditions for Payment by the Minister**

When a private lender **demands repayment** of the loan (e.g., due to default or insolvency), the Minister’s obligation to pay is **limited** to the **lesser of two amounts**:

1. **The amount of insurance currently in force on the date of demand**  
   → This means the Minister will not pay more than the current insurance coverage amount.

2. **90% of the net loss incurred by the private lender**, up to a **maximum of $15 million**  
   → As previously defined, this is the maximum financial protection available.

> **Key Implication**:  
> The Minister will not cover losses beyond the insurance limit, nor will they pay more than the current coverage value.  
> This protects the government from unlimited liability and ensures that the insurance is a risk-sharing mechanism, not a full financial guarantee.

### **Policy Objectives**

1. **Industrial Development**  
   To promote modernization of a key manufacturing facility in a region of economic significance.

2. **Private Sector Involvement**  
   To encourage private capital investment in industrial projects by reducing financial risk.

3. **Fiscal Responsibility**

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Marys Paper Inc. Regulations* represent a **targeted, risk-managed financial instrument** designed to support industrial modernization through private investment. By providing limited insurance coverage (up to 90% of net loss, capped at $15 million) and requiring a modest annual fee from private lenders, the government balances the need to stimulate investment with fiscal prudence and accountability.

This regulation exemplifies a form of **industrial development financing**, where public policy supports private enterprise through structured risk-sharing mechanisms — a common tool in regional economic development programs during the 1980s.

**Final Note**: These regulations are historical in nature and reflect policies from the 1980s. They are no longer in force today, as St. Marys Paper Inc. underwent significant restructuring and changes in ownership and operations over subsequent decades. However, they remain a notable example of government-backed insurance for industrial modernization in Canada.
