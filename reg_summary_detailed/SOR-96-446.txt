**Detailed Summary of the Nova BUS Corporation Exemption Order (S.C. 1993, c. 16)**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The exemption order was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. This action was taken under **paragraph 9(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act**, which allows for temporary exemptions from safety regulations when it is determined that compliance with certain standards would **hinder the development or advancement of new types of vehicles**—in this case, new kinds of buses.

**Purpose of the Exemption:**
The primary objective of this Order is to **facilitate innovation and technological development** in the design and manufacture of buses, specifically by allowing the Nova LFS (Low-Floor Standard) model to bypass certain safety requirements related to push-out windows. The exemption is intended to support the introduction and commercialization of a new generation of accessible, low-floor public transit buses that offer improved passenger access, particularly for individuals with mobility challenges.

**Scope of the Exemption:**
- **Applicable Vehicles:** Six hundred and fifty (650) units of the **Nova LFS low-floor model buses** manufactured by **Nova BUS Corporation**.
- **Exempted Requirements:** The exemption applies specifically to the requirements in **subsections 217(11), (14), (17), and (19)** of **Schedule IV** to the *Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations*. These subsections pertain to the design, operation, and safety standards for **push-out windows** in motor vehicles.
  - Push-out windows are typically designed to open outward from the vehicle body and are subject to safety standards ensuring they do not pose a risk of entrapment, injury, or failure under stress.
- **Nature of the Exemption:** The vehicles are exempt from these specific window safety standards **only** in the context of the Nova LFS model, and only for the stated number of units.

**Duration of the Exemption:**
- The exemption is **temporary** and lasts for a period of **two years**.
- It begins on the **date the Order is registered under the Statutory Instruments Act**.
- The Order comes into force on **September 17, 1996**.

**Regulatory Context and Rationale:**
The decision to grant this exemption reflects a balance between **public safety** and **technological innovation**. The Minister of Transport and the Governor General concluded that the strict application of the push-out window standards—specifically those related to structural integrity, opening mechanisms, or safety during operation—would **impede the development and practical implementation** of low-floor buses, which are critical for improving accessibility in public transportation systems.

Low-floor buses are designed to allow easier boarding for elderly passengers, persons with disabilities, and those with strollers or mobility devices. By allowing a deviation from standard push-out window requirements, the Order enables Nova BUS Corporation to develop and deploy a more user-friendly and accessible transit solution without being constrained by traditional safety norms that may not fully account for the unique operational and accessibility needs of modern public transit.

**Legal and Policy Implications:**
- This Order is a **temporary, narrowly tailored exemption** that does not undermine overall vehicle safety standards.
- It demonstrates the regulatory framework's flexibility to support innovation in transportation technology when such innovation serves public interest, particularly in the area of accessibility.
- The exemption is subject to oversight and must be reviewed at the end of the two-year period. If the safety of the vehicles is later found to be compromised, or if new standards are developed, the exemption may be revoked or modified.

**Conclusion:**
The Nova BUS Corporation Exemption Order (S.C. 1993, c. 16) is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure that allows 650 units of Nova LFS low-floor buses to be exempt from specific push-out window safety requirements under the Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. This exemption was granted to **promote innovation in accessible public transit**, recognizing that strict adherence to certain safety standards could hinder the development of more inclusive and efficient bus designs. The Order came into force on September 17, 1996, and remained in effect for two years, reflecting a pragmatic approach to balancing safety with technological progress in the transportation sector.
