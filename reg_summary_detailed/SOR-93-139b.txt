**Detailed Summary of the Department of Public Works Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993**

---

### **Overview**

The *Department of Public Works Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993* is a regulatory instrument enacted under the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to establish specific employment conditions for temporary workers in the Department of Public Works. These regulations govern the hiring, tenure, and termination of personnel who are appointed for **one or more periods of less than three months**, with the **total duration of such appointments not exceeding six months in any consecutive 12-month period**.

The regulations apply only during a specific time frame: **from April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.

---

### **Key Background and Rationale**

1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
   The Public Service Commission (PSC) determined that it would **not be practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* to temporary appointments in certain groups within the Department of Public Works. This exclusion is justified because:
   - The nature of the work is temporary and project-based.
   - The duration of appointments is short (less than three months), with a maximum aggregate of six months per 12-month period.
   - Applying standard employment protections under the PSEA (such as minimum notice periods, job security, or collective bargaining rights) would be impractical and administratively burdensome.

2. **Desirability of Specific Regulations:**  
   Despite the exclusion from the PSEA, the Commission found it **desirable to create specific, tailored rules** to govern these temporary appointments. These rules ensure clarity, fairness, and administrative efficiency while maintaining accountability and transparency.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The regulations are made under two provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:
   - **Subsection 41(1):** Grants authority to exclude individuals from the operation of the PSEA for specific purposes and timeframes.
   - **Subsection 37(1):** Grants authority to make specific regulations governing the employment of persons in temporary roles.

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

1. **Exclusion from PSEA Protections:**

   - Remove requirements such as:
     - Minimum employment duration
     - Job security provisions
     - Collective bargaining rights
     - Certain procedural safeguards
   - This allows the Department to respond quickly to short-term needs (e.g., project work, seasonal demands, or temporary staffing gaps).

2. **Regulatory Clarity and Accountability:**  
   Despite the exclusion, the regulations provide:
   - Clear rules on recruitment and termination.
   - Defined limits on the duration of temporary appointments.
   - A formal process for termination with notice.

3. **Flexibility Without Unfairness:**  
   The rules balance operational flexibility with fairness by:
   - Limiting appointment duration to prevent over-reliance on temporary staff.
   - Ensuring that termination is not arbitrary and is based on legitimate reasons (e.g., lack of work or cause).

### **Purpose and Objectives**

- To enable the Department of Public Works to efficiently manage short-term staffing needs.
