Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which establishes the rules for **interswitching of rail traffic** under the *National Transportation Act, 1987*, as approved by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Interswitching of Rail Traffic Regulations (S.C. 1987, c. 34)**

> **Note:** These regulations were originally enacted in 1987 and have since been **repealed in part** by **SOR/2019-254**, specifically Sections 2 and 4. As such, this summary reflects the **original content** of the regulation as it existed at the time of enactment, with appropriate context and notes on its current status.

---

### 📌 **Background and Rationale**

The regulation was introduced based on two key considerations:

1. **Cost Efficiency**:  
   The National Transportation Agency (NTA) determined that moving a greater number of cars (or transferring multiple cars simultaneously) reduces overall transportation costs. This is due to economies of scale in operations—fewer trips, lower per-unit handling costs, and improved efficiency in rail operations.

2. **Cost Analysis**:  
   The Agency analyzed the **average variable costs** associated with all traffic movements subject to the rates set in these regulations. This analysis supports the conclusion that standardized, efficient interswitching practices benefit both carriers and shippers.

Based on these findings, the Governor General in Council approved the regulation to establish fair, transparent, and cost-effective rules governing **interswitching**—a process where a railway company (a "terminal carrier") transfers freight cars from one carrier to another at an interchange point, typically to serve a private siding or terminal.

### ✅ **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Transportation Act, 1987* (the legal framework governing transportation services in Canada). |
| **Car Block** | A group of **60 or more cars** that are moved together as a single unit (a "block") and are either all destined for or all originating from the same shipper at a siding. This definition emphasizes bulk movement and efficiency. |
| **Siding** | A designated track or area where freight is loaded or unloaded. Includes: <br> • Private sidings connected to a terminal carrier’s line <br> • Team tracks of terminal carriers <br> • Tracks directly adjacent to a shipper’s facility <br> • Public stockyard loading/unloading tracks <br> • Points of origin or destination (as defined in Section 87 of the Act) <br> ❌ **Excludes**: Tracks used for internal terminal operations (e.g., transfers between cars or warehouses), reload/distribution compounds, container terminals, or facilities operated by the terminal carrier itself. |
| **Terminal Carrier** | A railway company that performs **interswitching**—i.e., transfers traffic between its own network and a shipper’s siding at an interchange. |

---

### ⚠️ **Exemptions and Scope Limitations**

These regulations **do not apply** in the following situations:

1. **Transfer to Another Siding After Interswitching**:  
   If a terminal carrier has already interswitched traffic to a siding under these rules, and then **transfers the traffic to a different siding at the request of a shipper or another railway company**, the regulation does **not apply** to that second transfer.

2. **Railway Companies with High Interswitching Revenue**:  
   If a railway company derived **at least 90% of its gross freight revenues from interswitching** in the **immediately preceding three-year period**, based on company returns filed under Section 50 of the Act, then these regulations **do not apply** to that company.

> This exemption recognizes that companies heavily involved in interswitching may operate under different financial and operational models and thus require different regulatory treatment.

---

### 📅 **Application of Regulations When Exemption Is Denied**

If the Agency determines that a railway company **does not qualify** for the exemption (i.e., it derived less than 90% of its revenue from interswitching), then:

- The regulations **become applicable 10 days after** the Agency notifies the company of this determination.
- The regulations **apply for a one-year period** from that date.

> This provides a **transition period** for companies to adjust to the new rules without immediate disruption.

---

### 📝 **Reapplication for Exemption**

A railway company that has been subject to the regulations may, upon the expiration of the one-year period, **request a review** of its eligibility for exemption under paragraph (1)(b).

- The company must submit **evidence** to the Agency demonstrating that it now qualifies for exemption (e.g., revenue data showing that 90% or more of its freight revenue comes from interswitching).
- The Agency has **60 days** to review the evidence and issue a formal notification:  
  ✅ Whether the company qualifies for exemption  
  ❌ Whether it remains subject to the regulations

> This creates a **flexible, data-driven review process** that allows companies to re-qualify as their business model evolves.

---

### 🚆 **Service Standards**

A terminal carrier must provide **the same level of service** to interswitched traffic as it provides to its own **line haul traffic** (i.e., long-distance freight movement).

> This ensures **fairness and consistency**—interswitched traffic is not treated as second-class or inferior in terms of reliability, timeliness, or availability.

---

### 🚚 **Empty Car Handling (No Charges)**

- A railway company that has a car **interswitched** by a terminal carrier must **deliver an empty car** back to the terminal carrier at the interchange for delivery to a siding for loading.
- **No charge** shall be made by the terminal carrier for:
  - Delivering an empty car from the interchange to a siding for loading  
  - Returning an empty car to the interchange after unloading

> This promotes **efficiency and cost predictability** in the rail network. It removes the cost burden on shippers for empty car handling, which would otherwise increase freight costs.

---

### 📏 **Measurement of Interswitching Distances**

Distances are measured **along the track of the terminal carrier**, unless otherwise specified.

#### Interswitching Distance Zones (by proximity to interchange):

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Zone 1** | Sidings located **within 6.4 km** of the interchange |
| **Zone 2** | Sidings located **within 10 km** of the interchange, but **outside Zone 1** |
| **Zone 3** | Sidings located **within 20 km** of the interchange, but **outside Zones 1 and 2** |
| **Zone 4A** | Sidings located **within 30 km** of the interchange, and **within 40 km or less**, but **outside Zones 1, 2, and 3** |
| **Zone 4B** | Sidings located **within 30 km** of the interchange, but **outside Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4A** |

> These zones are used to **differentiate pricing or service standards** based on distance. While the regulation does not specify pricing mechanisms, the zones likely inform rate structures or cost recovery models for terminal carriers.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Sections related to Zones 4A and 4B were **repealed by SOR/2019-254, s. 4**, meaning these zones are **no longer in effect**. The current regulatory framework may have been replaced or simplified.

---

### 🚫 **Status of the Regulation (Current Repeal Status)**

- **Repealed by SOR/2019-254, s. 2**: The entire regulation is **repealed** as of the date of the statutory order.
- **Repealed by SOR/2019-254, s. 4**: The specific provisions related to interswitching distance zones (especially Zones 4A and 4B) are **no longer valid**.

> 🚨 **Important**: This regulation is **no longer in force** in Canada. It was replaced by updated transportation policies and regulations, likely under modernized frameworks such as those governing the *Canada Transportation Act* and the evolving role of rail freight in the national transportation system.
