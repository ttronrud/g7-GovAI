**Detailed Summary of the Income Support Payment Amount Regulations**

**Regulatory Framework and Legal Authority**  
The *Income Support Payment Amount Regulations* are issued by the Minister of Employment and Social Development (MESD) under the authority granted by **subsection 7(2)** of the *Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act* (CERB Act). This provision empowers the Minister to establish the amount of income support payments for individuals receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), subject to the **consent of the Minister of Finance**. This dual approval ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with broader economic and budgetary considerations.

**Effective Date and Registration**  
The Regulations come into force on the day they are officially registered in the *Canada Gazette*, which occurred on **March 31, 2020**. This date marks the start of their legal applicability for determining income support payments under the CERB program.

**Key Provision: Payment Amount**  
Under these Regulations, the **weekly income support payment amount is fixed at $500**. This amount is specifically established for the purpose of **subsection 7(1)** of the CERB Act, which outlines the eligibility and payment structure of the benefit.  

- The $500 weekly payment was designed to provide financial relief to individuals who lost income due to the pandemic-related disruptions in early 2020.
- The payment is intended to be a temporary measure to support individuals during periods of job loss or income suspension, without requiring them to meet specific income thresholds or asset tests—unlike other social benefits.

**Purpose and Context**  
These Regulations were introduced in response to the public health emergency declared in March 2020 due to the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to rapidly provide financial assistance to unemployed or underemployed Canadians to maintain essential living expenses, stabilize household incomes, and reduce economic hardship during a time of widespread job losses.

**Administrative and Operational Impact**  
- The $500 weekly payment is administered through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and delivered directly to eligible individuals via direct deposit or cheque.
- The payment is not subject to deductions for taxes or other obligations, as it is intended to be a direct, immediate form of financial support.
- The Regulations establish a clear, uniform standard across Canada, ensuring consistency in benefit amounts regardless of location or provincial differences.

**Limitations and Conditions**  
While the Regulations specify the payment amount, they do not include provisions for adjustments based on inflation, cost of living, or changes in economic conditions. The $500 amount remained fixed throughout the duration of the CERB program, which was eventually phased out as the economy recovered and the pandemic situation evolved.

**Conclusion**  
The *Income Support Payment Amount Regulations* provide a clear, legally binding framework for the delivery of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit at a fixed weekly rate of $500. Issued in March 2020, these regulations were a critical component of Canada’s emergency economic response to the pandemic, offering immediate financial relief to those who lost income due to lockdowns and business closures. Their effectiveness and simplicity underscored the government’s intent to deliver swift, accessible support during a national crisis.
