|------|--------|
| **Class B1** | Any regulated entity (from paragraphs 7(1)(a)–(c)) that carries on a broadcasting undertaking |

| **Class B4** | A regulated entity from (7(1)(e) or (f)) carrying on broadcasting and has attested to having **fewer than 10 employees** |

> ✅ **Deemed Membership**: If an entity submits an attestation qualifying it for a class, it is **deemed to have always been a member** of that class and must fulfill all obligations of that class.

> ⚠️ **Continuity of Obligations**: If a regulated entity published an accessibility plan while in a particular class, it must **continue to fulfill feedback and progress report obligations** as if it were still in that class.
