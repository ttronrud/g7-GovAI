### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of the Anti-Racism Secretariat**

**Legal Authority and Source:**
- **Act:** *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22)
- **Section:** Section 207
- **Statutory Citation:** R.S., c. P-34 (the *Public Service Regulations*)

**Key Provision:**
> Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, transfers from the **Department of Canadian Heritage** to the **Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD)** the **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Anti-Racism Secretariat**.

### **Detailed Interpretation and Implications**

1. **Nature of the Transfer:**
   - This is not a transfer of personnel or funding, but a **restructuring of administrative control and supervision**.
   - The **Anti-Racism Secretariat**—a unit within the Department of Canadian Heritage—was formally transferred in terms of **operational oversight and management authority** to the Department of Employment and Social Development.

2. **Reason for the Transfer:**
   - The move reflects a strategic realignment of federal departments to better align with the **mission and policy priorities** of the receiving department.
   - The Anti-Racism Secretariat’s mandate—focusing on promoting equity, eliminating racial discrimination, and advancing anti-racism initiatives—aligns closely with the DESD’s broader responsibilities in **employment equity, social inclusion, and human rights**.
   - By transferring this unit, the government strengthens its capacity to implement anti-racism policies within employment and social services, where direct impact on marginalized communities is most evident.

3. **Jurisdictional and Functional Impact:**
   - **Department of Canadian Heritage (pre-transfer):** Previously responsible for cultural policy, multiculturalism, and federal programs related to diversity and inclusion. The Anti-Racism Secretariat operated under this umbrella, likely supporting policy development and intergovernmental coordination.
   - **Department of Employment and Social Development (post-transfer):** Now assumes responsibility for the day-to-day **control, supervision, and implementation** of anti-racism initiatives, including monitoring compliance, evaluating programs, and advising on employment equity and workplace diversity.
   - This shift enables more integrated and practical application of anti-racism strategies within employment and social policy frameworks.

4. **Legal Basis:**
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, which permits the federal government to reassign functions and responsibilities among departments through a formal process involving:
     - The Prime Minister’s recommendation,
     - The Governor General in Council’s approval (i.e., formal government endorsement),
     - A clear rationale tied to public service efficiency, policy coherence, or administrative effectiveness.

5. **Governance and Accountability:**
   - The Anti-Racism Secretariat will now report to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**, and its activities will be subject to the oversight and policy direction of that department.
   - This may enhance accountability and ensure that anti-racism efforts are integrated into broader social protection, employment, and labor market policies.

6. **Timeline and Implementation:**
   - While the regulation itself is retrospective in nature (dated 2003), it likely came into effect in the years following its publication, with implementation managed through internal administrative directives and interdepartmental coordination.
   - The actual operational transition would have involved coordination between the two departments, including staff reallocation, policy continuity planning, and stakeholder communication.

### **Significance and Broader Context**

- This transfer exemplifies a **shift in federal governance** toward placing anti-racism initiatives within the context of **social and economic policy**, rather than cultural or heritage policy.
- It reflects a growing government emphasis on **systemic equity**, particularly in employment and social services, where racial discrimination can have tangible, daily impacts.
- The move also supports the Canadian government’s broader commitments under **human rights legislation**, **employment equity laws**, and **multiculturalism policy**.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally transfers the **control and supervision** of the Anti-Racism Secretariat from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the Department of Employment and Social Development. It is a strategic administrative realignment aimed at strengthening the federal government’s ability to implement and monitor anti-racism policies within the social and employment sectors. The transfer is legally grounded, policy-driven, and intended to improve the effectiveness and coherence of anti-racism efforts in Canada’s public service.
