**Key Provisions and Summary:**

1. **Legal Basis:**  
   The notice is issued under **Section 18** of the *Canada-Papua New Guinea Income Tax Agreement Act, 1989*. This section empowers the Canadian government to formally announce the entry into force of a bilateral income tax agreement between Canada and Papua New Guinea. Such agreements are designed to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion related to taxes on income.

2. **Agreement in Question:**  
   The *Agreement between Canada and Papua New Guinea for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income*.  
   - This is a multilateral tax treaty aimed at ensuring that individuals and entities are not taxed twice on the same income by both Canada and Papua New Guinea.  
   - It also includes provisions to prevent tax avoidance and evasion through mechanisms such as the use of artificial arrangements or non-resident exploitation of tax loopholes.

3. **Date of Entry into Force:**  
   The agreement officially came into force on **December 21, 1989**.  
   - This date marks the beginning of the legal application of the treaty’s provisions between the two countries.  
   - The notice issued in February 1991 serves as formal public notification that the agreement has been activated and is now in effect.

4. **Purpose and Objectives of the Agreement:**  
   - **Avoid Double Taxation:** Ensures that income earned by residents of either country is taxed only once, in the country where the income is effectively earned or where the taxpayer resides.  
   - **Prevention of Fiscal Evasion:** Establishes rules and safeguards to prevent tax avoidance through artificial structures, such as the use of shell companies or mischaracterization of income.  
   - **Tax Residency and Source of Income Rules:** Defines criteria for determining which country has the right to tax income based on the taxpayer’s residency status and the source of income.  
   - **Tax Credit and Relief Provisions:** Provides mechanisms for residents of one country to claim tax credits or exemptions in the other country, based on the tax paid or deemed paid in their home jurisdiction.  
   - **Exchange of Information:** Includes provisions allowing the two countries to exchange tax information to combat tax evasion, subject to privacy and confidentiality protections.

5. **Legal and Administrative Implications:**  
   - Upon entry into force, the agreement becomes binding on both Canada and Papua New Guinea.  
   - Canadian tax authorities (such as the Canada Revenue Agency – CRA) may apply the treaty provisions when assessing income tax returns of individuals or businesses with ties to Papua New Guinea.  
   - The treaty may influence how tax liabilities are calculated, particularly for cross-border income (e.g., dividends, interest, royalties, business profits).  
   - It may also provide relief in cases where a taxpayer is subject to tax in both jurisdictions, allowing them to claim a credit or exemption in one country based on the tax paid in the other.

6. **Public Notification and Transparency:**  
   The issuance of this notice in Ottawa on February 2, 1991, serves to:  
   - Inform Canadian citizens, residents, and businesses of the treaty’s existence and applicability.  
   - Provide clarity to taxpayers on how income earned in Papua New Guinea (or vice versa) may be treated under Canadian tax law.  
   - Facilitate compliance and ensure that tax authorities are aware of the treaty’s operational status.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally announces that the Canada-Papua New Guinea Income Tax Agreement, which was signed and agreed upon in 1989, officially entered into force on December 21, 1989. It establishes a framework to eliminate double taxation and prevent tax evasion by providing clear rules for the taxation of income earned by individuals and businesses in either country. The notice issued in February 1991 ensures transparency and legal certainty for all stakeholders, including taxpayers, tax professionals, and government agencies, regarding the treaty’s implementation in Canada.
