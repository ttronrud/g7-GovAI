## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Region of Waterloo International Airport Zoning Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Regulatory Basis and Legal Authority**

These regulations are established under the **Aeronautics Act (Canada)**, specifically:

- **Subsection 5.5(1)a**: Requires publication of proposed regulations in official gazettes and public media to allow public comment.
- **Paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)b and (c)b of the Aeronautics Act**: Grant the Minister of Transport the authority to adopt zoning regulations to protect aviation safety and operations.

The proposed regulations were:
- Published in **two successive issues of *Canada Gazette*, Part I**, on **May 14 and May 21, 2005**.
- Published in **two successive issues of *The Record* and *Le Régional*** on **June 13–14 and June 15–22, 2005**.
- This provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment** and stakeholder input before final adoption.

> ✅ **Outcome**: The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, officially **adopted and enacted** the regulations on **March 19, 2009** (as noted in the note at the end).

### 🎯 **2. Primary Objectives of the Regulations**

The core purposes of these zoning regulations are:

1. **To prevent land adjacent to or near the airport from being used or developed in ways that interfere with safe airport operations**, including take-offs and landings.
2. **To prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems) between aircraft and airport facilities.

These objectives are designed to ensure **aviation safety**, **operational efficiency**, and **reliability of air traffic services**.

### 📐 **3. Key Definitions and Zones**

Several key spatial and technical terms are defined to guide enforcement and interpretation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Region of Waterloo International Airport, located in the Township of Woolwich, within the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as a datum for elevation calculations. Located at coordinates **550,107.96 E / 4,812,146.94 N**, derived from the eastern end of runway 07–25. |
| **Approach Surface** | An inclined surface extending from each end of a runway strip. It ensures aircraft have a clear path during approach and take-off. Has a **1:50 slope** (1 meter rise per 50 meters run). |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary surface associated with a runway, defined by the runway’s direction and length. It extends from the runway edge and forms the basis for approach and take-off zones. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined surface between the strip surface and the approach surface, designed to provide a buffer zone. |
| **Outer Surface** | A flat, imaginary surface at a **constant elevation of 45.000 m above the ARP**, unless it is less than 9.000 m above ground level—then it is set at **9.000 m above ground**. |
| **Bird Hazard Zone** | A designated area around the airport where **bird activity must be controlled** to prevent bird strikes, which pose a serious threat to aircraft safety. |
| **Outer Limit** | The boundary encompassing all the above surfaces (approach, outer, strip, transitional, and bird hazard zones). It defines the **total protected area** around the airport. |

> ⚠️ **Elevation Datum**: All elevations are referenced to the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum – CGVD28 (1978 Adjustment)**, with the ARP assigned an elevation of **311.500 m** above sea level.

---

### 📍 **4. Geographic Scope and Application**

- The regulations apply to **all land** (including public road allowances) that is:
  - Adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.
  - Within the **outer limit** as defined in **Part 6 of the Schedule**.

> This includes land in:
> - The Township of Woolwich  
> - The City of Cambridge  
> - The City of Kitchener  
> All within the **Regional Municipality of Waterloo**

The boundaries are defined by a detailed **polygonal description** using **grid coordinates (UTM Zone 17, GRS80 Ellipsoid, 1989 adjustment)** and **topographic references**.

> 🔍 The full boundary path is described in a series of directional bearings and distances, referencing specific lots, tracts, roads, and land parcels. This ensures precise spatial control and legal clarity.

### 🚫 **5. Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

#### **(1) Building Height Restrictions**
No person may:
- Construct or erect a **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures)
- Where the **highest point** of the object exceeds:
  - The elevation of the **approach surface** at that location
  - The elevation of the **outer surface**
  - The elevation of the **transitional surface**

> This ensures that no structure (e.g., towers, trees, buildings) blocks the line of sight or creates hazards during take-off or landing.

#### **(2) Interference with Signals or Communications**
No owner or lessee of land within the **outer surface** may:
- Permit any use or development that **interferes with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical facilities (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation systems)

> This protects the integrity of air traffic control and flight safety systems.

#### **(3) Natural Growth Restrictions**
No owner or lessee may allow **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to grow to a height that:
- Exceeds the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional)

> This prevents vegetation from obstructing aircraft or interfering with radar and communication signals.

#### **(4) Bird Hazard Zone Prohibitions**
No owner or lessee within the **bird hazard zone** may:
- Permit activities or uses that **attract birds** (e.g., open fields, water sources, food waste, feeding areas)

> This reduces the risk of bird strikes, which can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft.

### 📈 **6. Take-Off/Approach Surface Details**

The approach surfaces are **specific to each runway** and have different slopes and extents:

| Runway | Surface Description |
|--------|---------------------|
| **07–25 (east end)** | 1:50 slope, rises 300.000 m above the end of the strip surface, extends 15,000 m horizontally from the end, with a 2,400 m outer edge on each side |
| **07–25 (west end)** | Same as above (1:50 slope, 300 m rise, 15,000 m horizontal distance) |
| **14–32 (north end)** | 1:50 slope, rises 60.000 m above the strip surface, extends 3,000 m from the end, with a 600 m outer edge on each side |
| **14–32 (south end)** | Same as above (60.000 m rise, 3,000 m horizontal distance) |

> The **take-off/approach surface elevation** is calculated from the **end of the strip surface**, rising at a constant 1:50 ratio.

> The **strip surface** is defined by the runway centerline and extends from the runway edge.

---

### 🌍 **7. Outer Surface Specifications**

- The outer surface is a **flat surface** at **45.000 m above the ARP** (311.500 m = 356.500 m above sea level).
- However, **if this surface is less than 9.000 m above ground**, it is instead located at **9.000 m above ground** to prevent unrealistic or unsafe elevation requirements.
- This surface forms the **outer boundary** of the regulated zone and is critical for defining where development is prohibited.

---

### ⏱️ **8. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The regulations **come into force** on the day the requirements under **subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.
- As of the note in the document, these regulations were **in force as of March 19, 2009**.

> Enforcement is carried out by the **Minister of Transport**, with powers to issue fines, orders, or stop-work directives for violations.
