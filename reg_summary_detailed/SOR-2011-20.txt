The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-173, s. 2]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation SOR/2016-173, section 2**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The referenced regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists or is in force.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-173**, which stands for *Supplemental Regulation 2016-173* issued by the Government of Canada.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 2 of that regulation specifically abolished or canceled the prior rule or provision in question.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they become obsolete, contradictory, redundant, or when new regulations better serve the current policy or administrative needs. The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative or regulatory modernization effort.

### Interpretation:
There is **no active regulation** in force that corresponds to the original provision referenced, as it has been formally removed from the legal framework. The repeated citation suggests that the provision may have previously governed a specific area (e.g., licensing, fees, reporting requirements, or administrative procedures), but that area is now managed under different rules or has been superseded.

### Important Notes:
- Without the original text of the repealed regulation, the exact subject matter (e.g., what it regulated) cannot be determined from this summary alone.
- To understand the scope of what was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation before repeal and the explanatory notes or legislative intent behind SOR/2016-173, section 2.
- SOR/2016-173 may relate to a specific sector (e.g., environmental protection, transportation, or financial services), but without further context, the precise domain remains unspecified.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the provided text is **no longer in effect** and was formally **repealed by SOR/2016-173, section 2**. It was likely replaced by a new regulation or removed due to redundancy, obsolescence, or policy change. For a detailed understanding of the subject matter it once covered, access to the original regulation and the repeal notice is required.
