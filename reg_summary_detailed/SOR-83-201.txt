The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists or has legal effect.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *SOR/2017-84, section 1* (a statutory instrument published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on May 25, 2017).
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal was part of a broader legislative or administrative update to remove outdated, redundant, or obsolete provisions. The exact original regulation being repealed is not specified in your input, but the reference to "SOR/2017-84, s. 1" suggests that the repeal was enacted to streamline or modernize the regulatory framework.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, requirements, or procedures previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Legal or regulatory bodies must now refer to current, active regulations that have replaced or superseded it.
- **Context**: SOR/2017-84 is a regulatory notice issued by the Government of Canada, typically under the authority of a federal department (e.g., Health Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, or another relevant agency). The specific nature of the repealed regulation would depend on the original subject matter (e.g., workplace safety, environmental standards, food safety, etc.), which is not provided in your query.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or currently applicable regulation** in this list. The repeated entries serve only to indicate that the regulation was formally **repealed on May 25, 2017**, under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. Therefore, the regulation does not exist in current law and should not be referenced in legal or compliance contexts.

To determine the original subject of the repealed regulation, further research into the full text of *SOR/2017-84* would be required — for example, through the official Government of Canada regulations database (e.g., [canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca)).

👉 **Recommendation**: If you have a specific area of law or regulation in mind (e.g., workplace safety, environmental protection, or health standards), please provide more context so that a more detailed and accurate summary of the original regulation can be offered.
