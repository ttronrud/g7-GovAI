**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations Respecting the Information to be Displayed on Alcohol Containers and their Packaging"**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

- The regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 304(1)(f) of the Excise Act, 2001** (as referenced in the document as "Excise Act, 2001a" — likely a typographical or citation variation).
- This regulatory instrument is specifically designed to ensure **transparency and traceability** in the alcohol supply chain by mandating the clear display of identifying information on alcohol containers and their packaging.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary objective is to **enhance accountability and consumer awareness** by requiring the display of identifiable information about the entity responsible for packaging alcohol products. This helps in traceability, facilitates enforcement, and supports regulatory oversight in the alcohol sector.

**Prescribed Information to Be Displayed:**

Under **Section 87 of the Excise Act, 2001**, the following information must be clearly displayed on the alcohol container or its packaging:

1. **The name and address of the alcohol licensee who packaged the alcohol**, or  
2. **Their licence number**.

> *Note:* The regulation allows for either the full name and address *or* the licence number to be displayed. This provides flexibility for manufacturers, distributors, or packaging entities to meet the requirement in a practical and cost-effective manner, while still ensuring that the responsible licensee can be identified.

**Effective Date:**

- The regulations come into force on **July 1, 2003**.
- This date marks the start of compliance for all alcohol packaging produced or distributed after that date, ensuring that the new transparency requirement is implemented in a timely and structured manner.

**Key Implications and Context:**

- **Consumer Protection and Accountability:** By requiring the identification of the packaging licensee, the regulation empowers consumers and regulators to trace the origin of alcohol products, which can be useful in addressing issues such as counterfeit goods, illicit production, or non-compliant packaging.
- **Regulatory Enforcement:** The information serves as a tool for the Minister of National Revenue and enforcement agencies to verify compliance with excise laws, conduct audits, and investigate potential violations.
- **Clarity and Consistency:** The regulation establishes a clear, standardized requirement that applies uniformly across all alcohol packaging, reducing ambiguity and ensuring consistent application.

**Scope:**

- Applies to all **alcohol containers and their packaging**, including bottles, cartons, labels, and any other physical or printed components that come into contact with or are associated with the product.
- Applies to **all packaged alcohol** sold or distributed in the jurisdiction, regardless of type (e.g., beer, wine, spirits), provided it is subject to excise control under the Excise Act.

**No Additional Requirements:**

- The regulation does not mandate other information such as alcohol content, strength, or health warnings, which may be governed by other provisions of the Excise Act or related legislation.
- It focuses solely on identifying the **packaging licensee**, not the manufacturer or distributor.

**Conclusion:**

These Regulations are a targeted and practical step to improve transparency in the alcohol industry. By requiring the display of either the **name and address or licence number** of the alcohol packaging licensee, they ensure that the entity responsible for packaging is clearly identifiable, thereby strengthening regulatory oversight, consumer confidence, and accountability in the distribution chain. The regulation is effective from **July 1, 2003**, and is a key component of the broader compliance framework under the Excise Act, 2001.
