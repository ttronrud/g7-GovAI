### **Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation establishes a **remission (waiver or forgiveness)** of certain fees associated with passport and consular services for specific individuals who were adversely affected by administrative or service disruptions in 2002. The remission applies to both **passport service fees** and **consular service fees**, and includes the **remission of any interest** that may have accrued on unpaid fees.

The decision is made in the **public interest**, recognizing that systemic issues during a specific time period caused undue hardship for individuals seeking essential government services.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Remission of Passport Extension Fees (Limited Validity Passports)**  
- **Applies to:** Individuals who requested an **extension of a passport** that was originally issued for a **limited validity period**.  
- **Reason for Remission:**  
  The extension was requested because the individual was **unable to obtain a certificate of citizenship** due to **production problems** at the **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (now Citizenship and Immigration Canada)** during the period:  
  **March 27, 2002 – May 6, 2002**.  
  OR  
  The individual was **unable to obtain a birth certificate** due to a **labour dispute** in the **public service of the Province of Ontario** during the period:  
  **March 13, 2002 – May 5, 2002**.

- **Scope of Remission:**  
  - The fee specified in **Item 14** of the *Passport Services Fees Regulations* (which covers the extension of a limited-validity passport).  
  - **Any interest** that was payable on that fee, if not already paid.

> **Note:** This provision targets individuals who faced bureaucratic or operational failures due to internal disruptions in key government departments, which prevented them from meeting standard documentation requirements needed to extend their passports.

#### **2. Remission of Other Passport and Consular Fees (for Refused Services)**  
- **Applies to:** Every person who, **before June 24, 2002**, requested a service listed in the following:  
  - Items **1 to 6** and **8 to 13** of the *Passport Services Fees Regulations*  
  - Section **4** of the *Consular Services Fees Regulations*

- **Condition for Remission:**  
  The request for the service was **refused by the Passport Office**.

- **Scope of Remission:**  
  - The fees associated with the requested services (as listed above).  
  - Any **interest** that would have been payable on those fees, if not paid.

> **Note:** This provision applies broadly to any service that was denied due to administrative refusal, regardless of the reason. It covers a range of services such as passport applications, renewals, and consular services (e.g., notarial services, document authentication), provided the refusal occurred before June 24, 2002.

### **Key Dates and Timeframes**
- **Critical Dates:**  
  - **March 27, 2002 – May 6, 2002** (citizenship certificate production issues)  
  - **March 13, 2002 – May 5, 2002** (Ontario birth certificate labour dispute)  
  - **June 24, 2002** (cut-off date for eligibility for service refusal remission)

> These dates indicate that the government recognizes that service disruptions during this period caused significant delays or denials of essential services, and thus provides relief to those affected.

### **Eligibility Criteria Summary**

| Category | Eligibility Condition |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Passport Extension Remission** | Requested extension due to: <br> - Inability to get citizenship certificate (due to D.C.I. production issues, March 27 – May 6, 2002) <br> OR <br> - Inability to get birth certificate (due to Ontario public service labour dispute, March 13 – May 5, 2002) |
| **General Fee Remission** | Requested a service listed in items 1–6, 8–13 of Passport Fees Regulations or Section 4 of Consular Fees Regulations, and the request was **refused** by the Passport Office, **before June 24, 2002** |

---

### **Legal and Policy Implications**
- **Public Interest Justification:** The government recognizes that service disruptions during a period of internal administrative crisis (due to labour disputes or technical failures) may have caused legitimate hardship, especially for individuals who rely on passports and birth/citizenship documents for travel, legal identity, or immigration purposes.
- **Equity and Fairness:** By remitting fees and interest, the government acknowledges that individuals were not at fault for the service failures and were unfairly burdened by fees for services they were unable to access due to circumstances beyond their control.
- **Administrative Relief:** This regulation serves as a corrective measure to address past administrative failures and restore public confidence in government services.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**
- The remission **does not apply** to individuals who:  
  - Requested services after June 24, 2002.  
  - Were not affected by the specified disruptions (e.g., no production issues or labour dispute).  
  - Were not denied a service or did not request a service listed in the regulations.
- The remission **only applies to fees and interest**—it does not cover other charges or administrative costs.

---

### **Conclusion**
This remission order is a targeted and compassionate intervention by the federal government to address the consequences of two significant service disruptions in 2002:  
1. A breakdown in citizenship certificate production in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  
2. A labour dispute in Ontario that disrupted birth certificate issuance.

By waiving fees and interest for affected individuals, the government demonstrates accountability, recognizes the impact of administrative failures, and ensures that individuals who were unable to access essential services due to these events are not penalized financially. The regulation reflects a commitment to fairness and public interest in the delivery of government services.
