**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Upper Columbia River Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
April 21, 2016  
**Legal Citation:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Species at Risk Act)

---

### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)**, which empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and establish critical habitat for listed wildlife species.

The White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*) Upper Columbia River population is legally recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and is entitled to legal protection and recovery support.

A formal **recovery strategy** for this species was developed and is publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Designation of Critical Habitat**  
   The Order formally designates and establishes the **critical habitat** for the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Upper Columbia River population. This designation is based on the critical habitat identified in the recovery strategy, which has been officially registered in the Species at Risk Public Registry.

2. **Legal Applicability**  
   Subsection **58(1)** of SARA applies to this critical habitat. This means that any federal government activity or project that affects this designated area must be assessed for its impact on the species and its habitat. If such activities are likely to have a harmful effect, they must be modified or avoided.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**  
   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion** of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)** of SARA.  
   - Subsection 58(2) of SARA generally prohibits certain federal activities in critical habitat unless specific exceptions apply (e.g., for essential services or with approved mitigation).  
   - By confirming that the critical habitat is *not* located in such a restricted zone, the regulation ensures that the designation is valid and that federal actions can proceed under the appropriate legal framework without being automatically blocked.

4. **Effective Date**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette). This ensures immediate legal effect once officially recognized.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Conservation and Recovery**: The designation of critical habitat is a key step in the recovery of the White Sturgeon population. It ensures that the specific environmental conditions necessary for the species to survive and reproduce are protected from degradation or destruction.
  
- **Legal Enforcement**: By formally identifying the habitat, the federal government creates enforceable legal obligations for all federal agencies to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on this area.

- **Transparency and Accountability**: The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the Public Registry ensures public access to information, promoting transparency and enabling stakeholders (including Indigenous communities, scientists, and the public) to participate in conservation efforts.

### **Implications for Stakeholders**

- **Federal Agencies**: Must assess and modify any proposed projects (e.g., dam construction, water diversion, mining, or infrastructure development) that may impact the designated critical habitat.
- **Indigenous Communities**: May have traditional or cultural ties to the area; the regulation supports collaborative efforts in habitat protection and co-management.
- **Environmental Groups and Scientists**: Can use the designation to advocate for habitat protection and monitor ecological health.
- **Landowners and Industry**: May be required to adjust operations to avoid or minimize impacts on the critical habitat.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation legally establishes and protects the critical habitat of the endangered White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Upper Columbia River population. It is grounded in scientific assessment and formalized through the recovery strategy, and it ensures compliance with the Species at Risk Act by clearly defining the spatial boundaries of essential habitat. The exclusion from prohibited zones under subsection 58(2) confirms the validity and practicality of the designation. The Order serves as a foundational element in the long-term recovery and conservation of this species in Canada’s Upper Columbia River ecosystem.
