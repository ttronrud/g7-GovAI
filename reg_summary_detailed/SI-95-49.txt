## **5. Legal and Administrative Implications**

### ✅ **For the Minister of Finance (Quebec):**
- Gains authority to oversee and implement regional economic development policies in Quebec.
- Can now coordinate federal funding with provincial priorities, potentially improving alignment between fiscal policy and regional development goals.
- May enhance intergovernmental coordination and streamline decision-making processes.

### ❌ **For the Minister of Industry (Quebec):**
- Loses direct authority over regional economic development functions under the Department of Industry Act.
- Retains only those responsibilities not explicitly transferred or excluded (e.g., broader industrial policy, export promotion, or technical support).
- Must now operate under the new administrative framework established by the Minister of Finance.

### ⚖️ **Inter-Governmental Continuity:**
- The **exemption of the Industrial Development Subsidiary Agreements** ensures that existing commitments, funding mechanisms, and cooperative frameworks remain intact.
- This preserves stability in long-term economic development partnerships between Canada and Quebec.

---

## **6. Background and Rationale**

The transfer was likely motivated by:
- A desire to **integrate economic development with fiscal policy**, ensuring that regional investment decisions are aligned with broader financial planning and budgetary constraints.
- The need to **centralize accountability** for public spending in regional development projects under a single ministerial office.
- The recognition that **fiscal management and economic development** are closely linked, especially in a province like Quebec with significant industrial and regional disparities.

This move also reflects a shift in federal-provincial relations, where economic development is increasingly viewed as a **fiscal and financial issue**, not just an industrial one.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **significant reorganization of ministerial responsibilities** in Quebec’s economic governance. It transfers key functions related to **regional economic development** from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Finance, enhancing fiscal oversight and coordination. However, it **preserves critical intergovernmental agreements**—particularly the Industrial Development Subsidiary Agreements—ensuring continuity in long-standing federal-provincial cooperation on industrial growth and regional investment.

> **In essence:**  
> The regulation **shifts operational control** of regional economic development to the Minister of Finance, while **protecting existing agreements** that form the foundation of federal-provincial collaboration in industrial policy.
