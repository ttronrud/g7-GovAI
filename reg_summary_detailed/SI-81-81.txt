**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe Fees for Certificates of Multiple-Unit Residential Building Construction Starts

**Governing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council (the federal Crown), acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council to authorize the Minister of a federal department or agency to prescribe fees for services provided by Her Majesty in right of Canada, particularly those related to administrative or regulatory functions.

**Subject Matter:**  
The regulation authorizes the Minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to issue **orders prescribing fees** for services provided by the Government of Canada in connection with the **issuance of certificates of multiple-unit residential building construction starts**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Scope of Service:**  
   The fees are to be charged in relation to the issuance of **certificates of multiple-unit residential building construction starts**. These certificates are official government approvals that permit the commencement of construction for multi-unit residential buildings (e.g., apartment complexes, townhouses, etc.) under CMHC’s regulatory framework.

2. **Purpose of the Fee:**  
   The fee serves as a revenue mechanism to cover the administrative and regulatory costs associated with processing and issuing these certificates. It ensures that the government is compensated for the time, resources, and oversight involved in reviewing and approving construction starts.

3. **Authority to Prescribe Fees:**  
   The Minister responsible for CMHC is granted the power to issue a formal **regulatory order** to establish the specific fees. This includes setting:
   - The amount of the fee,
   - The conditions under which the fee applies (e.g., building size, number of units, location),
   - Whether fees are charged per application or per unit,
   - Any exemptions or reductions (e.g., for low-income or first-time builders).

4. **Legal Foundation:**  
   The authority to prescribe such fees is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the federal government to establish fees for services provided by Her Majesty in right of Canada. This includes administrative services such as approvals, certifications, and licensing.

5. **Implementation Process:**  
   - The Minister will issue a formal **regulatory order** (a statutory instrument) outlining the fee structure.  
   - The order will be published in the Canada Gazette and made publicly available.  
   - The fee structure will be subject to review and potential adjustment in line with administrative costs, inflation, or policy changes.

6. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   The regulation ensures that the fee structure is transparent and consistent with federal financial administration principles. It also supports accountability by requiring that fees be clearly defined, justified, and accessible to applicants.

7. **Impact on Stakeholders:**  
   - **Developers and builders** will be required to pay the prescribed fees when applying for construction start certificates.  
   - The fees may influence development decisions, potentially affecting affordability and project feasibility.  
   - The government gains a stable source of revenue to support housing policy and infrastructure oversight.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal, legally authorized mechanism for CMHC to set and collect fees for issuing certificates that authorize the start of construction for multi-unit residential buildings. It reflects the federal government’s ongoing effort to modernize and manage housing-related administrative processes efficiently and transparently, while ensuring that regulatory services are properly funded.
