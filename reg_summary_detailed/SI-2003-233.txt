**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, implements a transfer of administrative responsibilities under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**:  
   The control and supervision of specific functions within the **Directorate-General of Marine Programs** are being transferred from the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** to the **Department of Transport (DoT)**.

2. **Scope of the Transfer**:  
   The transfer applies only to those portions of the Directorate-General of Marine Programs that are responsible for the following policy areas:
   - **Pleasure craft safety**: Policies and regulations related to the safety of recreational boats and vessels, including safety standards, equipment requirements, and operator training.
   - **Marine navigation services**: Services that support safe and efficient vessel movement, such as maritime aids to navigation (e.g., buoys, lighthouses, electronic navigation tools), and coordination of navigational information.
   - **Pollution prevention and response**: Policies and programs aimed at preventing marine pollution (e.g., oil spills, hazardous material discharge) and managing emergency response efforts in the event of pollution incidents.
   - **Navigable waters**: Oversight and management of waterways deemed navigable, including the maintenance of channels, dredging, and the regulation of access and use of such waters.

3. **Effective Date**:  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. All responsibilities, policies, and operational functions related to the listed areas are transferred to the Department of Transport on this date.

4. **Legal Authority**:  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the federal government to reassign responsibilities between departments to improve efficiency, alignment with policy priorities, or better serve public interests.

5. **Implications**:  
   - The Department of Transport assumes responsibility for developing, implementing, and enforcing policies in these marine-related domains.
   - This shift reflects a broader government strategy to consolidate transportation-related functions under a single department, particularly those involving maritime safety, navigation, and environmental protection.
   - The Department of Fisheries and Oceans retains its core mandate related to fisheries, aquaculture, and marine biodiversity, while the transferred functions are now integrated into the transportation portfolio.

6. **Purpose**:  
   The move is intended to enhance coordination between transportation infrastructure, marine safety, and environmental protection, ensuring a more unified and effective approach to managing Canada’s marine transportation systems and environmental risks.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization within Canada’s federal public service, transferring key marine policy responsibilities from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to the Department of Transport. It strengthens the government’s ability to manage marine safety, navigation, and environmental protection through a more integrated and transport-focused framework, effective December 12, 2003.
