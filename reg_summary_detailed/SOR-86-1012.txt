**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: S.C. 1986, c. 1 – Special Customs Services (Repealed, SOR/2024-41, s. 10)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, originally enacted on March 15, 1986, and published in *Part I of the Canada Gazette*, establishes the rules governing **special customs services**—specifically, services performed by customs officers outside their normal duties or locations. It was introduced under the authority of **sections 166 and 167 of the Customs Act**, following a public consultation period during which stakeholders were given the opportunity to submit comments.

> **Important Note**: This regulation has been **repealed** by *SOR/2024-41, section 10*, effective as of the date of the repeal. Therefore, it is no longer in force and does not apply to current customs operations.

## **Key Definitions and Provisions**

### 1. **Definition of "Chief Officer of Customs"**
- The term **"chief officer of customs"** refers to the **manager of the customs office or offices** serving a particular area or place.
- This role is central to determining jurisdiction and responsibilities in relation to special services.

---

## **What Constitutes a "Special Service"?**

Under **section 2(1)**, a service is considered a *special service* if it is performed by a customs officer **outside the normal framework of duties**, including:

✅ **Outside regular working hours** (as defined by the Deputy Minister)  
✅ **In a location outside the area served by a customs office**  
✅ **Outside the officer’s ordinary duties**

> These conditions ensure that services not part of standard operations are classified as "special" and thus subject to specific charges and oversight.

---

## **Exclusions from Special Services**

Certain services are **not** considered special services, regardless of how unusual or outside normal hours they may be:

❌ **Examination or acceptance of reports related to a military conveyance**, *unless* the conveyance is being used in a commercial operation.  
❌ **Release of human remains**  
❌ **Release of perishable goods urgently needed to preserve human life or health**  
❌ **Release of non-perishable goods urgently needed to preserve human life or health**

> These exceptions reflect humanitarian and national security priorities where cost recovery is waived to ensure timely access to essential items.

## **Fees for Special Services**

### A. **General Fee Structure (for officers not listed in Section 5)**  
Every person requesting a special service from an officer **not specified in Section 5** must pay:

- **$54** for the **first two hours or portion thereof** spent on the service  
- **$27 per additional hour or portion** of service time

> Example:  
> - 3 hours of service → $54 + $27 = **$81**  
> - 5 hours → $54 + 2×$27 = **$108**

> ⚠️ *Note: This structure applies only when the officer is not a designated officer under section 5.*

---

### B. **No Charges for Meals and Rest**
- **No fee** is charged for time spent by officers on **meals or rest breaks** during the performance of a special service.

---

### C. **Multiple Officers Required**
- If **more than one officer** is involved in providing a special service, the **total chargeable time** is the **sum of all individual service times**.
- This means fees are calculated based on aggregate effort, not per officer.

---

## **Responsibility for Transportation, Accommodation, and Meals**

### A. **General Duty of the Requesting Person**
- The person requesting the special service must provide:
  - Transportation  
  - Accommodation  
  - Meals  

> This is required **unless** the service is being performed under exceptional circumstances.

---

### B. **Quality Standard**
- The provided transportation, accommodation, and meals must be **comparable in quality** to what would normally be authorized under the **Treasury Board Travel Directive** at the time of the service.

> This ensures fairness and consistency with government travel standards.

---

### C. **Fees When Provision Is Not Made**

If the requesting person fails to provide necessary support (transportation, accommodation, meals), the person **must pay**:

#### 1. **For Accommodation, Meals, or Transportation Not Provided**
- The charge is based on the **rates and allowances** set out in the **Treasury Board Travel Directive** in effect at the time of the service.

#### 2. **For Use of Private or Government-Owned Conveyance**
- If the officer must use:
  - A **privately owned vehicle**, or  
  - A **government-owned or leased vehicle**
  
> The requester must pay the **greater of**:
- The allowance for private vehicle use under the Treasury Board Travel Directive, **or**
- **$5**

> Example: If the travel allowance is $10, the requester pays **$10** (the higher amount).

---

## **Security Requirement for Payment**

### When Is Security Required?
- If the **chief officer of customs** determines that **security is needed** to guarantee payment of fees incurred during the performance of a special service, the requesting person **must provide security**.

### How?
- Security must comply with the **Financial Security (Electronic Means) Regulations**.
- The amount of security is **determined by the Minister of National Revenue**.

> This provision protects the government from non-payment risks in high-value or high-risk situations (e.g., urgent cross-border shipments or sensitive operations).

---

## **Regulatory Context and Authority**

- The regulation was made under **sections 166 and 167 of the Customs Act**, which empower the Minister of National Revenue to establish rules for special customs services.
- The process included **public notice and opportunity for comment**, ensuring transparency and stakeholder input before finalization.

## **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Recovery** | Ensures that the government recovers reasonable costs when officers perform non-routine duties. |
| **Operational Flexibility** | Allows officers to respond to urgent or off-hours needs without violating standard procedures. |
| **Fairness & Consistency** | Aligns service charges with established government travel standards. |
| **Humanitarian Exceptions** | Exempts life-saving or human remains-related releases from fees. |
| **Risk Management** | Requires security for high-risk or high-cost services. |

## **Repeal and Current Status**

- This regulation was **repealed on April 1, 2024**, under **SOR/2024-41, section 10**.
- As of that date, **no longer applies** to customs operations in Canada.
- The repeal suggests that the government has replaced or restructured the framework for special customs services with updated policies, likely reflecting changes in customs operations, digitalization, or administrative efficiency.

> **Note**: While the regulation is no longer active, its principles—such as cost recovery for off-hours or out-of-area services—may have influenced current customs policies or been incorporated into updated regulations.

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation established a clear, structured framework for when, how, and at what cost customs officers could perform special services beyond their regular duties. It balanced operational flexibility with fiscal responsibility and included important humanitarian exemptions. However, due to its **repeal in 2024**, it is now **historical** and **no longer in effect**.

For current guidance on special customs services, stakeholders should refer to **updated regulations** under the *Customs Act* or related administrative policies issued after 2024.
