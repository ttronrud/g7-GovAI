The primary objective of this regulation is to **authorize Theratronics International Limited (TIL)** — a corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* — to:

1. **Incorporate a new corporation**, and

- The authorization is **not limited in scope or duration**, unless otherwise specified in the annexed order (which is not provided in the text), implying it is a general and ongoing power.
