### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (not explicitly named in the text) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Order in Council SOR/2012-1, section 1**.

- **SOR/2012-1** stands for "Statutory Instrument 2012-1," which is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada. These instruments are used to amend, repeal, or introduce new rules under existing legislation.
- **Section 1** of that Order in Council specifically contains the provision that **repeals** a previously enacted regulation.
- The repeated entries suggest that the regulation in question was repealed multiple times or that the repeal notice was referenced multiple times in a document or list—however, without the original regulation’s title or subject matter, the exact scope or content of the repealed rule cannot be determined from this information alone.

### Important Notes:
- The regulation itself is **no longer in force** as of the date of the repeal (which would be effective upon the publication of SOR/2012-1).
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative or regulatory modernization effort to eliminate outdated, redundant, or inconsistent rules.
- Without the original regulation’s name or subject (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain financial services"), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of what the regulation originally governed (such as a specific industry, activity, or administrative process).

### Conclusion:
The provided text does **not contain a detailed summary of a regulation**, but rather indicates that a regulation was **repealed by SOR/2012-1, section 1**. To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation, which is no longer active and may be archived in official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations.gov* portal.

**Recommendation:** To find the original regulation and its content, search the *Canada Gazette* or the *Department of Justice Canada* database using the reference "SOR/2012-1, s. 1" and the title of the repealed regulation (if known).
