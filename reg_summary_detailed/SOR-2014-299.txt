**Detailed Summary of the CKFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**

The **CKFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** were formally issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the federal government the authority to create regulations that implement specific provisions of a trade agreement, such as the Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA).

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)**: This section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2001* authorizes the Governor General in Council to make regulations implementing provisions of the CKFTA.  
  - **S.C. 1997, c. 36**: This refers to the original enabling legislation or framework under which the regulations are authorized, likely related to customs and trade policy.

### **2. Scope and Legal Force of the CKFTA Provisions**

The following provisions of the **Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA)** are given **force of law in Canada** under these regulations:

- **Articles 3.1 to 3.6**:  
  These articles establish the general rules for determining the origin of goods for the purpose of eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the CKFTA. They define key concepts such as:
  - The meaning of "originating goods"
  - The requirement that goods must meet a certain level of value addition or processing in either Canada or Korea
  - The application of rules of origin to different types of products (e.g., manufactured goods, intermediate products)

- **Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3.7**:  
  These paragraphs outline the **rules of origin for specific product categories**, particularly those involving:
  - Components or parts manufactured in one country and assembled in another
  - The use of non-originating materials (e.g., imported components) in final products

- **Articles 3.8 to 3.17**:  
  These provisions contain **detailed rules of origin** for various product classifications, including:
  - **Manufacturing processes** (e.g., assembly, processing, transformation)
  - **Value-added thresholds** (e.g., a minimum percentage of value must be added in Canada or Korea)
  - **Specific rules for certain industries** (e.g., automobiles, machinery, textiles)
  - **Rules for goods that are partially made in one country and partially in another**

- **Article 3.20**:  
  This article establishes **rules for the treatment of goods that are not fully originating** (e.g., goods containing non-originating components). It may include provisions for:
  - The use of "exempted" or "non-originating" materials
  - The conditions under which goods can still qualify as originating despite partial foreign content

- **Annex 3-A**:  
  This annex provides **specific, product-specific rules of origin** that are detailed and tailored to particular goods (e.g., semiconductors, vehicles, machinery). It serves as a practical guide for customs authorities and businesses to determine whether a product qualifies as originating under the CKFTA.

> **Key Point**: These provisions are not merely interpretive—they are **legally binding** in Canada and must be applied by customs officials when assessing whether goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the CKFTA.

### **3. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The Regulations come into force on the day that **Section 47 of the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act** (chapter 28 of the Statutes of Canada, 2014) comes into force.
- **If the Regulations are registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely manner, aligned with the broader legislative framework of the CKFTA, and allows for a smooth transition when the regulations are formally published.

---

### **4. Historical Context and Effective Date**

- The regulations are noted as being **in force as of January 1, 2015**.  
  This indicates that they were implemented and became operational on that date, consistent with the timing of the CKFTA’s entry into force and Canada’s integration of trade rules.

### **5. Purpose and Significance**

The **CKFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** serve a critical function in the Canada–Korea trade relationship by:

- Ensuring **fair and transparent application** of preferential tariff treatment
- Preventing **tariff dumping** or **unfair competition** by requiring that goods meet specific origin criteria
- Enabling **Canadian and Korean manufacturers** to benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs on eligible goods
- Providing **clarity and predictability** for businesses involved in cross-border trade

These rules are essential for both **customs administration** and **business planning**, as they determine whether a product qualifies as "originating" and thus eligible for preferential treatment under the CKFTA.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **CKFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** are a legally binding set of rules that implement the origin determination provisions of the Canada–Korea Free Trade Agreement. They are designed to ensure that only goods meeting specific value-added or production criteria in Canada or Korea qualify for preferential tariff treatment. The regulations are effective upon the coming into force of Section 47 of the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act, with a fallback to the date of registration if published later. As of January 1, 2015, these rules have been in full force and are a cornerstone of Canada’s implementation of the CKFTA.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Enacted under statutory authority (Customs Tariff, s. 16(2)a)
- Implements specific CKFTA articles and Annex 3-A
- Legally binding in Canada
- Effective date tied to the Canada–Korea Economic Growth and Prosperity Act
- In force since January 1, 2015

These regulations are essential for ensuring compliance, transparency, and fairness in Canada’s trade relationship with South Korea.
