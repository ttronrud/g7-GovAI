**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Overpayments of Canada Education Savings Grants Remission Order**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically subsection **23(2.1)a**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and the Treasury Board) to make orders related to the remission of overpayments in respect of certain government grants. The regulation is formally enacted under **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of this order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or forgive) overpayments** made to beneficiaries under the **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)** program. These overpayments occurred during a specific historical period and were made under the *Canada Education Savings Act* and the *Canada Education Savings Regulations*.

---

**Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies to any beneficiary who received an overpayment of a Canada Education Savings Grant during the following period:  
📅 **January 1, 1998, to June 30, 2005**.

This means that individuals who were overpaid due to incorrect or erroneous calculations of their CESG eligibility or amounts during those years are eligible for the remission.

---

**Conditions for Eligibility**  
To qualify for the remission, a beneficiary must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Designation as a Beneficiary under the Income Tax Act**  
   The individual must be a person designated in respect of a **Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)** under **section 146.1 of the Income Tax Act**.  
   → This confirms that the individual is legally recognized as the beneficiary of an RESP, which is a key requirement for eligibility under the CESG program.

2. **Grant Paid During the Specified Period**  
   The Canada Education Savings Grant must have been paid to or for the benefit of the beneficiary **during the period from January 1, 1998, to June 30, 2005**.  
   → This ensures that only overpayments from that specific timeframe are covered, not earlier or later grants.

3. **Grant Has Not Been Repaid**  
   The overpayment must **not have been previously repaid** by the beneficiary.  
   → This condition prevents double remission or compensation and ensures that the overpayment remains outstanding and eligible for forgiveness.

4. **Minimum Contributions Not Made**  
   The beneficiary must **not have made minimum contributions** under **subparagraph 4(1)(c)(i) or (4)(1)(c)(ii)** of the *Canada Education Savings Regulations*.  
   → This is a critical condition. The regulations require that a minimum contribution be made annually to an RESP to qualify for the CESG. If such a minimum contribution was made, the overpayment is not eligible for remission.  
   → This likely reflects a policy intention to ensure that grants are only forgiven when they were issued in error — for example, when the plan was not properly maintained or when the beneficiary was not meeting the required contribution thresholds.

**Key Implications**  
- This regulation serves as a **corrective measure** to address administrative or calculation errors in the CESG program during a defined period.  
- It provides **financial relief** to individuals who were overcharged due to technical or procedural errors, without requiring them to repay the overpayment.  
- The condition regarding minimum contributions suggests that the government is protecting the integrity of the program by ensuring that grants are only forgiven when they were not tied to valid, compliant contributions.  
- The regulation is **not retroactive beyond June 30, 2005**, and does not apply to overpayments outside the specified timeframe.

**Conclusion**  
This Overpayments of Canada Education Savings Grants Remission Order is a targeted, time-bound, and conditionally applied policy designed to correct overpayments made under the CESG program between 1998 and 2005. It reflects a balance between public accountability and administrative fairness, ensuring that individuals who were wrongfully overcharged — particularly those who did not meet minimum contribution requirements — receive relief without undermining the program’s core principles of contribution-based eligibility and financial responsibility.

It remains a significant tool for improving public trust in the Canada Education Savings Grant program and addressing historical administrative shortcomings.
