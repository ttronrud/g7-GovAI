---

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Commodity Board** | The *Ontario Fresh Grape Growers’ Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body administers the marketing and pricing of Ontario fresh grapes and collects service charges. |
| **Producer** | A person engaged in the production of fresh grapes (producteur). This includes grape growers who grow grapes for direct sale or marketing. |
| **Shipper** | A person who receives, assembles, packs, ships, or transports fresh grapes. Excludes: servants driving vehicles owned by producers or appointed shippers/dealer-shippers, railway companies, and agents transporting grapes on behalf of producers. |
| **Dealer-Shipper** | A person who sells or offers to sell fresh grapes, receives, assembles, packs, ships, or transports them. Excludes: employees of producers/appointed parties, railway companies, and agents of producers. |
| **Appointed Shipper** | A shipper holding a valid certificate of appointment issued by the Commodity Board under the *Ontario Fresh Grape Shippers and Dealer-Shippers (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations*. |
| **Appointed Dealer-Shipper** | A dealer-shipper holding a valid certificate of appointment issued by the Commodity Board. |
| **Fresh Grapes** | Grapes produced in Ontario that are **not used for processing** (e.g., not used in juice, wine, or other processed products). Excludes grapes destined for processing. |
| **Processing** | Any activity involving the transformation of grapes into products such as juice, wine, spirits, or bottled beverages, including bottling, distilling, fermenting (with sugar or sulfur dioxide), or using chemicals. |

### **Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply **only** to:
  - The **marketing of fresh grapes** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces).
  - **Export trade** (sales to foreign countries).
  - Persons and property **situated within the Province of Ontario**.

- **Exemption**:  
  A **producer who sells directly to a consumer** (e.g., at a farm stand or through a roadside stand) is **exempt** from this regulation in respect of that transaction.  
  → This means the service charge does **not** apply to direct consumer sales.

---

### **Service Charge Requirement**

Every **producer** must pay a **service charge** to the Commodity Board for the marketing of fresh grapes. The charge is:

> **3/8 of one cent per pound** of fresh grapes  
> → That is: **$0.00375 per pound** (or 0.375 cents per pound)

This charge is **in addition** to the remuneration paid to the **appointed shipper**, which is set by the Commodity Board from time to time.

---

### **Collection and Remittance of the Service Charge**

The service charge is collected and remitted in **two distinct scenarios**, depending on how the grapes are marketed:

#### **1. When Sold Through the Commodity Board**

- The **Commodity Board** acts as the intermediary.
- The Board **deducts the service charge** from the payment it makes to the producer for the sale of fresh grapes.
- The charge is then **passed on to the Commodity Board** as revenue.

> ✅ The producer receives the sale proceeds minus the service charge.

#### **2. When Sold Through a Dealer-Shipper**

- The **dealer-shipper** (a licensed intermediary) purchases fresh grapes from the producer.
- The dealer-shipper must:
  1. **Deduct the service charge** (3/8 of one cent per pound) from the amount paid to the producer.
  2. **Remit the full amount of the service charge** to the Commodity Board within **21 days** after receiving the fresh grapes.

> ❗This creates a financial obligation for the dealer-shipper to ensure timely payment to the Commodity Board.

---

### **Purpose and Intent**

The regulation is designed to:

- Ensure that **producers receive fair compensation** for the marketing costs associated with interprovincial and export sales.
- Establish a **transparent and standardized service charge** system to fund marketing activities (e.g., promotion, logistics, market access).
- Support the **economic sustainability** of Ontario’s fresh grape industry by sharing marketing costs among participants in the supply chain.
- Prevent **unfair advantages** by ensuring all market participants (especially intermediaries) contribute to marketing costs.
