Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of the Cities Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada  
**Date of Effect:** July 20, 2004  
**Issuing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*

---

**Overview:**

This regulation formally transfers administrative control and supervision of a specific component of the Canadian public service — the *Cities Secretariat* — from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada**.

The transfer is not a reorganization of personnel or functions per se, but rather a reallocation of oversight responsibilities within the federal public service structure. It reflects a broader governmental strategy to align public service operations with current policy priorities, particularly those related to infrastructure development and urban planning.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Subject of Transfer:**  
   The *Cities Secretariat*, which is a division within the Privy Council Office responsible for advising the Government of Canada on matters related to urban development, municipal affairs, and intergovernmental coordination involving cities and urban areas.

2. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation specifies that the *control and supervision* of the Cities Secretariat are being transferred. This means that the Office of Infrastructure of Canada will now be responsible for:
   - Overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Cities Secretariat,
   - Setting strategic direction,
   - Approving budgets and resource allocations,
   - Ensuring compliance with federal policies and performance standards.

   Importantly, the transfer does not necessarily involve a change in the substantive functions or services provided by the Cities Secretariat — those functions remain intact — only the administrative and managerial oversight is relocated.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer takes effect on **July 20, 2004**. All administrative, reporting, and operational responsibilities are to be transferred to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada from that date forward.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign duties and responsibilities among federal departments and offices, including within the public service, to improve efficiency, accountability, and policy coherence.

5. **Purpose and Rationale (Implied):**  
   The move is interpreted as part of a broader government initiative to strengthen federal leadership in infrastructure and urban policy. By placing the Cities Secretariat under the Office of Infrastructure of Canada, the government aims to:
   - Enhance coordination between federal infrastructure programs and municipal development,
   - Improve policy integration across urban planning, transportation, housing, and economic development,
   - Ensure that urban-related policy decisions are aligned with national infrastructure priorities.

---

**Implications:**

- **For the Cities Secretariat:**  
  It continues to perform its advisory and policy functions but now operates under a new administrative umbrella with different strategic priorities and reporting lines.

- **For the Office of Infrastructure of Canada:**  
  The office gains a key policy and operational component focused on urban development, which strengthens its role in shaping national infrastructure strategy.

- **For Public Service Governance:**  
  The transfer exemplifies the federal government’s use of structural reorganization to improve interdepartmental alignment and policy coherence, particularly in complex, cross-sectoral areas like urban development.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It formally transfers the management and oversight of the Cities Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada, effective July 20, 2004. The change is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a strategic effort to align urban policy with national infrastructure goals, thereby enhancing the coherence and effectiveness of federal governance in the area of cities and urban development.
