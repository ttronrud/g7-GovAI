The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-319, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from legal force).
- **Repeal Notice**: The repeal was enacted under **SOR/2016-319, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument) published in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* of Canada in 2016.
- **Effective Date**: While the exact date is not specified in the provided text, SOR/2016-319 was issued on **April 28, 2016**, and the repeal would have taken effect upon publication or as specified in the instrument.
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it no longer applies to any legal, administrative, or operational context. Any previous provisions, obligations, or interpretations derived from it are no longer valid or enforceable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because the regulation was:
  - Outdated or superseded by newer legislation,
  - Found to be redundant or inconsistent with current laws,
  - Unnecessary due to changes in policy or administrative structure,
  - Or deemed to conflict with other regulations or statutes.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (nine times) are likely a formatting or technical error, possibly from a document that was copied incorrectly. Each line contains the same information, so the summary remains the same regardless of repetition.
- There is **no substantive content** of the original regulation provided — only the notice of its repeal.

### Conclusion:
This entry serves as a **legal notice of repeal**, confirming that a specific regulation (not named in the text) was officially removed from force by **SOR/2016-319, section 1**. As such, the regulation no longer exists in Canadian law and should not be referenced or applied in any legal or regulatory context.

To identify the original regulation that was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2016-319, which may be accessible through official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders* section of the Canadian government’s legislation website (e.g., [canada.ca/laws](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/)).
