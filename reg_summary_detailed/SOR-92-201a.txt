**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1992**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, formally titled the *Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1992*, is a government order issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada and the Public Service Commission) to exempt certain temporary employees from the full application of the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)* during a specific time period.

The primary purpose of the order is to allow the Department of National Defence (DND) to hire individuals for **short-term, temporary assignments**—specifically those lasting **less than three months**, with a total of **less than six months in any 12-month period**—without being subject to the standard employment protections and requirements under the Public Service Employment Act.

---

### **Key Background and Rationale**

1. **Context and Timing**  
   - The regulation applies to a defined period: **from April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994**.
   - It targets specific job categories within the Department of National Defence (DND), where short-term staffing is common due to operational needs, seasonal demands, or project-based work.

2. **Public Service Commission’s Determination**  
   - The Public Service Commission (PSC) concluded that:
     - It would **not be practicable** or in the **best interests of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to individuals hired for short-term roles.
     - Applying the Act to such temporary assignments would create administrative burdens, disrupt operational flexibility, and hinder effective staffing in key DND departments.

3. **Desirability of Exemption**  
   - The Commission found it **desirable** to create a regulatory framework that allows for temporary employment in these categories without the constraints of the PSEA, such as requirements for fixed-term contracts, job security, or certain procedural protections.

4. **Legal Authority**  
   - The PSC exercised its authority under **subsection 41(1)** of the *Public Service Employment Act* to **exclude** certain appointments from the operation of the Act.
   - Additionally, under **subsection 37(1)** of the same Act, the Commission recommended the creation of specific regulations to govern these temporary appointments.

### **Scope of the Exclusion**

The exclusion applies to individuals hired **on or after April 9, 1992**, for one or more specified periods of **less than three months each**, with the **total duration across any consecutive 12-month period not exceeding six months**.

#### **Applicable Job Categories in the Department of National Defence**:

| Category | Subgroups |
|--------|----------|
| **Operational Category** | All roles in the Operational Category |
| **Administrative Support Category** | Clerical and Regulatory, Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing, and Data Processing Groups |
| **Technical Category** | Drafting and Illustration, Engineering and Scientific Support Groups |
| **Scientific and Professional Category** | Education and Nursing Groups |

> Note: The exclusion does **not** apply to permanent or long-term positions, nor to other departments outside DND.

### **What Is Excluded from the Public Service Employment Act?**

For the period April 9, 1992 – April 30, 1994, the following provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* **do not apply** to individuals hired under this temporary arrangement:

- Requirements related to fixed-term employment conditions (e.g., job security, promotion, tenure)
- Provisions governing fair procedures for hiring, termination, or dispute resolution
- Certain protections related to equal opportunity, working conditions, and grievance mechanisms
- Mandatory eligibility criteria or competitive selection processes that would otherwise apply to temporary roles

> In essence, temporary staff in these roles are **not considered "public servants"** under the PSEA during this period, and thus are not bound by its employment standards.

### **Purpose and Benefits**

- **Operational Flexibility**: Allows DND to respond quickly to changing operational needs (e.g., training, emergency responses, project deadlines).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces administrative overhead associated with full employment compliance.
- **Staffing Agility**: Enables hiring of qualified professionals on a project-by-project basis without long-term commitments.
- **Support for Specialized Roles**: Particularly beneficial for roles in education, nursing, clerical, and technical support that may require short-term expertise.

---

### **Regulatory Framework and Legal Effect**

- The Order is **binding** and takes effect immediately upon issuance.
- It is based on a recommendation from both the **Secretary of State of Canada** and the **Public Service Commission**, ensuring accountability and alignment with public service policy.
- The Order is **cited as**: *Department of National Defence Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1992*.
- The term **"persons"** in the Order refers to individuals who are employed in these temporary roles and are thus **excluded from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act**.

### **Important Limitations and Conditions**

- **Duration Limit**: No individual can be hired for more than **six months in any 12-month period**.
- **Minimum Duration per Assignment**: Each individual assignment must be **less than three months**.
- **Applicability**: Only applies to the **Department of National Defence**.
- **Time Period**: Only valid from **April 9, 1992, to April 30, 1994**.
- **No Extension**: The exclusion does not extend beyond April 30, 1994, and is not retroactive to earlier dates.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a targeted, time-limited exemption from the Public Service Employment Act to accommodate the practical realities of temporary staffing in the Department of National Defence. It balances the need for operational efficiency and workforce flexibility with the broader principles of public service accountability and fairness.

By allowing short-term, project-based appointments in key administrative, technical, and professional support roles, the regulation enables DND to maintain effective operations without imposing the rigors of permanent public service employment rules on temporary workers.

> **Note**: This exemption was a one-time, historically specific measure and has since been superseded by updated employment policies and frameworks. It serves as an example of how regulatory flexibility can be introduced in public service management to meet urgent operational needs.

**In short**:  
This 1992 Order allows DND to hire temporary staff (for less than 3 months per assignment, with total under 6 months in any 12 months) in specific categories during 1992–1994 without applying the full Public Service Employment Act—enhancing flexibility while maintaining operational effectiveness.
