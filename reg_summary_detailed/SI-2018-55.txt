#### **2. Purpose and Rationale**

The proclamation is rooted in several key constitutional, cultural, and political principles:

- **Recognition of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights**  
  The Constitution of Canada (specifically Section 35) recognizes and affirms the **existing Aboriginal and treaty rights** of Indigenous peoples. This foundational principle underscores the importance of respecting Indigenous identities and histories.

- **Celebration of Contributions**  
  The Government of Canada acknowledges that **First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples** have made **valuable and enduring contributions** to Canadian society. The day serves as a formal occasion to:
  - Mark and celebrate these contributions.
  - Recognize the **diversity of Indigenous cultures** across Canada.

- **Historical Context: National Aboriginal Day**  
  Since **1996**, June 21 has been officially recognized as **"National Aboriginal Day"** through a proclamation registered on July 10, 1996. This date was chosen because it falls on the **summer solstice**, the longest day of the year, symbolizing light, strength, and renewal—values central to many Indigenous traditions.

- **Commitment to Reconciliation**  
  The Government of Canada has made a formal commitment to **advance reconciliation** with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples through:
  - Nation-to-nation, Inuit-Crown, and government-to-government relationships.
  - A foundation built on **recognition of rights, mutual respect, cooperation, and partnership**.

- **Use of the Term "Indigenous Peoples"**  
  The proclamation explicitly defines **"Indigenous peoples"** as including:
  - First Nations
  - Inuit
  - Métis  
  This inclusive definition reflects modern, accurate, and respectful terminology that acknowledges the distinct identities and histories of all three groups.

#### **3. Key Change: Renaming the Day**

- **Old Name**: *National Aboriginal Day*  
- **New Name**: *National Indigenous Peoples Day*
