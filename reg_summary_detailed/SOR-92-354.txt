Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

## **Protection of Assets (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations, S.C. 1991, c. 48**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**

This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 463(g) of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act**. It **revokes the previous Protection of Securities (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations** and replaces them with updated, more comprehensive rules designed to ensure the **protection and secure maintenance of assets** held by cooperative credit associations.

The primary objective is to establish clear, enforceable standards for how cooperative credit associations must manage, safeguard, and insulate their assets from loss due to fraud, theft, damage, or dishonest acts by employees or officers.

### **2. Citation and Scope**

- **Regulation Title**: *Protection of Assets (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations*
- **Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 48
- **Applicability**: Applies to **cooperative credit associations** in Canada, with specific exclusions outlined below.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Bond** | A contract of insurance where one party agrees to indemnify another for losses arising from the act of a third party (e.g., an employee’s dishonesty). |
| **Security** | A negotiable security owned or held by the association *in trust*, but **excludes securities issued by the association itself**. Examples include bonds, shares, or debentures. |
| **Security Transaction** | Any action involving the purchase, sale, redemption, exchange, transfer, or assignment of a security. |

> ⚠️ *Note: The term "security" is narrowly defined to exclude securities issued by the association, which are not considered assets under this regulation.*

---

### **4. Exemptions**

These Regulations **do not apply** in the following situations:

1. **Jurisdictional Compliance**:  
   If an association is operating in a jurisdiction and complying with local laws that are **inconsistent** with these Regulations.

2. **Trust or Estate Administration**:  
   To the extent that the Regulations conflict with:
   - Powers or duties related to the **administration of an estate or trust**, or  
   - The association’s role as an **agent** in such matters.

> This ensures flexibility where associations act in fiduciary or legal roles outside the scope of asset protection.

---

### **5. Recordkeeping Requirements**

#### **(a) Asset Handling Procedures**
- Every association must maintain a **written record** of the procedures it follows for:
  - Handling and safeguarding assets.
- This record must be **shared with all individuals** who:
  - Have access to assets, or
  - Are involved in managing or protecting those assets.
  - This includes directors, officers, employees, and agents.

#### **(b) Security Inventory**
- The association must maintain an **up-to-date record** that identifies **every security** held or owned by it.

> This ensures transparency and traceability of all financial instruments.

---

### **6. Custody of Securities**

#### **General Rule**
- Every security must be kept **securely** and **in a manner preventing unauthorized access**.
- It must be held either:
  - **In the custody of the association**, or  
  - **By an authorized entity** that is legally permitted to act as:
    - A **custodian of securities**, or  
    - A **depository or clearing agency** in the jurisdiction where it operates.

> This ensures that securities are not left in unregulated or insecure hands.

#### **Exemptions to Custody Rule**
The rule does **not apply** to securities that are:
- Under the **control of the government** of the jurisdiction where the association operates;
- **Pledged as collateral** for the association’s debt (or potential debt);
- **Loaned** to a person under a written agreement;
- **In transit** (being moved or transported).

> These exceptions recognize practical realities such as government-controlled assets, loans, or temporary movement.

#### **Custodial Agreements**
- Before placing any security in the custody of an external entity, the association must have a **written custodial agreement** in place.

> This ensures accountability and legal clarity in third-party custody arrangements.

### **7. Daily Deposit of Net Proceeds from Security Transactions**

On a **daily basis**, any net amount received from a security transaction (e.g., sale, redemption) must be deposited into one of the following:

1. An account **held by the association**;
2. With a **financial institution authorized** to accept deposits in the jurisdiction where it operates;
3. With a **trust company authorized** to hold money in trust in that jurisdiction;
4. With the **government** of the jurisdiction where the association operates, or with an agency thereof authorized to act as a security custodian;
5. With **CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.** (a national clearing and depository service).

> This ensures that proceeds are not retained in unsecured or risky forms and are kept in safe, regulated accounts.

---

### **8. Registration of Securities**

#### **General Rule**
- Every security must be **registered in the name of the association** in the register of the issuing entity (e.g., the issuer’s official register).

> This provides clear ownership and legal title.

#### **Exemptions**
The rule does **not apply** if:
- The security **cannot be registered** in the association’s name due to circumstances beyond the association’s control;
- The security is under the **control of the government**;
- The security is held as **collateral or for safekeeping**;
- The security is registered in the name of a **nominee** of the association or an authorized custodian;
- The security is held under a **book-entry (certificateless) or immobilization system** (e.g., electronic systems where physical certificates are not issued);
- The security is held **temporarily** by an agent, liquidator, trustee, or issuer for purposes such as:
  - Reorganization
  - Amalgamation
  - Liquidation
  - Voting

> These exceptions allow for flexibility in modern, electronic, or transitional financial processes.

---

### **9. Holding Securities in Bearer or Non-Registered Form**

If a security is **already protected** against:
- Loss  
- Fraud  
- Theft  
- Destruction  

Then the association may hold it in:
- **Bearer form** (where ownership is determined by physical possession), or  
- **Registered form in a name other than the association’s own** (e.g., in the name of a nominee or custodian).

> This provision allows for practical and secure handling in cases where physical or electronic safeguards are robust.

---

### **10. Insurance Requirements**

#### **(a) Insurance for Dishonest Acts**
- The association must acquire and maintain **one or more bonds** (insurance policies) to cover losses arising from:
  - **Dishonest or criminal acts** by officers or employees.

#### **(b) General Asset Insurance**
- The association must also maintain **insurance policies** to cover:
  - Damage to, destruction of, or mysterious disappearance of assets;
  - Other usual contingencies (e.g., fire, natural disaster, theft).

> This dual-layer protection covers both employee misconduct and physical loss.

#### **(c) Non-Cancellation Clause**
- Any bond or insurance policy acquired under these rules must:
  - **Not be cancelled or terminated** by the insurer or insured **until at least 30 days after**:
    - The Superintendent of Cooperative Credit Associations receives a **written notice** from the insurer or insured of their intention to cancel or terminate.

> This provides a **cooling-off period** and protects the association from sudden policy lapses.

#### **(d) Determining Insurance Amount**
- The amount of insurance must be established by the **board of directors**, based on:
  - The **nature and value** of the assets;
  - The **safeguarding procedures** in place;
  - Any other factors that could affect potential loss (e.g., risk profile, geographic location, type of securities).

> This ensures that insurance coverage is proportionate, realistic, and reflective of actual risk.

### **11. Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, the existence of a **Superintendent of Cooperative Credit Associations** (implied by the reference to "receipt by the Superintendent") indicates that these regulations are subject to **supervisory oversight**. The Superintendent has the authority to:
- Receive notices of cancellation;
- Monitor compliance;
- Enforce penalties for non-compliance.
