The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of a specific regulation under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*:

- **SOR/2016-231, s. 4** — This indicates that the regulation was repealed by Section 4 of the Statutory Regulation 2016-231.
- **SOR/2013-120, s. 5** — This indicates that the regulation was also previously repealed by Section 5 of Statutory Regulation 2013-120.

However, **no actual regulation is listed** in the text — only repeated citations to repeal notices. Therefore, there is **no detailed content or summary of a regulation** to provide, because the regulation itself has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).

### Summary:

- The referenced regulation has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in force**.
- It was repealed twice:
  - First by **SOR/2013-120, s. 5** (likely an earlier repeal attempt or partial repeal).
  - Then again by **SOR/2016-231, s. 4**, which is the most recent and definitive repeal.
- Since the regulation has been repealed, **there is no current legal text or provisions** to summarize.
- The repeated citations suggest that the repeal was formally applied multiple times or that the regulation was subject to multiple administrative actions, but this does not indicate a substantive regulation existed.

### Conclusion:

**There is no active or existing regulation to summarize. The referenced regulation has been repealed and is no longer valid under Ontario law.** Any attempt to summarize it would be based on obsolete or non-existent legal text. For current regulations, one should consult the official Ontario Government regulations database or the *Canada Gazette* or *Ontario Laws* website.
