**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
February 13, 2020  
Issued in Ottawa

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is made under **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29, and is authorized by the **recovery strategy** for the Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*).

### **Key Provisions and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback is officially listed as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and is entitled to protection under federal law.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat:**  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for this species has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the specific areas—known as *critical habitat*—that are essential for the survival and recovery of the species. These areas are defined by the ecological conditions necessary for the species to thrive.

3. **Critical Habitat Designation:**  
   This Order formally designates the **critical habitat** of the Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback based on the recovery strategy. The specific geographic boundaries and ecological requirements of this habitat are detailed in the **annexed Order** (not included in this summary but referenced in the regulation).

4. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Section 58(2)b):**  
   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion** of the designated critical habitat falls within an area referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.  
   - Subsection 58(2)b of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are **subject to a land claims agreement** and where a **wildlife management board (WMB)** has been established to carry out wildlife-related responsibilities.  
   - By confirming that the critical habitat is *not* located in such a restricted zone, the regulation avoids a potential conflict with Indigenous land rights and governance structures.

5. **Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards:**  
   The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** has determined that the proposed critical habitat designation would affect an area where a **wildlife management board** is authorized by a **land claims agreement** to perform functions related to wildlife species.  
   - Under **subsection 58(8)** of SARA, the Minister is required to **consult** with such a wildlife management board before designating critical habitat.  
   - This consultation has been completed, and the board has been duly informed and engaged in the process. This ensures that Indigenous governance and traditional land use considerations are respected.

6. **Legal Authority and Application:**  
   - Subsection **58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the species, meaning that the designated areas are legally protected under federal law.  
   - The protection includes restrictions on activities that could degrade or destroy the habitat, such as development, pollution, or physical alteration of the environment.  
   - The Order is **binding** and legally enforceable once it is registered.

7. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government. This ensures immediate legal effect upon official publication.

### **Purpose and Significance:**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally protect and conserve** the critical habitat of the Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback, a rare and endangered fish species.  
- It supports the broader goals of the *Species at Risk Act*, which aims to prevent extinction and promote recovery of at-risk species through the identification and protection of essential habitats.  
- By ensuring consultation with Indigenous wildlife management boards, the regulation demonstrates a commitment to **co-governance**, **Indigenous rights**, and **respect for land claims agreements**.

---

### **Implications:**

- **Environmental Protection:** The designated areas are now legally protected from harmful activities that could disrupt the ecological integrity required by the species.
- **Ecological Recovery:** The protection of critical habitat is a key step in the recovery of the species, which may lead to population stabilization or growth over time.
- **Legal Compliance:** The Order satisfies all procedural requirements under SARA, including consultation and exclusion from restricted zones, ensuring it is both lawful and equitable.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding step in the conservation of the Vananda Creek Limnetic Threespine Stickleback. It designates specific areas as critical habitat under the *Species at Risk Act*, based on scientific recovery planning, while ensuring compliance with Indigenous governance rights through prior consultation. The Order reflects a balanced approach to species protection, environmental stewardship, and respect for Indigenous rights and land claims.
