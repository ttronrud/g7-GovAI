**Detailed Summary of the Name Use (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Name Use (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is authorized under **section 531** and **subsection 533(4)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 45). These provisions empower the government to establish rules governing the use of a company’s name in connection with securities-related transactions.

**Regulation Title**  
The regulations are officially titled the *Name Use (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* and may be cited as such.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **June 1, 1992**.

**Core Purpose**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to clarify and regulate the circumstances under which a trust or loan company may use its official name in various documents associated with transactions involving securities. This ensures transparency, consistency, and legal compliance in public disclosures and marketing materials related to securities offerings or transactions.

**Permitted Use of Company Name**  
A person (such as an underwriter, broker, or issuing company) may use the name of a trust or loan company in the following types of documents, provided one of the following conditions is met:

1. **Use is required by law** – The use of the company’s name is mandated by applicable legislation or regulatory requirements.  
   *Examples*: Legal requirements for disclosure in a prospectus, offering memorandum, or takeover bid circular may necessitate the inclusion of the company’s name.

2. **Express written permission from the company** – The trust or loan company has provided **specific, written consent** authorizing the use of its name in the document.  
   *Note*: This consent must be explicit and documented, ensuring that the company is fully aware of and agrees to the use of its name in the context of a securities transaction.

**Types of Documents Covered**  
The regulations apply to the following securities-related documents:

- **Prospectus** – A formal document disclosing material information about a security offering.
- **Offering memorandum** – A detailed document used to inform potential investors about a proposed securities offering.
- **Takeover bid circular** – A document issued by a bidder to prospective shareholders in a takeover or acquisition.
- **Advertisement** – Any promotional material related to a securities transaction.
- **Any other document** – This includes any other communication or publication that is directly connected to a transaction involving securities.

**Key Principles**  
- The use of the company name is not automatic or unrestricted. It must either be legally required or authorized by the company in writing.
- The regulations promote accountability and prevent misleading or unauthorized use of a company’s name in financial disclosures.
- They provide clarity for market participants, investors, and regulators by defining when and how a company’s name may appear in public financial documents.

**Regulatory Significance**  
These regulations serve as a foundational tool for ensuring that securities transactions are conducted transparently and in compliance with legal and ethical standards. By restricting the use of a company’s name to legally mandated or explicitly permitted cases, the regulations help prevent misrepresentation, protect investor interests, and uphold the integrity of the securities market.

**Conclusion**  
The *Name Use (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* establish a clear and legally grounded framework for when a trust or loan company may use its name in documents related to securities transactions. The rules emphasize legal compliance and informed consent, reinforcing transparency and investor confidence in financial markets. Effective from June 1, 1992, these regulations remain a key component of the regulatory framework governing securities disclosures in Canada under the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.
