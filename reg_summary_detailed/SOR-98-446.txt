- **Paragraph 7(2)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA)

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

These regulations establish transitional coverage provisions for individuals or entities (referred to as "persons or bodies") that are transferred out of the Public Service under **subsection 40.1(1)** of the *Public Service Superannuation Act*. The primary objective is to ensure that such transferred individuals or organizations maintain a degree of superannuation coverage during the transition period, while also providing a clear and structured framework for their continued participation in the Public Service pension system—subject to specific conditions.

This transitional framework supports the orderly divestiture of services (i.e., the transfer of administrative responsibilities or functions from the federal public service to another entity, such as a private company or a new government body), without disrupting the pension entitlements of those involved.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), which governs the pension and superannuation arrangements for employees of the federal public service.

2. **"Person or body"**  
   Defined as any individual or organization to whom the administration of a public service is transferred or otherwise divested under **subsection 40.1(1)** of the PSSA.  
   - This term encompasses entities that take over a service (e.g., a government department or agency being transferred to a private entity or a new public body).  
   - The term is central to the transitional coverage framework and defines who is subject to the rules in this regulation.

### **Core Provision: Maximum Period of Public Service Membership**

- Under **paragraph 40.1(2)(a)** of the PSSA, a "person or body" that has been divested from the Public Service may remain part of the Public Service for a **maximum period of three years**.
- This three-year limit is a critical transitional safeguard: it ensures that any entity or individual receiving a service transfer does not remain indefinitely within the public service structure, which would otherwise create long-term pension obligations without clear accountability or funding mechanisms.

> **Important Note:** This three-year period is not a general rule for all public servants; it specifically applies to entities that are divested under the PSSA and are acting as "persons or bodies" in the transitional context.

### **Conditional Participation in the Pension System**

To remain part of the Public Service during the transitional period (i.e., within the three-year window), a person or body must meet a financial obligation:

- **Monthly Contributions to the Superannuation Account or Public Service Pension Fund**  
  - The amount of each monthly payment is determined in accordance with **Section 9 of the Public Service Superannuation Regulations**.  
  - These contributions are designed to mirror the pension contributions that would normally be made by public servants under the standard superannuation system.  
  - The contributions are required as a **condition of continued participation** in the Public Service pension system during the transitional period.

> This ensures that the financial obligations of the divested entity or individual are aligned with those of traditional public servants, preserving the integrity of the pension system and preventing gaps in coverage.

---

### **Regulatory Effect and Enforcement**

- These regulations are **not standalone legislation** but are a **secondary regulation** issued to implement specific provisions of the PSSA and FAA.
- The Treasury Board, acting on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board, has the authority to issue such regulations under the statutory powers granted in the PSSA and FAA.
- The regulations come into force on **August 28, 1998**, meaning all provisions apply from that date forward.

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

1. **Transitional Fairness**  
   Ensures that individuals or entities receiving transferred services are not left without pension protection during the transition, especially when they are temporarily operating under public service structures.

2. **Financial Accountability**  
   Requires monthly contributions to the superannuation fund, ensuring that the public pension system is not financially exposed to unmanaged risks from divested entities.

3. **Limiting Exposure**  
   The three-year cap prevents indefinite or prolonged public service status for divested entities, protecting both the public service and the pension fund from long-term liabilities.

4. **Clarity and Predictability**  
   Provides clear rules for both administrators and participants regarding the duration of transitional status and the financial obligations tied to it.

### **Conclusion**

The *Divestiture of Service Transitional Coverage Regulations* serve as a critical administrative tool to manage the financial and structural implications of transferring public service functions. By setting a clear three-year maximum period of transitional inclusion and requiring monthly contributions to the public pension system, the regulations ensure that:

- Divested entities do not remain indefinitely within the public service;
- Public pension obligations are preserved and funded;
- The integrity of the superannuation system is maintained during service transfers.

These provisions reflect a balanced approach to modernizing public service management while safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public employee benefits.

**Note:** These regulations are now historical in context (effective 1998), and may have been superseded or amended by subsequent legislation or regulations. However, they remain a foundational example of how transitional pension rules are structured in Canadian public service law.
