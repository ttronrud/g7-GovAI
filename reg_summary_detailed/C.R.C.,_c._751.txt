### **3. Scope of Tax Remission**

- **Remission of Taxes and Duties**:  
  Under this Order, **all taxes** imposed under:
  - Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*, and  
  - Any other part of the *Excise Tax Act*, and  
  - Customs duties under **Section 21 of the Customs Tariff**,  
  are **remitted (exempted)** for any commercial sample imported into Canada **on or after January 1, 1991**, for a **temporary period**.

> This means that importers do not have to pay excise taxes or customs duties on these samples, as long as all conditions of the Order are strictly followed.

---

### **4. Conditions for Tax Remission (Section 4)**

For remission to apply, the following conditions must be satisfied:

#### **(a) Importer Eligibility**
- The importer must be:
  - A **non-resident of Canada**, **or**
  - A **resident of Canada** who is:
    - An employee or agent of a **foreign supplier**;
    - Acts **on behalf of the foreign supplier**;
    - Negotiates sales contracts **only in the name of the foreign supplier**.

> This ensures that the importer is acting strictly in the interest of the foreign supplier and not engaging in commercial activity independently.

#### **(b) Ownership of Sample**
- The commercial sample must **remain in the ownership of a non-resident of Canada** during its time in Canada.

> This prevents the sample from being effectively "owned" or used by Canadian entities to generate revenue or sales within Canada.

#### **(c) Reporting and Record-Keeping Requirements (for samples valued over $1,000)**
- **At time of importation**, the importer must:
  - Clearly indicate **the specific locations in Canada** where the sample will be exhibited or demonstrated.
  - On **demand by the Minister of National Revenue**, provide proof that the sample is physically present at the indicated locations.
- The importer must:
  - Maintain **records** of the commercial sample in accordance with **Section 40 of the Customs Act** and related regulations.
  - Make these records available for **inspection** by any customs or excise officer.

> These requirements ensure transparency and accountability, especially for higher-value samples.

#### **(d) Exclusive Use by Importer**
- The commercial sample **must not be exhibited or demonstrated** by anyone other than the **authorized importer**.

> Prevents unauthorized third parties from using the sample to solicit orders, which could lead to misuse or circumvention of the remission rules.

#### **(e) Origin of Orders**
- Any goods ordered as a result of the exhibition or demonstration **must not be supplied from within Canada**.

> Ensures that the purpose of the sample is to generate demand for goods **from outside Canada**, not to stimulate domestic production or sales.

#### **(f) Export Deadline**
- The commercial sample must be **exported from Canada within one year** of the date of importation.

> This ensures the temporary nature of the import and prevents indefinite retention.

> **Extension Possibility**:  
> The **Deputy Minister of National Revenue** may extend this one-year period by **an additional six months** if, in their judgment, it is **impracticable or impossible** for the importer to comply with the deadline (e.g., due to unforeseen logistical, technical, or commercial challenges).

### **5. Requirement for a Valid Carnet**

- If the commercial sample is **not accompanied by a valid A.T.A. carnet**, the **chief officer of customs** may require the importer to provide **security** to ensure compliance with all the conditions in Section 4.

> This serves as a safeguard against non-compliance when formal international documentation is not available.

---

### **6. Security Requirements (When No Carnet is Present)**

If security is required, the importer must provide it in one of the following forms:

- **Cash**  
- **Certified cheque**  
- **Transferable bond issued by the Government of Canada**  
- **Bond issued by any of the following entities**:
  - A **fidelity or surety insurer** licensed in Canada or a province, and **recommended by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)**;
  - A **member of the Canadian Payments Association** (as defined in Section 4 of the Canadian Payments Association Act);
  - A **corporation** that accepts public deposits and is insured by:
    - Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), or  
    - Régie de l’assurance-dépôts du Québec (up to statutory limits);
  - A **credit union** (as defined in subsection 137(6) of the *Income Tax Act*);
  - A **corporation accepting public deposits**, with repayment guaranteed by **Her Majesty in right of a province**.

> The security amount must **not exceed** the total taxes and duties that would have been payable **if the remission had not applied**.

---

### **7. Refund or Cancellation of Security**

Security will be **refunded or cancelled** when one of the following occurs:

- The commercial sample is **released and accounted for** under the *Customs Act*;  
- The sample is **destroyed**, with a **certificate of destruction** issued by a customs officer, police officer, or fire marshal; **or**  
- The sample is **exported**, with a **certified exportation form** titled *"Temporary Admission Permit"* issued by the Department of National Revenue.

> The refund process is tied to the actual disposition of the sample, ensuring that security is only released when the sample is properly accounted for.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Penalties for Non-Compliance**

- If any of the conditions in Section 4(a) to (f) are **violated**, the commercial sample **shall be immediately entered for consumption**.
- This means the sample is treated as if it were permanently imported into Canada and subject to full taxation and duty collection.

> This is a strong enforcement mechanism to prevent misuse of the remission, such as:
  - Selling or using the sample for domestic purposes;
  - Allowing third parties to exhibit it;
  - Failing to export it within the required timeframe.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Promote Trade and Market Access**  
   Enables foreign suppliers to showcase their products in Canada without incurring significant import costs, thereby encouraging business development and international trade.

2. **Ensure Temporary and Controlled Use**  
   Limits the importation to a short, temporary period and requires strict oversight to prevent long-term retention or domestic sales.

3. **Maintain Tax Integrity**  
   Prevents tax evasion or avoidance by requiring clear ownership, reporting, and compliance with record-keeping and export obligations.

4. **Support International Trade Standards**  
   Aligns with the A.T.A. Carnet system, which is widely used internationally to facilitate temporary imports of goods.

5. **Protect Canadian Tax Revenue**  
   Through strict conditions and enforcement, the regulation ensures that tax remission is only granted in legitimate, non-commercial scenarios.

- **Effective Date**: Begins on **January 1, 1991**.
- **Exclusions**: Does not apply to goods that are not imported solely for exhibition or illustration to solicit orders.
- **No Duty on Exports**: The sample must be exported within one year (or extended by six months), and no duty is payable upon export.
