The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-24, s. 6]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 6 of the Statutory Instruments (SOR/2016-24)**, which is a statutory instrument issued in Canada under the authority of the Parliament.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal became effective through **SOR/2016-24, section 6**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on or around April 2016 (as SOR/2016-24 is the 2016 Statutory Instrument number 24).
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the Canadian government, likely under a broader legislative framework (such as a federal statute), where the regulation was originally issued to implement specific rules or requirements.
- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (Inferred)**: Although the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided, the repeated citation suggests it was a standalone rule—possibly related to environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, or another area of regulatory oversight—commonly found in federal or provincial regulatory frameworks. Without the original text, its precise subject matter cannot be determined.
- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - The regulation no longer applies.
  - Any legal obligations, compliance requirements, or enforcement mechanisms tied to it are now nullified.
  - Regulatory bodies or agencies must now refer to updated or successor regulations (if any) that may have replaced it.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text is **fully repealed** and **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its removal was formalized under **SOR/2016-24, section 6**, meaning that any prior references to it in legal, administrative, or compliance contexts must be disregarded. To understand the current regulatory landscape, one would need to consult the replacement regulation (if any) or the broader enabling legislation that previously authorized the rule.

> **Note**: Without access to the original regulation text, the exact subject matter (e.g., emissions standards, product safety, etc.) cannot be identified. A full summary of the original regulation would require retrieval of the text before repeal.
