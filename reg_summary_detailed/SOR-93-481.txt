**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Fingerprinting for Visa, Licensing or Security Clearance Purposes Fee Regulations**

**Regulatory Citation:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6  
Official Title: *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Fingerprinting for Visa, Licensing or Security Clearance Purposes Fee Regulations*

---

**1. Purpose and Authority**  
These regulations establish a standardized fee for fingerprinting services provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) when such fingerprinting is required for the purpose of obtaining a visa, licence, or security clearance.  

The regulations were made under the authority of **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting through the Crown) to establish fees for administrative and service-related activities, including those involving government departments and agencies, where such fees are necessary to cover the costs of providing services.

The regulations are issued on the recommendation of two key federal bodies:  
- The **Solicitor General of Canada**, who provides legal and policy advice on the validity and appropriateness of the fee.  
- The **Treasury Board**, which oversees the financial management and administrative costs of federal operations and ensures that fees are consistent with public accountability and fiscal responsibility.

**2. Scope of Application**  
The fee applies specifically to individuals who require fingerprinting as part of the application process for any of the following:  
- A **visa** (e.g., permanent resident, work, study, or temporary resident visas)  
- A **licence** (e.g., professional, occupational, or driver’s licences issued by federal or provincial authorities requiring biometric verification)  
- A **security clearance** (e.g., for access to sensitive government information or facilities, such as those required for employment in federal institutions, defence, or intelligence roles)

Fingerprinting is a biometric data collection process used for identity verification and background checks. The fee covers the administrative and operational costs associated with processing and storing the fingerprints for these purposes.

**3. Fee Amount**  
The prescribed fee for fingerprinting is **$25 (twenty-five Canadian dollars)**.  

This amount is set as a fixed, uniform rate for all individuals applying for fingerprinting in connection with visas, licences, or security clearances, regardless of jurisdiction or specific type of application, as long as the service is delivered by the RCMP.

---

**4. Enforcement and Compliance**  
- The fee is payable directly to the RCMP or the designated service provider responsible for fingerprinting services.  
- The fee is non-refundable and non-transferable.  
- The regulation does not impose additional charges beyond the $25 fee, and any related costs (e.g., processing, background checks, or document preparation) are not included in this fee.  
- The fee is intended to ensure that the cost of fingerprinting services is fairly and consistently borne by applicants, promoting transparency and fairness in the administrative process.

**5. Legal and Policy Context**  
The regulation reflects a broader federal policy of transparency and cost accountability in public services. By setting a clear, publicly known fee, the government ensures that applicants are informed of the cost of a service and can plan accordingly. It also supports the financial sustainability of the RCMP’s biometric services, which are essential for national security and immigration integrity.

Additionally, the regulation aligns with the principles of the *Financial Administration Act*, which mandates that government fees be reasonable, necessary, and clearly defined to ensure public confidence and administrative efficiency.

**6. Amendments and Review**  
While this regulation was enacted in 1991, it remains in force unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. Future reviews may be conducted to assess the need for fee adjustments in light of inflation, operational costs, or changes in service demand. However, no such amendment has been enacted as of the current date referenced.

**Conclusion**  
The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Fingerprinting for Visa, Licensing or Security Clearance Purposes Fee Regulations* provide a clear, legally binding framework for the collection of a $25 fee for fingerprinting services related to visas, licences, or security clearances. It ensures transparency, consistency, and fiscal responsibility in a critical administrative process, while respecting the legal authority of the federal government under the *Financial Administration Act*. The regulation remains a foundational component of Canada’s biometric identity verification system.
