**Detailed Summary of the Sandy Bay Band Council Elections Order (2003)**

**1. Background and Purpose**  
This regulation, issued on February 25, 2003, by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND), establishes a formal process for the democratic selection of the Sandy Bay Band Council. The primary objective is to ensure good governance within the Sandy Bay Band by instituting a transparent and legally grounded electoral system for choosing its leadership.

The Minister determines that transitioning to elected leadership—specifically, a chief and councillors—will strengthen democratic participation, accountability, and community representation within the Band. This shift aligns with the principles of the *Indian Act*, which provides a framework for the election of Band Councils.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Order comes into force on the day it is officially registered in the Canada Gazette. This ensures legal validity and enforceability once published and recognized by the government.

- **Commencement of Elections**:  
  Beginning on **February 26, 2003**, the council of the Sandy Bay Band—comprising a chief and one or more councillors—shall be selected through **elections conducted in accordance with the Indian Act**.

  The specific rules (e.g., voting methods, nomination timelines, polling locations) would be detailed in a separate by-law or regulation issued under the Indian Act, but this Order establishes that such elections must follow the Act’s framework.
