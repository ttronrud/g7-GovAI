The reference "[Repealed, SI/2007-62, s. 1]" indicates that the regulation in question has been officially repealed by **Statutory Instrument 2007 No. 62**, under **section 1** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The specific regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2007 No. 62* (commonly referred to as SI 2007/62).
- **Section of Repeal**: Section 1 of SI 2007/62 contains the provision that repeals the previously existing regulation.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal became effective upon the coming into force of SI 2007/62, which typically occurs on the date of publication in the Canada Gazette (or the relevant national gazette, depending on jurisdiction). In this case, it was likely published in the *Canada Gazette*, Part I, on a date in 2007 (exact date would require checking the official gazette).
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal suggests that the original regulation was either:
  - Outdated or no longer relevant,
  - Superseded by a more comprehensive or modern legislative framework,
  - Found to be inconsistent with current laws or policy objectives,
  - Or redundant due to the implementation of new rules or amendments.

### Contextual Notes:
- SI 2007/62 is a **statutory instrument**—a form of secondary legislation used in jurisdictions like Canada (under the *Statutory Instruments Act*) or the United Kingdom (under the *Statutory Instruments Act 1946*), depending on the country.
- In Canada, such instruments are typically issued by federal or provincial governments to implement or amend legislation. The repeal of a regulation through SI 2007/62 would mean that the prior rule no longer applies and must be disregarded in legal or administrative practice.
- The fact that the repeal is specified in **section 1** suggests that the instrument may have targeted a specific regulation or set of regulations, possibly one related to environmental protection, transportation, health, or workplace safety (depending on the subject matter of the original regulation).

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially removed from the legal framework** by Statutory Instrument 2007 No. 62, section 1. It is no longer valid or enforceable. Any legal or administrative action previously based on this regulation would need to be updated or replaced with current, applicable legislation.

> **Note**: Without additional context (e.g., the original regulation's title or subject matter), a more specific summary cannot be provided. To determine the exact nature of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of SI 2007/62 or the original regulation it repealed.

For precise details, refer to:

If you can provide the original regulation’s title or subject (e.g., "Regulation respecting the use of pesticides"), I can offer a more targeted summary.
