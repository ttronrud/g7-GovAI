Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, key provisions, purpose, scope, and implications.

### **Detailed Summary of the Definition of Promotion Regulations**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, pursuant to **paragraph 26(1)(b) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**.
- This provision grants the Treasury Board the authority to define key terms related to employment and promotion within the federal public service.
- The regulation is formally published under **S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13**, which are part of the *Public Service Modernization Act*.

#### **2. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on the date that Section 12 of the Public Service Modernization Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22) comes into force**.
- Section 12 of the Act was enacted to modernize public service employment practices, and its implementation date is critical for the operational effect of these rules.
- As noted in the note at the end, these regulations were **in force as of December 31, 2005**, indicating that they were finalized and adopted by that date.

#### **3. Purpose of the Regulation**
- To **clarify and define the term "promotion"** in the context of federal public service employment, ensuring consistency and fairness in how promotions are recognized and processed.
- To provide a **clear, objective standard** for determining when an employee has been promoted, which supports equitable pay progression, performance evaluation, and personnel management.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **A. Definition of "Substantive Level"**
- **Substantive level** refers to the **occupational group and level** at which an employee is currently being paid.
- If an employee holds an **acting appointment** (a temporary or interim position), their substantive level is determined by the **level they were being paid immediately before receiving the acting appointment**.
- This ensures that temporary assignments do not inadvertently displace the employee’s official pay grade or level.

> **Example**: An employee on an acting appointment in a higher-level position but not yet formally promoted would still be assessed at their previous substantive level for promotion purposes.

#### **B. Definition of "Promotion"**
Promotion is defined as the **assignment of an employee to the duties of a position** where:
- The **maximum rate of pay** for the new position is **greater than** the maximum rate applicable to the employee’s substantive level immediately before the assignment.
- The increase in pay must meet one of the following thresholds:
  1. **If the new position has more than one rate of pay**:
     - The increase must be **equal to or greater than the smallest increment** on the pay scale for the new position.
     - *Example*: If the pay scale has increments of $1,000, a promotion must involve a pay increase of at least $1,000.
  2. **If the new position has only one rate of pay**:
     - The increase must be **at least 4% of the maximum rate of pay** for the previous position.
     - *Example*: If the previous position paid $60,000, a promotion to a single-rate position would require a minimum increase of $2,400 (4% of $60,000).

> This threshold ensures that promotions are not minor or nominal changes in duties or pay, but represent meaningful advancement.

#### **C. Exclusions from Promotion**
- An assignment **does not constitute a promotion** if:
  - The employee is assigned to **another position within the same occupational group and subgroup**.
  - The new position is at the **same level or a lower level** than the previous one.
- This exclusion prevents trivial or lateral moves from being classified as promotions, which could otherwise lead to misclassification in pay progression, benefits, or eligibility for promotion-related benefits (e.g., seniority, training, or career advancement).

> **Example**: Moving from a Level 3 position to a Level 3 position in the same group/subgroup — even with different duties — is **not a promotion**.

### **Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply **only to organizations named in Schedule I or IV to the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**.
- The Financial Administration Act governs the federal government’s financial management and administrative structure.
- Schedule I includes **departments and agencies** directly involved in financial administration (e.g., Treasury Board, Public Service Commission, etc.).
- Schedule IV includes **federally regulated entities** such as the Canadian Wheat Board, which is specifically mentioned in the regulation’s preamble.

> **Note**: This means the rules do **not apply broadly** across all federal departments or agencies. They are limited to those specifically listed in the FAA schedules — a targeted approach to ensure alignment with financial and administrative oversight.

---

### **Preamble and Signatory**
- The regulation was signed by **Reginald B. Alcock**, who held dual roles:
  - President of the Treasury Board
  - Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board
- This reflects the cross-functional nature of the regulation, particularly given the Canadian Wheat Board’s inclusion in the scope.

### **Significance and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Clarity in Promotion Criteria** | Provides a clear, measurable definition of what constitutes a promotion, reducing ambiguity in personnel decisions. |
| **Pay Thresholds** | Ensures that promotions involve a meaningful increase in pay — either through a minimum increment or 4% of the prior maximum rate. |
| **Protection Against Misclassification** | Prevents lateral or non-advancing assignments from being labeled as promotions, protecting employee rights and organizational integrity. |
| **Fairness and Equity** | Supports consistent application of promotion rules across different positions and pay structures. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Definition of Promotion Regulations* serve as a **critical tool for ensuring fairness, transparency, and consistency** in the public service’s promotion system. By clearly defining when a promotion occurs — based on substantive level, pay increases, and structural criteria — the regulation strengthens accountability and aligns with broader goals of public service modernization.

It is particularly relevant for:
- Human resources departments managing employee progression.
- Pay and benefits administrators assessing pay scales.
- Senior management evaluating career advancement and performance.

While limited in scope to specific financial administration entities, its principles can serve as a model for future promotion standards in other federal organizations.
