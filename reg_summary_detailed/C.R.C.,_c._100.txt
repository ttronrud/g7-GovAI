The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal and revocation of a regulation under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* (SOR), specifically:

- **Repealed, SOR/2009-231, s. 7** (appears seven times)
- **Revoked, SOR/79-897, s. 1**

### Detailed Summary:

This text indicates that a particular regulation — previously in force — has been **repealed (cancelled or removed)** and **revoked (officially cancelled with legal effect)** through two separate statutory instruments:

1. **SOR/2009-231, Section 7**  
   - This regulation was formally **repealed** on the date the statutory rule came into force (typically January 1, 2009, unless otherwise specified).  
   - The repealing provision (Section 7 of SOR/2009-231) specifically nullifies the prior regulation.  
   - The repetition of this line seven times in the original text appears to be a typographical or formatting error, likely indicating a redundancy or copy-paste issue, and does not indicate multiple distinct legal actions.

2. **SOR/79-897, Section 1**  
   - This earlier statutory rule, issued in **1979**, revoked or replaced the same regulation.  
   - SOR/79-897, s. 1, served as the **original revocation** of the regulation, meaning it was legally removed from effect prior to 2009.  
   - The inclusion of this reference confirms that the regulation was already obsolete by 1979 and was later reaffirmed as repealed in 2009.

### Conclusion:

✅ The regulation referenced in the text is **no longer in force**.  
✅ It was **first revoked in 1979** under SOR/79-897, s. 1.  
✅ It was **repealed again in 2009** under SOR/2009-231, s. 7, which serves as a formal confirmation and final termination of its legal existence.  
✅ The repeated references are likely a formatting or editorial error and do not reflect distinct legal events.

### Legal Implication:
Any legal, administrative, or operational reference to this regulation is now **invalid**. Entities or individuals relying on it would be acting outside the bounds of current law. This repeal ensures that the regulation is completely removed from the legal framework of Ontario.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original regulation’s title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation respecting..." or "Occupational Health and Safety"), it is not possible to identify the specific area of law (e.g., environmental, transportation, health, etc.) that this repealed regulation governed. Additional context would be required to provide a more targeted summary.
