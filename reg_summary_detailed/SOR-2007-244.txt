The provided text consists of four identical entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-29, s. 23]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2016-29**, under **section 23** of that regulation.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Entry:**  
Each line is a notice of repeal — not a description of an active regulation. The repeated entries suggest that the section in question was repealed, and the notice appears multiple times, possibly due to formatting or duplication in a legal document.

**2. SOR/2016-29:**  
This refers to *Supplemental Regulation 2016-29*, which is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada. These supplements are typically issued under a parent regulation (such as the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or *Canada Elections Act*) and amend or repeal existing provisions.

**3. Section 23:**  
Section 23 of SOR/2016-29 contains the specific provision that **repeals** a prior regulation or section. The exact content of the repealed provision is not provided in the text, but the repealing action implies that a previous rule or requirement was removed from legal force.

**4. Legal Implications of Repeal:**  
- The regulation or section previously in force is **no longer valid**.  
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures previously governed by that section are **no longer enforceable**.  
- The repeal may have been enacted for reasons such as:  
  - Redundancy or obsolescence  
  - Legislative modernization  
  - Alignment with new policy or administrative frameworks  
  - Correction of errors or inconsistencies  

**5. Contextual Considerations:**  
Without the full text of SOR/2016-29 or the original regulation being repealed, it is not possible to determine:  
- What the original section governed (e.g., workplace safety, environmental standards, election procedures)  
- The specific subject matter or impact of the repeal  
- The date or reason for the repeal (e.g., policy shift, legal amendment)

**6. Authority and Source:**  
The repeal was issued under the authority of the federal government and is published in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR), which are official sources of Canadian regulatory law.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not contain a detailed summary of an active regulation**, but rather a **notice of repeal**. It confirms that a regulation or section (originally in force) was **officially removed** by *Supplemental Regulation 2016-29, section 23*. The specific content of the repealed regulation is not included in the text, so a detailed summary of its original provisions cannot be provided. To understand the full context, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2016-29 and the original regulation that was repealed.

> ✅ Summary: The entries indicate that a regulation or section was repealed by SOR/2016-29, section 23. This means the provision is no longer in force. However, due to the absence of the original content, a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be provided. The repeal implies the removal of a prior legal requirement or rule.
