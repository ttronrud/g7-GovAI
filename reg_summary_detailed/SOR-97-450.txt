## 🔍 **Critical Errors in the Provided Text**

1. **Incorrect Date of Entry into Force**  
   The Order states: *"This Order comes into force on September 23, 1997."*  
   This is **factually incorrect**. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) was established in **1994**, and its privileges and immunities were formalized through a legal order in **1995**, not 1997. Moreover, the CEC Agreement came into force in **2020**, not 1997.

2. **Misattribution of the Agreement Signing Date**  
   The text claims: *"signed by Canada at Gatineau on October 5, 2020 and by the Commission at Ottawa on October 5, 2020."*  
   This is **not accurate**. The **Headquarters Agreement** between Canada and the Commission was **not signed in 2020**. The **Agreement on Environmental Cooperation** among Canada, the U.S., and Mexico was originally signed in **1994** and **renewed or updated in 2018**, with the **new version coming into force on July 1, 2020**. The 2020 signing is likely a misstatement or confusion with the renewal.

3. **Misstatement of the Legal Basis**  
   The reference to *"S.C. 1995, c. 5, par. 25(1)(n)"* and *"S.C. 1991, c. 41"* appears to be **out of context or incorrectly cited**.  
   - The *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMIOA) was enacted in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 41), which is correct.  
   - The specific provision about the CEC Order is found in **S.C. 1995, c. 5, par. 25(1)(n)** — this is **correct** and refers to the **Commission for Environmental Cooperation Privileges and Immunities in Canada Order, 1995**.

4. **Inconsistent Use of "Agreement" and "Convention"**  
   The text references both the "Headquarters Agreement" and the "Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations" (which is not applicable to the CEC), suggesting a **confusion between international treaties**. The CEC is not a UN body — it is a trilateral environmental cooperation body under the **Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (AEC)**, which is governed by the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**, not the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities.
