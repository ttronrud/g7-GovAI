**Detailed Summary of the Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order**

**Order Title:**  
Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order  

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order*.

---

### **Scope of Application**  
- The term *"aircraft"* in this Order includes **helicopters**.  
- The remission applies specifically to **aircraft manufactured in Canada**.  
- The remission is granted **at the time of the aircraft’s first use in Canada**.

---

### **Key Provision: Sales Tax Remission**  
Under this Order, **sales tax** (as defined under the Excise Tax Act) that would otherwise be payable on the first use of a Canadian-manufactured aircraft is **remitted or waived**.  

This means that manufacturers of aircraft (including helicopters) are **exempt from paying sales tax** on the initial use of their newly manufactured aircraft in Canada — provided certain conditions are met.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is granted **only if** the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **Exclusive Use by the Manufacturer**  
   The aircraft must be used **only by the manufacturer** of the aircraft.  
   - It cannot be used by any third party, including dealers, distributors, customers, or government agencies.  
   - The purpose of the use must be strictly limited to **demonstrating the aircraft to prospective customers** of the manufacturer.

2. **Maintenance of Complete Records**  
   The manufacturer must maintain **complete and accurate records** documenting:  
   - The use of the aircraft;  
   - The dates and times of use;  
   - The nature and purpose of each demonstration;  
   - The names of individuals or entities involved in the demonstration (e.g., prospective customers).  

   These records must be kept in a manner that ensures their authenticity and availability for audit.

3. **Availability for Inspection**  
   The manufacturer must be prepared to **produce the records upon request** by an officer of the **Department of National Revenue** (DNR), who is administering or enforcing the Excise Tax Act.  
   - The records must be provided promptly and without delay.  
   - Failure to comply with inspection requests may result in the revocation of the remission or enforcement of tax liability.

### **Legal Status and Revocation**  
- This Order was **originally issued** to provide tax relief for Canadian manufacturers in the aircraft industry, particularly during a period when demonstrating new products to potential buyers was a critical part of market entry.  
- It was **revoked** by **Statutory Instrument No. 86-58, Section 1**.  
  - This indicates that the remission provision is **no longer in effect** as of the date of the revocation.  
  - The revocation implies that **no further tax remission** is granted under this Order for aircraft manufactured in Canada.

---

### **Implications and Interpretation**  
- The Order was designed to support **domestic manufacturing** by reducing the financial burden on new aircraft introductions.  
- It emphasized **transparency and accountability**, requiring manufacturers to maintain records and allow inspection — ensuring that the remission was not abused.  
- The revocation suggests that either:  
  - The policy was deemed no longer necessary;  
  - The tax regime was restructured to apply different rules (e.g., broader excise tax rules or new incentives);  
  - The government determined that the remission did not align with current fiscal objectives.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order* was a temporary, conditional exemption from sales tax for Canadian-manufactured aircraft (including helicopters) used solely for customer demonstrations by the manufacturer. It required strict compliance with record-keeping and inspection obligations. However, the Order has been **revoked**, and therefore **no longer applies**. As such, manufacturers of aircraft in Canada must now pay the applicable sales tax on the first use of their aircraft unless another exemption or incentive is currently in force.

> **Note:** This summary reflects the historical content of the Order as originally published. Since it has been revoked, it does not currently serve as an active regulatory instrument. Any current tax treatment of aircraft in Canada should be assessed under current Excise Tax Act provisions.
