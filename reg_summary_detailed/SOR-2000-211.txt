## ⚖️ **Procedural Principles**

### 1. **Informality, Fairness, and Expediency**
- The CNSC or a designated officer may:
  - Permit or require Commission officers/employees to participate.
  - Present information, respond to questions, and question participants.
- The goal is to ensure **fair, informal, and expeditious** consideration of the matter.

### 2. **Quorum Requirements**
- **Commission-level proceedings**:
  - **3 members** constitute a quorum.
- **Panel proceedings**:
  - **1 member** for a 1- or 2-member panel.
  - **2 members** for a 3- or 4-member panel.
  - **3 members** for a panel of 5 or more members.

> ⚠️ Quorum rules are designed to ensure decision-making legitimacy without overburdening the process.

### 3. **Flexibility in Procedure**
- The Commission or designated officer may **vary or supplement** any rule to suit the circumstances.
- Any procedural issue not covered by the rules shall be resolved **informally and expeditiously**, based on fairness and context.

### 4. **Tolerance for Minor Formal Deficiencies**
- A proceeding is **not invalid** due to:
  - A minor defect in form.
  - Failure to follow a specific procedural step — **unless it causes material harm** to a relevant interest.

> 🚫 This prevents procedural delays due to technical errors.

### 5. **Waiver of Procedural Rights**
- Any participant may **waive** any procedural right granted under these rules.
- If a participant **fails to exercise** a procedural right, it is **deemed waived** in the absence of proof to the contrary.

> 💡 Encourages efficiency and participation without rigid enforcement of every procedural step.

### 6. **Time Limits**
- Time limits in orders or notices must be set to allow for **informal and expeditious** proceedings — not overly rigid or burdensome.
