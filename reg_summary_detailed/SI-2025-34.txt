**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is made under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), which grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the authority to reassign control and supervision of certain federal public administration functions.

**Key Provision:**  
The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, transfers from the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** to the **Minister for International Trade** the **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration known as the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat** (CICS).

**Detailed Interpretation:**

1. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   This is not a change in the physical or operational structure of the Secretariat, but a **reassignment of administrative authority and oversight**. The Minister for International Trade assumes responsibility for the management, policy direction, staffing, and budgetary oversight of the Secretariat.

2. **Subject of the Transfer:**  
   The **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)** is a federal entity responsible for supporting and coordinating intergovernmental relations between the federal government and the provincial and territorial governments. Its core functions typically include:
   - Facilitating meetings and discussions between federal and provincial/territorial authorities
   - Managing the agenda and logistics of intergovernmental conferences
   - Providing policy advice and coordination on shared issues (e.g., health, infrastructure, climate, or economic policy)
   - Supporting the development of intergovernmental agreements and policy frameworks

3. **Change in Oversight:**  
   Prior to this transfer, the Secretariat was under the administrative supervision of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, likely due to historical or functional alignment with public safety and emergency coordination.  
   The transfer to the **Minister for International Trade** reflects a strategic realignment aimed at enhancing coordination on cross-jurisdictional policy issues—particularly those involving trade, economic policy, and intergovernmental cooperation in areas such as market access, regulatory alignment, and economic development.

4. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reassignment of administrative control over public service entities when it is in the public interest or necessary for improved governance. This provision enables the federal government to restructure responsibilities without requiring new legislation, provided it is recommended by the Prime Minister.

5. **Effective Date and Implementation:**  
   While the regulation does not specify an effective date in the provided text, such transfers typically take effect upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and are implemented through internal government directives and administrative procedures.

6. **Implications and Rationale:**  
   - The move suggests a broader government strategy to strengthen intergovernmental coordination in economic and trade-related policy areas.
   - It may reflect the growing importance of intergovernmental collaboration in areas such as supply chain resilience, trade agreements, and economic development.
   - By placing the Secretariat under the Minister for International Trade, the federal government may aim to align intergovernmental coordination more closely with trade policy priorities and cross-jurisdictional economic planning.

7. **Statutory Reference:**  
   - Primary legislation: *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, S.C. 2003, c. 22, section 207  
   - Reference to the relevant statutory code: *R.S., c. P-34* (the *Public Service Act* or similar public service framework, though the exact reference may require confirmation in the full text)

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It transfers oversight of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat from the Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to the Ministry of International Trade. The change is intended to improve coordination between federal and provincial governments on economic and trade-related policy issues, reflecting a strategic shift in how intergovernmental affairs are managed in Canada.
