**Detailed Summary of the Excise Duty Indexing Ratio Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Source and Authority**  
The *Excise Duty Indexing Ratio Regulations* (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 68, s. 77) were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendations of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Minister of National Revenue**. This action was authorized under specific provisions of **Part V of the Schedule to the Excise Act**, namely:

- Clause 1(b)(i)(B) – for excise duties on **spirits, beer, tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes** (covered in Parts I and III of the Excise Act schedule);
- Clause 2(b)(i)(B) – for excise duties on **other specified goods** (covered in Part IV of the schedule).

These regulations provide a formal mechanism to adjust excise duty rates in response to inflation or economic changes, using a specific **indexing ratio** that is modified by multiplication factors to reflect changes in economic conditions.

---

**Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose is to **adjust excise duties** on various taxable goods—specifically spirits, beer, tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes—by applying a revised indexing ratio that accounts for inflation or economic fluctuations. This ensures that the real value of excise duties remains aligned with the cost of living and economic conditions over time.

The adjustments are not automatic or annual; they are **targeted and time-bound**, applied on specific dates to ensure stability and predictability in the tax system.

**Key Provisions and Adjustments**

### 1. **Adjustments for Excise Duties in Parts I and III of the Schedule (Spirits, Beer, Tobacco, Cigars, Cigarettes)**  
These goods are subject to the indexing ratio under **Clause 1(b)(i)(B)** of Part V of the Excise Act schedule.

- **Adjustment on September 1, 1983**:  
  The base indexing ratio is **multiplied by 1.35559**.  
  → This factor increases the duty rate by approximately **35.56%** compared to the previous ratio.

- **Adjustment on September 1, 1984**:  
  The base indexing ratio is **multiplied by 1.99924**.  
  → This factor increases the duty rate by approximately **99.92%** (nearly a 100% increase), reflecting a significant rise in economic conditions or inflation.

> **Note**: The 1.99924 multiplier is very close to 2.0, suggesting a near-doubling of the duty ratio, likely due to a major inflationary period or economic policy decision in 1984.

### 2. **Adjustments for Excise Duties in Part IV of the Schedule**  
This part typically covers **other excisable goods** (e.g., certain types of fuels, or specific manufactured products). These are subject to the indexing ratio under **Clause 2(b)(i)(B)**.

- **Adjustment on September 1, 1983**:  
  The base indexing ratio is **multiplied by 1.37078**.  
  → This results in a **37.08% increase** in the duty rate.

- **Adjustment on September 1, 1984**:  
  The base indexing ratio is **multiplied by 1.88464**.  
  → This results in an increase of approximately **88.46%**, significantly higher than the 1983 adjustment.

> **Note**: The multiplier for Part IV (1.88464) is lower than that for Part I/III (1.99924), indicating a more moderate, but still substantial, adjustment for these goods.

**Scope and Exclusions**  
- The regulations **do not apply** to:
  - Subsections 1(2) and (3) of Part I of the Excise Act;
  - Section 2 of Part I of the Excise Act.
- These exclusions suggest that certain specific duties (e.g., duties on certain imported goods or exemptions) are outside the scope of this indexing mechanism.

---

**Effective Dates**  
The adjustments take effect on **September 1, 1983**, and again on **September 1, 1984**. This means that all excise duty calculations for the respective goods must be updated using the new ratio on these dates, and the adjusted rates will be applied prospectively from that point onward.

---

**Implications and Context**  
- The significant increase in indexing ratios—especially the near-doubling in 1984—suggests that the Canadian government was responding to **high inflation** during the early 1980s, a period marked by economic volatility.
- The use of precise multipliers (e.g., 1.35559, 1.99924) indicates a **formal, data-driven approach** to adjusting excise duties, likely based on consumer price indices or other economic indicators.
- The differential treatment between Parts I/III and IV reflects different economic sensitivities or policy priorities for different types of goods.

**Legal Citation and Citation of the Regulation**  
- The regulation is formally cited as:  
  **Excise Duty Indexing Ratio Regulations**  
  (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 68, s. 77)

**Conclusion**  
The *Excise Duty Indexing Ratio Regulations* establish a clear, rule-based method for adjusting excise duties on key consumer goods—tobacco, alcohol, and other excisable products—by applying specific multipliers on September 1, 1983, and September 1, 1984. These adjustments were designed to maintain the real value of excise taxes in the face of inflation, with particularly large increases in 1984. The regulation reflects a government effort to ensure that tax revenues remain stable and equitable amid economic change, while maintaining transparency and predictability in the excise tax system.
