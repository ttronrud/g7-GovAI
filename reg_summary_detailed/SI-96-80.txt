Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided, interpreted in plain language while preserving its legal and financial significance.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Reference:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
*Issued under the Financial Administration Act, pursuant to subsection 23(2)*  
*Issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **tax relief or settlement mechanism** for certain taxpayers who participated in **"tax shelter" arrangements**—specifically, general partnerships used as **SR & ED tax shelters**—that were identified and formally addressed by the Minister of National Revenue in a **June 30, 1995 notice**.

The primary objective is to **mitigate the financial impact** on taxpayers who paid taxes based on claims involving these tax shelters, which were later found to be **non-compliant or improperly structured** under Canadian tax law. The regulation allows eligible taxpayers to receive **partial refunds** of the taxes they overpaid, with interest and compensation adjustments.

---

### **Who Is Covered?**

- **Taxpayers who are not "promoters"** (i.e., individuals or entities who initiated or organized the tax shelter).
- Taxpayers who:
  - Have **delivered or deliver** a **timely and duly executed agreement letter** to the Minister.
  - The agreement letter must have been **accepted by the Minister**.
  - The agreement must relate to a **general partnership used as a tax shelter** under the SR & ED (Savings and Retirement & Education) tax shelter scheme.

> ⚠️ *Note:* Promoters (those who created or managed the tax shelter) are **excluded** from this relief.

---

### **What Amounts Are Refunded?**

The total refund amount to each eligible taxpayer is calculated as the **sum of three components**:

---

#### **Component 1: Refund Based on Pre-Agreement Payments**

This component compensates taxpayers for **overpayments** made before the agreement was executed.

- Calculate the **difference** between:
  - **(a)** 50% of the product of:
    - Each payment made **before** the agreement was signed,
    - And the **tax liability resulting from adjustments** made by the Minister to the taxpayer’s claim (i.e., the revised tax amount after audit or review),
    - Multiplied by the **prescribed rate of interest for income tax refunds**,
    - Compounded **daily**,
    - For the period from the **date of the payment** to the **date of the tax assessment** (the date the Minister finalized the tax liability based on the agreement).

  - **(b)** The **refund interest** that would have been due on that same payment.

> So, Component 1 = 50% × [(a) – (b)]

This ensures that only **half of the overpayment interest** (after adjusting for the actual refund interest) is refunded.

---

#### **Component 2: Refund Based on Post-Agreement Period**

This component compensates for the **time between the assessment date and the implementation date** of this Order.

- Calculate 50% of the product of:
  - The **difference** from Component 1,
  - And the **same prescribed interest rate**,
  - Compounded **daily**,
  - For the period from the **date of assessment** to the **date this Order is implemented**.

> So, Component 2 = 50% × [Difference from Component 1] × Interest Rate × (Days between assessment and implementation), compounded daily.

This component provides **additional compensation** for the time delay between when the tax liability was assessed and when the refund is actually made.

---

#### **Component 3: Additional Compensation for No Refund or No Order**

This component accounts for **lost benefits** that would not have occurred if:
- There had been **no refund interest**, or
- This Order **had not been made at all**.

In other words, it ensures that taxpayers receive **a fair share of the benefit** they would have otherwise lost due to the absence of a refund mechanism.

> This component is a **"loss of benefit" or "equity adjustment"** to ensure fairness in the absence of a refund system.

---

### **Key Features and Implications**

1. **Partial Refund Only**:  
   The refund is **not a full refund** of the overpayment. Only **50%** of the interest-based difference is returned in each component. This reflects a compromise to balance public interest with the need to recover tax revenue.

2. **Interest Compounded Daily**:  
   The use of **daily compounding** ensures that interest accumulates accurately over time, reflecting the true cost of delayed payment.

3. **Time-Based Calculation**:  
   The refund is tied to specific time periods:
   - From **payment to assessment** (pre-agreement),
   - From **assessment to implementation** (post-agreement).

4. **Focus on Non-Promoters**:  
   The regulation protects taxpayers who were **not involved in creating** the tax shelter, avoiding a direct penalty on those who may have been misled or unaware of the structure.

5. **Public Interest Justification**:  
   The Governor General acts on the recommendation of the Minister, citing **public interest** as the basis for the remittance. This suggests the government recognizes the potential for **unfair financial burden** on individuals caught in flawed tax shelter schemes.

6. **Legal Authority**:  
   The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to make administrative decisions on tax matters when in the public interest.

### **Practical Example (Simplified)**

Suppose a taxpayer:
- Made a payment of $10,000 on January 1, 1995.
- The Minister later adjusted the tax liability to $15,000 (a $5,000 overpayment).
- The interest rate is 5% per year (daily compounded).
- The assessment date was March 1, 1995.
- This Order is implemented on January 1, 1996.

**Component 1 (pre-assessment)**:
- Difference = 50% × ($5,000 × 5% annual interest, daily compounded from Jan 1 to Mar 1)
- Assume daily compounding yields ~$120 interest → 50% × $120 = **$60**

**Component 2 (post-assessment)**:
- 50% × $60 × 5% interest, daily compounded from Mar 1 to Jan 1, 1996 (300 days)
- Assume compounding yields ~$40 → 50% × $40 = **$20**

**Component 3 (loss of benefit)**:
- Estimated at $10 (to cover lost opportunity cost or equity)

**Total Refund** = $60 + $20 + $10 = **$90**

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a **targeted tax relief measure** for non-promoters involved in specific tax shelter arrangements (SR & ED partnerships) that were later found to be non-compliant. It provides a structured, interest-based, and time-sensitive refund mechanism that:

- Acknowledges the financial harm caused by flawed tax shelters,
- Balances the public interest in tax compliance with fairness to affected taxpayers,
- Avoids full refunding of overpayments to prevent revenue loss,
- Ensures transparency and consistency through daily interest compounding and clear calculation rules.

It is a key example of how Canadian tax administration uses **administrative relief orders** to correct past errors in a fair and legally grounded manner.

---

**Note**: This regulation is **historical** in nature, as it was issued in 1991 and applies to tax shelters identified in 1995. It may no longer be actively enforced or updated, but it remains a significant precedent in Canadian tax administration. Modern tax shelter enforcement and settlements are likely governed by updated policies and regulations.
