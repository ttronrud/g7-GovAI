**Detailed Summary of the Portions of the Public Service General Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Portions of the Public Service General Divestiture Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency, the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under **paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**. This provision grants the government the authority to make regulations governing the transition of public service employees to new employers through divestiture agreements.

The regulation is published under:
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, para. 225(z.19)**  
- **R.S., c. P-36** (the Public Service Superannuation Act)

This regulation specifically addresses the **superannuation rights and benefits** of public service employees who transition from the federal public service to a **new employer** as part of a government divestiture — a process where certain public service functions are transferred to private or semi-private entities (e.g., through privatization or outsourcing).

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, which governs the pension and superannuation rights of federal public service employees.

2. **New Employer**  
   A person or entity that, through a formal agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, assumes the responsibilities and activities previously carried out by a portion of the public service.  
   → This could include a private company, a Crown corporation, or another public body that takes over specific government functions.

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

- **Applies to**:  
  A person who **ceases to be employed in the public service** and **becomes employed by a new employer** after the regulations come into force.

- **Does NOT apply to**:  
  - A person who becomes **re-employed** by the new employer (i.e., re-hires after a period of employment elsewhere).  
  - Survivors or children of a person who has already received a **return of contributions** or exercised an **option for transfer value** under the Act.

> Thus, the regulation only applies to **first-time transitions** from public service to a new employer.

---

### **Exclusions from Specific Provisions of the Act**

Certain sections of the Public Service Superannuation Act do **not apply** to individuals in this transitional scenario:

- **Sections 4 to 6** (which deal with return of contributions and options for early retirement or transfer value) **do not apply** to:
  - The **survivor** or **children** of a person who has:
    - Already received a return of contributions, or
    - Already exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the Act.

> This means that once a survivor or child has already claimed a benefit under these provisions, they are not subject to the new rules regarding return of contributions or transfer options.

---

### **Application of Sections 12 to 13.01 of the Act**

- These sections govern **pensions, death benefits, and survivor benefits**.
- The regulations state that these provisions **only apply to the individual on or after the day they cease to be employed in the public service**.

> In other words, once an employee leaves the public service and joins a new employer, the pension rules (such as retirement age, pensionable service, and benefit entitlements) are applied **from that date onward** — not retroactively or before the transition.

---

### **Special Provisions for Return of Contributions and Transfer Options**

Despite the general exclusion, **a key exception** is provided:

- If, **without these regulations**, a person would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
  - Subsection **12(3)** (return of contributions upon leaving service), or  
  - Subsection **12.1(4)** (return of contributions under certain conditions),  
  then the person may **request a return of contributions in writing within one year** of ceasing public service employment and joining the new employer.

- Similarly, if the person would have been entitled to **exercise an option for transfer value** under **section 13.01** (which allows employees to transfer their superannuation value to a new employer), they may **exercise that option within the same one-year period**.

> This ensures that individuals who would otherwise have had a right to a return of contributions or a transfer option are not deprived of that right due to the transition to a new employer.

---

### **Survivor and Children Benefits**

The regulations provide **continued entitlements** to key benefits for the **survivors and children** of a public service employee who dies while employed by the new employer:

- They are entitled to **one of the following**, as if the employee had remained in the public service:
  1. The **death benefit** under:
     - Subsection **12(8)** or **12.1(8)** of the Act (for pension or survivor benefits).
  2. The **allowances** under:
     - Subsection **13(3)** or **13.001(3)** of the Act (e.g., survivor’s allowances).

> This ensures that the family of a deceased employee continues to receive protection under the public service pension scheme, even if the employee worked for a new employer after transitioning from the public service.

---

### **Interpretive Provisions (Key Clarifications)**

To ensure consistency with the Act, the regulation includes several **interpretive rules**:

1. **Deemed Cessation of Employment (Section 26(2) of the Act)**  
   A person is **deemed to have ceased being employed in the public service** on the day they **cease to be employed by the new employer**.  
   → This simplifies the administrative process for determining the end of public service employment.

2. **One-Year Period for Claims (Section 10(5) of the Act)**  
   The one-year period for making claims under section 10(5) (e.g., for return of contributions or transfer options) **begins on the day the person ceases to be employed by the new employer**.  
   → This aligns the timeline with the actual date of transition.

3. **Pensionable Service and Age for Benefit Calculations**  
   - **Pensionable service** includes the period that begins on the day the person **ceases to be employed in the public service** and ends on the day they **cease to be employed by the new employer**.  
   - The **age** used for benefit calculations (e.g., retirement age) is the person’s age **on the day they cease to be employed in the public service**.

> These provisions ensure that the transition period is treated as a **relevant period of service** for pension purposes, even though it occurs outside the traditional public service employment.

---

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).  
This is a standard administrative practice to ensure legal certainty and allow for proper implementation.

### **Summary of Key Impacts and Objectives**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Facilitate Transition** | Enables a smooth transfer of public service employees to new employers without disrupting their superannuation rights. |
| **Preserve Employee Benefits** | Ensures that employees and their families retain access to key benefits (death benefits, survivor allowances, return of contributions). |
| **Clarify Timing and Entitlements** | Defines clear cut-off dates and periods for pensionable service, age, and benefit claims. |
| **Prevent Benefit Loss** | Protects individuals who would have otherwise been entitled to a return of contributions or transfer value. |
| **Maintain Equity** | Ensures that survivors and dependents are not disadvantaged by a change in employment status. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Portions of the Public Service General Divestiture Regulations* serve as a **critical bridge** between the public service and new private or semi-public employers. They ensure that:

- Employees transitioning out of the public service do not lose access to essential superannuation rights.
- Survivors and dependents retain key benefits.
- The timing and calculation of pensionable service, age, and benefit entitlements are clearly defined.
- The transition process is governed by fair, predictable, and equitable rules.

These regulations are essential for maintaining **employee trust, financial security, and continuity of benefits** during government divestiture activities.

--- 

**Note**: These regulations are part of a broader framework under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* to manage workforce transitions in a way that respects both public service obligations and employee rights.
