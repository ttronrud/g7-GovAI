**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation:**  
S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
**Title:** Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act  
**Provision:** Section 207  
**Date of Effect:** February 6, 2006  
**Issuing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister

**Summary:**

This regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative control and supervision within the federal public service under the authority granted by paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

Specifically, the regulation provides that:

- The **control and supervision** of the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)** — a key federal entity responsible for supporting and managing intergovernmental cooperation between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments — is being **transferred** from the **Prime Minister** to the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.

- This transfer is effective as of **February 6, 2006**.

**Context and Purpose:**

The Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat plays a central role in facilitating coordination, communication, and decision-making among the federal government and the provinces and territories on matters of shared responsibility. It supports the functioning of the *Canadian Intergovernmental Conference*, which is the formal mechanism through which federal and provincial governments negotiate on policy issues such as health, education, infrastructure, and natural resources.

Prior to this transfer, the Secretariat was under the direct oversight of the Prime Minister, reflecting its strategic importance in national governance. However, the shift to the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** — a senior public service official who serves as the head of the federal executive branch and oversees the administration of government departments and agencies — was intended to:

1. **Improve institutional accountability** by placing the Secretariat within a more formal and structured public service governance framework.
2. **Enhance administrative stability** by aligning the Secretariat with broader public service leadership and policy coordination.
3. **Promote transparency and consistency** in intergovernmental relations by ensuring that intergovernmental coordination is managed through a respected and neutral administrative authority.
4. **Reflect a broader reorganization** of federal public service responsibilities aimed at improving efficiency and clarity in government operations.

**Legal Basis:**

The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign control over specific parts of the federal public service, including administrative functions and oversight responsibilities.

This provision allows for strategic reallocations of duties to better serve government objectives, improve performance, or ensure better alignment with institutional roles and responsibilities.

---

**Implications:**

- The **Prime Minister** no longer has direct control over the day-to-day operations or policy direction of the CICS.
- The **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** now assumes responsibility for the Secretariat’s strategic direction, staffing, budget, and coordination with other government departments and levels of government.
- The Secretariat continues to serve as a critical facilitator of intergovernmental cooperation, but now operates under a more institutionalized and publicly accountable structure.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal government’s structure. By transferring control of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat from the Prime Minister to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, the government aimed to strengthen institutional governance, improve accountability, and ensure more consistent and transparent intergovernmental collaboration. The change underscores the importance of institutionalizing key public service functions to support effective federal-provincial relations.
