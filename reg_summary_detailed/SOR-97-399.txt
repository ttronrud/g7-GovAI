The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2014-293, section 11**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Date/Action**: It was repealed effective as part of **SOR/2014-293**, which is a **Supplemental Order Respecting the Repeal of Certain Regulations** issued by the Government of Canada in 2014.
- **Section Cited**: The repeal is specifically attributed to **Section 11** of that order.
- **Repeal Purpose**: Section 11 of SOR/2014-293 lists specific regulations that are no longer in force. The repeated citations suggest that the regulation in question was one of those targeted for removal, likely due to being obsolete, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or policy.

### Important Notes:
- Since the regulation is **repealed**, it is **no longer legally enforceable** or applicable.
- There is **no substantive content** provided in the original text (e.g., definitions, requirements, penalties) to summarize, as the only information available is the repealing notice.
- The repetition of the same line eight times appears to be a formatting or data entry error and does not add additional legal or substantive content.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially removed from the legal framework** through **SOR/2014-293, section 11**. As such, it is **no longer in effect**, and any references to it in legal or administrative contexts are outdated. For current regulatory information, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, if any, that may have replaced it.

> 🔍 Recommendation: To understand what regulation was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of **SOR/2014-293**, specifically **Section 11**, which would list the names or numbers of the repealed regulations. Without that full text, a detailed summary of the original regulation cannot be provided.
