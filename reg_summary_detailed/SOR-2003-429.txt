**Detailed Summary of the Transfer of the Customs Services Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA), specifically **paragraph 36(1)(b)**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer certain public service functions or responsibilities among different divisions or branches of the Public Service, including those within the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA).  

This transfer is not a reorganization of the entire agency but a targeted adjustment to clarify the employment and administrative responsibilities of specific units within the CCRA, particularly those involved in customs operations and enforcement.

**2. Scope of Applicability – Who Is Affected**  
Subsections **37.3(1) and (37.3(2))** of the *Public Service Employment Act* apply to all individuals who are employed or engaged in the following designated portions of the Public Service within the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA):

- **The Customs Branch**  
  This includes all staff involved in the day-to-day operations of customs, such as border inspections, enforcement, and compliance activities.

- **The Customs Operations Division of the Investigations Directorate, Compliance Programs Branch**  
  This division is responsible for investigating potential violations of customs laws and regulations. Staff in this unit are involved in compliance monitoring, risk assessment, and enforcement actions related to customs policy breaches.

- **The Customs Appeal Directorate of the Appeals Branch**  
  This unit handles appeals from individuals or entities who have disputes with customs decisions—such as penalties, seizures, or administrative rulings. The regulation ensures that employees in this division are subject to the same employment standards and protections under the PSEA.

- **That portion within each of the Agency’s regional divisions responsible for the administration of the Customs program, other than the portions related to collections**  
  Regional divisions of the CCRA are responsible for implementing customs policies at the local level. This provision specifically includes only those parts of regional divisions that administer customs programs (e.g., enforcement, compliance, inspections), **excluding** functions related to **collections** (such as tax assessments or revenue recovery). This exclusion ensures that collection staff, which may fall under different employment or operational frameworks, are not included in this transfer.

**3. Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- Clarify the employment status and rights of staff within key customs operational and compliance units.
- Ensure consistency in the application of public service employment standards across the CCRA.
- Align staffing and operational responsibilities with the broader goals of transparency, accountability, and efficiency in customs enforcement and compliance.
- Provide a clear legal framework for the transfer of responsibilities and the application of employment rules, especially in relation to staffing, promotion, and protection from unfair treatment.

---

**4. Effective Date**  
These regulations come into force on **December 12, 2003**. This date marks the official start of the application of subsections 37.3(1) and (37.3(2)) to the specified units within the CCRA. All employees in the affected units must comply with the employment standards set out in the PSEA from this date forward.

---

**5. Key Implications**  
- Employees in the listed units are now governed by the same employment rights and obligations as other public servants under the PSEA, including protections against unfair dismissal, fair procedures in disciplinary actions, and eligibility for certain benefits and career development opportunities.
- The exclusion of collection-related functions from the scope ensures that revenue collection staff are not subject to the same employment regime, reflecting the distinct nature and operational focus of collection duties.
- The regulation enhances administrative clarity and accountability by defining which parts of the CCRA are subject to the broader public service employment framework.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a targeted administrative and employment policy adjustment within the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. By applying specific employment provisions to key customs operational and compliance units—while excluding collection functions—it ensures that staff involved in enforcement, investigations, appeals, and program administration are protected under consistent public service standards. The regulation strengthens the integrity and fairness of employment practices within the customs sector and supports the broader objectives of public service accountability and operational effectiveness.  

Effective as of **December 12, 2003**.
