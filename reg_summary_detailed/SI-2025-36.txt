### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**, in accordance with **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (P.S.R.T.D.A.).

This provision allows for the reallocation of powers, duties, and functions among federal ministers in the Public Service, typically to reflect changes in government priorities, organizational structure, or policy focus.

---

#### **2. Key Provision**
The regulation transfers certain **powers, duties, and functions** related to:

- The **Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA)**  
- The **Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA)**

from the **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** (and Associate Minister of Health)  
to the **Minister of Health**.

---

#### **3. Background and Context**
This transfer follows a prior administrative reorganization established by **Order in Council P.C. 2022-549**, issued on **May 26, 2022**.

- In that earlier order, powers and responsibilities related to the CDSA and TVPA were **initially transferred** to the **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** and the **Associate Minister of Health**.
- The current regulation is a **subsequent adjustment** that reassigns those responsibilities back to the **Minister of Health**, reflecting a shift in how these health-related policy areas are administered.

This reallocation is likely intended to:
- Strengthen the integration of mental health and substance use policy within the broader public health framework.
- Ensure that regulatory oversight of drugs (including controlled substances and tobacco/vaping products) is centralized under the **Minister of Health**, which has broader authority over public health policy and enforcement.

---

#### **4. Legal Basis and References**
The regulation is grounded in several key legislative and statutory references:

- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This section of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* provides the legal mechanism for transferring ministerial responsibilities.
- **R.S., c. P-34**: Refers to the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*, which governs the regulation of drugs and substances that are controlled under Canadian law.
- **S.C. 1996, c. 19**: Likely refers to the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act* (or related predecessor legislation) or foundational health policy frameworks.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 13; S.C. 2018, c. 9, s. 2**: These may relate to amendments or updates to the CDSA or related regulatory frameworks, particularly concerning substance use and public health policy.
- **SI/2022-31**: The **Statutory Instrument** issued on May 26, 2022, which formally transferred the powers and functions to the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. This instrument is the **predecessor** to the current transfer and provides the factual basis for the reallocation.

---

#### **5. Implications of the Transfer**
- **Minister of Health** will now have full responsibility for:
  - Enforcing the **Controlled Drugs and Substances Act** (including licensing, regulation, and prosecution of drug-related offenses).
  - Regulating **tobacco and vaping products** (including product safety, advertising, age restrictions, and marketing rules).
- The **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** will no longer have direct regulatory authority over these areas, though they may continue to provide policy guidance or support in mental health and addiction services.
- This centralization may improve coordination between public health policy and substance use regulation, aligning enforcement with broader health outcomes.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale**
The transfer aims to:
- Improve interdepartmental coordination between health and substance use policy.
- Ensure that regulatory functions are aligned with the Minister of Health’s broader mandate for public health protection.
- Reflect a strategic shift in government structure to streamline decision-making and enforcement in substance use and public health policy.

#### **7. Effective Date and Implementation**
While not explicitly stated in the text, such transfers typically take effect immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* or upon the issuance of the statutory instrument. The effective date is generally the date of publication in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, which is standard for such regulatory actions.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **restructuring of ministerial responsibilities** within the federal government’s health portfolio. It moves the regulatory oversight of **controlled drugs and tobacco/vaping products** from the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions to the **Minister of Health**, based on the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The change enhances administrative coherence and aligns substance use regulation with broader public health objectives under the Minister of Health’s jurisdiction.
