**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Claims (People’s Republic of China) Settlement Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Foreign Claims (People’s Republic of China) Settlement Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established by the Government of Canada to govern the determination and payment of certain private property claims against the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These regulations were enacted under **Vote 22a of Schedule B to Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**, and were made pursuant to the **Agreement between Canada and the PRC concerning the settlement of private property claims**, signed on **August 20, 1981**, in Beijing (commonly referred to as the "Accord").

The primary objective of these regulations is to provide a structured, fair, and legally grounded process for Canadian citizens to seek compensation for losses incurred due to government actions—such as expropriation, intervention, or state disposition—of property in China between **October 1, 1949**, and **August 20, 1981**.

The regulations define the eligibility criteria, procedural requirements, limits on awards, and the mechanisms for payment from the **Foreign Claims Fund**, ensuring that compensation is both equitable and financially sustainable.

- The rights to the property in question must have been **held continuously by a Canadian citizen** from the date the claim arose until October 20, 1981.

## **Commission’s Role and Reporting Process**

### 1. **Report Submission**
- The **Chief Commissioner** must submit a detailed report to the **Minister of External Affairs** and the **Minister of Finance** for each claim considered.
- The report must include:
  - Whether the claimant is eligible for an award.
  - The recommended amount of the award (if any).
- The report must take into account:
  - Canadian law
  - Chinese law
  - International law
  - These regulations

### 2. **Flexible Reporting (Postponement Exception)**
- The Chief Commissioner may submit a report **early** if delay would cause undue hardship or delay in processing.

### 3. **Distribution of Reports**
- Upon approval by both Ministers, a copy of the report is sent to the claimant.

---

## **Award Limits and Proportional Payments**

### 1. **Maximum Award per Claim**
- The Commission **cannot recommend an award exceeding $100,000** for any individual or claim.

### 2. **Corporate Claims – Proportional Award**
- For a Canadian-owned corporation, the award is limited to the proportion of the total issued share capital that was **beneficially held by Canadian citizens** at:
  - The date the claim arose, **or**
  - October 20, 1981 — whichever is **lesser**.

> Example: If a company had 100,000 shares, with 40,000 held by Canadians at the time of the claim, the award is capped at 40% of the total recommended amount.

### 3. **Offsetting Compensation from Other Sources**
- If a claimant receives or is likely to receive compensation from **any source other than the Fund** (e.g., from the PRC, private settlement, or insurance), the Commission must **deduct that amount** from the recommended award.
- **Exception**: If the claimant **neglected or failed** to receive such compensation, the deduction applies **as if** the compensation had already been received.

> This ensures that compensation from external sources does not double-dip.

---

## **Payment Mechanisms and Fund Sources**

### 1. **Source of Funds**
Awards are paid from the **part of the Foreign Claims Fund** that includes:
- Money received from the PRC under **Articles I and III of the Agreement**, credited to the Fund under the Vote.
- Money transferred to the Fund under **Section 13**.
- Any interest accrued on the above funds.

### 2. **Transfer from War Claims Fund**
- The Minister of Finance shall transfer to the Foreign Claims Fund the **remaining balance** of the portion of the **War Claims Fund** (established in 1952) related to property of Chinese residents that was previously vested in the **Custodian of Enemy Property** during WWII.

> This provides a secondary funding pool to support claims.

---

## **Payment in Cases of Insufficient Funds**

If the funds in the designated portion of the Fund are **insufficient to pay all awards in full**:

1. **Each award** is paid:
   - The **full amount**, **or**
   - **$5,000**, whichever is **lesser**.

2. Any **remaining unpaid balances** are paid on a **pro rata basis** from any remaining funds in the Fund.

> This ensures that **no claimant is left uncompensated**, even if the Fund is underfunded.

---

## **Payment Terms and Installments**

- Awards may be paid in **one or more installments**, depending on:
  - The amount of available funds in the Fund.
  - The potential size of future awards (including those still under review).
- The decision rests with the **Minister of Finance**, based on financial and administrative feasibility.

---

## **Conditions for Award (Assignment or Undertaking)**

As a condition for receiving an award, the Commission may recommend (or the Minister may require) that the claimant:
- **Assign** their right to compensation from a source **other than the Fund** to the Government of Canada (Her Majesty in right of Canada); **or**
- If assignment is not possible, provide a **written undertaking** to do all necessary acts to transfer those rights to the Government.

> This ensures that the Government of Canada has a clear and enforceable claim to any compensation already received from the PRC or elsewhere.

---

## **Final Provisions**

### 1. **No Right to Award by Recommendation**
- A recommendation by the Commission **does not create a legal right** to an award.
- The final decision on payment rests with the **Minister and Minister of Finance**, who determine:
  - How much of the recommended award will be paid from the Fund.
  - To whom (if the claimant has died) the award will be paid.

### 2. **Pre-Payment Requirement**
- Before making any payment, the **Minister of Finance must obtain a release** (in a form satisfactory to him) from the claimant, confirming the claim and waiving any further claims against the PRC or third parties.
