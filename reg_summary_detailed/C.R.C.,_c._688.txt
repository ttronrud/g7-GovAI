**Detailed Summary of the Defence Maps and Charts Transfer Order**

**Title:**  
Defence Maps and Charts Transfer Order

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to authorize the Minister of National Defence to transfer certain defence-related geographic materials—specifically maps, charts, reproductions of maps and charts, and related publications and documents—gratuitously to other Canadian governments. The transfer is intended to serve the public interest by promoting the sharing of critical geographic information among federal, provincial, and territorial authorities for use in planning, safety, environmental management, and other public services.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority of the Minister of National Defence:**  
   The Minister of National Defence is granted the power to initiate and approve the transfer of defence-related maps, charts, and related materials. This authority is not automatic but is exercised only when the Minister determines that such a transfer would serve the public interest.

2. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer includes:
   - Original or reproduced maps and charts
   - Map and chart reproduction materials
   - Related publications and documents that are connected to or derived from defence mapping activities

3. **Value Limitation:**  
   The total value of all materials transferred in a single calendar year is strictly capped at **$75,000 CAD**. This cap ensures that the transfer remains within a reasonable financial and administrative boundary, preventing excessive or uncontrolled dissemination of sensitive materials.

4. **Gratuitous Nature of Transfer:**  
   The transfer is made **free of charge**. No monetary compensation is required from the receiving government or entity. This reflects the policy intention to promote public access and intergovernmental cooperation without financial burden.

5. **Public Interest Requirement:**  
   The Minister must assess and justify that the transfer will serve the **public interest**. This includes considerations such as:
   - Improved access to geographic data for public safety, infrastructure planning, or environmental monitoring
   - Support for regional or provincial government operations
   - Enhanced coordination between levels of government in areas like transportation, emergency response, or land use planning

6. **Scope of Recipients:**  
   The regulation allows transfers to **other governments**, which includes:
   - Provincial governments
   - Territorial governments  
   (Note: The regulation does not explicitly mention municipalities or Indigenous governments, so transfers are limited to other levels of government within the Canadian federal structure.)

7. **No Requirement for Prior Approval Beyond Ministerial Judgment:**  
   While the Minister must assess public interest, the regulation does not specify a formal review process or external oversight. The decision rests solely with the Minister of National Defence, providing flexibility but also implying a responsibility to act in a transparent and accountable manner.

**Implications and Context:**

- This Order facilitates **intergovernmental cooperation** by enabling provincial and territorial authorities to access valuable geographic intelligence previously held by the federal government.
- It supports **open data principles** in a controlled and secure manner, ensuring sensitive defence information is not broadly disseminated.
- The annual $75,000 cap provides a clear financial threshold, helping to manage risks related to data sensitivity, cost, and potential misuse.
- The order operates under the broader framework of national defence policy and information management, balancing national security with public service needs.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

- The regulation does not cover the transfer of classified or sensitive defence information. It applies only to non-classified or declassified maps and charts.
- The Minister retains discretion in determining what constitutes "public interest," which may lead to subjectivity in decision-making.
- There is no requirement for public disclosure of transfer decisions, which may limit transparency.

**Conclusion:**  
The Defence Maps and Charts Transfer Order is a targeted, flexible, and financially constrained mechanism that enables the federal government to share non-sensitive geographic data with provincial and territorial governments. By allowing gratuitous transfers of maps and related materials up to a value of $75,000 annually, the Order promotes efficient use of geographic information across Canada while safeguarding national security interests. Its effectiveness depends on the Minister’s judgment in assessing public benefit and ensuring responsible stewardship of defence-related materials.
