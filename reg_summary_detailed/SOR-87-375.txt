### **Detailed Summary of the Dawson Creek Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Dawson Creek Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada to ensure the safe and efficient operation of **Dawson Creek Airport** in British Columbia. These regulations define spatial restrictions on land use around the airport to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases. The regulations were developed following a public consultation process and were officially adopted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations are made under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Minister of Transport to establish zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **September 27, 1986**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections.
- **Final Adoption**: After review, the regulations were formally enacted by the Governor General in Council, based on the Minister’s recommendation.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the Dawson Creek Airport located in the Peace River-Liard Regional District, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial measurements. It is marked by a brass monument in concrete. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 06–24). These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility and unobstructed flight paths during approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if that would be less than 9 meters). This defines the upper boundary of the zone where no structures may exceed this height. |
| **Strip** | The main runway and associated landing area (300 m wide, 1,948.9 m long), centered on Runway 06–24. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface. This ensures smooth transitions between the runway and the outer zone. |

---

## **3. Elevation Datum**

- The **assigned elevation** of the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **653.8 meters above sea level**.
- All other surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are measured relative to this point.

---

## **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to all lands:

1. **Within the outer limits** of the lands described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.
2. **Directly beneath** any portion of the approach surfaces that extend beyond the outer limits.

> This includes public road allowances adjacent to the airport, meaning even roads and public spaces near the airport are subject to these height restrictions.

---

## **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

**No person may construct or erect** any building, structure, object, or addition to an existing structure on regulated land **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surface**,
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

> These surfaces are designed to maintain clear visual lines of sight for pilots during critical phases of flight (e.g., landing and takeoff).

---

## **6. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land **exceeds the elevation of any of the defined surfaces**, the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:
  - Remove the excessive portion of the growth, or
  - Prune or otherwise manage it to bring it within allowable limits.

> This provision ensures that even natural features do not interfere with flight safety.

---

## **7. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier may use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that:
  - Is **edible by birds**, or
  - Is **attractive to birds**.

> This rule is critical to prevent bird strikes, which pose a serious threat to aircraft safety.

---

## **8. Location of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- Located **76.492 meters south and perpendicular** to the centerline of Runway 06–24.
- Measured from a point **784.035 meters west** along the runway centerline from the end of Runway 24.
- **UTM Coordinates**:  
  - North: 6,180,705.080  
  - East: 676,910.156  
- This point serves as the origin for all elevation and spatial measurements in the regulations.

---

## **9. Description of Approach Surfaces**

Each approach surface is defined by its slope and horizontal extent:

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Runway 06** (approach from the west) | - Inclined plane with 1:50 slope (1 meter rise per 50 meters run)<br>- Rises to a horizontal line 15,000 meters from the end of the runway<br>- Outer ends of this line are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline<br>- This horizontal line is 300 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway |
| **Runway 24** (approach from the east) | - Inclined plane with 1:40 slope (1 meter rise per 40 meters run)<br>- Rises to a horizontal line 3,000 meters from the end of the runway<br>- Outer ends are 600 meters from the runway centerline<br>- This horizontal line is 75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring unobstructed visibility.

---

## **10. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located **45 meters above the ARP elevation (653.8 m)** → **698.8 m above sea level**.
- **Exception**: If 45 meters above ground would be less than 9 meters, then the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface defines the upper limit for all structures and natural features.

---

## **11. Strip Dimensions**

- **Length**: 1,948.9 meters
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline)
- This strip is associated with **Runway 06–24**, which is the primary runway at the airport.

---

## **12. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Slope: **1:7** (1 meter rise per 7 meters run).
- Extends upward and outward until it intersects with the **outer surface**.
- Ensures a gradual transition between the runway area and the outer zone, avoiding abrupt changes in terrain or structure height.

---

## **13. Boundary of Outer Limits (Legal Description)**

The outer boundary of the regulated zone is defined in a detailed, legal description that follows a precise path through parcels, streets, and property lines. Key features include:

- Starts at the **southeast corner of the north half of Section 3, Township 78, Range 15, W of 6th Meridian**.
- Progresses through a series of directional movements and intersections with:
  - Runway approach surfaces (06 and 24)
  - Major roads: 116th Avenue, 8th Street, 107th Avenue, 106th Avenue
  - Property plans: Plan 8586, 7353, 23597, 26535, 5526, 21051, 6423, 14192, 23044
  - Railways and roads (e.g., Plan A-754)
- Ends at the **northwest corner of Parcel A (A9434)** and returns to the starting point.

> This boundary defines the **geographic extent** of the regulated zone and ensures that all land within it is subject to the zoning rules.

## **14. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Flight Safety**: To prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.
2. **Visual Clearance**: To maintain clear visibility for pilots, especially during low-visibility or night operations.
3. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**: To reduce the risk of bird strikes by banning the disposal of food or attractive waste.
4. **Consistency with Planning**: To align with the official **Dawson Creek Airport Zoning Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1690**, dated November 23, 1984, which provides the spatial and design basis for the regulation.

---

## **15. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of vegetation exceeding height limits.
  - Enforce compliance with waste disposal rules.
- Violations may
