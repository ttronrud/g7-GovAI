**Detailed Summary of the Oshawa Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1976-77, c. 28, s. 2 and 49)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Oshawa Airport Zoning Regulations* were approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **Section 6** of the *Aeronautics Act*. These regulations establish strict spatial and elevation controls around **Oshawa Airport** in the Regional Municipality of Durham, Ontario, to ensure aviation safety by minimizing obstacles that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.

The regulations define key geometric surfaces and boundaries to control the height of structures, natural features, and land use in the vicinity of the airport. They are designed to prevent visual and physical obstructions that could compromise flight safety, particularly during critical phases of flight.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Oshawa Airport, located near Oshawa, in the Regional Municipality of Durham, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to establish elevation and horizontal coordinates. Located 49.13 m south of a point 518.62 m west of the eastern end of runway 12-30. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of runways 12–30 and 04–22. Designed to ensure clear visibility for pilots during approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, with a minimum of **9 meters above ground level** where terrain is lower. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area (runway and adjacent surface) for each runway direction. Includes runways 12–30 and 04–22. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 135 meters above sea level.

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) adjacent to or in the vicinity of Oshawa Airport, as precisely described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. This includes both private and public properties within the designated boundary.

---

### **Prohibited Actions – Height Restrictions**

No person may:

1. **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (or add to an existing one) such that:
   - The **highest point** of that object exceeds:
     - The **approach surface** of any strip;
     - The **outer surface**;
     - The **transitional surface**.

> This restriction applies to all points on the land, meaning even small structures or towers must not rise above these defined surfaces.

2. **Allow natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) to exceed any of the above surfaces:
   - If a natural object exceeds the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This ensures that vegetation does not create visual or physical hazards during flight operations.

3. **Use land for waste disposal** that is:
   - **Edible by birds** or
   - **Attractive to birds**

> This provision is critical for **bird hazard mitigation**, as bird strikes are a major aviation safety risk. Prohibiting such waste helps prevent bird accumulation near runways and approach paths.

### **Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

#### **1. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at:
  - 518.62 m west of the **eastern end of runway 12–30**, measured along its centerline.
  - 49.13 m south of that point, measured at right angles to the centerline.
- Elevation: **135 meters above sea level**.

#### **2. Approach Surfaces**
Each approach surface is an inclined plane rising from the end of a runway strip to a horizontal line at a specified height and distance.

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Runway 12 (approach)** | - Inclined plane: 1:50 slope (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)<br> - Rises to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end of the strip<br> - Outer ends: 2,400 m from centerline<br> - Horizontal line: 300 m above elevation at the end of the strip |
| **Runway 30 (approach)** | - Same as 12: 1:50 slope, 15,000 m distance, 2,400 m outer ends, 300 m above strip elevation |
| **Runway 04 (approach)** | - 1:50 slope<br> - Rises to horizontal line 2,500 m from end of strip<br> - Outer ends: 325 m from centerline<br> - Horizontal line: 50 m above strip elevation |
| **Runway 22 (approach)** | - Same as 04: 1:50 slope, 2,500 m distance, 325 m outer ends, 50 m above strip elevation |

> These surfaces are designed to provide a safe "clear zone" for pilots during final approach, especially in low visibility or adverse weather.

#### **3. Outer Surface**
- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (i.e., 180 meters above sea level)**.
- **Exception**: Where the ground is lower than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- Ensures a consistent, safe clearance zone extending outward from the airport.

#### **4. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surface.
- Slope: **1:7** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extends upward and outward until it intersects with:
  - The outer surface, or
  - The transitional surface of an adjacent runway strip (e.g., between 12–30 and 04–22).

> These surfaces prevent obstructions from appearing in the blind zones between strips and ensure a continuous safe zone around the airport.

#### **5. Boundary of the Outer Limits of Lands**
The regulatory boundary is a complex, precisely defined polygon described in **Part VI of the Schedule**, using coordinate-based directions and distances. Key features include:

- Starts at the **southwesterly corner of Lot 24, Concession 3** in the Township of Whitby.
- Proceeds through a series of directional segments:
  - Along lot boundaries and road allowances.
  - Across multiple concessions (3 to 5).
  - Includes specific **azimuths and distances** (e.g., 281°03′30″, 19°35′21″, 118°07′12″).
- Ends at the **southeasterly corner of Lot 6, Concession 4**, after a series of 1,110 m and 990 m straight-line segments across lots and road allowances.

> This boundary defines the **legal jurisdiction** of the zoning regulations — all land within this boundary is subject to the height and waste restrictions.

### **Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure Flight Safety**:
   - Prevent obstructions (buildings, trees, structures) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
   - Maintain visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR) safety margins.

2. **Mitigate Bird Hazards**:
   - Prohibit disposal of food or waste that attracts birds, reducing the risk of bird strikes.

3. **Provide Clear, Predictable Zones**:
   - Define precise geometric surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) to allow for consistent planning, development, and enforcement.

4. **Support Airport Operations**:
   - Protect the operational integrity of Oshawa Airport, which serves both general aviation and commercial flights.

### **Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions requiring removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions.
- Violations may result in legal action or penalties, though enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in the text.

### **Conclusion**

The *Oshawa Airport Zoning Regulations* represent a comprehensive and technically precise set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** by establishing strict elevation and land-use controls around the airport. By defining approach, outer, and transitional surfaces with clear geometric parameters and applying them to a well-defined boundary, the regulations ensure that the airspace around Oshawa Airport remains unobstructed and safe for all aircraft operations.

These regulations are not only a technical document but
