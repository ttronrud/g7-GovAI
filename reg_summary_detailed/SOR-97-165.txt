**Detailed Summary of the *Administration of Labour Market Development Services Divestiture Regulations* (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Administration of Labour Market Development Services Divestiture Regulations* were enacted by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under two key statutory authorities:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**

These regulations establish specific rules governing the **transition of public service employees** who move from federal employment to employment with a **provincial government** under a **labour market development agreement (LMDA)**. The purpose is to ensure that the **superannuation rights and benefits** of such employees are appropriately protected and administered during and after their transition.

The regulations came into force on **April 1, 1997**, and were later **repealed in part** by *SOR/2016-203, s. 53* (specifically the provision regarding survivor and child benefits), though key provisions remain in effect.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA) |
| **Labour Market Development Agreement (LMDA)** | An agreement between the **Government of Canada** (represented by the Minister of Human Resources Development) and a **provincial government**, whereby the provincial government assumes responsibility for designing and delivering labour market development programs and certain functions of the national employment service. |
| **New Employer** | A provincial government that has entered into an LMDA with the federal government. |

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

1. **Applicable Transition**  
   These regulations apply to individuals who:
   - Cease to be employed in the **federal public service**, and  
   - Become employed by a **new employer** (i.e., a provincial government) **pursuant to a labour market development agreement**.

2. **Exclusions**  
   The regulations **do not apply** in the following situations:
   - A person who later becomes **re-employed by the same new employer** after leaving.
   - A person who, after ceasing employment with a new employer, becomes employed by **another new employer**.

3. **Exemption from Certain Sections**  
   - **Sections 4 to 9 of the PSSA** (which relate to general superannuation rights, such as contributions, pension eligibility, etc.) **do not apply** to individuals who have exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA (likely referring to an option to transfer pension value or receive a return of contributions).

---

### **Application of Superannuation Provisions (Sections 12 to 13.01 of the PSSA)**

These sections govern pension rights, including retirement pensions, survivor benefits, and death benefits.

- The provisions **only apply to individuals on and after the date they cease employment with the new employer**.
- This means that **pensionable service, age, and other eligibility criteria** are calculated based on the period of service with the new employer.

#### Key Provisions:

| Provision | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pensionable Service** | Includes the period of service with the new employer that begins on the day the person leaves federal service and ends on the day they cease employment with the new employer. |
| **Age for Eligibility** | The person’s age when they cease to be employed in the public service is considered their age **on the day they cease employment with the new employer**. |

> This ensures that the employee’s pension eligibility and benefit calculations are based on their actual employment timeline with the provincial government, not their prior federal service.

---

### **Return of Contributions (Section 12 or 12.1 of the PSSA)**

- If, **without these regulations**, a person would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
  - Subsection 12(3) or  
  - Subsection 12.1(4) of the PSSA,  
  then the person may **request a return of contributions** in writing within **one year** of:
  - Ceasing federal employment and beginning employment with a new employer.

> This provision provides a **limited window** for employees to reclaim contributions made to the public service superannuation fund during their transition.

---

### **Option to Transfer Value (Section 13.01 of the PSSA)**

- If, **without these regulations**, a person would be entitled to exercise an option in favour of the **transfer value** (i.e., the value of their pension entitlement) under section 13.01 of the PSSA, then:
  - The person may **exercise this option** within **one year** of ceasing federal employment and beginning employment with a new employer.

> This allows employees to choose whether to retain their pension value in the federal system or transfer it to the provincial system (or receive a lump sum), giving them financial flexibility during the transition.

---

### **Survivor and Child Benefits**

For the **survivors and children** of a person who dies while employed by a new employer:

- They are entitled to **one of the following benefits**, as if the deceased had been employed in the federal public service:
  - The **death benefit** under subsection 12(8) or 12.1(8) of the PSSA; or  
  - The **allowances** under subsection 13(3) or 13.001(3) of the PSSA.

> This ensures continuity of family benefits even when an employee transitions to provincial employment.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This provision was **repealed** by *SOR/2016-203, s. 53*, meaning it no longer applies as of that date. However, the summary includes it as it was in effect at the time of the original regulation.

### **Child Allowance (Subsection 26(2) of the PSSA)**

- A child who is:
  - Born to, adopted by, or becomes a stepchild of the person **during the period** between:
    - The day they cease federal employment, and  
    - The day they cease employment with the new employer  
  is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA**.

> This ensures that children born or adopted during the transition period are not excluded from pension-related child benefits.

---

### **One-Year Period for Section 10(5) of the PSSA**

- For the purposes of **subsection 10(5)** of the PSSA (which relates to eligibility for certain benefits or rights), the one-year period referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** begins on the **date the person ceases employment with the new employer**.

> This clarifies the timeline for benefit claims or rights that may be triggered after leaving the provincial employer.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations came into force on **April 1, 1997**.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Context**

These regulations were introduced in the context of **labour market development reform** in the 1990s, where the federal government transferred responsibility for labour market development programs (such as job training and employment services) to provincial governments.

The key objectives were:

1. **To provide clarity** on how public service superannuation rights apply when employees transition from federal to provincial employment.
2. **To ensure fairness and continuity** of pension, survivor, and child benefits during the transition.
3. **To allow flexibility** in pension choices (e.g., return of contributions or transfer of pension value).
4. **To protect the rights of employees and their families** during a structural shift in employment services.

### **Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Applicability** | Only applies to employees transitioning from federal public service to a provincial government via an LMDA. |
| **Benefit Continuity** | Survivor and child benefits are preserved even after transition. |
| **Pension Service Period** | Service with the new employer counts toward pensionable service. |
| **Return of Contributions** | Eligible within one year of starting provincial employment. |
| **Transfer Option** | Option to transfer pension value available within one year. |
| **Exclusions** | Does not apply to re-employment or employment with another new employer. |
| **Status** | Some provisions (e.g., survivor benefits) were **repealed in 2016**; others remain in force. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Administration of Labour Market Development Services Divestiture Regulations* serve as a **critical transitional framework** for public service employees moving from federal to provincial employment under labour market development agreements. They balance the need for **federal oversight of superannuation rights** with the **practical realities of devolved services**.

While many of the benefits and protections remain relevant, **the repeal of the survivor and child benefit provisions in 2016** reflects broader reforms to the superannuation system. Nevertheless, the core structure — particularly around contribution returns, pension service periods, and transition timelines — continues to inform how employees' retirement rights are managed during intergovernmental service transitions.
