**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Onion Growers’ Marketing Order**

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **grant the Ontario Onion Growers’ Marketing Board (the "Board") authority to regulate the marketing of onions in interprovincial and export trade**, beyond its existing jurisdiction within the province of Ontario. This extension of regulatory power is authorized under the **Agricultural Products Marketing Act (APMA)**, which allows the Governor in Council to delegate authority to provincial boards or agencies to oversee the marketing of agricultural products in markets outside their province.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
The Order is issued under the authority of the **Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, specifically under provisions that permit the Governor in Council to grant interprovincial and export marketing powers to any board or agency authorized under provincial law to regulate the marketing of agricultural products within its province.

- The Board is already authorized under the **Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario** and its associated regulations to regulate the marketing of onions **within Ontario**.
- The Governor in Council, upon recommendation of the Acting Minister of Agriculture, has determined that it is **"deemed advisable"** to extend this authority to cover **interprovincial and export trade**.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Board"**: Refers to *The Ontario Onion Growers’ Marketing Board*, established by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario*.
- **"Onions"**: Means onions produced in Ontario (i.e., originating from Ontario farms and growing regions).

> This definition ensures that only onions grown in Ontario are subject to the Board’s regulatory authority in interprovincial and export markets.

#### **Regulatory Authority Granted**
The Board is authorized to:
- **Regulate the marketing of onions** in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (i.e., sales or distribution of Ontario-grown onions to other provinces),
  - **Export trade** (i.e., sales of Ontario-grown onions outside Canada).

#### **Powers Exercisable in Interprovincial and Export Trade**
For the purpose of regulating interprovincial and export marketing, the Board may, with respect to persons and property located within Ontario, exercise **all or any of the powers** it currently holds under the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* and its regulation **Regulation 334/61**.

Specifically, the powers include those set out in:
- Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of Regulation 334/61.

These sections typically cover powers such as:
- Setting marketing standards (e.g., quality, grading, packaging),
- Establishing pricing mechanisms (e.g., price supports, market controls),
- Regulating sales and distribution,
- Enforcing compliance with marketing rules,
- Conducting inspections or audits,
- Imposing penalties or sanctions for non-compliance,
- Approving or rejecting marketing agreements or contracts.

> Importantly, the Board is not granted full regulatory power over the entire supply chain outside Ontario — only over **marketing activities** (i.e., sales, pricing, distribution), and only with respect to **persons and property situated within Ontario**.

### **4. Scope and Limitations**
- **Geographic Scope**: The authority applies only to **onions produced in Ontario** and to **marketing activities involving such onions** in other provinces or internationally.
