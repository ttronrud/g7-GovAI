**Detailed Summary of the National Energy Board Substituted Service Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**
These regulations are issued under **section 75.29 of the National Energy Board Act (NEBA)**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**. This legislative action formalizes and operationalizes procedures for the **substituted service of notices** when personal service is not feasible.

The regulations are officially titled:  
**National Energy Board Substituted Service Regulations**  
They may be cited as such and are intended to provide clear, enforceable rules for how notices required under specific sections of the NEBA may be served when direct delivery (personal service) is impractical or impossible.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Board**: Refers to the *National Energy Board* (NEB), the regulatory body responsible for overseeing energy policy, infrastructure, and public interest matters in Canada.
- **Notice**: A formal communication required under specific provisions of the NEBA, including:
  - Section 34 (e.g., notices of proposed actions),
  - Section 87 (e.g., notices of hearings or decisions),
  - Subsection 104(2) (e.g., notices related to compliance or investigations).
- **Personal Service**: Delivery of a notice directly to a person in person, following the procedures outlined in the *National Energy Board Rules of Practice and Procedure, 1995*.

### **Core Provision: When Substituted Service Is Permitted**

> **Section 3(1)**  
> If a company has made **reasonable efforts** to personally serve a notice on a person but has been unable to do so, it may apply to the Board for an order authorizing **substituted service** of that notice.

#### **Conditions for Approval of Substituted Service**

The Board **must satisfy two conditions** before granting substituted service:

1. **Impracticality of Personal Service**  
   The Board must be satisfied that personal service is **impractical in the circumstances** (e.g., due to the person’s absence, unavailability, or physical inaccessibility).

2. **Reasonable Possibility of Notice Receipt**  
   The information provided (as per paragraph 4(c)) must demonstrate a **reasonable possibility** that the substituted service method will bring the notice to the attention of the intended recipient.

> This ensures that substituted service is not used arbitrarily or as a default option, but only when genuinely necessary and likely to reach the person.

---

### **Application Process for Substituted Service**

To apply for substituted service, the company must file with the Board:

1. **Five copies of a written application**  
   Ensures transparency and allows for record-keeping and review.

2. **Evidence by affidavit** showing:
   - The **efforts made to effect personal service** (e.g., attempts to contact via phone, mail, or in-person visits).
   - The **prejudice to any person** that would result from continuing attempts at personal service (e.g., delay in decision-making, financial harm, or harm to public interest).
   - The **last known address** of the person, or any other location where they may be found (e.g., residence, workplace, known frequented places).
   - The **names and addresses of any individuals** in communication with the person (e.g., family, colleagues, agents).
   - Any **other relevant information** indicating where the person might be located.

> This requirement ensures due diligence and accountability in the application process.

### **Permitted Methods of Substituted Service**

Substituted service may be carried out through **one or more** of the following methods:

1. **Delivery to an adult at the residence or place of business**  
   Leaving the notice with an adult at the person’s home, workplace, or any other place known to be frequented by them.

2. **Delivery to an adult in communication with the person**  
   Leaving the notice with any adult who has regular contact with the person (e.g., a family member, employer, or agent).

3. **Registered mail**  
   Sending the notice via **registered mail** to the last known address of the person. This method provides a verifiable delivery record.

4. **Publication in general circulation publications**  
   Publishing the notice in one or more **publications widely circulated** in the geographic area where the person was last known to reside or operate.

5. **Any other method** that the Board determines is **more likely to bring the notice to the person’s attention**  
   This provides flexibility for exceptional or novel circumstances (e.g., community bulletin boards, online platforms if appropriate).

> The Board retains discretion to approve additional methods if they are deemed effective and reasonable.

---

### **Service Requirements and Documentation**

- **Accompanying Order**  
  Unless otherwise directed by the Board, **a true copy of the Board’s order** authorizing substituted service must accompany the notice when it is delivered.

> This ensures transparency and legal validity of the service process.

---

### **Effective Date of Service**

- A notice served by substituted service is **deemed to have been received** by the person entitled to it on:
  - The **day following** the day on which **all methods of substituted service** ordered by the Board have been completed, **or**
  - On a **later date** as specified by the Board in its order.

> This establishes a clear and predictable timeline for when the notice is considered legally effective, even if the recipient does not immediately receive or read it.

---

### **Important Note on Revocation**

> [Revoked, SOR/93-240, s. 2]  
> These regulations were previously revoked by **SOR/93-240, section 2**, but the current version appears to be a **reinstated or revised version**. This indicates that the regulations may have been temporarily withdrawn and then reissued, likely to reflect updated practices or policy needs. The current text supersedes the earlier revocation.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Enables Timely Compliance**  
   Allows energy projects, regulatory actions, or compliance notices to proceed without indefinite delays due to inability to locate or personally serve a recipient.

2. **Balances Efficiency with Fairness**  
   Prevents arbitrary or unnecessary substitution while ensuring that notices are effectively delivered when personal service is not feasible.

3. **Provides Legal Clarity**  
   Establishes clear procedures, standards, and thresholds for when substituted service is authorized and how it is documented and effective.

4. **Protects Recipient Rights**  
   Requires that the Board be satisfied that the substituted method will reasonably reach the person, preventing notice from being ignored or missed due to poor delivery methods.

5. **Supports Regulatory Accountability**  
   Requires detailed evidence of attempts at personal service and prejudice, ensuring that the process is not abused.

### **Conclusion**

The **National Energy Board Substituted Service Regulations** provide a structured, fair, and legally sound framework for delivering regulatory notices when direct personal service is not possible. By requiring reasonable efforts, establishing clear conditions for approval, specifying effective delivery methods, and ensuring proper documentation and timing, the regulations ensure that regulatory processes remain both **practical and just**.

They are a critical component of the NEB’s operational capacity to enforce compliance, conduct investigations, and communicate with stakeholders—particularly in complex or dispersed energy sectors where individuals may be difficult to locate.

---

**In short**:  
When personal delivery fails, the National Energy Board can authorize substituted service—via delivery to a known adult, registered mail, or publication—only if it is both impractical and likely to reach the recipient. The process requires detailed evidence and is governed by strict conditions to ensure fairness, transparency, and effectiveness.
