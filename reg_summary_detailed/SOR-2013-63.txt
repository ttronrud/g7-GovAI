Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, purpose, key provisions, conditions, and implications:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Reconsideration Request Regulations (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 247; S.C. 1996, c. 23)**  
**Effective Date:** April 1, 2013  
**Issued By:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development  
**Authority:** Subsection 112(3)a of the *Employment Insurance Act*  

---

## **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **allow eligible individuals to request a reconsideration of an Employment Insurance (EI) decision beyond the standard 365-day deadline**, under specific circumstances. This provides greater flexibility in cases where a person has a legitimate and ongoing reason to seek a review of an EI decision — particularly when the request for reconsideration is made after the statutory 365-day period.

This provision supports fairness and equity by recognizing that some individuals may not be able to act promptly due to unforeseen personal or financial circumstances, or because they are still gathering evidence or information necessary to support a successful appeal.

---

## **2. Key Provisions**

### **Paragraph 112(1)(b) of the Employment Insurance Act – Basis for Extended Reconsideration**

Under this provision, the **Employment Insurance Benefits Review Commission (Commission)** may grant an extension to a request for reconsideration **if**:

- The Commission is satisfied that there is a **reasonable explanation** for requesting a longer period; **and**
- The individual has demonstrated a **continuing intention** to pursue reconsideration.

> This means the request must not be a mere delay or abandonment, but must reflect genuine, ongoing efforts to challenge the original decision.

---

## **3. Conditions for Granting an Extension**

The Commission must also be satisfied that **allowing a longer period** to submit a reconsideration request would not cause **prejudice** to:

1. **The Commission itself** (e.g., operational delays, backlog of cases), or  
2. **Any party involved** (e.g., the claimant, the employer, or the EI system).

Additionally, the extension is only permitted in **specific situations** where the request is made **after** the standard 365-day period. These include:

| Scenario | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Request made after 365 days** | If the decision was communicated to the individual, and the request for reconsideration is submitted more than 365 days later. |
| **Request made by someone who submitted another EI application after the decision was communicated** | The individual has filed a new EI claim (e.g., for a different type of benefit or after a change in circumstances) following the original decision. |
| **Request made by someone who has already requested the Commission to rescind or amend the decision under Section 111** | The individual has formally asked the Commission to cancel (rescind) or modify (amend) the original decision — indicating active engagement in the review process. |

> In all these cases, the Commission must still assess whether the request has a **reasonable chance of success** and whether extending the deadline would cause undue harm to the system or other parties.

---

## **4. Requirements for a "Reasonable Chance of Success"**

The Commission must determine that:

- The reconsideration request is **not frivolous or speculative**.
- There is **substantive merit** in the arguments or evidence presented.
- The claimant has **provided sufficient basis** (e.g., new evidence, changed circumstances) to justify a reevaluation of the original decision.

This ensures that the extension is not granted arbitrarily or in cases where the request is clearly without merit.

---

## **5. "Reasonable Explanation" and "Continuing Intention"**

To qualify for an extension, the individual must provide:

- A **clear and credible explanation** for the delay (e.g., illness, lack of access to documentation, financial hardship, or difficulty in identifying evidence).
- Evidence of **continued interest and effort** to pursue reconsideration (e.g., correspondence, follow-up actions, or new information gathered).

The Commission evaluates both elements to ensure the delay is justified and not due to negligence or bad faith.

---

## **6. Prejudice Assessment**

Before granting an extension, the Commission must consider whether allowing the request to be made later would:

- Cause **operational delays** in processing other cases.
- Lead to **unfair advantage** for the claimant or other parties.
- Undermine the **integrity or efficiency** of the EI review process.

If prejudice is likely, the extension will not be granted.

---

## **7. Legal and Procedural Context**

- **Statutory Authority**: The regulation is based on subsection 112(3)a of the *Employment Insurance Act*, which authorizes the Commission to allow extensions under certain conditions.
- **Historical Background**: This regulation builds upon earlier provisions in S.C. 1996, c. 23, and was updated in 2012 to modernize and clarify the process for reconsideration requests.
- **Implementation Date**: The regulations came into force on **April 1, 2013**, meaning all requests for reconsideration under these rules must be processed after that date.

---

## **8. Key Implications**

| Implication | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Greater Flexibility** | Claimants who face unforeseen challenges can now seek reconsideration beyond 365 days, provided they meet the criteria. |
| **Improved Fairness** | Recognizes real-life complexities that may prevent timely action (e.g., medical issues, financial stress). |
| **Accountability** | The Commission retains discretion to ensure that extensions are only granted when justified and not abused. |
| **System Integrity** | Prevents abuse of the process by requiring proof of a reasonable chance of success and no prejudice. |

---

## **9. Summary of Key Requirements for an Extended Reconsideration Request**

To qualify for an extension under these regulations, a person must demonstrate:

✅ A **reasonable explanation** for the delay in filing the reconsideration request.  
✅ A **continuing intention** to pursue reconsideration.  
✅ That the request has a **reasonable chance of success**.  
✅ That **no prejudice** would result to the Commission or any party.  
✅ That the request falls into one of the three specified scenarios (post-365-day request, new application after decision, or request to rescind/amend under section 111).

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Reconsideration Request Regulations* represent a balanced approach to enhancing access to justice and fairness within the Employment Insurance system. They provide a pathway for individuals to seek a review of EI decisions beyond the standard 365-day limit, while ensuring that the process remains efficient, accountable, and not open to abuse. The emphasis on **substantive merit**, **credible explanations**, and **no prejudice** ensures that the extension is granted only when genuinely needed and justified.

This regulation strengthens the Commission’s ability to respond to complex and real-world situations, promoting both equity and procedural integrity in the administration of Employment Insurance benefits.
