**Detailed Summary of the Quesnel Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

The Quesnel Airport Zoning Regulations are established under **Section 4.4** of the **Aeronautics Act** (formerly known as the *Aeronautics Act, 1985*), which authorizes the Minister of Transport to regulate land use around airports to ensure safety, particularly in relation to aircraft operations. These regulations were developed following a public consultation process initiated under **Section 4.5** of the same Act.

- A proposed version of the zoning regulations was **published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on March 22, 1986**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, community groups, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on that input and recommendations, the Governor General in Council, acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, **formally enacted** the final zoning regulations.

### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Quesnel Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Quesnel Airport**, including public road allowances.  
- The specific lands covered are **detailed in Part VI of the schedule**, which defines a precise boundary encompassing a large area surrounding the airport.

### **3. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and enforceability, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Quesnel Airport located in the Cariboo Regional District and Cariboo Land District, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used for elevation and spatial measurements. Located 100 meters southwesterly from the centerline of runway 13–31, perpendicular to it. Coordinates: UTM 5,875,022.10 N, 532,852.11 E. Assigned elevation: **543 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway (strip), rising at a ratio of **1.25 meters vertically to 50 meters horizontally**. It extends 3,000 meters from each end of the strip and reaches an elevation of **75 meters above the strip ends**. The surface is bounded by horizontal lines drawn at right angles to the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface located at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP (543 m ASL)**, i.e., 588 meters ASL. However, if this would place the surface below **9 meters above ground level**, the surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground**. This ensures a minimum safety buffer near terrain. |
| **Strip** | The active runway area associated with runway 13–31. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,798.855 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally**, extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, until it intersects with the outer surface. This creates a gradual slope that transitions from the strip to the outer surface. |

### **4. Height Restrictions**

The primary regulatory provision limits construction and development near the airport to ensure **aircraft safety during takeoff, landing, and approach**.

> **No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:
>
> - The **approach surface**  
> - The **outer surface**  
> - The **transitional surface**

This means that all structures—whether new or existing—must remain below these defined imaginary planes. These surfaces are designed to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft visibility or flight paths.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Provisions**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, hills) grows above any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a directive** to the landowner or occupier to:
  - Remove the overgrown portion, or
  - Trim or reduce the growth to bring it within the allowed elevation limits.

This provision ensures that even natural features do not become hazards during flight operations.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Restrictions**

- No owner or occupier of land within the regulated area may **use that land for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**

This is a critical measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which pose a serious risk to aircraft safety. The regulation aims to reduce the presence of food sources or attractants that might draw birds to the airport vicinity.

---

### **7. Regulatory Maps and Boundaries**

All surfaces and land boundaries are defined and illustrated in the **Department of Transport Quesnel Airport Zoning Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1662**, dated **February 29, 1984**.

#### **Boundary Description of the Regulated Area**

The outer boundary of the regulated land is described in a detailed, step-by-step legal description (a legal description commonly used in land surveys). It spans across multiple parcels and lots in the Cariboo District and includes:

- Key roads: **Trembley Road, Quesnel Canyon Road, Barkerville Highway No. 26, Cariboo Highway No. 97, Blackwater Road, Gemini Road, Spears Road, Patchett Road**
- Natural features: **Quesnel River (high water marks)** and **Fraser River (high water marks)**
- Land parcels and lots referenced by plan numbers, district lots, and fractional sections (e.g., "Remainder of the Northeast 1/4 of District Lot 4368")

The boundary is extensive and reflects a **comprehensive buffer zone** designed to protect critical flight paths and approach corridors.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directives regarding vegetation removal
  - Enforce height restrictions
  - Monitor compliance with waste disposal rules
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative and legal means under the Aeronautics Act.

---

### **9. Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Flight Safety**: Prevent physical obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**: Reduce the risk of bird strikes by eliminating food sources and attractants.
3. **Public and Environmental Protection**: Balance aviation safety with land use and environmental considerations.
4. **Transparency and Public Participation**: Ensure that stakeholders had a fair opportunity to comment before finalization.

---

### **10. Historical and Contextual Notes**

- The regulations were enacted in **1985**, with the final publication in **1986**, indicating a deliberate and structured process.
- The zoning plan (Z.B.C. 1662) was developed in **1984**, showing that the planning and technical design were completed prior to formal adoption.
- The use of **UTM coordinates** and **elevation references** ensures precision in enforcement and compliance.
- The inclusion of **natural features** (rivers, roads, land parcels) in the boundary reflects a real-world, geographically accurate approach to defining the airport’s influence zone.

### **Conclusion**

The **Quesnel Airport Zoning Regulations** constitute a comprehensive and technically precise set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** by establishing clear height limits, managing natural growth, and restricting hazardous waste disposal in the vicinity of Quesnel Airport. By defining specific surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) and a detailed boundary, the regulations provide a clear framework for land use and development control. The process followed—public consultation, expert planning, and formal legislative adoption—demonstrates a balanced and transparent approach to regulating airport surroundings in Canada.

These regulations remain a foundational document in the aviation safety framework for regional airports in British Columbia and serve as a model for similar airport zoning initiatives across Canada.
