## **Acceptance of Mailable Matter for Registration**

### **What Can Be Registered?**
The following items may be accepted for registration at the applicable rate (as listed in **column II of item 1 of Schedule VII**):
1. **Letter mail** as defined in the *Letter Mail Regulations*.
2. **Letters** referred to in the *International Letter-post Items Regulations*.

> This means only standard letter-sized mail (within defined dimensions and content) qualifies for registration under these rules.

---

## **Requirements for Registration**

1. **Receipt Upon Acceptance**  
   When a registered item is accepted, the sender must receive a **receipt in a form approved by Canada Post**.

2. **Addressee Signature Requirement**  
   - The **signature of the addressee or their authorized representative** must be obtained **before delivery** of registered mail.  
   - This ensures accountability and verification of delivery.

3. **Identification Requirements**  
   - Mailable matter that identifies the addressee **only by initials or surname without clear identification** (e.g., "John Smith") is **not accepted** for registration.  
   - Clear identification (e.g., full name, address) is required to prevent fraud or misdelivery.

4. **Tape Closure Requirement**  
   - If adhesive tape is used to close a package, the **sender must apply their name, mark, stamp, or signature** directly on the tape.  
   - This serves as a tamper-evident and sender-verified seal.

---

## **Advice of Receipt**

- A sender may request an **Advice of Receipt**:
  - **After posting** for delivery **within Canada**; or  
  - **At the time of posting** for delivery **outside Canada**.
- The Advice of Receipt must be in a **form approved by Canada Post**.
- This provides documentation confirming the mail was received by the postal facility at the time of posting.

## **Insurance for Registered Mail**

### **When Insurance Is Available**
- Registered mail posted **in Canada** for delivery **in or outside Canada** may be insured against:
  - Loss
  - Rifling (tampering or opening)
  - Damage

> Insurance is **not automatic** — it must be requested by the sender.

### **Requirements for Insurance**
- The item must be:
  - **Securely wrapped** with sufficient cushioning and reinforcing material to:
    - Prevent loss or damage to the contents,
    - Protect postal equipment and other mail,
    - Prevent injury to handlers.

- **Prohibited Items for Insurance**:

## **Indemnity (Compensation) Rules**

### **Maximum Indemnity Amount**
The maximum amount Canada Post will pay in compensation (indemnity) is the **lesser of**:
1. The value of the mailable matter **less any compensation received from another source**;  
2. The amount of indemnity coverage obtained under these regulations.

> This caps the payout to prevent overcompensation.

---

### **What Is Covered by Indemnity?**
Canada Post will pay indemnity for:
- **Postage paid** for the registered mail
- **Provincial sales tax** (if proof of payment is available and Canada Post determines the tax cannot be recovered)

> ❌ **Not Covered**:
- Postage paid for **special services** (e.g., insurance, tracking) under these regulations
- Any **claim submission fees** or expenses incurred by the sender or addressee

> ✅ **Exception**: Canada Post may **replace the contents** of the mail instead of paying indemnity, especially when the item is lost or damaged.

## **When Indemnity Is Not Paid**

No indemnity will be paid if:
1. The mail was a **commercial shipment** not ordered by the addressee.
2. The injury or damage was **not a direct result** of loss, damage, delay, non-delivery, or misdelivery.
3. The mail was **delivered without complaint** or evidence of loss/damage.
4. The loss or damage was **the sender’s fault**.
5. The mail contained **glass, ceramic, or perishable items**.
6. A **common carrier** would have been legally exempt from liability (e.g., due to force majeure or legal immunity).
7. The mail contained **intoxicating liquor**.
8. The mail was **lawfully seized** by the destination country.

> These exclusions protect Canada Post from liability in cases of fraud, negligence, or legal immunity.

2. Submit a claim **within the following timeframes**:
