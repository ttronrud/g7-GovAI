Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Authorization of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion under the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
The regulation is issued under **section 7 of the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act (AFRA)**.  
It is promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which reflects the constitutional and administrative process whereby federal executive authority is exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister.

This means the regulation is not a standalone legislative act but a **governmental administrative directive** implementing the provisions of the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act, specifically in relation to the restructuring and management of fishery enterprises in Atlantic Canada.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **transfer certain powers** from the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion (MRIE)**.  
This transfer enables greater regional economic development coordination by allowing the MRIE to exercise regulatory and operational authority over specific fishery-related enterprises.

This reflects a strategic shift in federal policy: while the MFO traditionally oversees fisheries management, conservation, and scientific aspects, the MRIE is responsible for broader regional economic development, including industrial growth, job creation, and regional competitiveness. This regulation allows the MRIE to play a more active role in the governance of key fishery companies.

#### **3. Scope of the Authorized Entities**
The regulation authorizes the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion to exercise powers **in respect of 12 specific fishery companies**, listed below:

1. 125459 Canada Ltd.  
2. The Lake Group Ltd.  
3. John Penny and Sons Ltd.  
4. Caribou Fisheries Inc.  
5. Caribou Food Industries Inc.  
6. Fishery Products Ltd.  
7. Fishery Products (St. Anthony) Ltd.

11. North Atlantic Fisheries Ltd.  
12. T.J. Hardy Co. Ltd.  
13. Fishery Products International Ltd.  
14. Great Harbour Deep Seafoods Ltd.

Additionally, the regulation includes a **provision for amalgamation**:  
The Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion may also exercise these powers **with respect to any company formed by the amalgamation of two or more of the above-listed enterprises**.

This provision allows for **consolidation and restructuring** of fishery operations—potentially to improve efficiency, reduce duplication, or strengthen market competitiveness—while maintaining federal oversight under the MRIE.

#### **4. Powers Being Transferred**
The powers being transferred are those **originally granted to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under subsection 6(1) of the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act**.  
While the specific content of subsection 6(1) is not detailed in the provided text, based on typical provisions in such legislation, these powers likely include:

- Authority to **approve or deny mergers, acquisitions, or restructuring** of fishery operations  
- Power to **issue licenses, permits, or operational approvals** for fish processing, storage, or export  
- Authority to **set conditions for operations**, including environmental or labor standards  
- Oversight of **business planning, capital investment, or expansion** in fishery-related industries  
- Approval of **joint ventures or inter-company agreements** among the listed enterprises

By transferring these powers to the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, the government is emphasizing **economic development and regional resilience** over purely fisheries management.

---

#### **5. Significance and Implications**
- **Economic Development Focus**: This regulation supports regional economic growth by enabling the MRIE to promote industrial consolidation and investment in fish processing and value-added industries.
- **Streamlined Governance**: It reduces bureaucratic overlap by allowing regional economic ministers to manage fishery enterprises more effectively than the traditional fisheries minister, especially in areas where processing and employment are key drivers.
- **Flexibility for Restructuring**: The inclusion of amalgamation provisions allows for strategic business reorganizations to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
- **Continuity of Oversight**: Despite the transfer of powers, the regulatory framework remains grounded in the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act, ensuring that environmental, safety, and public interest considerations are still respected.

---

#### **6. Limitations and Conditions**
- The powers are **limited to the listed companies** and any amalgamations formed from them.
- The transfer is **conditional upon compliance with the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act** and its associated regulations.
- The Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion must act within the **bounds of the original powers granted under subsection 6(1)** and cannot expand those powers beyond what is legally defined.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant policy shift in how fishery enterprises in Atlantic Canada are governed. By transferring operational and structural authority from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, the federal government is promoting a more **integrated, development-oriented approach** to fisheries. It supports industrial consolidation, regional economic resilience, and long-term sustainability through strategic business restructuring—while maintaining legal and regulatory accountability under the Atlantic Fisheries Restructuring Act.
