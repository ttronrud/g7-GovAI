The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> [Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (or provision) was **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 11 of the Statutory Instruments Regulation (SOR/2014-293)**.

- **SOR/2014-293** is a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2014 by the Government of Canada. Statutory Instruments are a form of delegated legislation used to implement or amend laws without requiring a full act of Parliament.
- **Section 11** of this instrument contains the provision that formally repeals a previously existing regulation.
- The repeated mention of "[Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]" suggests that the referenced regulation was officially removed from legal force on the date the instrument came into effect.

### Key Points:
- The regulation in question is **no longer in effect**.
- It was **repealed** as part of a broader legislative update or consolidation effort, likely to simplify the regulatory framework, eliminate outdated provisions, or align with new policies.
- The repeal does not imply that the regulation was invalid or unlawful — it simply means it is no longer active or enforceable.
- The repeal date would typically be specified in the SI, and in this case, it would be the date SOR/2014-293 was published and came into force (commonly the day after publication in the Canada Gazette).

### Implications:
- Any legal, administrative, or operational references to the repealed regulation must now be updated to reflect current laws.
- Entities (such as businesses, government departments, or regulatory bodies) that previously relied on this regulation must now consult the current version of the applicable statute or regulation.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does not contain the content of the repealed regulation itself, only a notice of its repeal. Therefore, the summary is limited to the factual status of the regulation: **it has been officially canceled and is no longer in force due to Section 11 of SOR/2014-293**.

To fully understand the scope or substance of the original regulation, one would need to consult the original version prior to repeal, which is no longer accessible through this notice.
