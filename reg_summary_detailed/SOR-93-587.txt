### 🔹 **3. Key Principles for Certificate Issuance**

The Minister must take **three core considerations** into account when issuing a certificate under **Section 9.1 or 9.2** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*:

1. **Export Performance of the Exporter**
   - The exporter’s recent export performance (volume and value) to the U.S. or Mexico must be evaluated.
   - A "representative base period" (e.g., the past 12–24 months) is used to assess trends.
   - This ensures that certificates are not granted to exporters with poor or inconsistent export records.

2. **Degree of Demand for Certificates**
   - The overall market demand for certificates (i.e., how many exporters are seeking them) is a factor.
   - High demand may lead to more certificates being issued, while low demand may result in tighter allocation.

3. **Effective Utilization and Preservation of CUSMA Benefits**
   - The goal is to ensure that the benefits of the **Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)** — such as increased market access, reduced trade barriers, and economic integration — are **fully and fairly utilized**.
   - Certificates should not be issued in a way that undermines intergovernmental agreements or leads to over-allocation or misuse.

> 🎯 This triad of considerations ensures that certificate allocations are **fair, transparent, and aligned with broader trade policy goals** under CUSMA.

### 🔹 **5. Amendment of Certificates**

A certificate holder may **request an amendment** to their certificate **in writing**, **before its expiry date**.

- The request must include:
  - A clear statement of the **new terms and conditions** of the certificate (e.g., changed quantity, value, destination, etc.)
  - **Reasons** for the requested change (e.g., change in demand, production schedule, or market conditions)

> ⚠️ Amendments are not automatic and require **Ministerial approval**. This provides flexibility while maintaining oversight and control over certificate use.

### 🔹 **6. Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation was introduced to:

- **Modernize** the certificate issuance process under the *Export and Import Permits Act*.
- Align with the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** and later, the **Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**.
- Ensure that export allocations are based on **objective, measurable, and equitable criteria**.

### 🔹 **7. Repeal Status (Important Update)**

Although this regulation was issued in 1993 and came into force with the implementation of CUSMA, it has since been **formally repealed**:
