The regulation came into force through **Statutory Citation S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465**, and was previously referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 47**. It was later **repealed by SOR/2009-63, section 1**, indicating that the regulation is no longer in force as of the date of repeal. However, the summary below reflects its *historical content and purpose* prior to repeal.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of the Complaint Information (Canadian Insurance Companies) Regulations is to **ensure that consumers are informed of how and where they can file complaints** regarding insurance products or services offered by Canadian insurance companies. This enhances consumer access to dispute resolution mechanisms and supports transparency and accountability in the insurance sector.

Specifically, the regulation defines and specifies:

- The **prescribed information** that must be provided to consumers.
- The **authorized contact points** (i.e., where consumers can go to file a complaint).
- The **required format** in which this information must be delivered.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Prescribed Information (Under Subsections 486(4) and 487(1) of the Insurance Companies Act)**

The regulation mandates that, for the purposes of **subsection 486(4)** and **subsection 487(1)** of the Insurance Companies Act, the following information must be provided to consumers:

> Consumers must be informed that they may contact the **Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC)** (formerly known as the Insurance Commissioner’s Office) to file a complaint.

This information must be clearly communicated in a manner that is accessible and understandable to the average consumer.

#### 2. **Contact Methods for Complaints**

The prescribed contact information includes:

- **Physical Office Address:**  
  The FCAC office is located at:  
  **427 Laurier Avenue West, 6th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1R 1B9**

- **Online Access:**  
  Consumers may also file complaints or obtain information via the **FCAC website**:  
  **www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca**

These are the official and authorized channels through which consumers can initiate a complaint against an insurance company.

#### 3. **Manner of Providing the Information**

The regulation specifies **how** the complaint information must be delivered to consumers. It must be provided in one of the following formats:

1. **In a brochure, statement of account, or written statement** that includes:
   - The required complaint information (i.e., contact details with FCAC).
   - **Additional information** that is legally required under the Insurance Companies Act to be disclosed in connection with:
     - An **arrangement** referred to in **subsection 482(3)** of the Act (e.g., insurance products involving credit or borrowing).
     - A **payment, credit, or charge card**.
     - The **cost of borrowing**.
     - Any other **obligation** of the insurance company under a **consumer provision** of the Act.

   > This ensures that the complaint information is not delivered in isolation but is integrated into broader disclosures that consumers already receive when engaging with insurance products.

2. **In a separate document**  
   Alternatively, the complaint information may be provided in a **standalone document**, such as a separate leaflet or notice, if the insurer chooses to do so.

> This flexibility allows insurers to tailor their disclosure approach depending on the product or customer interaction, while still ensuring compliance with the requirement to provide complaint contact details.

### **Legal Context and Relevance**

- **Section 486(4)** and **Section 487(1)** of the Insurance Companies Act require insurers to provide consumers with clear and accessible information about how to file complaints.
- The regulation ensures that this requirement is met in a consistent, standardized, and enforceable way across the Canadian insurance sector.
- By linking complaint information to broader consumer disclosures, the regulation strengthens consumer awareness and empowers individuals to seek redress when they believe their rights have been violated.

### **Status and Repeal**

- The regulation was **repealed by SOR/2009-63, section 1**.
- This means that as of the date of repeal, the regulation is **no longer in effect**.
- The repeal likely reflects a broader update or consolidation of consumer protection regulations, possibly with the introduction of more modern or comprehensive frameworks (such as updated provisions under the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* or revised disclosure requirements under the *Consumer Protection Act* or *Financial Services Modernization* initiatives).

> **Note**: Although the regulation is no longer active, its historical significance lies in establishing early, formalized procedures for consumer complaint access in the Canadian insurance sector.

### **Conclusion**

The *Complaint Information (Canadian Insurance Companies) Regulations* served as a foundational tool to ensure that consumers of insurance products in Canada were clearly informed of how to file complaints with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC). It mandated that this information be provided either within standard disclosures (such as brochures or statements) or in a separate document, and specified the official contact points (Ottawa office and website). While the regulation has since been repealed, it played a key role in enhancing transparency, accountability, and consumer protection in the insurance industry during its active period.

**Summary in One Sentence**:  
This regulation, now repealed, required Canadian insurance companies to clearly inform consumers of how to file complaints with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) through either a brochure, statement, or separate document, and specified FCAC’s Ottawa office and website as the official complaint channels.
