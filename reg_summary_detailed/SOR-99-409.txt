### **3. Legal Capacity in Canada**

- The **Preparatory Commission** and the **Secretariat** each have, in Canada, the **legal capacity of a body corporate**.

- **Acts and regulations** that prohibit the import or export of certain articles (e.g., controlled substances, dangerous goods), **as well as the Quarantine Act and its regulations**, apply to:

---

### **6. Equipment Inspection at Borders**

- Any **equipment** proposed by the Preparatory Commission or Secretariat to enter Canada must be:
  - **Inspected at the border**

- **Designation of special handling or storage requirements**:
  - Officials must designate any equipment requiring special safety handling or storage.
  - They must **notify Canadian authorities in advance** of such designations before the equipment arrives.

  - The **Executive Secretary** of the Preparatory Commission, or
  - An official or expert responsible for the **Inspection Team of the Secretariat**

- **Exception**: Consent is **deemed granted** in the event of a **fire or other emergency** requiring immediate intervention.

---

### **8. Abandoned Property**

- **Privileges and immunities do not apply** to any property that:
  - Has been **abandoned by the Preparatory Commission or Secretariat** for **more than one year**.

  - **Immunity from immigration restrictions and alien registration**
  - **Same repatriation facilities in time of international crisis** as those granted to diplomatic envoys

- **Canadian citizens or permanent residents** serving in these bodies shall have only the following privileges and immunities:
  - As specified in **paragraphs (a), (c), and (e)** of Section 18 of Article V of the Convention

---

### **12. Personal Baggage of Experts**

- The **Quarantine Act and related regulations** apply to the **personal baggage** of experts performing missions.

> This means experts must comply with Canadian rules on prohibited or restricted items (e.g., biological, hazardous, or regulated materials), even though they enjoy other immunities.
