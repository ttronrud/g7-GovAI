## 🔹 **3. Base Assessment Amount: How It Is Calculated**

The **base assessment** is the core of the financial institution’s annual assessment and is calculated differently depending on the institution type.

---

### ✅ **3.1 Minimum Assessment (Starting Point)**

Each institution starts with a **minimum assessment** based on its type:

| Institution Type | Minimum Assessment |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Bank | $30,000 |
| Authorized Foreign Bank (not under restrictions) | $30,000 |
| Authorized Foreign Bank (subject to restrictions under s. 524(2) of Bank Act) | $15,000 |
| Trust and Loan Company (restricted to fiduciary activities) | $15,000 |
| Trust and Loan Company (not restricted) | $30,000 |
| Retail Association | $30,000 |
| Cooperative Credit Association | $15,000 |
| Company, Provincial, or Foreign Company under Insurance Companies Act | $15,000 |
| Society or Foreign Fraternal Benefit Society | $2,000 |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These minimums are adjusted annually for inflation (see below).

---

### ✅ **3.2 Inflation Adjustment (Subsection 2(2))**

The minimum assessment is **adjusted annually for inflation** using the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.

#### Formula:
$$
\text{Adjusted Minimum Assessment} = \text{Previous Year's Minimum} \times \left( \frac{\text{CPI}_{\text{current year}}}{\text{CPI}_{\text{previous year}}} \right)
$$

Where:
- **CPI** = Average of the 12-month CPI values for Canada (as published by Statistics Canada).
- The result is **rounded to the nearest multiple of $10**.

#### Exception:
- If the CPI ratio is **less than 1**, **no adjustment** is made — the prior year’s minimum applies.
- This rule **does not apply** to the fiscal year beginning **April 1, 2016** (a transitional provision).

> 💡 This ensures that assessments keep pace with inflation without increasing costs disproportionately in periods of deflation.

---

### ✅ **3.3 Capital Base Determination**

The **capital** of an institution is determined based on its financial reporting and regulatory framework:

| Institution Type | Capital Definition |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Bank, Trust & Loan, Retail Association** | Total risk-weighted assets from the financial return (Q4 of the fiscal year) under relevant Acts:  
- Bank Act (s. 628)  
- Trust & Loan Act (s. 495)  
- Cooperative Act (s. 431) |
| **Authorized Foreign Bank** | Minimum capital equivalency deposit (from annual return under s. 601 of the Bank Act) |
| **Cooperative Credit Association** | 1/20th of total borrowings (from Q4 financial return under s. 431) |
| **Life Company, Society, Foreign Life, Foreign Fraternal Benefit Society** | Minimum required capital (from annual return under s. 665(1) of Insurance Companies Act) |
| **Foreign Company under Insurance Act** | Minimum required margin of assets in Canada (from s. 665(2)) |

> 📌 The capital base reflects the institution’s risk exposure and is used to determine the **proportionate share of regulatory costs**.

### ✅ **3.4 Base Assessment Formula by Institution Type**

#### A. **Banks, Authorized Foreign Banks, Trust & Loan Companies, Retail Associations**

The base assessment is:
- **If minimum assessment > formula result**, then use the **minimum assessment**.
- Otherwise, use:
  $$
  \text{Base Assessment} = \text{Minimum Assessment} + \left[ \text{Formula Result} - \text{Minimum Assessment} \right]
  $$

Where:
- **A** = Capital of the institution
- **B** = Sum of capital for all similar institutions (excluding those in subsection 2(2))
- **C** = Excess of administrative expenses over revenues (for banks, TLCs, retail associations)

> This formula ensures that institutions with higher capital or greater administrative costs pay more.

---

#### B. **Cooperative Credit Associations**

Base assessment:
- If minimum assessment > formula result → use minimum
- Else → use:
  $$
  \text{Base Assessment} = \text{Minimum Assessment} + \left[ \text{Formula Result} - \text{Minimum Assessment} \right]
  $$

Where:
- **A** = Capital
- **B** = Sum of capital for all CCAs (excluding those in subsection 2(2))
- **C** = Excess of administrative expenses over revenues (for CCA administration)

---

#### C. **Life Companies, Societies, Foreign Life Companies, Foreign Fraternal Benefit Societies**

Base assessment:
- If minimum assessment > formula result → use minimum
- Else → use:
  $$
  \text{Base Assessment} = \text{Minimum Assessment} + \left[ \text{Formula Result} - \text{Minimum Assessment} \right]
  $$

Where:
- **A** = Capital
- **B** = Sum of capital for all such institutions (excluding those in subsection 2(2))
- **C** = Excess of administrative expenses over revenues (for Insurance Companies Act administration)

---

#### D. **Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurers**

Base assessment:
- If minimum assessment > formula result → use minimum
- Else → use:
  $$
  \text{Base Assessment} = \text{Minimum Assessment} + \left[ \text{Formula Result} - \text{Minimum Assessment} \right]
  $$

Where:
- **A** = Capital
- **B** = Sum of capital for all P&C insurers (excluding those in subsection 2(2))
- **C** = Excess of administrative expenses over revenues (for Insurance Companies Act and Green Shield Canada Act)

---

#### E. **Mortgage Insurance Companies**

Base assessment:
- If minimum assessment > formula result → use minimum
- Else → use:
  $$
  \text{Base Assessment} = \text{Minimum Assessment} + \left[ \text{Formula Result} - \text{Minimum Assessment} \right]
  $$

Where:
- **A** = Capital
- **B** = Sum of
