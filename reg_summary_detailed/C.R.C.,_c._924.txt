The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2016-178, s. 4]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2016-178, section 4**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The specific regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on the date specified in **SOR/2016-178**, which is the *Statutory Instrument of 2016, No. 178*. Section 4 of that instrument explicitly repeals the prior regulation (or provisions) that were previously in effect.

**What Does "Repealed" Mean?**  
Repeal means that the regulation was officially canceled and is no longer legally binding or enforceable. Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are now nullified and superseded by other current laws or regulations.

**Context of SOR/2016-178:**  
SOR/2016-178 is a *Statutory Instrument* issued under the authority of the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on jurisdiction). These instruments are used to implement or amend laws. In this case, the repeal likely occurred as part of a broader legislative or administrative update — for example, to modernize, simplify, or consolidate regulations, or to align with new policy priorities.

**Section 4 of SOR/2016-178:**  
While the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided, section 4 of SOR/2016-178 would have contained the **specific legal language or citation** that formally revoked the prior rule. For instance, it may have read something like:

> "Section 4 of the [Name of Prior Regulation] is hereby repealed."

This action ensures legal clarity and prevents outdated or redundant rules from being applied in current operations.

**Implications:**  
- Any entity, organization, or individual previously operating under the repealed regulation must now comply with current, active rules.  
- Legal or compliance officers should review current legislation to ensure adherence to up-to-date requirements.  
- The repeal may reflect a change in policy, administrative efficiency, or a shift in regulatory focus.
