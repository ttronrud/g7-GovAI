**Detailed Summary of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Privileges and Immunities Order, 2023**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is made under **Section 5a of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMOA)**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of two key federal ministers:
- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs**
- The **Minister of Finance**

This authority allows the Canadian government to grant legal privileges and immunities to international organizations and their representatives, consistent with international law and Canada’s obligations under multilateral agreements.

The Order is referenced in:
- **S.C. 2002, c. 12, ss. 3 and 10** – provisions related to the application of privileges and immunities to foreign missions and international organizations.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 41** – the original *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*, which establishes the legal framework for such orders.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant specific privileges and immunities** to the **Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO)** and its associated personnel (representatives, officials, experts) while they are in Canada. These privileges are necessary to ensure that the Organization can carry out its mandate—promoting sustainable fisheries management in the Northwest Atlantic—without undue interference or obstruction from Canadian authorities.

These rights are derived from:
- The **Headquarters Agreement** between Canada and NAFO (2019)
- The **Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations** (the "Convention"), which serves as a model for defining privileges and immunities for international organizations.
