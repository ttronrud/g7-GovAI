## **3. Waiver of Civil Court Jurisdiction by the Attorney General**

### **Purpose**
To allow foreign military personnel to be tried in **service courts** (rather than Canadian civil courts) when accused of committing an offence under Canadian law.

### **When Can a Waiver Be Made?**
- **No information has been laid** against the member before the civil court:
  - The Attorney General may waive the civil court’s primary jurisdiction **by sending a signed waiver** (Form 1) to the **officer in command** of the visiting force.
- **Information has already been laid**:
  - The waiver must be sent **to the presiding judge, magistrate, or justice** of the civil court, **alongside** the original waiver (Form 1).

### **Conditions for Waiver**
- The waiver applies **only to offences** that constitute a breach of a law in force in Canada.
- **No waiver is permitted** after a civil court has already made a final adjudication (judicial decision) regarding the offence.
- **No prior request is required** to empower the Attorney General to issue a waiver.
- The officer in command of the visiting force may **submit a request** (Form 2) explaining why a waiver is needed — though it is not mandatory.

> 🔍 **Key Principle**: This mechanism allows for **dual jurisdiction flexibility**, ensuring that foreign military personnel are not subjected to Canadian civilian courts for offences that may be better handled in their own military justice systems.

- The **officer in command** of the visiting force may initiate the waiver by:
  - Completing and sending a signed form (Form 3) to the **Attorney General**.

### **Conditions**
