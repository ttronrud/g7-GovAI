   On July 23, 2012, the Government of Canada established a list of entities believed to be involved in terrorism under **section 83.05(1)b** of the *Criminal Code*.

   Section 83.05(9)d mandates that the Minister conduct a periodic review of the list. Specifically, the Minister must assess whether there are still **reasonable grounds to believe** that each listed entity continues to engage in or support terrorist activities.

3. **Governor in Council Approval:**  
   The recommendation from the Minister is submitted to **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, who formally approves the continuation of the list. This step ensures parliamentary accountability and democratic oversight.
