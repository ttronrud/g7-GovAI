**Detailed Summary of the Bottled Domestic Spirits Remission Order**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

The *Bottled Domestic Spirits Remission Order* is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. It was made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of three key federal government bodies:

- The **Minister of National Revenue**  
- The **Minister of Finance**  
- The **Treasury Board**

This order is rooted in a public interest consideration, specifically aimed at facilitating the efficient and lawful movement of domestically produced spirits through specific supply and export channels—particularly in cases involving bottling, reprocessing, or export.

The Order is formally cited as:  
**Bottled Domestic Spirits Remission Order**  
(S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4)

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

1. **Agency**  
   Refers to any government body (such as a provincial board, commission, or agency) that has legal authority under provincial law to **sell or authorize the sale and delivery of spirits**.  
   *(Note: This includes provincial entities with regulatory or distribution responsibilities for alcoholic beverages.)*

2. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of National Revenue**, who is responsible for administering excise regulations and processing claims for remission.

3. **Spirits**  
   Defined broadly as **any material or substance**, in liquid or any other form, that contains **any proportion (by mass or volume) of absolute ethyl alcohol (C₂H₅OH)**, **excluding beer or malt liquor**.  
   *(This includes distilled spirits such as whisky, gin, vodka, rum, and other fermented and distilled alcohols.)*

### **Main Provisions: Remission of Excise Duty**

Under this Order, **excise duty paid or payable** by a **licensed distiller** on domestic spirits may be **remitted** (i.e., waived or refunded) under specific conditions, effective **September 1, 1984**.

#### **Eligible Situations for Remission**

Remission is granted when domestic spirits—bottled by an *agency* for a licensed distiller—are used in one of the following scenarios:

1. **Exported**  
   - The bottled spirits are shipped abroad (exported) from Canada.  
   - The duty paid at the time of bottling is waived because the spirits are leaving the country.

2. **Returned to the Licensed Distiller’s Excise Bonding Warehouse**  
   - The spirits are returned to the distiller’s designated **excise bonding warehouse**.  
   - This return must occur **under the supervision of an excise officer**.  
   - The purpose is likely to allow for reprocessing, re-bottling, or re-sale within Canada.

3. **Sold to an Agency and Entered into the Agency’s Excise Bonding Warehouse**  
   - The spirits are sold to a government agency (e.g., a provincial liquor board).  
   - The sale must be followed by entry of the spirits into that agency’s **excise bonding warehouse**, again under the **supervision of an excise officer**.  
   - This provision supports the agency’s role in managing distribution and storage of spirits for public or official use.

4. **Delivered to a Customs Bonded Warehouse and Designated as Ships’ Stores**  
   - The spirits are delivered to a **customs bonded warehouse** (a facility under customs control).  
   - They are designated specifically as **ships’ stores** (i.e., for use by vessels at sea).  
   - This applies to cases where spirits are destined for use on commercial or government vessels, such as naval or commercial ships.

### **Conditions for Remission**

The remission of excise duty is **not automatic**. It is conditional upon:

- A **formal claim** being submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue**.  
- The claim must be made in **a form and manner prescribed by the Minister**.  
  - This ensures consistency, transparency, and administrative control over the remission process.  
  - The Minister has discretion over the format (e.g., application form, supporting documentation, required declarations).

This requirement protects the integrity of the excise system by ensuring that only legitimate and properly documented cases receive remission.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order was introduced to:

- Facilitate the **efficient movement of domestically produced spirits** through the supply chain.  
- Support **provincial agencies** in managing distribution, especially in cases involving reprocessing, resale, or export.  
- Avoid **double taxation or unjust excise burdens** when spirits are temporarily moved or reprocessed.  
- Maintain compliance with excise regulations while allowing flexibility in operations.

By allowing remission in specific, clearly defined scenarios, the government ensures that the excise system remains both **flexible and accountable**.
