**Detailed Summary of the Deep Panuke Offshore Production Platform Remission Order, 2007**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulation is issued under the authority of *section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which empowers the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to grant remission of customs duties for specific goods imported into Canada under exceptional circumstances—particularly those related to national economic development, energy infrastructure, or strategic public interest.

**Purpose of the Order:**
The Deep Panuke Offshore Production Platform Remission Order, 2007, grants a **customs duty remission** for a specific floating production platform used in the **Deep Panuke Offshore Gas Development Project**, located off the southeast coast of Nova Scotia. This project is part of Canada’s offshore natural gas exploration and production initiatives.

**Subject of Remission:**
- The remitted goods are a **floating production platform**.
- The platform is classified under **tariff item 8905.20.20** of the Customs Tariff Act.
  - This classification generally pertains to "floating offshore structures, including production platforms, used in the extraction of oil or gas from offshore sources."

**Scope of Remission:**
- The remission applies to **customs duties that have already been paid or are otherwise payable** in respect of the imported platform.
- The remission is not a reduction in the value of the goods or a waiver of taxes on the platform’s market value; rather, it specifically offsets the customs duty that would otherwise be levied under the tariff classification.

**Conditions for Eligibility:**
The remission is not automatic and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **Evidence Requirement:**  
   The importer must provide **such evidence as may be reasonably required by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** to verify eligibility for the remission. This may include:
   - Technical specifications of the platform.
   - Project documentation (e.g., feasibility studies, environmental assessments).
   - Proof of the platform’s role in the Deep Panuke Offshore Gas Development Project.
   - Demonstrations of compliance with federal and provincial energy development policies.

2. **Timely Claim Submission:**  
   The importer must **submit a formal claim for remission to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (then the responsible minister for border and trade-related matters) **no later than December 31, 2012**.  
   - This deadline is significant and imposes a strict administrative time limit, indicating that the remission was intended to be a one-time, time-bound incentive tied to a specific phase of project development.

**Effective Date:**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws and regulations). This ensures legal validity and enforceability upon formal notification.

**Strategic and Economic Context:**
- The Deep Panuke project was a key component of Canada’s offshore energy strategy in the early 2000s, aiming to develop natural gas resources in Nova Scotia’s offshore waters.
- The remission reflects a government policy of supporting **strategic energy infrastructure development** by reducing financial burdens on capital-intensive offshore projects.
- By exempting the platform from customs duties, the government facilitates faster deployment and reduces the cost of entry for such critical infrastructure.

**Limitations and Implications:**
- The remission is **limited in scope**—it applies only to the specific platform and the specific project.
- It does not extend to other floating structures or other offshore projects unless separately authorized.
- The requirement for a claim submission before December 31, 2012, suggests that the remission may have been designed to incentivize timely project implementation and financing.

**Conclusion:**
The Deep Panuke Offshore Production Platform Remission Order, 2007, is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure that provides a duty exemption for a critical piece of offshore energy infrastructure. It demonstrates the use of the Customs Tariff Act’s remission provisions to support national energy development goals, particularly in the context of offshore natural gas exploration. The conditions—particularly the requirement for evidence and the strict deadline—ensure accountability and prevent misuse of the remission mechanism.

This regulation remains a notable example of how Canadian trade and customs policy can be adapted to support strategic public infrastructure projects in the energy sector.
