**Detailed Summary of the CPFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **CPFTA Tariff Preference Regulations** were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision empowers the federal government to establish rules governing tariff preferences under international trade agreements, specifically the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA).

- **Statutory Source**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)*: This refers to the enabling clause in the *Customs Tariff Act*, which allows for the creation of tariff preference regulations based on trade agreements.  
  - *S.C. 1997, c. 36*: Likely a reference to a prior enabling statute or related legislation that supports the regulatory framework.

### **2. Definition of "Originating" Goods**

A key concept in these regulations is the definition of **"originating" goods**:

> **"Originating" means qualifying as originating in the territory of a Party under the rules of origin set out in Chapter Three (Rules of Origin) of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement, signed on May 29, 2008.**

- This means that for goods to be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the CPFTA, they must meet the specific **rules of origin** established in Chapter Three of the agreement.
- These rules typically assess whether goods have undergone sufficient transformation or processing in Canada or Peru to qualify as "originating" (i.e., produced or manufactured in one of the two Parties).
- The rules of origin are critical because only originating goods are entitled to reduced or zero tariffs when traded between Canada and Peru.

### **3. Eligibility for Peru Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the *Customs Tariff*, goods exported from **Peru to Canada** are entitled to the benefit of the **Peru Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff treatment) if they meet one of the following two conditions:

#### **Condition 1: Direct Shipments Without Transit Through Another Country**

If the goods are shipped directly from Peru to Canada **without passing through any other country**, the importer is entitled to preferential treatment **if**:

- The shipment is made on a **through bill of lading**, OR  
- If there is **no through bill of lading**, the importer provides, **upon request by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly shows the **shipping route**; and  
  - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada.

> This provision ensures transparency and traceability of the shipment path, even in the absence of a formal through bill of lading.

#### **Condition 2: Shipments Through Another Country**

If the goods are shipped **through another country** (i.e., transshipped), the importer must provide, upon request by a customs officer:

1. **Documentary evidence** that:
   - Shows the **shipping route** and **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada; and  
2. A **copy of the customs control documents** that demonstrate the goods remained **under customs control** during their stay in the third country.

> The requirement that goods remain under customs control ensures that the goods did not undergo unauthorized processing or re-export, which could disqualify them from preferential treatment.

### **4. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 42 of the Canada-Peru Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 16 of the Statutes of Canada 2009) comes into force.

- This section is the legal mechanism that activates the full implementation of the CPFTA, including the application of tariff preferences and the rules of origin.
- The regulations were officially **in force on August 1, 2009**, as noted in the footnote (SI/2009-67 – Statutory Instrument 2009-67).

### **5. Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Promotes Trade Between Canada and Peru**:  
  By providing preferential tariff treatment to originating goods, the regulations encourage trade flows between Canada and Peru, reducing trade barriers and lowering costs for exporters and importers.

- **Ensures Compliance with Rules of Origin**:  
  The regulations ensure that only goods that meet the agreed-upon rules of origin (as defined in Chapter Three of the CPFTA) receive preferential treatment, preventing misuse or fraud.

- **Provides Flexibility in Documentation**:  
  The rules allow for both formal (through bill of lading) and informal (documentary evidence) methods of proving shipment routes, making it easier for businesses to comply, especially in complex international logistics.

- **Protects the Integrity of the Trade Agreement**:  
  The requirement for customs control documentation during transshipment prevents goods from being re-exported or processed outside the intended trade flow, preserving the authenticity of the origin claim.

### **6. Conclusion**

The **CPFTA Tariff Preference Regulations** establish a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework for determining when goods shipped from Peru to Canada can benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement. By defining the conditions under which goods qualify as "originating" and outlining specific documentation requirements, the regulations ensure that preferential treatment is granted fairly and in accordance with the agreed rules of origin.

These rules support Canada’s broader trade policy objectives, including deepening economic ties with Latin America, promoting fair competition, and facilitating smoother international supply chains.
