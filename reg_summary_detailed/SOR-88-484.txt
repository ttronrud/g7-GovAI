This regulation, officially titled the *Montreal Port Warden’s Tariff of Fees Order (1988)*, was issued under the authority of:

- **Section 28 and Section 33** of *An Act to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to the office of Port Warden for the Harbour of Montreal* (commonly referred to as the Port Warden Act).

This Order serves to **repeal** the previous tariff established by **Order in Council P.C. 1985-3546**, dated December 5, 1985, and to **replace it** with a new tariff established by the **Council of the Board of Trade at the City of Montreal**, on the recommendation of the **Board of Examiners**.

All fees are due **at the time the service is rendered**, and the master or owner of the vessel is responsible for payment.

| **Final inspection and certificate** | Not specified | Issued after loading is complete |
| **Loading of timber on deck** | Not specified | Special handling due to weight and stability concerns |

| **Readiness to load inspection** | Not specified | Same as above |
| **Final inspection and certificate** | Not specified | Same as above |
| **Lanoraie, Contrecoeur Wharf, Longue Pointe or Pointe aux Trembles** | **$0.02 per hour (minimum 50 minutes, maximum $300.00)** | **Fee for wharf usage**:<br> - **First hour or part thereof**: $0.02 (minimum 50 minutes)<br> - **Each additional hour or part thereof**: $0.02 (capped at $300.00 maximum per vessel) |

> **Note on the $0.02 per tonne fee**:  
> The fee of **$0.02 per tonne loaded** for final inspection and certificate is a significant component of the tariff. It ensures that the Port Warden is compensated for the labor and administrative oversight involved in verifying cargo safety and compliance. The fee is **per tonne**, making it scalable with cargo volume.

> **Note on Wharf Usage Fees**:  
> The fee for using specific wharf locations (Lanoraie, Contrecoeur, Longue Pointe, Pointe aux Trembles) is **time-based**, with a **minimum of 50 minutes** counted as a full hour. This prevents undercharging for short visits. The **maximum cap of $300.00** ensures that no vessel is charged excessively for extended use, even if multiple hours are required.

### **6. Key Features and Implications**

- **Transparency**: The tariff clearly defines services and associated fees, promoting transparency for vessel operators.
- **Accountability**: Fees are due at the time of service, reducing the risk of delay or dispute.
- **Standardization**: Provides uniformity in fee application across different types of cargo and vessels.
- **Municipal Oversight**: The Board of Trade (City of Montreal) now governs the tariff, reflecting a shift toward local port management and accountability.
- **Cost Control**: The **capping of fees at $300.00** for wharf usage prevents unreasonable charges and protects vessel operators from excessive costs.
- **Per-Tonne Pricing**: The $0.02 per tonne fee for final inspection ensures that larger vessels pay proportionally more, which is fair and scalable.

---

### **7. Limitations and Gaps**

- **Missing fee amounts** for many services (e.g., preliminary inspection, inspection report, master attendance) suggest that either:
  - These fees are either included in other items or are administratively managed separately.
  - The original schedule may have been incomplete or omitted in this version.
- The absence of specific dollar amounts for many services may lead to ambiguity or disputes unless supplemented by internal guidelines or policy.

### **8. Conclusion**

The *Montreal Port Warden’s Tariff of Fees Order (1988)* represents a significant update to the fee structure governing port operations in Montreal. By replacing the 1985 tariff with a more modern, transparent, and municipally managed system, it enhances fairness, accountability, and operational efficiency.

The key fees—particularly the **$0.02 per tonne** for final inspection and the **hourly wharf usage fee capped at $300.00**—are designed to balance the Port Warden’s need for compensation with the financial sustainability of vessel operators.

This Order remains a critical component of Montreal’s maritime regulatory framework, ensuring that port services are properly funded while maintaining compliance with safety, security, and environmental standards.
