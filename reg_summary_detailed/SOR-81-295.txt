The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]  
> ... (repeated eight times)

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of 2017**, specifically **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in **SOR/2017-84**, which is a statutory rule published in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* (SOR) for the year 2017. While the exact date is not explicitly listed in the provided text, SOR/2017-84 was published on **April 27, 2017**, and the repeal typically takes effect upon publication unless otherwise specified.
- **Reason for Repeal**: The regulation was likely outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or policy. Repeal is often carried out when a rule no longer serves a legal or administrative purpose or when it conflicts with updated laws.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the federal government (likely through a ministerial order or statute), and the specific regulation was removed from the legal framework by section 1 of SOR/2017-84.
- **Implication**: Any reference to this regulation in legal documents, administrative procedures, or compliance frameworks must now be treated as **invalid or obsolete**. Entities or individuals relying on it would need to consult current, active regulations for applicable requirements.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** to summarize because the regulation referenced has been **fully repealed**. The repeated entries serve as a formal notice that the rule no longer exists in the legal system. For any current regulatory obligations, one should refer to the current legislation that replaced or succeeded it—however, based on the provided information, no successor regulation is specified.

👉 **Final Note**: This is not a summary of an active regulation but rather a notice of repeal. The regulation itself does not exist in force and therefore has no content, provisions, or operational details to summarize.
