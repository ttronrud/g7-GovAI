**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 14 – Margarine for Personal Use**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation establishes a **General Import Permit (GIP No. 14)** issued by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs** under the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA), specifically *S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 106*. The permit authorizes the importation of **margarine into Canada** for **personal use**, subject to specific conditions and limitations.

The regulation is rooted in two key policy considerations:

1. **Margarine is on the Import Control List** – This means that margarine is subject to regulatory oversight and control under Canadian import laws.
2. **An import access quantity has been determined** – The Secretary of State has assessed and set a limit on how much margarine can be imported per individual, based on public health, trade, and economic considerations.

### **Legal Authority**

The permit is issued pursuant to **subsection 8.3(3)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*, which allows the Secretary of State to issue general permits for the importation of certain goods when specific conditions are met. This provision enables streamlined access to goods that are otherwise restricted, particularly for personal or household use.

The permit comes into force on the **latest of the following dates**:
- Section 74 of the *World Trade Organization (WTO) Implementation Act* (S.C. 1994, c. 47)
- Section 106 of the same Act
- Section 109 of the same Act

These sections relate to the implementation of WTO obligations and the framework for managing import controls. The permit is thus aligned with Canada’s international trade commitments.

> **Note**: This permit was **repealed** by *SOR/97-46, s. 2*, meaning it is no longer in effect as of the date of repeal (April 1, 1997). However, this summary reflects the content and structure of the original 1994 permit.

- Classified under:
  - **Tariff item No. 1517.10.10** or **1517.90.21**

### **Importation Rules**

Residents of Canada may import margarine **for personal use** and for the use of their household, under the following conditions:

#### **1. Standard Import Quantity (No Medical Prescription):**
- **Maximum of 3 kilograms (kg) in net weight per importation**

#### **2. Increased Quantity with Medical Prescription:**
- **Maximum of 12 kilograms (kg) in net weight per importation**
- **Only if** the importer has a **valid medical prescription** for margarine
- This exception is likely intended for individuals with medical conditions (e.g., dietary needs, cholesterol management, or specific health requirements) that necessitate higher consumption of margarine.

> The medical prescription requirement ensures that the increased import volume is justified and not used for commercial or non-personal purposes.

### **Reporting Requirements**

Any goods imported under this permit must be reported to customs in the prescribed form. The form must include one of the following statements:

- **In English**:  
  *"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 14 — Margarine for Personal Use"*

- **In French**:  
  *"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 14 — Margarine pour usage personnel"*

This ensures transparency and compliance with customs reporting obligations under the *Customs Act*.

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Consumer Access** | Allows Canadian residents to import margarine for personal or household use without needing a formal import permit for small quantities. |
| **Trade Compliance** | Aligns with WTO rules by allowing limited, non-commercial importation of a product that may otherwise be restricted. |
| **Health Considerations** | The medical prescription exception recognizes health-related needs, promoting access for individuals with specific dietary requirements. |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Maintains control over the importation of a product that could otherwise flood the market or pose public health risks. |

### **Important Notes**

- **Repeal Status**: This permit was **repealed on April 1, 1997**, under *SOR/97-46, section 2*. Therefore, **it is no longer valid or enforceable** in current Canadian law.
- **Replacement**: The repeal suggests that Canada has since moved toward a different regulatory framework for the importation of food products, possibly through the *Food and Drug Regulations* or other food safety legislation, which may now govern such imports.
- **Historical Significance**: This permit reflects early Canadian efforts to balance trade openness with public health and regulatory control in the post-WTO era.

### **Conclusion**

The **General Import Permit No. 14 – Margarine for Personal Use** was a targeted, temporary regulatory measure issued in 1994 to allow Canadian residents to import small quantities of margarine for personal consumption. It distinguished between standard and medically prescribed imports, ensuring both accessibility and regulatory oversight. While it served an important function in the context of early WTO implementation and domestic food policy, it has since been **repealed** and is **no longer in force**.

This regulation exemplifies how Canada balances international trade obligations with domestic consumer needs and health considerations in the management of food product imports.
