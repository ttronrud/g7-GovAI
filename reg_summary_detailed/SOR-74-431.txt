**Detailed Summary of the Teslin Exploration Limited Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority of the Order**
The *Teslin Exploration Limited Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Administrator in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)**, under **Vote No. 7a of Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**. This vote provides the financial authority necessary to approve the actions outlined in the Order.

The primary objectives of the Order are:
- To authorize the **transfer of specific Territorial Coal Licences** from **Teslin Exploration Limited** to **Vittorio Ghitti**.
- To **postpone repayment** of a financial obligation (the balance of a grant) owed by Teslin Exploration Limited to Her Majesty in right of Canada, under the *Northern Mineral Exploration Assistance Regulations*, until the licences are disposed of.

This Order may be cited as the **Teslin Exploration Limited Order**.

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Minister**: Refers to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, who has the authority to act under this Order.
- **Regulations**: Refers to the *Northern Mineral Exploration Assistance Regulations*, which govern the financial support and repayment obligations for companies engaged in mineral exploration in northern Canada.

### **3. Authorization for Transfer of Coal Licences**
Under **paragraph 11(c)** of the *Northern Mineral Exploration Assistance Regulations*, transfers of Territorial Coal Licences are generally not permitted. However, this Order **exempts** Teslin Exploration Limited from that restriction.

- **Transfer Authorized**: The Minister is authorized to consent to the transfer of the following **Territorial Coal Licences**:
  - Licence No. 10  
  - Licence No. 11  
  - Licence No. 12  

- **Recipient**: The transfer is to be made to **Vittorio Ghitti**, an individual or entity (not specified in the text).

> This exception allows for a significant deviation from standard regulatory requirements, permitting a change of ownership of these licences despite the usual prohibition.

### **4. Postponement of Repayment Obligations**
Under **paragraph 11(e)** of the *Northern Mineral Exploration Assistance Regulations*, Teslin Exploration Limited is required to repay the balance of the grant it received, plus **simple interest at 10% per annum**.

However, this Order **postpones** that repayment obligation **subject to specific conditions**:

- The repayment is deferred **until the disposition (sale, transfer, or other disposal)** of the following Territorial Coal Licences:
  - Licence No. 10  
  - Licence No. 11  
  - Licence No. 12  
  - Licence No. 15  
  - Licence No. 16  
  - Licence No. 17  

> This means that the company will not have to repay the grant amount (plus interest) until one or more of these licences are sold or otherwise transferred.

---

### **5. Written Undertaking Requirement**
To ensure accountability and compliance, the Order mandates that:

- **Teslin Exploration Limited** must provide a **written undertaking** to the Minister.
- This undertaking confirms that, upon the **disposition** of any of the licences listed above (Nos. 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17), the company will repay:
  - The **balance of the original grant** received under the Regulations
  - **Simple interest** at the rate of **10% per annum**, calculated from the date of the grant

> This ensures that the repayment obligation is not eliminated but is instead **conditioned on future disposal** of the licences, with a clear, enforceable commitment.

---

### **6. Legal and Financial Implications**
- The Order **modifies** the enforcement mechanisms of the *Northern Mineral Exploration Assistance Regulations*, allowing for flexibility in the face of specific circumstances (e.g., a change in ownership or business structure).
- It reflects a **government policy of supporting exploration and development** in northern territories, possibly in response to economic or strategic interests in coal resources.
- The repayment condition is **not a waiver** of the obligation—it is a **delay**, with a clear trigger (disposition of the licences) and a binding commitment.

---

### **7. Governance and Oversight**
- The decision is made by the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, with administrative approval from the Administrator in Council.
- The Order is based on a specific appropriation (Vote No. 7a), indicating that it is a **fiscally authorized** action, not a general policy change.
- The Minister retains oversight and authority to ensure compliance with the conditions of the Order.
