**Detailed Summary of Canadian Payments Association By-law No. 6 — Compliance**

---

### **Overview**

Canadian Payments Association By-law No. 6 — *Compliance* is a regulatory instrument established under the **Canadian Payments Act** (S.C. 2001, c. 9) and approved by the members of the Canadian Payments Association (CPA) at a members’ meeting. It was formally adopted on **June 25, 2003**, and came into force upon registration. This by-law governs the **processes for investigating and addressing contraventions** (non-compliance) by members and non-members of the CPA, particularly in relation to payment item handling, clearing, and settlement activities.

It establishes a structured, transparent, and fair framework for handling complaints, conducting investigations, imposing sanctions, and ensuring accountability within the payment systems operated by the CPA — especially the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS).

| **Item in dispute** | As defined in CPA Rule A6 — a payment item that has been challenged due to errors, discrepancies, or disputes. |
| **Non-member** | A local financial institution (e.g., bank or credit union) that is not a full member of the CPA but participates in the system through a clearing member. |
