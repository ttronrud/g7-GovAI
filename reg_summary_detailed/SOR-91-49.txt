Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation you provided, which governs the **reduction or offset of excise tax remittances by the amount of a refund or rebate** under the *Excise Tax Act*.

## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Reducing or Offsetting Excise Tax with Refunds or Rebates**

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**
- **Authority**: The regulation was made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under:
  - Subsection **228(7)** and **277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act*.
- **Objective**: To allow **corporations that are members of a closely related group** to **offset or reduce** the excise tax they are required to remit (or have already paid) by the amount of a **refund or rebate** that another member in the group is entitled to under the Act.
- **Key Principle**: Tax owed by one member can be reduced by the amount of a refund or rebate due to another member within the same group — promoting tax efficiency and avoiding double taxation among related entities.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation was **repealed** by *SOR/2002-277, s. 18*, meaning it is **no longer in force** as of the date of repeal. However, the summary remains relevant for historical or interpretive purposes.

- Excise tax **paid** under:

---

### **4. Prescribed Circumstances (When Offset Is Allowed)**

- All such corporations are considered **members** of the closely related group.

> ✅ Only corporate members can participate in the offset mechanism.

---

### **5. Prescribed Conditions (Requirements for Valid Offset)**

The following conditions must be met for the offset to be valid:

### **6. Prescribed Rules (Operational Requirements)**

#### **(a) Content of Applications**
- **Joint Application**: Must include information proving that **each applicant is a member** of the group.
- **Revised Application**: Must confirm that the newly added corporation is a **member** of the group.

#### **(b) When Offset Is Allowed**
- The tax remittable by a member may be reduced or offset by the amount of a refund or rebate (or portion thereof) from another member **during or after**:
  - The reporting period when the CRA acknowledges the joint or revised application.
- But **before** the earliest of the following:
  1. A reporting period when a corporation **ceases to be a member**.
  2. A reporting period when a member **fails to comply** with the Act or these regulations.
  3. A reporting period in which the coordinator files a **notice** stating that the members **no longer intend** to offset tax using refunds or rebates.

> This ensures the offset is only active during active, compliant participation.

#### **(c) Conditions for Filing a Direction**
A direction (i.e., instruction to apply a refund/rebate) may only be followed if:
- The member has **no tax to remit**, **or**
- The tax remittable by the member has **already been reduced or offset** under subsection 228(6) of the Act (i.e., by a refund or rebate due to the member).

> Prevents over-application or misuse of refunds.

#### **(d) Filing Requirements with the Minister**
The coordinator must file with the Minister:
- **All joint and revised applications**.
- **All directions, returns, and refund/rebate applications** for each reporting period, **together with a statement** that includes:
  - The **tax to be remitted** by each member.
  - The **amount of refund or rebate** each member is entitled to.
- Additionally, for each reporting period, a **list** must be filed that includes:
  - The **name of each member** entitled to a refund or rebate and the **content of their direction**.
  - The **name of each member** who may reduce or offset tax, and the **amount** of reduction.
  - The **order** in which refunds or rebates are applied to reduce tax (if multiple members are involved).

> Ensures transparency and accountability in the offset process.

#### **(e) Tax Remittance Obligations**
- The coordinator must **remit the tax** for each member.
- For members who reduce or offset tax via a direction:
  - The remittance amount is **adjusted downward** by the amount of the refund or rebate applied.

> Ensures accurate tax payment reflecting actual entitlements.

### **7. Application of Section 9 (Timing of Tax Payment Requirements)**

Section 9 of the *Excise Tax Act* applies to:
- Any amount required to be remitted for a reporting period that **ends after July 22, 2016**.
- Any amount required to be paid **after July 22, 2016**.

> This implies that the offset rules only apply to reporting periods and tax payments **post-July 22, 2016** — a likely adjustment to align with changes in tax administration or compliance timelines.

---

### **8. Key Implications and Practical Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Group Structure** | Requires a clearly defined group of **closely related corporations** (e.g., parent-subsidiary, joint ventures). |
| **Centralized Administration** | Only one entity (the coordinator) can manage all filings — simplifies compliance but increases reliance on that entity. |
| **CRA Acknowledgment is Mandatory** | Without CRA confirmation, no offset or direction is valid. This creates a procedural checkpoint. |
| **Transparency** | Detailed reporting is required — the CRA can verify how refunds are applied to reduce tax. |
| **Termination of Offset** | Members can choose to stop offsetting at any time via a formal notice. |
| **Compliance Risk** | Failure to meet any condition (e.g., no acknowledgment, non-compliance, overlapping groups) invalidates the offset. |
