**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
Transfer of Portions of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Regulations  
**Legal Basis:**  
- Made under subsection 123(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA)  
- Recommended by the Prime Minister  
- Approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council  

**Regulatory Text Reference:**  
S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13  
(These sections relate to the transfer of certain functions or units within the federal public service.)

**Key Provision:**  
The Governor General in Council, acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, formally transfers specific portions of the federal public administration within the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**. These portions are defined as:

1. **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**  
2. **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

**Applicability of Public Service Employment Act (PSEA):**  
Subsection 132(1) of the *Public Service Employment Act* applies to all individuals who are employed or engaged in the operations of these two units. This means that the employment conditions, terms, and rights of personnel in these units are governed by the PSEA, including provisions related to:

- Employment rights  
- Terms and conditions of service  
- Promotion, transfer, and disciplinary procedures  
- Public service standards and accountability  

This transfer ensures that the personnel and operational functions of these IT support units are subject to the same public service employment standards as other federal public service units, thereby maintaining consistency in employment practices and accountability across the federal government.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations come into force on **November 15, 2011**.  
All personnel in the designated units must comply with the new employment provisions from this date onward.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- The transfer reflects a reorganization of responsibilities within the CNSC to better align IT infrastructure and support services with broader public service standards.  
- It ensures that the technical and administrative staff responsible for managing email systems, data centres, and network services are governed by the same employment rules as other federal public servants.  
- This enhances transparency, fairness, and consistency in employment practices, particularly in terms of recruitment, compensation, and performance management.  
- It also supports the integration of these units into the broader federal public service framework, promoting efficiency and compliance with federal employment legislation.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formalizes the transfer of specific IT support units within the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission into the federal public service framework. By applying the Public Service Employment Act (specifically subsection 132(1)), it ensures that employees in these units are protected under standard public service employment laws, reinforcing accountability, equity, and administrative coherence within the federal government.
