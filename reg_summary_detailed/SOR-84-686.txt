**Detailed Summary of the N.H.A. Designated Areas Order (S.C. 1983-84, c. 26)**

---

### **Overview**

The *N.H.A. Designated Areas Order* (S.C. 1983–84, c. 26), made under the authority of the **National Housing Act (N.H.A.)**, designates specific geographic areas across Canada as **"designated areas"** for the purposes of certain provisions of the Act. This Order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Works**, pursuant to:

- **Section 60** of the National Housing Act (which empowers the Governor General to make orders to designate areas), and  
- The **definition of "designated area"** in **Section 2** of the Act.

The Order may be cited as the **N.H.A. Designated Areas Order**.

---

### **Purpose of the Designation**

The primary purpose of designating these areas is to determine which regions qualify under specific provisions of the National Housing Act, particularly those related to:

- **Housing affordability and development**
- **Federal housing program eligibility and funding**
- **Municipal and regional housing policy implementation**

The designated areas are specifically relevant to the following subsections of the National Housing Act:

- **Section 34.121(2)** – Likely related to housing assistance or funding eligibility for low-income individuals or families.
- **Section 34.161(2)** – Possibly concerning housing for seniors or specific vulnerable groups.
- **Section 34.17(1)** – May relate to housing development or land use policies in rural or remote areas.
- **Section 55(7)** – Could pertain to the provision of housing for persons with disabilities or special needs.

These provisions may involve federal funding, housing program access, or regulatory treatment that differs for areas classified as "designated" versus non-designated.

### **Scope of the Designation**

The Order applies to **all provinces and territories** in Canada, with the exception of areas that are within the boundaries of an incorporated **city, metropolitan area, town, or village** that has a **population exceeding 5,000**.

#### **Key Criteria for Designation:**

1. **Population Threshold**:  
   - Only areas **outside** of incorporated urban centers with a population **over 5,000** are designated.
   - The population threshold is based on the **most recent decennial census** conducted under the *Statistics Act*.

2. **Exclusion Rule**:  
   - Any area **within** the boundaries of a city, metropolitan area, town, or village that has a population of **5,000 or more** is **not** considered a designated area.

3. **Geographic Coverage**:  
   The Order applies to the following jurisdictions:

   - **Provinces**:
     - Newfoundland
     - Nova Scotia
     - New Brunswick
     - Prince Edward Island
     - Quebec
     - Ontario
     - Manitoba
     - Saskatchewan
     - Alberta
     - British Columbia

   - **Territories**:
     - Yukon Territory
     - Northwest Territories

### **Key Interpretation and Implications**

- **"All that portion"** of each province or territory **outside** the boundaries of qualifying urban centers is considered a designated area.  
  This means that rural, remote, or sparsely populated regions — even if they are part of a larger administrative region — are included if they fall outside a municipality with over 5,000 residents.

- **Urban centers with ≥5,000 population** are excluded from the designation.  
  This implies that large cities (e.g., Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal) are not subject to the specific housing provisions tied to "designated areas" — because their urban cores are explicitly excluded.

- **Decennial Census Basis**:  
  The designation is not based on real-time or annual data but on the **most recent full census** (i.e., every 10 years). This ensures consistency and avoids frequent re-evaluation of boundaries.

- **Applicability is Limited to Specific Provisions**:  
  The designation only affects the four subsections listed above (34.121(2), 34.161(2), 34.17(1), and 55(7)). It does not broadly alter housing policy or funding across all sections of the Act.

### **Examples (Illustrative)**

- In **Ontario**, rural regions such as parts of northern Ontario or remote communities like Hearst or North Bay (if outside a city with >5,000 residents) would be designated areas.
- In **British Columbia**, areas outside the boundaries of Vancouver, Calgary, or Victoria (which all exceed 5,000 residents) would be designated.
- In **Yukon**, areas outside Whitehorse or other incorporated towns with populations above 5,000 would qualify.

Conversely, **Vancouver** or **Montreal** — as incorporated cities with populations well over 5,000 — are **excluded** from the designation.

---

### **Legal Authority and Process**

- The Order is issued under **Section 60** of the National Housing Act, which allows the federal government to make orders to define areas for administrative or policy purposes.
- The definition of "designated area" in **Section 2** of the Act provides the legal basis for the criteria used (i.e., areas outside incorporated municipalities with ≥5,000 population).
- The Minister of Public Works recommends the Order, indicating that the designation is part of a broader federal housing strategy focused on **rural and remote communities**.

---

### **Significance and Policy Context**

This Order reflects a federal policy intent to:

- Target **funding and support programs** toward **non-urban, rural, and remote areas** where housing needs may be greater due to geographic isolation, limited services, or economic challenges.
- Differentiate between **urban centers** (which have more developed infrastructure and services) and **rural or sparsely populated areas** (which may require special housing interventions).
- Ensure equitable access to federal housing programs across Canada, particularly in regions with historically underfunded housing systems.

### **Conclusion**

The *N.H.A. Designated Areas Order* establishes a clear, population-based, and geographically defined framework for identifying areas in Canada that fall under specific federal housing provisions. By excluding urban centers with populations exceeding 5,000 and including all surrounding rural or unincorporated areas, the Order ensures that **federal housing policies and funding mechanisms are targeted toward underserved, remote, and rural populations**.

This designation remains **static** until updated by a new decennial census, meaning it is subject to change only when new population data becomes available — ensuring stability and predictability in housing program eligibility.
