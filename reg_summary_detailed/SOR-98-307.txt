**Detailed Summary of the "Definition of 'Wireless Transmission System' Regulations"**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Definition of "Wireless Transmission System" Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry. This action was authorized under **subsection 68.1(5)a of the Copyright Act**. The regulation serves to define a specific term—“wireless transmission system”—for the purposes of copyright law, particularly in relation to the rights of performers and rights holders in the context of radio broadcasting.

**Regulatory Text and Definition**  
The regulation defines the term **"wireless transmission system"** as follows:

> A *wireless transmission system* means a system operated by a terrestrial radio station that transmits in analog or digital mode a signal containing performers’ performances of musical works or sound recordings embodying the performers’ performances, in analog or digital form, whether in the A.M. or F.M. frequency band or in any other range assigned by the Minister under section 5 of the Radiocommunication Act, without artificial guide for free reception by the public.

**Key Elements of the Definition**  

1. **Operator**: The system must be operated by a **terrestrial radio station**.  
   - This excludes satellite, cable, or internet-based transmission systems.  
   - The focus is on traditional over-the-air broadcasting.

2. **Transmission Mode**: The signal may be transmitted in either **analog or digital mode**.  
   - This ensures inclusivity of both legacy and modern broadcasting technologies.

3. **Content of Transmission**: The signal must contain:
   - **Performers’ performances of musical works**, or  
   - **Sound recordings** that embody such performances.  
   - This refers specifically to the actual performance of music (e.g., a live concert or recorded song) by artists or performers.

4. **Frequency Bands**: Transmission may occur in:
   - **A.M. (Amplitude Modulation)** or **F.M. (Frequency Modulation)** bands, or  
   - Any other frequency range assigned by the **Minister under section 5 of the Radiocommunication Act**.  
   - This provision allows for future expansion to include other authorized radio spectrum allocations.

5. **Free Reception (No Artificial Guide)**:  
   - The signal must be received **freely by the public** without requiring an artificial guide (such as a tuning dial, set-top box, or subscription-based service).  
   - The absence of an artificial guide means the signal is accessible directly through a standard radio receiver, such as a household radio.  
   - This distinguishes the regulation from systems that require special equipment or paid access (e.g., digital radio with encryption or subscription services).

**Purpose and Legal Context**  
This definition is critical under **section 68.1 of the Copyright Act**, which governs the rights of performers in relation to the broadcasting of their performances. Specifically, it clarifies what constitutes a "wireless transmission system" for the purposes of determining when performers’ rights are triggered.  

By defining this term, the regulation ensures that:
- Radio broadcasters are clearly identified as users of a "wireless transmission system" when they transmit live or recorded musical performances via terrestrial signals.
- Performers (and their rights holders) are entitled to royalties or compensation when their performances are broadcast through such systems.
- The scope of protection is limited to **public, free reception** via standard radio receivers, thereby excluding systems that require user intervention or payment.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations came into force on **May 28, 1998**. This date marks when the definition became legally binding and applicable for enforcement under the Copyright Act.

**Significance**  
These regulations help establish a clear, legally enforceable boundary between:
- **Broadcasting via free, terrestrial radio** (which triggers performer rights),
- And **other forms of transmission** (such as cable, satellite, or internet streaming), which may fall outside the scope of this definition.

They also support the Canadian copyright framework by ensuring that performers are fairly compensated when their music is broadcast over the airwaves, especially in the context of evolving broadcasting technologies.

**Conclusion**  
The *Definition of "Wireless Transmission System" Regulations* provide a precise and legally grounded definition of a terrestrial radio transmission system that broadcasts performers’ musical performances to the public without requiring special equipment or payment. This definition is essential for the proper application of performer rights under section 68.1 of the Copyright Act and helps protect the economic interests of performers in the context of public radio broadcasting. The regulation remains relevant as a foundational element in Canadian copyright law related to radio transmission.
