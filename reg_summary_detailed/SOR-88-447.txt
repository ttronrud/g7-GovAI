### **Detailed Summary of the Kingston Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

The **Kingston Airport Zoning Regulations** were enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Sections 4.4 and 4.5**. 

- On **January 23 and 30, 1988**, and again on **March 26 and 27, 1986**, a proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in:
  - *Canada Gazette, Part I* (official federal publication)
  - *Kingston Whig-Standard* (a local newspaper)

This publication provided **public notice** and a **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., residents, businesses, environmental groups) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, formally adopted and promulgated the final regulations.

---

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Title**: *Kingston Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability**: The regulations apply to all lands **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kingston Airport**, as specifically defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.
- These lands include **public road allowances** and surrounding properties.

> The regulations are designed to ensure **flight safety**, **airfield visibility**, and **protection from hazards** such as bird attraction or obstructions.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Kingston Airport located in the County of Frontenac, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point at an elevation of **91 meters above sea level**. It is located 340.0 meters east of a point 920.5 meters south of the northern end of runway 01–19. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. It ensures clear visibility for aircraft during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 91 m + 45 m = 136 m), but **not less than 9 meters above ground level** if the terrain is lower. |
| **Strip** | The designated runway and adjacent area used for takeoff and landing, including taxiways. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. |

#### **4. Regulatory Provisions**

##### **4.1 Prohibition on Obstruction**

No person may:
- Construct or erect any **building, structure, or object**
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object  
on land subject to these regulations  
**if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

- The **approach surfaces**  
- The **outer surface**  
- The **transitional surfaces**

> This rule ensures that no physical obstruction (e.g., trees, towers, buildings) interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

##### **4.2 Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:
  - Remove or trim the excessive growth.

> This prevents uncontrolled tree growth from creating hazards during flight operations.

##### **4.3 Prohibition of Bird Attractants**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use land for **disposal of waste** that is:
    - **Edible** to birds
    - **Attractive to birds**

> This helps reduce bird strikes, a major aviation safety risk.

#### **5. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**  
- Coordinates:  
  - 340.0 m east of a point 920.5 m south of the **northern end of runway 01–19**  
- Elevation: **91 meters above sea level**

> This point serves as the origin for measuring all other surfaces.

---

##### **B. Approach Surfaces (Four in total)**

These are **inclined planes** extending from each end of the runway strips (01–19 and 06–24):

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Approach 01** | - Inclined at **1:50** (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)<br>- Rises to a horizontal line **15,000 m** from the end of the strip<br>- Outer ends: **2,400 m** from centerline<br>- Final elevation: **300 m above strip end elevation** |
| **Approach 19** | - Same as Approach 01 (1:50 ratio)<br>- 15,000 m horizontal distance<br>- 2,400 m from centerline<br>- 300 m above strip end elevation |
| **Approach 06** | - Inclined at **1:40** (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal)<br>- Rises to a horizontal line **1,744 m** from the end<br>- Outer ends: **249.4 m** from centerline<br>- Final elevation: **43.6 m above strip end elevation** |
| **Approach 24** | - Identical to Approach 06 (1:40 ratio)<br>- 1,744 m horizontal distance<br>- 249.4 m from centerline<br>- 43.6 m above strip end elevation |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach and landing.

---

##### **C. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 91 m + 45 m = **136 m**)
- However, **if the ground is below 9 meters**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**
- Ensures a safe buffer zone around the airport in all directions

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object in the surrounding area.

---

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal)
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces
- Continue upward until they intersect with:
  - The outer surface
  - Or another transitional surface of an adjacent runway strip

> These surfaces connect the approach zones to the outer buffer and ensure smooth, uninterrupted visibility for aircraft.

---

#### **6. Boundary of Regulated Lands**

The regulated area is defined by a detailed **geometric boundary** (in survey terms) drawn on **Kingston Airport Zoning Plan No. 10-009-84-89**, dated **February 14, 1985**, across multiple sheets (1 to 18).

The boundary follows a complex path involving:

- **Lots and concessions** in the Townships of Ernestown and Kingston
- **Road allowances** (public rights-of-way)
- **Railway right-of-way** (Canadian National Railway, Toronto to Montreal line)
- **Highways**: King’s Highway No. 2 and Highway No. 33 (The Bath Road)
- **Land parcels** (e.g., Blocks 79, 85)
- **Municipal boundaries** between the Township of Kingston and the City of Kingston
- **Lake Ontario** (southern boundary)

> The boundary is described using **azimuths, distances, and UTM coordinates** (e.g., N 4,913,641.07, E 368,717.13), ensuring precise spatial delineation.

#### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of the Kingston Airport Zoning Regulations are:

1. **Ensure Flight Safety**  
   - Prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

2. **Maintain Visibility**  
   - Guarantee unimpeded visibility for pilots using the airport’s runways.

3. **Protect Against Bird Hazards**  
   - Eliminate food sources and waste that attract birds, reducing the risk of bird strikes.

4. **Preserve Airspace Integrity**  
   - Establish clear height and spatial boundaries to maintain the integrity of the airport’s operational environment.

5. **Public and Environmental Protection**  
   - Balance aviation safety with land use planning and environmental stewardship.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive vegetation
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions
  - Issue notices or penalties where necessary

- The regulations are **binding** on all landowners and occupiers within the defined boundary.

---

#### **9. Jurisdiction and Authority**

- Enacted under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister to establish zoning rules for airports.
- The **Governor in Council** (federal cabinet) approved the regulations based on the Minister’s recommendation.
