### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Repeal and Replacement of Crown Corporation Borrowing and General Regulations (SOR/84-742 and SOR/84-743, 1984)**

This regulation, issued under the **Financial Administration Act (Act)**, formally **repeals two outdated Orders in Council** from 1984:

- *Crown Corporation Borrowing Regulations* (P.C. 1984-3093)  
- *Crown Corporation General Regulations* (P.C. 1984-3094)

It replaces them with **new, updated regulations** that provide modern governance frameworks for Crown corporations in areas such as **borrowing, property disposal, remuneration, by-laws, and exemptions** from certain provisions of the Financial Administration Act. These updated rules were introduced to align with evolving financial practices, corporate governance standards, and accountability requirements.

The regulation is now **repealed in full** by **SOR/2022-257, s. 2**, meaning it is no longer in force as of the date of that repeal. However, this summary provides a comprehensive analysis of its **original content, structure, purpose, and key provisions** as they existed at the time of issuance.
