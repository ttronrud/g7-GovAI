**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–4**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**
This exemption order was issued under the authority of **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act** (R.S.C., c. R-2), as recommended by the **Minister of Industry** and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**. It is a temporary regulatory exemption allowing specific use of radio equipment that would otherwise be prohibited under the Radiocommunication Act.

The order is specifically designed to permit **interference or obstruction of radiocommunications** in certain circumstances related to **security, safety, or international relations**, during a defined period and geographic area.

---

### **2. Scope of the Exemption**
The exemption applies **only to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, acting on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada.

#### **Duration**
- The exemption is **temporary**, effective from **May 28, 2010**, to **May 31, 2010** (a period of four days).
- This limited timeframe indicates a **targeted, short-term operation**, likely for a specific national security or emergency event.

#### **Geographic Limitation**
The exemption is restricted to a specific quadrilateral region within the province of **Ontario**, defined by four geographic coordinates:

1. **43°22′44″ N, 79°24′50″ W**  
2. **43°57′31″ N, 79°39′06″ W**  
3. **45°33′21″ N, 75°41′11″ W**  
4. **44°18′51″ N, 75°00′42″ W**

This area covers parts of central and southern Ontario, including regions near major cities such as **Toronto, London, and Hamilton**, and extends into the northern parts of the province. The boundaries suggest a strategic zone of operational focus, possibly involving border security, emergency response, or coordination with international agencies.

> **Note:** The area is not the entire province, nor does it extend beyond Ontario. This ensures that the exemption is geographically contained and minimizes unintended interference with civilian or commercial radio services.

### **3. Conditions for Exemption**

#### **(a) Subsection 4(1) Exemption (Interference with Radiocommunications)**
- The exemption applies **only if**:
  - The radio apparatus is installed, operated, or possessed **specifically to interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication**.
  - Such interference is conducted **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The purpose of the interference must be one of the following:
  - **Security**
  - **Safety**
  - **International relations**

> This means that the RCMP must have a legitimate, authorized reason tied directly to national security, public safety, or diplomatic concerns.

#### **(b) Paragraph 9(1)(b) Exemption (Obstruction of Radiocommunications)**
- The exemption applies **only if**:
  - The radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed **for the purposes of security, safety, or international relations**.

> This reinforces that the interference must serve a clear, justified public interest and not be used arbitrarily or for commercial or political purposes.

---

### **4. Principle of Minimization**
To ensure responsible and accountable use of the exemption, the order mandates that **every reasonable effort** be made to:

- **Constrain the physical area** of interference to the **smallest possible zone**.
- Limit the **number of frequencies** affected.
- Reduce the **duration** of interference to the **minimum required** to achieve the intended objective.

> This provision is critical in balancing national security needs with the protection of essential communication infrastructure (e.g., emergency services, transportation, public utilities). It ensures that the exemption is not abused and that civilian and public communications are not unnecessarily disrupted.

---

### **5. Enforcement and Oversight**
- The exemption is **not a blanket authorization**. It is strictly governed by the stated conditions and purposes.
- The RCMP is responsible for ensuring compliance with the rules of the order.
- The order does **not authorize** any form of unauthorized jamming or interference outside the defined parameters.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the appropriate government body (typically the Department of Industry or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission — CRTC, depending on context).

> This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal publication, allowing prompt action when required.

---

### **7. Purpose and Rationale**
This exemption was likely issued in response to a **specific national security or emergency situation**—such as:
- A threat to critical infrastructure (e.g., communications during a cyberattack or terrorist incident),
- A need to protect sensitive diplomatic communications,
- A coordinated response to a natural disaster or public safety emergency involving communication disruptions.

The temporary nature and geographic limitation reflect a **risk-based, necessity-driven approach** to regulating radio interference under the Radiocommunication Act.

---

### **8. Key Legal and Policy Implications**
- **Balances Freedom and Security**: The order demonstrates how Canada can maintain regulatory control over radio spectrum while allowing emergency or security-related exceptions.
- **Prevents Abuse**: The requirement to minimize interference helps prevent misuse and protects the rights of the public to access essential communication services.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The clear conditions and limitations ensure that the exemption is not used as a tool for political or commercial interference.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order No. 2010–4** is a **temporary, narrowly defined, and purpose-limited exemption** that allows the RCMP to interfere with or obstruct radio communications in a specific geographic region of Ontario during a short period (May 28–31, 2010), solely for the purposes of **security, safety, or international relations**.

It operates under strict conditions, including the **principle of minimization**, to ensure that such interference is both necessary and proportionate. This order exemplifies Canada’s regulatory framework for balancing national security imperatives with the broader public interest in reliable and secure communications.

> **Note**: This exemption is **not retroactive** and is **not available for future use without further legislative or ministerial approval**. It is a one-time, event-specific authorization.
