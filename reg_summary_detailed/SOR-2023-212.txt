**Detailed Summary of the Direct Shipment (Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff, General Preferential Tariff, etc.) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Direct Shipment (Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff, General Preferential Tariff, General Preferential Tariff Plus, Least Developed Country Tariff, Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff, Australia Tariff and New Zealand Tariff) Regulations* are made under subsection 17(2) of the *Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 36). This regulatory instrument was enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. The purpose of these regulations is to define and operationalize the conditions under which goods imported into Canada from designated "beneficiary countries" may qualify for preferential tariff treatment—specifically, the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN), General Preferential Tariff (GPT), General Preferential Tariff Plus (GPT+), Least Developed Country (LDC) Tariff, Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff, Australia Tariff, and New Zealand Tariff—by establishing the criteria for "direct shipment."

**Key Definitions**

- **Beneficiary Country**:  
  A country or territory that is eligible for preferential tariff treatment under one of the following tariff schemes:
  - Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Tariff  
  - General Preferential Tariff (GPT)  
  - General Preferential Tariff Plus (GPT+)  
  - Least Developed Country (LDC) Tariff  
  - Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff  
  - Australia Tariff  
  - New Zealand Tariff  

  This definition ensures that only goods originating from these designated countries can benefit from the preferential tariff treatment under the direct shipment regime.

**Definition of "Direct Shipment" (Under Subsection 17(1) of the Customs Tariff)**

For goods to qualify as "shipped directly" from a beneficiary country to Canada, the importer must meet specific conditions depending on whether the shipment is **direct** (without transshipment) or **through** (involving an intermediate country).

### 1. **Shipment Without Transshipment (Direct Shipment)**

Goods are considered shipped directly to Canada if:

- They are shipped **without passing through any other country**, or  
- They are shipped **on a through bill of lading** (i.e., a single bill of lading that covers the entire journey from origin to destination), **or**  
- They are shipped **without a through bill of lading**, but the importer provides, **when requested by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that clearly shows:
  - The **full shipping route**  
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** (if any)  
  - The **route prior to importation into Canada**

> This provision allows flexibility in documentation, particularly when a through bill of lading is not available or issued. The burden of proof lies with the importer to provide verifiable, transparent documentation to demonstrate that the goods were not transshipped through a third country.

### 2. **Shipment Through Another Country (Transshipment)**

If goods pass through a third country, they are still eligible for direct shipment status **only if**:

- The importer provides, **when requested by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** showing:
  - The **full shipping route**  
  - All **points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada  
- **AND**  
  A **copy of customs control documents** is provided that confirms the goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the intermediate country.

> This requirement ensures that goods do not enter the intermediate country without proper customs oversight. The "customs control documents" must demonstrate that the goods were subject to customs inspection, clearance, or control during their time in the third country. This prevents fraud or misuse of preferential tariff treatment by allowing goods to be "hidden" in a third country without proper monitoring.

**Repeal of Previous Regulations**

- The *Mexico Deemed Direct Shipment (General Preferential Tariff) Regulations* (SOR/98-37) are **repealed** by these new regulations.  
- This repeal indicates a shift in policy: Canada is no longer treating Mexico shipments under a separate "deemed direct shipment" regime for GPT purposes. Instead, the broader framework of direct shipment is now applied uniformly across all beneficiary countries, including Mexico, under the new rules.

> This change simplifies the regulatory framework and aligns it with a more consistent, transparent approach to verifying direct shipment for all preferential tariff schemes.

---

**Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on **January 1, 2025**.  
- All importers and customs officers must comply with the new rules from this date onward.

---

**Purpose and Policy Implications**

The regulations aim to:

1. **Ensure transparency and integrity** in the preferential tariff system by verifying that goods originate from beneficiary countries and are not indirectly routed through third countries to circumvent tariff obligations.
2. **Prevent fraud and non-compliance** by requiring verifiable documentation and customs control evidence.
3. **Simplify compliance** for legitimate exporters and importers by providing clear, structured criteria for what constitutes "direct shipment."
4. **Modernize and streamline** the customs process by replacing outdated, country-specific rules (like the Mexico-specific regulation) with a unified, principle-based approach.

---

**Conclusion**

These Direct Shipment Regulations establish a clear, enforceable framework for determining when goods from beneficiary countries qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the Canadian Customs Tariff. By defining both direct and transshipment scenarios and requiring verifiable documentation, the regulations enhance compliance, reduce risk of fraud, and support fair trade practices. The repeal of the Mexico-specific rule reflects a broader policy shift toward harmonization and consistency across all beneficiary countries. Effective January 1, 2025, these regulations will govern how Canadian customs authorities assess direct shipment eligibility for a wide range of preferential tariff schemes.
