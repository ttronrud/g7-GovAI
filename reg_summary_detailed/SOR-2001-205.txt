### **Key Details of the Remission**

1. **Amount of Remission:**

3. **Legal Basis for the Remission:**  
   The remission is authorized under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff**, which provides the legal framework for granting remissions of customs duties in specific circumstances—such as for public interest, economic justification, or to support domestic industry.

4. **Conditions of the Remission:**  
   The remission is **not unconditional**. It is granted **subject to Section 2** of the *Customs Tariff*, which typically outlines conditions related to eligibility, compliance, or administrative requirements.

### **Implications and Significance**

- **Support for Domestic Industry:**  
  This remission likely reflects a government effort to support the growth or competitiveness of the Canadian bus manufacturing sector, particularly during a period of transition or market challenge.

- **Administrative Requirement:**  
  The two-year deadline for claiming remission underscores the importance of timely administrative action. Orion Bus Industries must act promptly to ensure the remission is properly claimed and processed.

- **Fiscal Responsibility:**  
  The remission is a discretionary measure, indicating that the Minister of Finance and the Governor General in Council determined that the financial or economic justification for remission outweighed the need to collect the duties in this case.

- **Legal and Compliance Framework:**  
  The regulation is part of Canada’s customs administration system, ensuring that remissions are granted within a clear legal and procedural framework, with accountability to the Minister of National Revenue.

### **Conclusion**

This remission order is a targeted fiscal intervention designed to alleviate the financial burden on Orion Bus Industries Ltd. by canceling $993,907.56 in customs duties paid or due on bus imports between August 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. While the remission is granted under a specific legal authority, it is conditional upon the company making a timely claim to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of the Order’s registration. This regulation reflects a balance between fiscal policy and support for key domestic industries.
