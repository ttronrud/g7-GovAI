**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Review of Parole Ineligibility Rules (2005)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Saskatchewan Review of Parole Ineligibility Rules*, made on **March 31, 2005**, by the **Chief Justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench for Saskatchewan** under **subsection 745.64(1)a of the Criminal Code**, establish a formal, structured process for individuals serving a sentence of **imprisonment without eligibility for parole** to apply for a **reduction in the number of years** of that non-parole period.

This regulation implements **section 745.6 of the Criminal Code**, which allows eligible individuals to apply for a reduction in their non-parole period—effectively enabling them to become eligible for parole after serving a portion of their sentence—*provided* that the reduction is justified and meets specific procedural and evidentiary standards.

The Rules provide a comprehensive, transparent, and fair framework for reviewing such applications, ensuring that the process is both **just and efficient**, while maintaining the integrity of the justice system.
