**Detailed Summary of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Notice Regulations (Compensation in Respect of the Restructuring of Federal Member Institutions)**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**
These regulations were issued under **section 39.37a of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDICA)**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. The purpose of these regulations is to establish the **specific requirements for notices** that the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) must issue during the **restructuring of federal member financial institutions** — particularly when such institutions enter either **receivership** or **vesting** proceedings.

These rules ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in how CDIC communicates with stakeholders (such as depositors, assignees, successors, and institutions) during periods of financial distress and restructuring.

---

### **Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (CDICA), which provides the legal framework for CDIC’s operations, including deposit insurance and the restructuring of member institutions.
- **Receivership Order**: A formal order issued under **paragraph 39.13(1)(b)** of the Act. It occurs when a federal member institution is placed under receivership due to insolvency or financial instability, and a receiver is appointed to manage its affairs.
- **Vesting Order**: A formal order issued under **paragraph 39.13(1)(a)** of the Act. It transfers ownership or control of the institution’s assets and liabilities to the CDIC, typically as part of a restructuring or resolution process.
