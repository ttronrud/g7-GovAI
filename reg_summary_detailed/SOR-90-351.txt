**Detailed Summary of the *Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations*, 1990**

---

### **Background and Context**
On October 1, 1990, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, revoked the outdated *Sanitary Control of Shellfish Fisheries Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 832) and introduced the new *Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations*. This action was taken under **Sections 8 and 43 of the Fisheries Act**, which empower the government to revise or replace regulations related to fisheries management, particularly in response to public health concerns.

The new regulations were designed to provide a more effective, flexible, and scientifically grounded framework for managing fisheries affected by contamination—whether from biological agents (e.g., bacteria, toxins), chemical pollutants, or other harmful substances—thereby protecting public health while maintaining sustainable fishing practices.

### **Regulatory Title**
The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations"**  
They may be cited as **C.R.C., c. 832 (replaced)** or as **C.R.C., c. 832 (as amended)** in subsequent references.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Contaminated (with respect to fish)**  
   - Fish are considered *contaminated* if they contain **bacteria, toxins, chemical compounds, or other substances** present at levels that **pose a danger to public health**.  
   - This definition is broad and includes both biological and chemical hazards, emphasizing the primary objective: **public health protection**.

2. **Regional Director General**  
   - Refers to either a **Regional Director General** or an **Associate Regional Director General** of the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)**.  
   - These officials are responsible for regional oversight and enforcement of the regulations in specific geographic areas.

### **Core Provisions and Enforcement Mechanisms**

#### **1. Authority to Issue Prohibitions on Fishing**
- If a **Regional Director General has reasonable grounds to believe** that fish of any species in a particular area are contaminated, they may issue an **order prohibiting fishing** in that area for that species.
- This power allows for **rapid, targeted intervention** when contamination risks are detected—especially during outbreaks of harmful algal blooms, bacterial infections (e.g., *Vibrio*), or chemical pollution events.

#### **2. Restrictions on Fishing in Contaminated Areas**
- **No person may fish, catch, or retain** any species specified in a prohibition order **unless**:
  - They hold a **valid licence issued under subsection 4(1)** and are **carrying that licence**, or  
  - They are **named in a licence** issued under subsection 4(1) and are **carrying a copy of that licence**.
- This ensures that only authorized individuals—those with proper documentation and compliance obligations—can access contaminated zones, reducing the risk of unsafe fish entering the food supply.

#### **3. Licensing for Fishing in Prohibited Areas**
- The **Minister may issue a licence** to a person (or multiple persons named in the licence) to fish in an area under a prohibition order, **subject to**:
  - A formal **application** being submitted.
  - Payment of an **appropriate fee** as set out in a prescribed table (not included in the text but referenced).
- The licence authorizes fishing for **any species specified in the order**, within the designated area.
- This creates a **controlled access mechanism**, allowing limited fishing under strict conditions, rather than complete closure.

#### **4. Decontamination Requirements for Food-Purpose Fishing**
- Any person seeking a licence to fish **for food purposes** must submit a **decontamination plan** to the Minister.
- The plan must demonstrate that the fish will be **decontaminated before being used for human consumption**.
- This requirement ensures that fish harvested from contaminated areas are processed safely and do not pose health risks to consumers.

#### **5. Restrictions on Use of Fish by Licence Holders**
To prevent misuse and ensure safety, the regulations impose strict limitations on how fish caught under different licences may be used:

- **Scientific Investigation Licence**:
  - Fish caught under such a licence **may not be used for any purpose other than scientific research or study**.
  - This protects the integrity of scientific data and prevents the commercialization of research specimens.

- **Food-Purpose Licence**:
  - Fish must be **handled strictly in accordance with the decontamination plan** submitted to the Minister.
  - This includes handling, storage, processing, and transportation protocols to minimize contamination exposure.

- **Bait-Purpose Licence**:
  - Fish caught for bait must be used **exclusively for bait**.
  - No other use (e.g., consumption, sale, or scientific study) is permitted.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Public Health Protection**  
   - The central goal is to prevent the consumption of contaminated fish, which could lead to illness or disease (e.g., foodborne illness, toxic shellfish poisoning).

2. **Timely and Targeted Response**  
   - Empowers regional DFO officials to act swiftly upon detection of contamination, minimizing the spread of unsafe fish products.

3. **Balancing Economic and Environmental Interests**  
   - While restricting fishing in high-risk areas, the regulations allow for **controlled access** through licensing, supporting legitimate fishing activities (e.g., scientific research, bait collection) while protecting public health.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   - Requires detailed decontamination plans and clear documentation of fish use, ensuring accountability and traceability in the food chain.

5. **Regulatory Modernization**  
   - Replaces outdated shellfish-specific rules with a more comprehensive, adaptable framework applicable to all fish species and types of contamination.

### **Key Implications and Practical Effects**

- **Immediate Effect**: The regulations took effect on **October 1, 1990**, replacing the previous sanitary control rules.
- **Geographic Flexibility**: Prohibitions and licensing can be applied to any species and location where contamination is suspected.
- **Enforcement**: DFO regional officials have discretion to assess risks and issue orders, supported by clear legal authority under the Fisheries Act.
- **Public Trust**: By requiring decontamination plans and strict handling protocols, the regulations enhance consumer confidence in fish products from potentially contaminated areas.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **No Automatic Closure**: The regulations do not mandate a blanket closure of entire fisheries; instead, they rely on **risk-based assessments** and **procedural orders**.
- **Burden of Proof**: The Regional Director General must have "reasonable grounds" to believe contamination exists—this requires scientific monitoring and reporting.
- **Fee Structure**: While the fee table is referenced, the exact amounts and categories are not included in the provided text, suggesting that these are determined administratively and may vary over time.
- **Scientific vs. Commercial Use**: The strict separation between scientific, food, and bait fishing ensures that only appropriate uses are permitted, reducing the risk of misuse.

### **Conclusion**

The *Management of Contaminated Fisheries Regulations, 1990* represent a significant evolution in Canada’s approach to fisheries safety. By replacing a narrow, shellfish-focused regulation with a broader, health-centered framework, the government established a system that:

- Responds dynamically to contamination threats,  
- Protects public health through enforceable restrictions and decontamination requirements,  
- Maintains essential fishing activities through carefully regulated access, and  
- Balances environmental, economic, and safety concerns.

These regulations remain foundational in Canada’s regulatory approach to managing fish safety in the face of emerging or known contaminants, and they continue to inform modern food safety and fisheries policy.
