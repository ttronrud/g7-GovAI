### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entry**
Each line "[Repealed, SOR/2014-37, s. 23]" signifies that a particular provision or section of a prior regulation has been **officially removed** from the legal framework. The term *repealed* means that the regulation no longer has legal force or effect.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of Ontario*.
- **SOR/2014-37** is the specific statutory instrument number issued in 2014.
- **Section 23** of that instrument contains the repeal clause.

#### 2. **What Was Repealed?**
Although the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated reference to "s. 23" suggests that **Section 23 of SOR/2014-37** contains a list or directive to repeal one or more prior regulations. This is a common practice in legislative amendments: new instruments often repeal outdated, redundant, or obsolete rules.

Therefore, the regulation being referenced was likely a **prior Ontario regulation** (possibly related to health, safety, environmental protection, or another area), which was removed from force by the amendments in SOR/2014-37.

#### 3. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- **Legal Effect**: The repealed regulation is no longer enforceable, and any references to it in existing laws or administrative decisions are now invalid.
- **Administrative Impact**: Agencies or officials that previously relied on the regulation must now follow the current, active rules in place after the repeal.
- **Public Access**: The repeal is typically published in the *Ontario Gazette* and made available through official legal databases such as the *Ontario Government Legislation* website.

#### 4. **Why Was It Repealed?**
Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
- Obsolescence (it no longer applies to current practices)
- Inconsistency with newer legislation
- Duplication with other regulations
- Outdated language or procedures
- Better governance through consolidation or modernization

#### 5. **Source and Authority**
- The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Ontario Legislature**.
- SOR/2014-37 is a government instrument issued under the authority of a relevant Act (e.g., *Health Services and Long-Term Care Act*, *Environmental Protection Act*, etc.), depending on the subject matter of the original regulation.

#### 6. **Accessing the Original Regulation**
To identify the exact regulation that was repealed:
- Search the **Ontario Government Legislation website** (www.legislation.gov.on.ca)
- Look up SOR/2014-37 and review Section 23.
