### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a financial limit on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s (CBC) ability to enter into lease or other agreements for the use or occupation of real property. Specifically, it sets a cap on expenditures related to real property use beyond a specified amount, requiring prior approval from the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) for any transaction exceeding that threshold.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Amount of Expenditure Limit:**  
   The regulation prescribes **$15,000,000** as the maximum amount of expenditure that the CBC may incur in connection with a lease or other agreement for the use or occupation of real property.

2. **Applicability:**  
   This limit applies to all leases, subleases, agreements for the use of premises, or any other form of arrangement involving real property (such as office space, broadcast facilities, or studio buildings), regardless of duration or type.

3. **Excess Expenditure Requirement:**  
   If the CBC intends to enter into any such agreement that would result in an expenditure **in excess of $15,000,000**, the corporation **must obtain prior approval** from the Governor in Council.

4. **Nature of Approval:**  
   The approval is not automatic or routine. It requires formal review and authorization by the federal government (via the Governor General in Council), typically involving the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Treasury Board, reflecting the importance of fiscal and strategic oversight of public broadcasting assets.

5. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 48(2)(b) of the Broadcasting Act**, which grants the Governor General in Council the authority to prescribe limits on CBC expenditures in relation to real property, particularly where such expenditures may impact the corporation’s financial stability or public service mandate.

### **Implications and Significance**

- **Fiscal Accountability:** This regulation ensures that the CBC remains financially disciplined and does not incur large, uncontrolled real estate expenditures that could affect its operational independence or public funding.

- **Government Oversight:** It reinforces the principle that major real property transactions involving public broadcasters are subject to high-level governmental scrutiny, reflecting the public interest and the role of CBC as a Crown corporation.

- **Strategic Use of Property:** The limit encourages the CBC to evaluate its real estate needs carefully, potentially leading to more efficient use of space, consolidation of operations, or leasing of smaller or more cost-effective facilities.

- **Prevention of Unplanned or Unapproved Costs:** By requiring approval for expenditures above $15 million, the regulation prevents sudden or uncoordinated real estate investments that could disrupt CBC’s budget or operations.

### **Effective Date and Scope**

- The regulation was enacted in **1991** and remains in force as part of the *Broadcasting Act* framework.
- It applies to all CBC operations, including those in Canada and any international facilities where real property is involved.
- The $15 million cap is not a one-time threshold but a continuous limit that applies to any single lease or agreement, regardless of whether it is a new transaction or a renewal.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a critical financial safeguard within the Canadian broadcasting system. By setting a clear, enforceable limit on real property expenditures and mandating prior Cabinet approval for any transaction exceeding $15 million, it ensures that the CBC operates within a framework of accountability, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. It reflects the broader government commitment to managing public assets—especially those tied to national broadcasting—through prudent and oversight-driven policies.
