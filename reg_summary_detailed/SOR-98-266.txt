- **Export Controls Division (ECD)**:  
  The division within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade responsible for administering export and import controls, including the monitoring and enforcement of permits related to sensitive materials.

- **Guide**:  
  Refers to the same meaning as defined in **Section 1 of the Export Control List (ECL)**. This typically includes guidance on the classification, use, and control of specific chemicals or materials.

### **4. Scope of the Permit**
- **Who Can Import?**  
  Any **resident of Canada** (individual or entity) may import CWC toxic chemicals and precursors **from any source** (domestic, international, or third-party suppliers), **provided they comply with the conditions of this permit**.

- **Permit Type**:  
  This is a **general import permit**, meaning it does not require individual approval for each shipment. Instead, it provides broad authorization to import the specified substances, subject to compliance with reporting and record-keeping obligations.

### **5. Conditions of the Permit**

The importer must comply with the following **mandatory conditions**:

#### **(a) Recordkeeping Requirement**
- The importer must **retain all documentation** related to each import made under this permit.
- These records must be **kept at the importer’s place of business or residence**.
- The records must be maintained for a **minimum period of six years** from the date of import.

#### **(b) Availability to Authorities**
- Upon **request by an officer of the Export Controls Division (ECD)**, the importer must **make the required documents available** for inspection.
- This ensures transparency and enables regulatory oversight to verify compliance with the permit and Canadian laws.

#### **(c) Reporting Requirement under the Customs Act**
- If the import of CWC toxic chemicals or precursors is subject to **reporting in a prescribed form under the Customs Act**, the importer must:
  - Insert the statement **“GIP-108”** (in English) or **“LGI-108”** (in French) in the appropriate field of the form.
- This labeling ensures that such imports are clearly identifiable and traceable within Canada’s customs and control systems.

---

### **6. Purpose and Policy Rationale**
This permit serves several key regulatory and security objectives:
- To **facilitate legitimate industrial, scientific, or medical uses** of certain toxic chemicals and precursors that are otherwise subject to strict controls.
- To **prevent misuse** of these substances in the development of chemical weapons by establishing a clear, transparent, and accountable import framework.
- To **balance national security concerns** with legitimate commercial and research needs by providing a streamlined pathway for authorized imports under strict oversight.

---

### **7. Key Observations**
- The permit is **not a blanket exemption** from all controls. It applies only to substances listed in **Item 74 of the Import Control List**.
- The **six-year recordkeeping requirement** reflects a balance between enabling business operations and ensuring regulatory accountability.
- The **mandatory labeling ("GIP-108" or "LGI-108")** is a critical tool for customs officials and enforcement agencies to identify and monitor shipments of controlled substances.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**
- Non-compliance with any of the conditions (e.g., failure to retain records, failure to provide documents upon request, or failure to report properly) may result in:
  - Fines,
  - Suspension of future import privileges,
  - Legal action under the Export and Import Permits Act or the Customs Act.
- The Export Controls Division retains the authority to investigate and take enforcement action as needed.

---

### **Conclusion**
General Import Permit No. 108 is a targeted regulatory instrument that authorizes Canadian residents to import specific toxic chemicals and precursors used in chemical weapon production (CWC-related substances) from any source. It operates under strict conditions to ensure accountability, transparency, and compliance with national security and public safety standards. By requiring recordkeeping, document availability, and proper reporting, the permit supports both legitimate industrial use and effective government oversight of high-risk materials.

**Note**: This permit is a historical document issued in 1998. While it remains valid under Canadian law, its scope and applicability may be subject to updates due to changes in the Import Control List, international agreements (e.g., Chemical Weapons Convention), or new regulatory frameworks. For current compliance, importers should verify the status of Item 74 in the most recent version of the Import Control List.
