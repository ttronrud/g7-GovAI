**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Milk Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Ontario Milk Marketing Levies Order*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes the **milk marketing levies** that dairy producers in Ontario must pay to the **Ontario Milk Marketing Board (Commodity Board)**. These levies are designed to support the financial sustainability of the milk marketing system, ensure fair distribution of milk volumes, and manage supply and pricing within the province’s dairy sector.

The levies are structured based on whether a producer is selling milk **within or beyond their allocated quota**, with different rates applied to milk volume and butterfat content.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Commodity Board**  
   - Refers to *The Ontario Milk Marketing Board*, established under the *Milk Act of Ontario* by Order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.  
   - Responsible for overseeing milk marketing, setting quotas, and collecting levies.

2. **Milk**  
   - Defined as milk derived from cows.  
   - Excludes milk from other sources (e.g., goats, sheep).

3. **Producer**  
   - A dairy farm or entity that sells milk directly to the Commodity Board.  
   - Subject to the levy requirements outlined in this Order.

4. **Quota**  
   - A fixed, allocated volume of milk (in pounds) assigned to each producer by the Commodity Board.  
   - Applies specifically to sales of milk of **Classes 3, 4, 5, and 6** as defined in *Ontario Regulation 139/70*.  
   - The quota serves as a cap on how much milk a producer can sell to the Commodity Board without incurring additional levies.

### **Levy Structure**

Producers are required to pay **two types of levies**, in addition to standard licence fees set out in the *Ontario Milk Marketing Plan*:

#### **1. Levy on Milk Sold Within Quota (Up to Allotted Amount)**  
- **Rate**: $1.20 per 100 pounds of milk sold **within the producer’s quota**.  
- **Alternative Expression**: $0.3429 per pound of butterfat sold **within the quota**.  
- **Purpose**: This levy applies to the portion of milk that falls within the producer’s allocated quota. It is a base levy to fund the marketing system and ensure equitable cost-sharing among producers who are operating within established limits.

> *Note: The butterfat-based rate is a conversion of the per-100-pound rate (100 × $0.003429 = $0.3429). This reflects the value of butterfat as a key component of milk pricing and marketing.*

#### **2. Levy on Milk Sold Beyond Quota (Excess Volume)**  
- **Rate**: $7 per 100 pounds of milk sold **in excess of the quota**.  
- **Alternative Expression**: $0.20 per pound of butterfat sold beyond the quota (since $7 ÷ 100 = $0.07 per pound, but the text says $2 per pound of butterfat — this appears to be an error or misstatement; see note below).  
- **Purpose**: This higher levy is imposed on any milk sold beyond the producer’s allocated quota. It acts as a disincentive for overproduction and helps manage supply, prevent market oversaturation, and ensure that the Commodity Board can maintain stable pricing.

> ⚠️ **Clarification on Butterfat Rate**:  
> The text states:  
> - "$7 for each 100 pounds of milk" → $0.07 per pound  
> - "$2 per pound of butterfat sold in excess" → This appears inconsistent with the $7 per 100 pounds.  
>  
> If the butterfat rate is truly $2 per pound, it would be **100 times higher** than the milk rate and would be economically unreasonable.  
>  
> **Likely Interpretation**:  
> This is likely a **typo or misstatement**. The intended rate is probably **$0.02 per pound of butterfat** (i.e., $2 per 100 pounds), which aligns with the $7 per 100 pounds of milk.  
>  
> Therefore, the correct interpretation should be:  
> - **$7 per 100 pounds of milk sold beyond quota**  
> - **$0.07 per pound of butterfat sold beyond quota** (or $2 per 100 pounds of butterfat)  
>  
> This would make the structure consistent and fair.

### **Deduction of Levies**

- The Commodity Board is authorized to **deduct all applicable levies** from the **moneys payable to the producer**.  
- This means that when a producer receives payment for milk sold to the Commodity Board, the levies (both within-quota and excess) are **automatically withheld** from the final payment.  
- This ensures compliance and simplifies the financial process for both producers and the Board.

---

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Quota Management** | Limits milk supply to prevent market oversaturation and price collapse. |
| **Revenue Generation** | Generates funds for the Commodity Board to support marketing, quality control, and distribution. |
| **Equity & Fairness** | Producers within quota pay a lower, more predictable rate, while those exceeding their allocation face a higher cost to discourage overproduction. |
| **Incentive for Efficiency** | Encourages producers to manage production efficiently and stay within their quota to avoid high excess levies. |
| **Support for Dairy Marketing System** | Funds help maintain infrastructure, transportation, processing, and market access for Ontario dairy products. |

### **Legal and Regulatory Context**

- This Order operates under the authority of the *Milk Act of Ontario* and is implemented through specific regulatory instruments (e.g., Regulation 139/70, which defines milk classes and quotas).  
- It is binding on all producers who sell milk to the Ontario Milk Marketing Board.  
- The levies are **mandatory**, not optional, and must be paid in full.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Milk Marketing Levies Order* establishes a structured, quota-based system for collecting levies from dairy producers. It ensures that:

- Producers within their quota pay a modest levy based on milk volume or butterfat content.  
- Producers exceeding their quota pay a significantly higher levy to discourage overproduction.  
- All levies are automatically deducted from payments, ensuring transparency and compliance.  

This system supports the stability of Ontario’s dairy market by balancing supply with demand, promoting responsible production, and funding essential marketing functions.

> ✅ **Note on Accuracy**: The butterfat rate of "$2 per pound" in excess is likely a typographical or interpretive error. It should be corrected to **$0.02 per pound (or $2 per 100 pounds)** to maintain consistency with the $7 per 100 pounds of milk rate.
