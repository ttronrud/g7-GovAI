## 📋 Scope of Regulation: Substances Covered

### ✅ Substances Included in the List
Substances are included if:
1. They have a **CAS number** listed in **Column 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1** and are present in a mixture at a concentration **≥ Column 3 (threshold)**.
2. They are **solutions** with a CAS number in **Column 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 1**, where:
   - The **solute concentration ≥ Column 3**, *and*
   - If in a mixture, the **concentration of solute in the mixture ≥ Column 3**.

> These substances are subject to reporting and emergency planning obligations.

## ⚠️ Exclusions from the List

Certain substances are **exempt** from the regulation despite being on the list due to low risk or specific use cases:

| Exclusion | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Combustible or explosive substances** | If in a mixture with flashpoint >23°C and boiling point >35°C, or if it's a component of natural gas in gaseous form. |
| **Inhalation hazards** | If the total vapour pressure of the mixture is <1.33 kPa (very low volatility). |
| **Fuel for heating or power generation** | If present in quantity **less than** the threshold in Column 4 of Part 1. |
| **Regulated under other Acts** | Substances governed by the *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act* or *Canada Shipping Act*. |
| **Pipelines and processing plants** | Substances in pipelines or processing plants regulated under **National Energy Board (NEB) rules**. |
| **Pipelines in isolated provincial areas** | If located entirely within a province and no fixed onshore installations exist except pipelines/compressor stations. |
| **Fuel tanks supplying conveyance engines** | Fuel stored in tanks connected to transport vehicles. |
| **Solid forms of specific substances** | E.g., Item 57 in Part 1 — only if solid. |
| **Solid particles >10 μm** | Item 143 — only if particles exceed 10 micrometres in diameter. |
| **Non-white phosphorus forms** | Item 167 — only if not in white phosphorus form. |

> These exclusions reduce regulatory burden for low-risk or operationally distinct uses.

## 📝 Reporting Obligations

### 1. **Initial Notice Submission (Within 90 Days)**
A **responsible person** must submit a notice to the Minister within **90 days** of either of the following events:

- The **total quantity** of a substance at a facility reaches or exceeds the threshold in **Column 4** of Part 1 or 2 of Schedule 1.
- A quantity is placed in a **container system** whose **maximum capacity** is equal to or greater than the threshold in Column 4.

> The notice must include information in **Schedule 2**.

---

### 2. **Excluded Quantities (Not Counted in Total)**
Quantities **excluded from reporting** include:
- Substances present for **≤72 hours**, unless evidence of arrival time is kept.
- Container systems with **maximum capacity ≤0.03 tonnes**.
- Substances in **slag, waste rock, tailings, solid residues, ores, or ore concentrates**.
- Substances in **small container systems (<10 t)** located **≥360 m from facility boundary** (Item 17).
- Agricultural nutrients (Items 163, 5, or 9 in Part 2) used **on-site at farming operations**.

> This avoids over-reporting for transient or low-risk storage.

---

### 3. **Quantity Calculations**
- For **mixtures**:
  - Multiply total mixture weight (in tonnes) by the **mass/mass percentage** of the substance.
- For **solutions**:
  - If in a mixture and solute concentration known:  
    → Multiply mixture weight × solute concentration × solution concentration in mixture.
  - If solute concentration is **unknown**:  
    → Multiply mixture weight × percentage of solution in mixture.

> These formulas ensure accurate quantification of hazardous material presence.

---

### 4. **Updated Notices (Within 60 Days)**
A responsible person must submit an **updated notice within 60 days** if:
- Any information in Schedule 2 changes.
- The **maximum expected quantity** (under paragraph 3(d)) increases by **10% or more**.
- The **maximum capacity** (under paragraph 3(f)) increases by **10% or more**.

> Ensures dynamic responsiveness to changing conditions.

## 🛡️ Environmental Emergency Planning Requirements

### When a Plan Must Be Prepared
A responsible person must prepare an **Environmental Emergency Plan** if:
- The substance is **not in a container system**, and the reported maximum expected quantity ≥ threshold in Column 4 of Part 1.
- The substance **is in a container system**, and:
  - Maximum expected quantity ≥ threshold in Column 4 (Part 1 or 2), **and**
  - Maximum capacity ≥ threshold in Column 4.

> The plan is required for substances at risk of significant environmental or health impacts.
