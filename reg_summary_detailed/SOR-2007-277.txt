Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

---

## **First Nations Property Assessment and Taxation (Railway Rights-of-Way) Regulations**  
**S.C. 2005, c. 9**  
**Made under the First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act, paragraph 36(1)(d)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
These regulations establish a framework for how **property taxation** of **railway rights-of-way areas** on First Nations reserves in British Columbia is conducted. The goal is to ensure that the **taxation of property within railway rights-of-way** is consistent with provincial property tax laws, while respecting the **autonomy and fiscal self-governance** of First Nations.

The regulation was enacted by the **Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, under a specific provision of the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act* (paragraph 36(1)(d)).

This ensures that First Nations have the authority to create their own property taxation laws for their reserves — particularly those containing railway rights-of-way — while maintaining **provincial-level fairness and consistency** in valuation and taxation.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to:
- Property taxation laws enacted by the **council of a First Nation** listed in **Schedule 1**.
- Specifically, taxation of **property located within a “right-of-way area”** on such reserves.

The regulations govern how the **assessable value** of certain types of property is determined and how **tax rates** are set in these areas.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Right-of-way area** | Lands designated as railway corridors (e.g., Canadian Pacific Railway) within a First Nation reserve, as specified in **column 2 of Schedule 1**. |
| **Adjacent area** | The incorporated or unincorporated area bordering the majority of a First Nation’s reserves that contain right-of-way areas. Used to determine tax applicability. |
| **Property** | Includes rights-of-way, any interest in land, or improvements (e.g., tracks, bridges, utilities). |
| **Track in place** | As defined in subsection 21(15) of the *Assessment Act* — refers to existing railway tracks and structures. |
| **Fibre optic improvements** | Includes cables, conduits, sheaths, and related infrastructure. |
| **Provincial taxation laws** | BC laws governing property taxation, including: <br> - Assessment Act <br> - Railway Corporations Assessment Regulation <br> - Hospital District Act <br> - School Act <br> - Local Government Act <br> - Taxation (Rural Area) Act |
| **Adjustment factor** | A multiplier used in provincial tax law to adjust valuation based on location (e.g., rural vs. urban). Derived from *Railway Corporations Assessment Regulation, B.C. Reg. 51/2016*. |

### **4. Assessment of Property Value**

#### **(a) Valuation Principles**
Subject to subsection (2), a First Nation’s property taxation law must require that the **assessable value** of the following types of property be determined using the **same assessment rates, adjustments, exceptions, inclusions, and exclusions** that would apply if the property were subject to **provincial taxation laws**:

1. **Track in place of a railway company**, including **fibre optic improvements**  
2. **Rights-of-way for track** (e.g., future or existing rail corridors)  
3. **Bridges** of a railway company  
4. **Fibre optic improvements** of a non-railway company  
5. **Utility systems** of non-railway companies (e.g., power, gas, sewer, pipeline, telephone)  
6. **Other lawful improvements** located in a right-of-way area  

> ✅ This ensures **uniformity** in valuation standards between First Nation and provincial taxation systems.

#### **(b) Adjustment Factors**
- **Adjustment factors do NOT apply** to the determination of assessable values under First Nation property taxation laws.  
- This is a significant departure from provincial practice, where such factors adjust values based on location (e.g., urban vs. rural).  
- The rationale is to **avoid double-counting or inconsistent valuations** and to maintain **fairness and transparency** in First Nation taxation.

### **5. Tax Rate Limits**

#### **(a) Railway Company Property (e.g., Canadian Pacific Railway)**
For a First Nation in **Schedule 2**, the tax rate for a given year on railway company property in a right-of-way area **shall not exceed**:

> **Sum of (tax rate × adjustment factor)**  
> For each tax base listed in **column 2 of Schedule 2**

- Example:  
  If the provincial tax rate for a base is $100 per hectare and the adjustment factor is 1.2, the maximum allowable rate under First Nation law is $120 per hectare.

> This ensures that tax rates do not exceed what would be applied under provincial law — with adjustment factors applied appropriately.

#### **(b) Non-Railway Company Improvements**
For improvements by companies **other than railway companies** (e.g., utilities, telecom), the tax rate **shall not exceed** the sum of the **provincial tax rates** for each tax base listed in Schedule 2.

- No adjustment factors are used here.
- This reflects the principle that non-railway utilities are taxed at the **same rate as in the adjacent area**, without added multipliers.

---

### **6. Exemptions, Exceptions, Inclusions & Exclusions**

- Any **exemptions, exceptions, inclusions, or exclusions** that would apply to property under **provincial taxation laws** in the **adjacent area** must also be applied in the First Nation’s taxation law.
- This ensures **consistency and fairness**, so that property is not taxed differently based on jurisdiction.

> Example: If a utility system is exempt from taxation in the adjacent area (e.g., due to public service), the same exemption applies in the First Nation.

---

### **7. Adjustment Factor Application by First Nation**

The regulation specifies **which adjustment factors apply** based on the **specific First Nation**:

| First Nation | Adjustment Factor Applied |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Adams Lake Indian Band<br>Chawathil First Nation<br>Cook’s Ferry Indian Band<br>Kanaka Bar Indian Band<br>Leq’a:mel First Nation<br>Little Shuswap Lake Indian Band<br>Matsqui First Nation<br>Neskonlith Indian Band<br>Shuswap First Nation | Adjustment factors applicable to **incorporated areas** |
| Seabird Island Indian Band | Adjustment factors applicable to the **District of Kent** |

> This reflects regional differences in property value and tax rates across BC.
