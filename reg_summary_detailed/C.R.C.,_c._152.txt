**Detailed Summary of the Manitoba Chicken Order**

---

### **Overview**
The *Manitoba Chicken Order* is a regulatory instrument established under the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (the "Act"). It provides specific authority to the **Manitoba Chicken Broiler Producers’ Marketing Board** (the "Commodity Board") to regulate the marketing of chickens in both **interprovincial and export markets**, as well as to manage related financial and operational aspects of the industry. This Order may be cited as the *Manitoba Chicken Order*.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing Act of Manitoba* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the Commodity Board’s regulatory powers in relation to chicken marketing.

2. **Chicken**  
   Defined broadly as:
   - Any variety, grade, or class of chicken;
   - Not older than **five months of age**;
   - Raised or kept **within the Province of Manitoba**;
   - Raised **not for egg production**;
   - Includes **broilers, fryers, and roasting chickens**.

   This definition excludes poultry raised specifically for egg production, focusing instead on meat-producing chickens.

3. **Commodity Board**  
   The *Manitoba Chicken Broiler Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the Act. It is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pricing, and financial management of chickens in Manitoba.

4. **Plan**  
   Refers to any marketing plan established and amended over time by the Commodity Board under the authority of the Act. The Plan guides how chickens are marketed, priced, and distributed, both locally and beyond provincial borders.

### **Core Regulatory Authority**

The Commodity Board is granted **specific powers to regulate the marketing of chickens** in two key areas:

#### 1. **Interprovincial and Export Trade**
- The Board may regulate the marketing of chickens **outside Manitoba**, including sales to other provinces and international markets.
- For these purposes, it may exercise **all or any powers** that are available to it under the Act and the Plan **in relation to local marketing within Manitoba**, **except** those powers exercised by the **Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency (CCMA)** under the *Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act*.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**: Powers related to national-level marketing (such as those administered by the CCMA) are excluded from the Commodity Board’s authority under this Order.

#### 2. **Levies and Charges**
The Commodity Board is authorized to:
- **Make orders** establishing, imposing, and collecting **levies or charges** from individuals or businesses engaged in:
  - The **production** of chickens;
  - The **marketing** of chickens;
  - Who are located **within Manitoba**.

##### **Classification of Producers**
- The Board may **classify producers into different groups** (e.g., by size, type of operation, or production volume).
- Each group may be assigned a **different levy or charge** based on its characteristics.

##### **Use of Levies and Charges**
Proceeds from levies and charges may be used for:
- **Board operations and administrative expenses**;
- **Payment of losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of chickens (e.g., price drops, market volatility);
- **Creation of reserves** to ensure financial stability during downturns;
- **Equalization or adjustment** of income among producers.

> This mechanism allows for **financial support and equity** among producers during periods of market fluctuation. For example, if prices fall, the Board can use collected levies to redistribute funds to producers who may have suffered losses.

##### **Time Periods**
- The Board may determine **specific time periods** (e.g., quarterly, annually) during which levies or charges are applied and for which equalization or adjustment of funds occurs.

---

### **Revocation Note**
- A previous provision in this Order (specifically the section regarding levies and charges) was **revoked by SOR/80-90** (Supplemental Order 80-90).  
- This indicates that **the current version of the Order does not contain the prior levy provisions** and reflects a revised or updated regulatory framework.

> The revocation suggests that the original levy mechanism was replaced, possibly due to changes in policy, market conditions, or legislative reform.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Stability in the Chicken Market**  
   To ensure stable pricing and predictable income for producers through mechanisms like levies and equalization.

2. **Financial Protection for Producers**  
   To provide a buffer against market volatility and to support producers during periods of low demand or price crashes.

3. **Efficient Marketing and Distribution**  
   To enable coordinated marketing strategies in interprovincial and export markets, ensuring that Manitoba’s chicken producers can compete effectively.

4. **Equity Among Producers**  
   To prevent disparities in income by redistributing funds from higher-performing periods to those experiencing losses.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Manitoba Chicken Order* empowers the Manitoba Chicken Broiler Producers’ Marketing Board to:
- Regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of chickens;
- Classify producers into groups and impose tiered levies or charges;
- Use collected funds to manage financial risks, create reserves, and equalize income among producers;
- Operate within the framework of the *Natural Products Marketing Act*, while excluding powers exercised by the national CCMA.

Despite the revocation of a prior levy provision (SOR/80-90), the current Order remains a vital tool for maintaining market stability and producer equity in Manitoba’s chicken sector.

**Note**: This Order operates in conjunction with the *Natural Products Marketing Act* and the *Plan* developed by the Commodity Board. Its effectiveness depends on the ongoing development and review of the marketing plan and market conditions.
