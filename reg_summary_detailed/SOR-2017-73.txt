Certainly. Below is a **detailed, accurate, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation — a **Proclamation under the Visiting Forces Act** issued by the Governor General of Canada on April 11, 2017.

### 📄 **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation: Designation of Montenegro as a Designated State under the Visiting Forces Act**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The proclamation is issued under **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act (VFA)**, which is contained in **Chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985**.
- Section 4 empowers the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government of Canada, acting through the Cabinet) to:
  - Designate a foreign country as a "designated state";
  - Declare the extent to which the VFA applies in that country;
  - Designate civilian personnel from that country as part of a "civilian component" of a visiting force operating in Canada.

> This authority is exercised through **Order in Council P.C. 2017-260**, dated **March 24, 2017**, which serves as the legal foundation for this proclamation.

#### **2. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

##### **A. Designation of Montenegro as a Designated State**
- The **Republic of Montenegro** is officially designated as a **designated state** under the Visiting Forces Act.
- This means that the provisions of the VFA (with certain exceptions) now apply to Montenegro in the context of Canadian military and civilian interactions.

##### **B. Scope of Applicability of the Visiting Forces Act**
- The VFA is declared **applicable in respect of Montenegro**, **except for Part VI**.
- **Part VI** of the VFA typically deals with matters such as:
  - The treatment of Canadian citizens or residents in foreign military forces;
  - Issues related to the rights and obligations of Canadian nationals in foreign operations;
  - Certain provisions related to consular protection or legal jurisdiction.
- The exclusion of Part VI indicates that **certain rights or protections for Canadian citizens or residents** are not extended or governed by the VFA in this context — likely to preserve distinct legal frameworks for Canadian nationals abroad.

> This means that while the general rules governing the presence, movement, and rights of foreign military forces and their civilian components in Canada apply, **specific provisions in Part VI do not extend to Montenegro**.

##### **C. Designation of Civilian Personnel**
- The proclamation designates **civilian personnel employed by the Montenegrin force** (i.e., the Montenegrin military or government-linked institutions) who are **in Canada** as part of a **civilian component of a visiting force**.
- Eligibility criteria for inclusion in this component:
  - Must **not be stateless persons**;
  - Must **not be nationals of any state that is not a designated state**;
  - Must **not be citizens or residents of Canada**.

> This ensures that only certain categories of Montenegrin civilians — specifically those who are not Canadian citizens or residents, and not stateless — are recognized under the VFA as part of a visiting force.

> This provision is critical for legal clarity regarding the rights, responsibilities, and protections afforded to these individuals when they are operating in Canada.

#### **3. Purpose and Implications**

- **Legal Clarity and Predictability**: The proclamation establishes a clear legal framework for how Canadian authorities will treat Montenegrin military and civilian personnel visiting Canada.
- **Facilitation of Bilateral Cooperation**: It enables smoother coordination between Canada and Montenegro in areas such as:
  - Joint military exercises;
  - Training programs;
  - Defense diplomacy;
  - Civilian exchanges or cooperation in security or intelligence fields.
- **Compliance with International Law and Canadian Law**: The designation ensures that Montenegrin forces and their civilian components operate under predictable and lawful conditions in Canada, consistent with Canada’s obligations under international law and its own domestic legislation.

---

#### **4. Enforcement and Effectiveness**

- The proclamation is **binding on all persons and institutions** in Canada.
- It is to be **governed and implemented by all relevant federal departments and agencies**, including:
  - Department of National Defence;
  - Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC);
  - Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS);
  - Federal courts and administrative bodies.

> All Canadian officials, agencies, and institutions are required to **take notice** of this proclamation and **govern themselves accordingly**.

---

#### **5. Issuance and Authentication**

- The proclamation was issued by **David Johnston**, the **Governor General of Canada**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**.
- It was signed and sealed with the **Great Seal of Canada** on **April 11, 2017**, in Ottawa.
- The Governor General, as the representative of the Crown, formally affirms the legal validity of the decision.

> The Governor General’s role here is **ceremonial and constitutional** — the actual decision is made by the federal government (via the Privy Council), and the proclamation is the formal legal instrument that gives it legal effect.

---

#### **6. Historical and Strategic Context (Implied)**

- Montenegro became a **member of NATO** in 2009, and Canada has long maintained strong defense and security ties with NATO members.
- This designation likely reflects:
  - Canada’s strategic interest in engaging with Montenegro in defense cooperation;
  - Montenegro’s growing role in regional security and stability in the Balkans;
  - A desire to formalize and standardize the legal status of Montenegrin personnel in Canada, especially in joint training or operations.

> The timing (March 2017) coincides with a period of increased international military engagement and defense cooperation in Europe, including participation in NATO-led missions.
