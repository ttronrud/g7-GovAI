## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Pest Control Products Incident Reporting Regulations**

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
- These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, under **subsection 67(1) of the Pest Control Products Act (PCA)**.
- **Purpose**: To establish a formal, mandatory reporting system for incidents involving pest control products (PCPs) that pose potential health or environmental risks.
- The goal is to ensure **timely, accurate, and comprehensive reporting** of adverse events to the Minister, enabling risk assessment, regulatory oversight, and public protection.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Pest Control Products Act*. |
| **Animal** | Any invertebrate or vertebrate, excluding humans. |
| **Domestic animal** | An animal under human control and dependent on humans for survival (e.g., dogs, cats, livestock). |
| **Incident** | An event involving exposure to a pest control product with health or environmental effects. **Exclusions**: <br> - Acts or activities that constitute offences under the *Criminal Code*; <br> - Exposure of a targeted subject (e.g., pests being treated). |
| **Incident Report** | A report containing specific information required by sections 3 and 4, submitted by a registrant or applicant to the Minister. |
| **Individual of a species at risk** | *Repealed* by SOR/2019-173, s. 2. |
| **Scientific study** | A study (human epidemiological or scientific investigation) sponsored by the registrant/applicant that identifies: <br> - New health/environmental hazards; <br> - Greater risks than those at registration; <br> - Previously undetected components or derivatives of the product. |

> ✅ **Note**: Information in an incident report does **not need to be proven or substantiated** by the registrant or applicant — it may be included even if unverified.

### **3. Classification of Incidents**

Incidents are categorized based on **subject** (human, animal, plant) and **effect** of exposure:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** Human death | Death of a human due to exposure. |
| **(b)** Major human effect | Human symptoms indicating life-threatening conditions, adverse reproductive/developmental effects, or chronic disability. |
| **(c)** Other human effect | Any human health effect not falling under (a) or (b). |
| **(d)** Animal death | Death of any animal; if in the U.S., specifically a **domestic animal**. |
| **(e)** Animal effect (non-death) | Any adverse effect on animals other than death. |
| **(f)** Effect on plants | Harm to terrestrial or aquatic plants. |
| **(g)** Package failure | A failure in packaging that could lead to human exposure or injury. |
| **(h)** Scientific study findings** | Study (ongoing, discontinued, or concluded) sponsored by the registrant/applicant showing: <br> - New hazards; <br> - Greater risk than at registration; <br> - Undetected components or derivatives. |

> 🔍 These categories determine **reporting obligations**, timeframes, and reporting thresholds.

---

### **5. Deemed Receipt of Information**

> ⚠️ **Special Rule for Scientific Studies**:  
> If the study is received by a related corporation (paragraph 1(b)), the information is **deemed received by the registrant/applicant one year after receipt** by that person.

> 📌 This provides a buffer period for studies that take time to reach the registrant.
