**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207; R.S., c. P-34)

**Effective Date:**  
00:00:02 on November 16, 2011

**Subject Matter:**

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

1. **Transfer of Control and Supervision**  
   The regulation establishes that, effective November 16, 2011, the **Communications Security Establishment (CSE)** will assume full **control and supervision** over its own operational and administrative functions. This includes:
   - Management of personnel
   - Oversight of programs and operations
   - Administrative and financial responsibilities
   - Strategic direction and policy implementation

2. **Scope of the Transfer**  
   The transfer specifically applies to:
   - The **Communications Security Establishment (CSE)**  
     A federal agency responsible for developing and maintaining Canada’s cryptographic capabilities, securing government communications, and protecting national security information.
   - The **Communications Security Establishment Internal Services Unit (CSE-ISU)**  
     A support unit within CSE that provides administrative, technical, and operational services to enable the CSE’s mission. This unit was previously under the broader supervision of the Department of National Defence.

3. **Legal Authority**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reorganize or transfer responsibilities among federal departments and agencies. This provision allows for the reallocation of administrative control to better align with mission objectives, efficiency, and operational effectiveness.

4. **Effective Time**  
   The transfer takes effect at **00:00:02 on November 16, 2011** — a precise time indicating a formal and legally binding transition. This timing ensures a clear administrative boundary and facilitates smooth operational continuity.

5. **Implications and Rationale**  
   - **Mission Alignment:** By placing CSE and CSE-ISU under direct control, the government ensures that national security communications and cryptographic operations are managed with strategic autonomy and operational focus.
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Decentralizing administrative oversight allows for more agile decision-making and reduces bureaucratic delays between the DND and the CSE.
   - **Security and Confidentiality:** The transfer reinforces the sensitivity of CSE’s work by ensuring that its internal operations and security protocols are managed by a dedicated, specialized entity.

### **Context and Background**

- The **Communications Security Establishment (CSE)** is a key component of Canada’s national security infrastructure, operating under the Department of National Defence but functioning independently in its mission.
- Prior to this transfer, the CSE and its internal services were jointly supervised by the DND, which could create potential conflicts in oversight and policy implementation.
- This reorganization reflects a broader trend in Canadian government reform to enhance the autonomy and effectiveness of specialized agencies, particularly those dealing with national security.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation marks a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It formally transfers the control and supervision of the CSE and its internal services unit from the Department of National Defence to the CSE itself, effective November 16, 2011. The move strengthens the operational independence, efficiency, and security of Canada’s communications intelligence and cryptographic capabilities, aligning with national security priorities and modern governance standards.
