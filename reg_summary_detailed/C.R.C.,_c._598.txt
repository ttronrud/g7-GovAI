The regulation you have provided—"[Repealed, P.C. 2013-1284]"—is marked as **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in effect.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**  
  The regulation identified by **P.C. 2013-1284** has been officially repealed. The designation "P.C." stands for "Proclamation," which is a form of legislative or administrative instrument used in certain jurisdictions (such as in the province of Manitoba, Canada) to issue rules, regulations, or orders.

- **Date of Repeal**: **2013**  
  The repeal was enacted in **2013**, specifically through a proclamation issued on or around that date. The exact date within 2013 is not specified in your input, but the reference to "P.C. 2013-1284" indicates it was one of the regulatory instruments issued in that year.

- **Jurisdiction**:  
  Given the format "P.C.," this regulation likely pertains to **Manitoba, Canada**, where Proclamations (P.C.) are used to amend or repeal rules under the authority of provincial legislation. The repeal would have been issued under the authority of a relevant provincial statute.

- **Nature of the Regulation (Inferred)**:  
  While the specific content of the original regulation is not provided, the fact that it was repealed suggests it may have governed a specific area such as:
  - Environmental protection
  - Workplace safety
  - Licensing or permitting
  - Public health or safety
  - Building or construction standards  
  *(Note: Without the original text, the exact subject cannot be determined.)*

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant
  - They conflict with newer legislation
  - They are superseded by a more comprehensive or updated rule
  - They are found to be redundant or ineffective
  - A new regulatory framework has been introduced

- **Legal Effect**:  
  Since the regulation is **repealed**, it has **no legal force** and is **no longer enforceable**. Any actions or requirements previously governed by it are now subject to either:
  - A new, current regulation
  - A different legal framework
  - The general laws of the province (if no specific rule applies)

- **Access to Original Text**:  
  The original regulation may still be archived in official government databases such as:
  - Manitoba’s Legislative Assembly website
  - The Manitoba government’s regulatory database (e.g., [www.gov.mb.ca](https://www.gov.mb.ca))
  - The Manitoba Statutes and Regulations (MSR) database

### Conclusion:

**P.C. 2013-1284 is a repealed regulation** and is no longer in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework in 2013, likely due to being outdated, redundant, or replaced by a more current rule. Without access to the original text, the specific subject matter cannot be confirmed, but the repeal status means that it has no current legal effect.
