**Detailed Summary of the *Telegraph and Cable Messages Terms and Conditions Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Telegraph and Cable Messages Terms and Conditions Order** and may be cited by that name. It establishes standardized terms and conditions that govern how telegraph and cable companies operating under the jurisdiction of the Commission must transmit, handle, and deliver messages.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**
The terms and conditions outlined in the **Schedule** to this Order are **prescribed and binding** on all telegraph and cable companies subject to the Commission’s oversight. These conditions apply to all message transmissions and related services provided by such companies.

---

### **3. Limitation of Liability for Transmission Failures or Errors**
A key provision limits the liability of the telegraph or cable company in the following situations:
- **Failure to transmit or deliver** a message.
- **Delays** caused by interruptions in the operation of transmission lines.
- **Errors** in transmission or delivery of an **unrepeated telegram** (i.e., a message not repeated by the company).
- **Errors due to**:
  - Cryptographic (cypher) or obscure messages.
  - Illegible handwriting or writing.

> **Important Limitation**: The company is **not liable for any damages** arising from these issues—whether due to negligence of its employees or otherwise—**except for the amount already paid** to send the message.

This means that if a message fails or contains an error, the sender bears the loss unless the company is specifically liable under a different clause (e.g., for repeated messages or insured transmission).

---

### **4. Right to Repeat Messages (with Limited Liability)**
To improve accuracy, the company offers a **repetition service**:
- The sender may request that the message be **repeated** by the company.
- This service incurs an **extra charge of one-half the regular rate** for the original message.

> **Liability for Repeated Messages**:
- If the message is repeated and the company fails to transmit or deliver it correctly due to **its own negligence**, the company is **liable for damages**.
- However, this liability is **limited to a maximum of $200**.

This provision serves as a limited safeguard against errors, but only when the sender opts for repetition and the company’s negligence is proven.

---

### **5. Insurance Against Errors (Optional Contractual Protection)**
Senders may **insure** the correctness of message transmission through a **written contract** that specifies:
- An **agreed amount of risk** (i.e., financial coverage for errors).
- A **premium** to be paid in addition to the standard charges.

> **Premium Rates**:
- **1%** of the message value for distances **up to 1,000 miles**.
- **2%** of the message value for distances **exceeding 1,000 miles**.

This insurance option allows senders to mitigate risk, especially for long-distance or high-value communications. It is **in addition** to the cost of repeated messages.

---

### **6. Indemnity for Third-Party Actions**
The company **shall not be liable** for:
- The **acts or omissions** of any other telegraph or cable company.

However, the company **shall make reasonable efforts** to forward the message through another company if necessary to reach the destination. In such cases:
- The company acts **only as an agent of the sender**.
- It **does not assume responsibility** for the actions or failures of third-party companies.

This provision protects the company from downstream failures caused by other service providers.

---

### **7. Responsibility for Messages**
The company is **not responsible** for a message until:
- It is **presented and accepted** at one of the company’s transmitting offices.

Two scenarios are defined:
- **If a message is delivered by the company’s own messenger** to a transmitting office, the messenger acts as an **agent of the sender** for that purpose.
- **If the message is received via telephone**, the person receiving it acts as the sender’s agent and is authorized to **accept and assent to the terms** of this Order on behalf of the sender.

This establishes a clear boundary: the company only assumes responsibility once the message is formally accepted at a transmitting office.

---

### **8. Time Limit for Claiming Damages**
The company is **not liable** for any damages unless:
- A written claim is submitted **within 60 days** of the date the telegram is received for transmission.

This creates a strict time limit to ensure prompt and fair claims, preventing prolonged or speculative litigation.

---

### **9. Non-Delegation Clause**
No employee, officer, or representative of the company may **alter, vary, or interpret** the terms and conditions set forth in this Order without formal authorization.

> This ensures **uniformity and consistency** in service delivery and legal obligations across all company personnel.

---
