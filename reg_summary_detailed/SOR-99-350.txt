**Detailed Summary of the *Organization of American States Privileges and Immunities in Canada Order* (S.C. 1991, c. 41)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, made under the authority of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*, grants specific **privileges and immunities** to representatives, officials, and experts of the **Organization of American States (OAS)** when they are operating in **Canada**. It is enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, pursuant to several provisions of the Act—specifically paragraphs 5(1)(a), (b), (c), (g), and (h)—which empower the government to confer immunities on international organizations and their personnel.

The Order establishes a legal framework that aligns the privileges and immunities of OAS personnel with those of diplomatic envoys under the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (the "Convention"), adapted to the specific status and functions of the OAS.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **"Convention"**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in Schedule III of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*. This serves as the legal basis for the immunities granted.
- **"Organization"**: Refers to the **Organization of American States (OAS)**, a regional intergovernmental organization of 35 countries in the Western Hemisphere.

## **1. Legal Status of the Organization**

The OAS is granted:
- The **legal capacity of a body corporate**, meaning it can own property, enter into contracts, and sue or be sued in Canadian courts.
- The **privileges and immunities** specified in **Articles II and III** of the Convention.

> *Note*: These provisions typically include immunity from legal process, inviolability of premises, and freedom from taxation or interference in operations—standard for international organizations under UN-style frameworks.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Alignment with International Standards**:
   - The Order ensures that the OAS, as a major regional intergovernmental body, operates under the same legal protections as the United Nations, consistent with international norms on diplomatic and official immunities.

     - No tax exemptions on imported goods (except personal baggage).
     - Immunity is conditional on official duties.

4. **Practical Benefits**:
   - Enables smooth operation of OAS meetings and missions in Canada.
   - Ensures security and confidentiality of official communications.
   - Facilitates rapid repatriation during emergencies.
   - Supports the professional functioning of staff and experts.
