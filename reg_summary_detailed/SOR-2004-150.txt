**Detailed Summary of the *Compensation for Certain Birds Destroyed in British Columbia (Avian Influenza) Regulations***  
*Issued: June 4, 2004*  
*Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food – Robert Speller*  
*Under Section 55a of the Health of Animals Act (S.C. 1997, c. 6, s. 71; S.C. 1990, c. 21)*

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The regulation was introduced in response to the outbreak of **avian influenza (bird flu)** in British Columbia. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food determined that there was **no readily available market** for certain birds (specifically chickens, ducks, and geese) that were destroyed as a public health and animal welfare measure under the *Health of Animals Act*.

To compensate affected poultry producers for the loss of their birds, the Minister invoked **section 55a of the Health of Animals Act**, which authorizes the creation of compensation regulations for animals destroyed due to disease outbreaks. This regulation establishes a **specific compensation framework** for chickens, ducks, and geese destroyed in a designated control area due to avian influenza.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only to birds destroyed in the control area** of British Columbia under **subsection 48(1)** of the *Health of Animals Act*, specifically because of an outbreak of avian influenza.

The **control area** is defined as the region declared under subsection 27(1) of the Act and remains in effect as of **March 11, 2004**. This area was identified as a high-risk zone where avian influenza was detected and where bird movements were restricted to prevent further spread.

The regulation covers three types of birds:
- **Chickens** (female broiler breeders or table egg layers)
- **Ducks** (female duck breeders or table egg layers)
- **Geese** (female goose breeders)

| **Duck** | A female duck breeder or a duck table egg layer |
| **Goose** | A female goose breeder |
| **Control Area** | The region in BC declared under subsection 27(1) of the Act, as of March 11, 2004 |

### **Market Value Determination (Compensation Formula)**

The compensation amount for each type of bird is calculated using a **formula-based valuation system** designed to reflect the bird's age, production cycle, and market value at time of destruction. The goal is to ensure fair compensation based on economic loss, while also accounting for salvage value.

---

#### **1. Market Value of a Chicken**

The market value is determined differently depending on the bird’s age:

- **For chickens 25 weeks or younger (broiler breeder) or 19 weeks or younger (table egg layer):**  
  Uses a formula based on age and production cycle.

- **For chickens older than 25 weeks (broiler breeder) or older than 19 weeks (table egg layer):**  
  Uses a different formula.

**Variables in the formula:**
- **M** = Maximum amount for a chicken under Section 2 of the *Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations*  
- **V₀** = Value of a day-old chicken (broiler breeder or table egg layer)  
- **S** = Salvage value of the chicken (i.e., value if sold after destruction)  
- **T** = 25 weeks (for broiler breeders), 19 weeks (for egg layers) – the maximum productive lifespan  
- **A** = Age of the chicken at time of destruction (in weeks)  
- **C** = Average production cycle (in weeks) of the bird type

> **Important Note:** The market value of a chicken **cannot exceed** the maximum amount set under Section 2 of the *Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations*.

---

#### **2. Market Value of a Duck**

- **For ducks 22 weeks or younger:**  
  Uses a formula based on age and production cycle.

- **For ducks older than 22 weeks:**  
  Uses a different formula.

**Variables in the formula:**
- **M** = Maximum amount for a duck under Section 2 of the *Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations*  
- **V₀** = Value of a day-old duck (breeder or egg layer)  
- **S** = Salvage value  
- **T** = 22 weeks (maximum productive lifespan)  
- **A** = Age at destruction (in weeks)  
- **C** = Average production cycle (in weeks)

> **Key Provision:** Despite the general Compensation Regulations, the **maximum amount** for a duck under subsection 51(3) of the *Health of Animals Act* is **fixed at $73.34** for a duck breeder and **$37.51** for a duck table egg layer. This means that even if the formula yields a higher value, the compensation cannot exceed these caps.

---

#### **3. Market Value of a Goose**

- **For geese 22 weeks or younger:**  
  Uses a formula based on age and production cycle.

- **For geese older than 22 weeks:**  
  Uses a different formula.

**Variables in the formula:**
- **M** = Maximum amount for a goose under Section 2 of the *Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations*  
- **V₀** = Value of a day-old goose  
- **S** = Salvage value  
- **T** = 22 weeks (maximum productive lifespan)  
- **A** = Age at destruction (in weeks)  
- **C** = Average production cycle (in weeks)

> **Key Provision:** Despite the general regulations, the **maximum amount** for a goose under subsection 51(3) of the *Health of Animals Act* is **fixed at $149.59**. This cap ensures that no compensation exceeds this amount, regardless of the formula output.

### **Key Regulatory Principles**

1. **Fair Compensation Based on Age and Production Value**  
   The formulas are designed to reflect the economic loss to producers by accounting for:
   - How long the bird had been productive
   - How much it would have produced over its lifetime
   - The cost of replacing the bird

2. **Salvage Value Deduction**  
   The salvage value (value if the bird could be sold after destruction) is subtracted from the total value to determine net loss.

3. **Age-Based Adjustments**  
   Birds that are younger and still in their productive phase receive higher compensation because they have more potential production left.

4. **Maximum Caps on Compensation**  
   The regulation explicitly sets **maximum compensation amounts** for ducks and geese (under subsection 51(3) of the Act) that **override** the general compensation rules. This ensures consistency and prevents overcompensation.

5. **No Market for Birds**  
   The rationale for creating this regulation was the **lack of a market** for the birds after destruction — meaning producers could not sell them or recover value through the market. Thus, compensation is necessary to offset financial losses.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 55a of the Health of Animals Act**  
  Grants the Minister the authority to make regulations providing compensation for animals destroyed due to disease outbreaks.

- **Section 2 of the Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations**  
  Provides the general framework for determining market value, which is referenced but **not the final determinant** in this case due to the specific caps set in this regulation.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- The regulation applies **only to birds destroyed in the control area** during the avian influenza outbreak.
- Compensation is paid to **producers** (e.g., farmers, poultry owners) who had birds destroyed under the Act.
- The Minister is responsible for administering the compensation process, including determining eligibility, verifying destruction, and calculating values using the formulas provided.

---

### **Repeal and Updates**

- The definition of "bird" was **repealed** by **SOR/2005-113, s.1**, meaning it is no longer used in the regulation.
- The regulation remains in force as a response to the 2004 avian influenza outbreak and may have been referenced in later policy updates, though it is not currently active in a general sense.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted, age-based, and economically grounded compensation system** for poultry producers in British Columbia who lost chickens, ducks, and geese due to avian influenza. It balances:
- The need for **fair compensation** based on production potential and age,
- The **practical reality** of no market for destroyed birds,
- And the **need for consistency and caps** to ensure financial stability and administrative clarity.

It reflects a government response to a public health emergency, emphasizing both animal welfare and economic support for agricultural producers during times of crisis.

**Note:** While this regulation was issued in 2004 and remains historically significant, it may no longer be in active force due to changes in the Health of Animals
