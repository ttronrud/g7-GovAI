**Official Title:**  
Order in Council P.C. 1989-67 (as amended or issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council)

**Date of Publication:**  
January 30, 1989 (original Order in Council P.C. 1989-137)  
This summary refers to a subsequent **revocation and re-designation** issued under the same authority, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 1447*, on **January 30, 1989** (SI/89-67).

---

### 1. **Purpose of the Regulation**

This Order in Council serves two primary functions:

1. **Revocation of a Prior Order**  
   It formally **revokes** Order in Council P.C. 1989-137, dated January 30, 1989, which had previously designated a different individual or entity as the Minister responsible for Statistics Canada or related functions.

2. **Designation of a New Minister**  
   It **designates the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** as:
   - The **"Minister"** for the purposes of the *Statistics Act*;
   - The **"appropriate Minister"** for the purposes of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically with respect to **Statistics Canada**.

---

### 2. **Legal Authority**

The regulation is based on two key statutory definitions:

#### a. *Statistics Act* – Definition of "Minister" (Section 2)
- The term "Minister" is defined in section 2 of the *Statistics Act* to mean a member of the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for the administration of the Act.
- By this designation, the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology is formally recognized as the Minister responsible for the administration, oversight, and policy direction of Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*.

#### b. *Financial Administration Act* – Definition of "appropriate Minister" (Paragraph (b))
- Paragraph (b) of section 2 of the *Financial Administration Act* defines the "appropriate Minister" as a Minister responsible for the administration of a department or agency that is subject to financial administration rules.
- This designation establishes the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** as the "appropriate Minister" with respect to **Statistics Canada**.
- This role grants the Minister authority over financial matters related to Statistics Canada, including budgetary oversight, financial reporting, and compliance with financial administration policies.

---

### 3. **Key Implications of the Designation**

- **Policy and Oversight Responsibility**: The Minister of Industry, Science and Technology now holds formal responsibility for the strategic direction, policy development, and governance of Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*.
- **Financial Accountability**: As the "appropriate Minister," the Minister is responsible for ensuring that Statistics Canada complies with financial administration requirements, including budgeting, financial reporting, and accountability to the federal government.
- **Succession and Continuity**: This designation replaces a prior assignment (P.C. 1989-137), ensuring clarity and continuity in ministerial responsibilities, particularly in the context of interdepartmental coordination.

---

### 4. **Context and Background**

- This change reflects a shift in ministerial responsibilities, likely due to reorganization of federal departments during the 1980s.
- The Minister of Industry, Science and Technology was likely chosen because of the overlap between statistical functions (e.g., economic data, innovation metrics, industrial performance) and the mandate of that portfolio.
- It underscores the integration of statistical services within broader economic and technological policy frameworks.

---

### 5. **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This Order in Council is a **formal, binding administrative action** issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
- It is issued under the principle of **"ministerial responsibility"**, ensuring that specific government agencies are under the oversight of a clearly designated minister.
- The designation is not temporary; it establishes a permanent assignment for the purposes of both statutory and financial governance.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively:

- **Revokes** an outdated or superseded ministerial designation (P.C. 1989-137);
- **Designates** the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as the **Minister** under the *Statistics Act* and the **appropriate Minister** under the *Financial Administration Act* with respect to Statistics Canada.

This ensures that Statistics Canada operates under clear, legally recognized leadership and financial accountability, aligning its governance with the broader federal administrative framework.

---

**Note:** While the Order is dated January 30, 1989, and appears to be a single publication (SI/89-67), it may have been part of a broader administrative reorganization that restructured federal departmental responsibilities during that period.
