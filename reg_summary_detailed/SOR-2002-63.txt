**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Regulations Excluding Certain Indictable Offences from the Definition of “Designated Offence”  

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, under **subsection 462.3(2)a of the Criminal Code** of Canada. This provision empowers the government to exclude specific indictable offences from the definition of “designated offence” as set out in subsection 462.3(1) of the Criminal Code.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **exclude certain specific indictable offences** from being classified as “designated offences” under the Criminal Code. This exclusion is significant because “designated offences” are subject to special provisions, including the potential for mandatory minimum sentences and specific sentencing guidelines under the Code. By excluding certain offences, the regulation ensures that those particular offences are not subject to these enhanced sentencing rules or procedural requirements, thereby providing a more tailored or less punitive approach to their prosecution.

**Scope of Excluded Offences:**  
The regulation explicitly excludes the following **indictable offences**—as defined in the respective Acts—from the definition of “designated offence” in subsection 462.3(1) of the Criminal Code:

1. **Feeds Act**  
2. **Fertilizers Act**  
3. **Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Act**  
4. **Health of Animals Act**  
5. **Nuclear Safety and Control Act** – *with a notable exception*  
   - *Exclusion applies except for the indictable offence under section 50* of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act.  
     → This means that the offence under section 50 (e.g., violations related to nuclear safety) **remains** a designated offence and is therefore subject to the special provisions of subsection 462.3(1).  
6. **Plant Protection Act**  
7. **Safe Food for Canadians Act**  
8. **Seeds Act**

**Important Notes on Status and Repeal:**  
- Several of the listed Acts have been **repealed** over time, including:
  - The **Feeds Act**, **Fertilizers Act**, **Health of Animals Act**, and **Nuclear Safety and Control Act** (in whole or part) were repealed by:
    - **S.C. 2010, c. 12, s. 36** (2010)
    - **SOR/2018-108, s. 391** (2018)
    - **SOR/2010-74, s. 1** (2010)
- These repeals indicate that the underlying legislation for these offences no longer exists in current law.  
- Despite the repeal of the Acts, the regulation **retains the exclusion** as a historical or transitional measure. This may reflect a legislative decision to preserve the status of certain offences in the Criminal Code's definition of “designated offences” even after the original enabling statutes have been abolished.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations came into force on **February 1, 2002**.

**Legal Implications:**  
- Offences listed in the regulation are **not considered "designated offences"** under subsection 462.3(1) of the Criminal Code.  
- As a result, they are **not subject to mandatory minimum sentences** or other special sentencing provisions tied to the designation.  
- This means that prosecutors and courts may apply sentencing guidelines more flexibly, without being bound by the stricter parameters that apply to designated offences.  
- The exception for **section 50 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act** ensures that high-risk, safety-critical nuclear-related offences remain subject to enhanced penalties, reflecting their serious nature and public importance.

**Context and Background:**  
This regulation was part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to refine the scope of “designated offences” in the Criminal Code. The designation of certain offences as “designated” was introduced to address serious or recurring crimes, particularly those with significant public safety implications. However, many of the offences excluded here relate to **regulatory or agricultural compliance**, which may not meet the threshold for mandatory sentencing or public safety concerns. Their exclusion reflects a policy choice to treat these as administrative or sector-specific violations rather than as serious criminal offences requiring enhanced penalties.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a **legislative clarification** that certain historical or sector-specific indictable offences are not included in the category of “designated offences” under the Criminal Code. While several of the underlying Acts have since been repealed, the regulation maintains the exclusion as a formal designation. It reflects a careful balancing of public safety, sentencing policy, and regulatory oversight. Notably, the exception for section 50 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act underscores the continued legal significance of nuclear safety violations, which remain subject to strict criminal penalties.

**Final Note:**  
Due to the repeal of several of the Acts, the practical relevance of this regulation today may be limited. However, it remains a part of the legal record and may still be referenced in sentencing or judicial interpretation for historical or procedural reasons.
