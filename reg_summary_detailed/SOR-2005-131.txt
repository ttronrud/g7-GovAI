**Detailed Summary of the Plum Pox Virus Compensation Regulations, 2004**

---

### **Overview**

The *Plum Pox Virus Compensation Regulations, 2004* (S.C. 1990, c. 22) were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, pursuant to **paragraph 47(q) of the Plant Protection Act**. These regulations establish a compensation framework for farmers who suffered financial losses due to the presence of **Plum Pox Virus (PPV)** in their orchards, specifically between **January 1, 2004, and March 31, 2011**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to provide **financial relief** to producers of apricot, nectarine, peach, or plum trees who were required to remove and dispose of infected trees under orders from inspectors under the *Plant Protection Act* or related regulations.

---

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Certified Tree**  
   A tree that meets the standards outlined in **Document D-83-44**, prepared by the Food Production and Inspection Branch of Agriculture Canada (now the Canadian Food Inspection Agency – CFIA), dated December 21, 1983. This document specifies the criteria for tree certification.  
   - The document is available in both official languages (English and French) upon request from the CFIA.  
   - Alternatively, "equivalent requirements" may be accepted.

2. **Tested Tree**  
   A tree propagated from **budwood and clonal rootstock** that originated from plants that have been **annually tested by the CFIA and found negative for PPV**.  
   - This ensures that replacement trees are free from the virus.

3. **Tree**  
   Any apricot, nectarine, peach, or plum tree planted in an orchard for **commercial production of tender fruit**.

## **Eligibility for Compensation**

A person may be eligible for compensation if they meet **all of the following conditions**:

### 1. **Notice of Disposal**
- The person received a **formal notice** from an inspector under the *Plant Protection Act* or *Plant Protection Regulations* between **January 1, 2004, and March 31, 2011**, ordering them to dispose of one or more trees due to the presence of PPV.

### 2. **Incurred a Loss**
The applicant must have suffered a **direct financial loss** resulting from:

### 3. **Farm Income Reporting**
The applicant must have reported **farm income from tender fruit sales** in one of the following years:
- The year immediately before the notice was issued;
- The year the notice was issued;
- The year the loss occurred.

> This requirement ensures that only those actively engaged in commercial fruit production are eligible.

### 4. **Timely Application Submission**

- However, **exceptions** are allowed under exceptional circumstances (see below).

---

- Amendments must still comply with all eligibility criteria.

---
