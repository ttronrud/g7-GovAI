Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which revokes an old Export Control List and establishes a new one under Canada’s *Export and Import Permits Act*.

## 📜 **Regulatory Summary: Revocation and Establishment of the Export Control List (S.C. 1987, c. 15, s. 26)**

### 🔍 **Overview**
On **July 14, 1987**, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, **revoked the previous Export Control List** (C.R.C., c. 601) and **established a new, updated Export Control List** under **Section 3 and Section 6 of the Export and Import Permits Act**.

This regulation defines the scope, applicability, and exceptions for **goods and technologies subject to export controls** in Canada. It reflects international agreements and national security interests, particularly in the areas of **dual-use items, nuclear materials, firearms, and agricultural products**.

---

## 📚 Key Provisions and Structure

### 1. **Definitions**
The regulation introduces two foundational definitions used throughout the list:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Guide** | A *Guide to Canada’s Export Control List*, published by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD), as amended from time to time. This serves as the interpretive framework for the control list. |
| **Wassenaar Arrangement** | The international list of *dual-use goods and technologies* and *munitions* adopted in 1996 by the Wassenaar Arrangement (a multilateral export control regime). It includes items with both civilian and military applications. Amendments are applied as they occur. |

> ⚠️ Note: The Guide and Wassenaar Arrangement are critical for interpreting which goods fall under export control.

---

## 🚨 **Export Control Scope (Subject to Control)**

The following goods and technologies are subject to export control **based on their intended destination and classification**:

---

### ✅ **Group 1: Goods under Wassenaar Arrangement**
- All goods and technologies described in **Group 1 of the Guide**.
- Canada has agreed to control these items **in accordance with the Wassenaar Arrangement**.
- Applies to **all destinations** unless otherwise specified.

> 📌 This group includes dual-use technologies (e.g., advanced electronics, chemicals, software) that could be used for both civilian and military purposes.

---

### ✅ **Group 2: Firearms and Related Items**
Applies to **firearms and related technologies**, with specific exceptions and conditions:

#### a) **General Controls**
- All firearms (as defined in the *Criminal Code*, Section 2) **except antique firearms** (as defined in subsection 84(1) of the *Criminal Code*).
- Excludes **antique firearms** (i.e., those manufactured before 1938, unless otherwise defined).

#### b) **Prohibited or Restricted Firearms**
- Includes firearms:
  - Listed in **Part 1 of the Firearms Regulations** (prohibited or restricted);
  - Designed to discharge a projectile at:
    - Muzzle velocity **> 152.4 m/s**, or
    - Muzzle energy **> 5.7 joules**.
- Also includes **smooth-bore weapons**, **automatic weapons**, and **projectors** described in **items 2-1 and 2-2.a of the Guide**.

#### c) **Exemptions for Pre-1938 Weapons**
- **Smooth-bore weapons, automatic weapons, or projectors**:
  - Used for **hunting or sporting purposes**;
  - Manufactured **before 1938**;
  - Are **not antique firearms**; or
  - Use **non-centre fire cased ammunition**.

> 🔍 *Note: These exceptions are limited and require verification of origin, use, and compliance with the Inter-American Convention on Firearms.*

---

### ✅ **Group 3: Nuclear Materials and Technologies**
Applies to **nuclear-related goods and technologies** under two international frameworks:

#### a) **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**
- Canada is a signatory to the NPT (entered into force March 5, 1970).
- Controls all nuclear-related items in accordance with the treaty.

#### b) **Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Guidelines**
- Applies to transfers governed by:
  - **INFCIRC/254/Rev.14/Part 1** (for nuclear materials and equipment);
  - **INFCIRC/254/Rev.11/Part 2** (for nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials, software, and technology).

#### ❌ **Exclusions (Non-Controlled Items)**
Certain items containing small amounts of nuclear materials are **exempt** from control, including:

| Exempt Item | Conditions |
|-----------|------------|
| Natural or depleted uranium ≤ 4 grams | In a sensing component (e.g., detectors) |
| Alloys < 5% thorium | For non-nuclear use |
| Thorium-containing ceramics | Manufactured for non-nuclear use |
| Medicinal substances | Containing source material |
| Trace amounts | Found on contaminated items (clothing, shielding, packaging) |
| Source material used only in civil non-nuclear applications | E.g., shielding, packaging, ballasts, counterweights, alloy/ceramic production |
| Special fissionable material ≤ 4 effective grams | In sensing components |
| Plutonium-238 | In heart pacemakers only |

> 📌 **Effective Grams Formula** (for calculating weight of enriched uranium or plutonium):
> - **Plutonium isotopes or U-233**: Isotope weight in grams.
> - **Uranium enriched ≥1% U-235**: Element weight × (enrichment)^2.
> - **Uranium enriched <1% U-235**: Element weight × 0.0001.

> ⚠️ *Source material and special fissionable material are defined per NSG Guidelines.*

#### ✅ **Deuterium and Heavy Water**
- **Deuterium**, **heavy water (D₂O)**, or any compound where **deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio > 1:5,000**.
- Only if the Minister determines it is destined for use in a **nuclear reactor capable of maintaining a controlled self-sustaining fission chain reaction**.

> 🚫 This means deuterium is controlled only when used in nuclear reactors — not for general industrial or scientific purposes.

---

### ✅ **Group 4: Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment and Technology**
- Applies to goods and technologies under the **NPT** and **NSG Guidelines (INFCIRC/254/Rev.11/Part 2)**.
- Covers dual-use equipment (e.g., centrifuges, reactors, software) that can be used in nuclear programs.

> 📌 This group overlaps with Group 3 but focuses more on **equipment and technology** rather than raw materials.

---

### ✅ **Agricultural and Food Products (Specific Exports)**

#### 1. **Wood Products**
- **All logs of all species of wood** → Export to **all destinations**.
- **Pulpwood of all species** → Export to **all destinations**.
- **Red cedar blocks, bolts, blanks, boards** → Suitable for manufacturing shakes or shingles → Export to **all destinations**.

> 🔍 These are controlled due to potential use in military or construction applications.

#### 2. **Softwood Lumber Products**
- Exports to the **United States** only.
- Based on **Annex 1A to the Softwood Lumber Agreement (2006)**, as amended to October 12, 2015.

- **Paragraph 5 is read without reference to item (e)** (i.e., specific conditions are waived).
- **Tariff references**: HTSUS classifications are interpreted as **Canadian tariff classifications** (Annex 1B).
- All references to "imported" are replaced with "exported" in both English and French versions.
