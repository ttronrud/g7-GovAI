## 🔍 **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, which provides the legal foundation for banking regulation in Canada. |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value of shares or ownership interests reported on an **unconsolidated basis** on a bank’s or entity’s balance sheet. *Note: "book value" was repealed in 2008 (SOR/2008-168, s.1).* |
| **Specialized financing entity of the bank** | An entity that is either: <br> - Controlled by the bank, or <br> - In which the bank holds a **substantial investment**. <br> This includes entities that hold investments in other entities that the bank may acquire control of under subsection 466(4) of the Act. |
| **Subsidiary** | A company in which a bank holds a controlling interest. **Excludes** specialized financing entities of the bank. |

> ⚠️ **Important Clarification**:  
> For the purposes of defining a *specialized financing entity* under subsection 464(1) of the *Bank Act*, the definition is expanded to include any entity that acquires or holds shares/interests in entities the bank may control or invest in under **subsection 466(4)**.

## 🎯 **Scope of the Regulations**

These regulations apply to two primary areas:

1. **Specialized financing activities** under **subsection 466(4)** of the *Bank Act*.
2. **Ownership** by a bank of shares or ownership interests in a **specialized financing entity** under **paragraph 468(2)(b)** of the *Bank Act*.

Thus, the rules govern both:
- What types of entities banks can finance through specialized financing, and
- How long and how much banks can invest in such entities.

## 🚫 **Prohibited Activities (What Banks Cannot Do)**

A bank **shall not** engage in specialized financing activities to:
1. **Acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in**, any entity listed in **paragraphs 468(1)(a) to (j)** of the *Bank Act* (e.g., entities involved in credit card issuance, lending to individuals, etc.).

2. **Acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in**:
   - An entity **primarily engaged in leasing motor vehicles in Canada** for the purpose of extending credit or financing a customer’s acquisition of a motor vehicle.
   - An entity **primarily engaged in providing temporary possession** of personal property (including motor vehicles) to customers **for purposes other than financing** the acquisition of that property.
   - An entity that **acts as an insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

> 📌 *Rationale*: These activities are considered high-risk or non-core to banking, and may lead to overexposure or conflicts of interest.

## ⏳ **Ownership Duration Limit (13-Year Cap)**

- A bank **shall not** hold control of, or hold a substantial investment in, a specialized financing entity for **more than 13 consecutive years**.
- This restriction applies regardless of whether the entity is directly owned or indirectly held through a chain of entities.

> 🔁 **Exception**:  
> If a specialized financing entity of the bank (e.g., a financing subsidiary) held control or a substantial investment in an entity **before becoming a specialized financing entity**, that period **does not count** toward the 13-year limit.

> 🚫 **Exception also applies**:  
> A specialized financing entity **controlled by** another specialized financing entity **is not considered** when evaluating the 13-year rule.

## 💰 **Investment Thresholds (Value-Based Caps)**

### 1. **Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Cap**

- A bank **shall not** acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in, an entity **controlled by a specialized financing entity of the bank** or in which such a specialized financing entity holds a substantial investment, if the **sum** of the following exceeds or would exceed **25% of the bank’s regulatory capital**:
