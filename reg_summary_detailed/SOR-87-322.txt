- **SOR/2007-209** is a statutory order issued in Canada, typically under the authority of a federal department or ministry, and it contains amendments or repeals of existing regulations.
- The phrase **"repealed"** means that the regulation no longer exists in force and is no longer applicable.
- **Section 1** of SOR/2007-209 is the legal provision that formally removes the referenced regulation(s).
- The repeated nature of the entry suggests that multiple provisions or sections of a prior regulation were affected by the repeal, or that the repeal notice was applied in multiple contexts or parts of a larger regulation.

### Important Notes:
- Since the regulation itself is not provided, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice.
- The repeal does not provide details about what the original regulation was, its scope, or its purpose — only that it was formally canceled.
- Repeal orders are typically used to modernize, simplify, or correct outdated or redundant rules. In this case, the regulation was likely obsolete, redundant, or superseded by a new legal framework.

No further details about the original regulation’s content, subject matter, or jurisdiction are available from this entry alone.
