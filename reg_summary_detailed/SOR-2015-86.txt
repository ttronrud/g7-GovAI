**Detailed Summary of the First Nations Elections Regulations (S.C. 2014, c. 5)**

---

### **Overview**
The *First Nations Elections Regulations* (S.C. 2014, c. 5) are issued under the authority of the *First Nations Elections Act* by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. These regulations provide a comprehensive, detailed framework for the conduct of elections within First Nations communities in Canada, ensuring transparency, fairness, accessibility, and compliance with legal standards.

They govern the appointment of electoral officers, the preparation and management of voter lists, nomination processes, voting procedures (including mail-in ballots and advance polling), and the declaration of election results — all while respecting the unique governance structures of First Nations.
