### **5. Residency and Residence Rules – Key Provisions**

#### 🟢 **Rule for Non-Ordinary Residents in New Zealand (Article V)**
A person who:
- Is **ordinarily resident in Canada**,
- Is **present in Canada or New Zealand** on the date of application,
- Has **intended to remain in Canada for at least 26 weeks**, and
- Has **resided in New Zealand for at least one continuous year since age 20**

👉 Shall be **deemed to be ordinarily resident in New Zealand** for the purpose of applying for a New Zealand benefit.

> This rule allows Canadian citizens or residents with long-term New Zealand ties to access NZ benefits despite not being physically present.

#### 🟢 **Rule for Presence in New Zealand (Article VI)**
If a person is entitled to a New Zealand benefit but payment is **conditional on presence in New Zealand**, they shall be **deemed present** in NZ if:
- They are ordinarily resident in Canada,
- And have lived in NZ for at least one year since age 20.

> This ensures that individuals who are temporarily absent from NZ can still receive benefits.

#### 🟡 **Temporary Absence from Canada (≤26 weeks)**
- A temporary absence from Canada **does not interrupt** ordinary residence in Canada.
- If absence exceeds 26 weeks, the person **ceases to be considered ordinarily resident** in Canada.

#### 🟡 **Departure from New Zealand with Intent to Reside in Canada**
- If someone leaves NZ with the intention of becoming **ordinarily resident in Canada for at least 26 weeks**, and achieves that status within 26 weeks of departure:
👉 They are **deemed to have become ordinarily resident in Canada on the date of departure**.

> This prevents loss of benefits due to short-term migration.

### **6. Exclusion and Limitation Rules**

#### ⚠️ **No Entitlement to NZ Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension Before Age of Entitlement**
- A person **not yet entitled** to NZ superannuation or veteran’s pension **cannot be deemed entitled** under this agreement.

#### ⚠️ **No Entitlement to Invalids, Widows, or Domestic Benefits After Entering NZ Superannuation or Veteran’s Pension**
- Once a person reaches the age of entitlement to **NZ superannuation or veteran’s pension**, they **lose eligibility** for:
  - Invalids benefits
  - Widows benefits
  - Domestic purposes benefits

> This prevents overlap between retirement and disability/widow benefits.

---

### **7. Creditable Periods and Residency Aggregation**

#### 📌 **Canadian Creditable Periods Counted as NZ Residence**
- For **New Zealand superannuation or veteran’s pension**, a Canadian creditable period **after age 20** is **deemed to be a period of residence and presence in NZ**.
- For **invalids, widows, or domestic benefits**, a CPP creditable period is **deemed to be a period of residence and presence in NZ**.

> This allows individuals to use Canadian contributions toward NZ benefits.

#### 📌 **Avoiding Double Counting**
- If a period of **residence in NZ and a Canadian creditable period coincide**, it is counted **only once** as NZ residence.
- A Canadian creditable period under **Old Age Security Act** and **CPP** that overlaps is counted **only once**.

> Prevents double counting of time spent in both countries.

---

### **8. Dependent Children – Birth in Canada Counted as Birth in NZ**

A **dependent child born in Canada** shall be treated as though **born in New Zealand**, provided:
- In the case of a **widow**: child was conceived before the death of the last spouse.
- In the case of a **widower**: child was born before the death of the last spouse.

> Ensures that children of deceased spouses are eligible for benefits regardless of place of birth.

---

### **9. Widows’ Benefits – Special Provisions**

A widow who is ordinarily resident in Canada or NZ shall:
- Be **deemed to have accumulated a Canadian creditable period** for any time her last deceased spouse had one under CPP.
- Any overlapping periods (both spouses accumulating CPP) are counted **only once**.
- A Canadian creditable period of the deceased spouse is **deemed to be a period of ordinary residence in NZ** for the purpose of determining the spouse’s residence.

> This ensures that widows can claim benefits based on their deceased spouse’s contributions.

---

### **10. Benefit Calculation Rules**
