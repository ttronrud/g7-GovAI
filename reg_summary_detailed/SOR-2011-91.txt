**Detailed Summary of the Deposit Out of the Normal Course of Events Notification Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

These regulations are issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **paragraph 38(9)(a) of the Fisheries Act (R.S., c. F-14)**. This provision grants the Minister the authority to make regulations to implement specific provisions of the Fisheries Act, particularly those related to the reporting of environmental incidents involving deleterious substances.

The purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear procedures and designated persons** who are responsible for promptly notifying authorities about the **deposit of a deleterious substance outside the normal course of events**, or the **serious and imminent danger** of such a deposit. This ensures rapid response to potential environmental harm to Canada’s aquatic ecosystems.

**Key Provisions:**

### 1. **Prescribed Persons Required to Report (Under Subsection 38(4) of the Fisheries Act):**

The following individuals or entities are legally designated as "prescribed persons" under subsection 38(4) of the Fisheries Act:

- **Emergency Telephone Service Providers**:  
  Specifically, those who operate **24-hour emergency telephone services** from the office listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**, for the respective province listed in **Column 1**.  
  → These services are intended to serve as the primary point of contact for reporting emergencies involving deleterious substance deposits.

- **Pollution Prevention Officers (PPOs)**:  
  Officers referred to in:
  - Paragraph **5(8)(a)** or  
  - Subsection **5(9)** of the *Pollutant Discharge Reporting Regulations, 1995*  
  → These officers are responsible for monitoring and managing pollution risks, especially in industrial or commercial settings.

> *Note:* The designation ensures that individuals with direct responsibility for environmental monitoring and emergency response are legally empowered to act.

### 2. **Reporting Obligations:**

Any person required to report under subsection 38(4) of the Fisheries Act must **notify immediately** (without delay) one of the following:

#### a) In most cases (excluding those specified in paragraph (b)):
- An **inspector** or a person referred to in paragraph (1)(a) (i.e., the emergency service provider or PPO)  
- **At the telephone number** listed in **Column 3 of the Schedule**  
  → This number is **only accessible within the respective province**, ensuring localized and efficient emergency response.

#### b) In specific cases involving vessels:
- For the **master of a vessel**, the **owner of a vessel**, or the **operator of an oil handling facility** to whom the *Pollutant Discharge Reporting Regulations, 1995* apply:
  - They must notify either:
    - An **inspector**, or  
    - The person referred to in paragraph (1)(b) (i.e., the pollution prevention officer)

> This provision ensures that maritime operators—especially those handling oil or other hazardous materials—are held to a strict reporting standard when a pollution risk arises.

### 3. **Effective Date:**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication, allowing for timely enforcement and compliance.

---

### 4. **Geographic and Access Restrictions:**

- The emergency telephone numbers listed in the schedule are **province-specific** and **only accessible within that province**.  
- This restriction ensures that emergency services are tailored to local infrastructure and jurisdictional boundaries, preventing cross-provincial misuse and ensuring that local authorities can respond effectively.

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

These regulations serve as a critical component of Canada’s environmental protection framework under the *Fisheries Act*. By establishing:

- Clear **reporting triggers** (deleterious substance deposits outside normal conditions),
- Specific **responsible parties** (emergency service providers, PPOs, vessel operators),
- Timely **notification requirements**,
- And geographically relevant **contact points**,

…they help prevent or mitigate environmental damage to fish, aquatic life, and water quality. The regulations are designed to ensure a **rapid and coordinated response** to pollution events—especially those involving oil, chemicals, or other harmful substances—thereby protecting fish stocks, ecosystems, and public health.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Deposit Out of the Normal Course of Events Notification Regulations* provide a structured, enforceable mechanism for reporting environmental emergencies involving deleterious substances. By clearly defining who must report, when, and to whom, and by limiting access to province-specific emergency lines, the regulations enhance accountability, improve response times, and reinforce Canada’s commitment to environmental stewardship under the Fisheries Act.
