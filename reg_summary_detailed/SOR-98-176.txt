The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of a specific regulation under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* (SOR), specifically:

- **SOR/2016-175, s. 5**  
- **SOR/2009-179, s. 7**

However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text—only annotations indicating that the regulation has been repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**Summary of the Regulatory Status:**

The listed entries indicate that the following provisions have been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) from the Ontario regulatory framework:

1. **Section 5 of SOR/2016-175**  
   - This section was repealed by the *Statutory Rules of Ontario* on April 14, 2016 (SOR/2016-175).  
   - The repeal was enacted under the authority of the *Regulations Amending the Ontario Regulation* (or similar enabling legislation), typically to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated provisions.  
   - The specific content of Section 5 of SOR/2016-175 is not provided in the text, but its repeal implies that the regulation it governed—likely related to a specific area such as licensing, environmental standards, or workplace safety—has been formally removed.

2. **Section 7 of SOR/2009-179**  
   - This section was repealed earlier, on April 14, 2009 (SOR/2009-179).  
   - This repeal likely stemmed from a legislative review or amendment that rendered the provision obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with current laws.  
   - Again, without the original text of Section 7, the exact subject matter cannot be determined, but it may have related to administrative procedures, reporting requirements, or compliance standards.

### Key Observations:

- **Multiple repetitions** of the same repeal notices (especially SOR/2016-175, s. 5) suggest either a typographical error, a formatting issue, or a misrepresentation of the original document. It is possible that the original regulation was cited multiple times in a list or database, leading to redundant entries.
- The **repeal of both sections** indicates that the regulatory framework has undergone significant revision or consolidation, possibly to eliminate overlapping or outdated rules.
- The **lack of substantive content** means that no details about the regulation’s purpose, scope, or operational requirements can be provided from this text alone.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not contain a detailed summary of a regulation**—instead, it only lists the **repeal of two specific sections** of Ontario statutory rules. As such, it serves as a **status update** rather than a regulatory summary.

> ✅ **Final Summary Statement**:  
> The listed entries indicate that Section 5 of SOR/2016-175 and Section 7 of SOR/2009-179 have been formally repealed. These provisions were removed from the Ontario regulatory framework, likely due to obsolescence or legislative modernization. However, no content or context of the original regulations is provided in the text, so a detailed summary of their substance, purpose, or application cannot be generated. The repeated references may reflect a data error or formatting issue.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, the full text of SOR/2016-175 (Section 5) and SOR/2009-179 (Section 7) would need to be accessed through the official Ontario government legislation database (e.g., the *Ontario Legislation Register* or *Legislation.gov.on.ca*).
