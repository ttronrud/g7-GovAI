**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Background**

This regulation, known as the **Milk Control Order, 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2)**, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. Its primary purpose is to **repeal the outdated Saskatchewan Milk Order (C.R.C., c. 278)** and replace it with a modern, more flexible framework that allows the **Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan (Commodity Board)** to regulate the **interprovincial and export marketing of milk** produced in Saskatchewan.

The repeal was formally enacted in **SOR/2001-16, s. 48**, meaning the original Saskatchewan Milk Order was officially removed from law in 2001.

---

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

The regulation introduces several key definitions to clarify scope and application:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Milk Control Act, 1992* of Saskatchewan. This is the foundational legislation that empowers the Commodity Board to manage milk marketing.
  
- **Commodity Board**: The *Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan*, established under the Milk Control Act. It is the body granted regulatory authority over milk marketing.

- **Milk**: Defined broadly as milk or cream from cows, produced for consumer use in **liquid form in Canada**. This excludes dairy products like cheese or butter, focusing strictly on raw milk and cream.

- **Plan**: A marketing plan established and amended over time under the Milk Control Act. This plan governs how milk is marketed, priced, and distributed within Saskatchewan.

---

### **Scope of Application**

The Order applies to:

- **Milk produced in the Province of Saskatchewan**, and  
- **Milk referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b)** that is produced in the **Provinces of Alberta and Manitoba**.

> Note: The inclusion of Alberta and Manitoba milk is limited to cases where such milk is being shipped to Saskatchewan and falls under specific provisions.

### **Regulatory Authority Granted to the Commodity Board**

Under subsection (2), the **Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan** is granted **authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade** — specifically, milk moving between provinces or exported outside Canada — **with certain exceptions**.

#### **Powers Granted**:
The Board may exercise **all or any powers** it currently holds over **local marketing of milk within Saskatchewan**, including the following:

1. **Regulatory Oversight**:
   - Over **persons and property located within Saskatchewan**.
   - Over **milk produced in Saskatchewan** that is being marketed **outside the province** (i.e., in Alberta, Manitoba, or internationally).

2. **Exclusions**:
   - **Excluded from regulation**:
     - Milk produced in Saskatchewan and marketed in **Alberta or Manitoba** under **milk quotas** granted by:
       - The **Alberta Milk Control Board** (under the Alberta Milk Order), or  
       - The **Manitoba Milk Producers** (under the Manitoba Milk Order).
     - Milk shipped **from Alberta or Manitoba to Saskatchewan** by persons who:
       - Have **not been granted a milk quota** under this Order.

> In essence, the Board does **not** regulate milk that is being traded under existing provincial quotas established by Alberta or Manitoba.

3. **Exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC) Powers**:
   - The authority granted to the Commodity Board **does not include** any powers exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in relation to interprovincial milk marketing.
   - This means the CDC retains its own regulatory and market functions, and the Saskatchewan Board operates independently in this area.

### **Levies and Charges on Milk**

The Commodity Board has the power to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on:
  - Milk or any component of milk (e.g., cream, fat, protein).
  - Persons engaged in **production or marketing** of milk, as defined in subsection 3(1) of the Act.

- **Classify producers into groups** and impose **different levies or charges** based on group type (e.g., small farms vs. large dairies).

- **Collect** these levies and charges from eligible producers.

---

### **Use of Levies and Charges**

Funds collected from levies and charges may be used for:

1. **Creation of reserves** (financial buffers).
2. **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of milk.
3. **Equalization or adjustment** among milk producers:
   - To ensure fair distribution of revenue from milk sales.
   - To compensate producers who may have experienced lower returns due to market fluctuations.
   - Adjustments may occur over **specific periods or timeframes** as determined by the Board.

> This mechanism supports **market stability**, **producer equity**, and **financial resilience** in the face of volatile milk prices.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Modernization** | Replaces outdated rules with a more transparent and adaptable framework for interprovincial milk trade. |
| **Provincial Autonomy** | Grants Saskatchewan greater control over its milk marketing, especially in export and cross-border trade. |
| **Fairness and Equity** | Enables equalization of income among producers through financial adjustments. |
| **Market Stability** | Helps buffer producers against price volatility via reserves and levy systems. |
| **Clear Exclusions** | Respects existing provincial milk quota systems in Alberta and Manitoba, avoiding duplication or conflict. |

---

### **Legal and Practical Significance**

- This Order reflects a shift from rigid, province-specific controls to a **more cooperative and market-responsive model** of milk marketing.
- It strengthens the role of the **Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan** as a central body managing both **domestic and interprovincial** milk flows.
- However, it **does not override** federal or other provincial regulatory frameworks — especially the CDC’s role in national dairy policy.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively **replaces the old Saskatchewan Milk Order** with a modern, targeted, and equitable system allowing the **Milk Control Board of Saskatchewan** to regulate the **interprovincial and export marketing of milk**. It provides the Board with significant powers to:

- Set and collect levies,
- Regulate marketing activities,
- Ensure fair returns to producers,
- Maintain financial stability.

Crucially, it **excludes** milk traded under existing Alberta or Manitoba quotas and **respects the jurisdiction** of the Canadian Dairy Commission, ensuring a balanced and cooperative national dairy market structure.

This Order represents a key step in aligning Saskatchewan’s milk marketing policies with evolving market realities and interprovincial cooperation.
