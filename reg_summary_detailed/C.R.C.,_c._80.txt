**Detailed Summary of the Chilliwack Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **Chilliwack Airport Zoning Regulations**.
- It may be cited as such and governs land use and development in specific areas adjacent to and beneath the approach and transitional surfaces of Chilliwack Airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to *Chilliwack Airport*, located within the Township of Chilliwack, Province of British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 27 feet above sea level** for regulatory purposes. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), at right angles to the runway centerline. It ensures a safe approach path for aircraft. Described in **Part II of the Schedule**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing zone, including the runway, designated for take-off and landing in a particular direction. Defined in **Part III of the Schedule**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. It provides a buffer zone beyond the strip to prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft operations. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**. |

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to:
  - All **land and underwater areas** (including public road allowances) located **vertically beneath** the **approach surfaces** and **transitional surfaces** of the airport.
  - Areas adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are **formally part of the airport** (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated airport property) are **not subject** to these regulations.

---

### **4. Prohibited Development (Section 5)**
- **No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on land covered by these regulations **if**:
  - The **highest point** of that structure or object would **exceed** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
    - The **approach surfaces**;
    - The **transitional surfaces**.
- This means that any man-made structure (e.g., buildings, towers, antennas, trees, signs) must remain **below or at the level** of these defined imaginary planes.

> **Example**: A building with a roof 100 feet above ground cannot be built if it would rise above the approach or transitional surface at any point along its footprint.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceeding Surface Elevation**
- If **natural features** (e.g., trees, shrubs, hills) grow on regulated land and **exceed** the elevation of the approach or transitional surfaces:
  - The **Minister of Transport** (Minister) has the authority to issue a **direction** (formal directive) requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision ensures that even natural features do not create safety hazards during aircraft approach or departure.

> **Note**: The regulation was **revoked** by *SOR/81-169, section 1*, but the summary provided appears to be based on a version prior to revocation. Therefore, this summary reflects the **historical content** of the regulation as it existed before revocation. **Current applicability may be limited or superseded**.

### **6. Specific Geometric Descriptions**

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **500 feet north** of a point on the centerline of **runway 07–25**.
- That point is **1,000 feet east** of the **westerly end** of runway 07–25.
- **Elevation**: Deemed to be **27 feet above sea level**.

---

#### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 07–25)**

Each end of the strip (for runways 07 and 25) has a separate approach surface:

- **Runway Approach 07**:
  - An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 foot vertically to 40 feet horizontally**.
  - Rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
    - 250 feet **above the elevation at the end of the strip**.
    - 10,000 feet **horizontally from the end of the strip**.
    - Outer ends of this line are **1,400 feet from the runway centerline**.

- **Runway Approach 25**:
  - Same slope and elevation profile as approach 07.
  - Identical dimensions: 1:40 slope, 250 ft above strip elevation, 10,000 ft horizontal distance, outer ends 1,400 ft from centerline.

> These surfaces are **illustrated in blue** on **Department of Transport Plan B.C. 1123**, dated **December 10, 1975**.

---

#### **Strip (Runway 07–25)**
- **Width**: 300 feet total (150 feet on each side of the centerline).
- **Length**: 4,400 feet.
- The strip is the **active area** for aircraft takeoff and landing.
- Shown in **green** on the same reference plan (B.C. 1123).

---

#### **Transitional Surface**
- An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally**.
- Extends **outward from the lateral edges** of the strip and its approach surfaces.
- Reaches an elevation of **150 feet above the airport reference point (ARP)**.
- This surface ensures that structures or features beyond the strip do not interfere with aircraft during approach or departure.
- Shown in **red** on the same reference plan (B.C. 1123).

---

### **7. Purpose and Safety Rationale**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear flight paths for aircraft during approach and departure.
- To **prevent obstructions** (both man-made and natural) from interfering with aircraft operations.
- To define **clear, measurable boundaries** (via approach and transitional surfaces) that restrict development near the airport.

These surfaces are designed based on **aviation safety standards**, including:
- Aircraft visibility and obstacle clearance requirements.
- Minimum safe distances from runways and approach paths.
- Protection of critical flight corridors.

---

### **8. Legal Authority and Enforcement**
- The **Minister of Transport** is the **primary enforcement authority**.
- The Minister may issue **directions** to remove excessive natural growth.
- Violations of the restrictions (e.g., building above approach or transitional surfaces) may result in legal action or administrative penalties, though specific penalties are not detailed in the provided text.

---

### **9. Status and Current Relevance**
- The regulation was **revoked by SOR/81-169, section 1**.
- This means the **Chilliwack Airport Zoning Regulations as presented are no longer in force**.
- The revocation suggests that the regulation has been **replaced, amended, or superseded** by more modern or comprehensive aviation safety or land-use regulations.
- As such, **this summary reflects historical content** and should not be interpreted as current law.

> **Recommendation**: For current zoning or aviation safety requirements at Chilliwack Airport, one should consult:
> - The **current BC Aviation Safety Regulations** (e.g., under the *Aviation Act*),
> - The **BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure**,
> - Or the **most recent airport master plan** or zoning bylaws.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Chilliwack Airport Zoning Regulations** were a set of detailed, geographically specific rules designed to **protect aircraft approach and departure paths** by restricting construction and natural growth near the airport. They defined key surfaces (approach and transitional) with precise geometric parameters and established clear responsibilities for landowners and the Minister of Transport.

However, **the regulation has been formally revoked**, and thus is **no longer applicable**. Its historical significance lies in illustrating how early aviation safety zones were established through technical and spatial planning.

---

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:
*The Chilliwack Airport Zoning Regulations (now revoked) established strict limits on construction and natural growth near the airport to ensure aviation safety by defining approach and transitional surfaces with precise geometric parameters, all based on a fixed airport reference point and referenced in a 1975 Department of Transport plan.*
