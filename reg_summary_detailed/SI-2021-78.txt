**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2019-1366 and Designation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as Minister for the Purposes of the Shared Services Canada Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to section 3 of the *Shared Services Canada Act* (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 711).

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2019-1366 (November 20, 2019):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2019-1366, which was issued on November 20, 2019. This prior order had likely established or modified certain administrative arrangements, responsibilities, or governance structures related to Shared Services Canada. By repealing it, the current regulation removes the legal effect of that earlier directive, effectively ending its applicability and any ongoing obligations or provisions it may have created.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as the Minister for the Purposes of the Shared Services Canada Act:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** as the designated Minister responsible for the administration and oversight of the Shared Services Canada Act. This designation is made under **section 711** of the *Shared Services Canada Act* (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 711), which provides the legal authority for the Governor General in Council to appoint a Minister to serve in this role.

   - This appointment is not a change in the minister’s official portfolio per se, but rather a formal designation for the purposes of the Act—specifically, to ensure that the Act’s operational and administrative functions are properly managed and directed by a designated Minister.
   - The Minister of Public Works and Government Services is thus empowered to exercise the responsibilities and authorities conferred under the Act, including oversight of Shared Services Canada’s operations, policy development, budgetary management, and intergovernmental coordination.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is grounded in **section 3 of the Shared Services Canada Act**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council to make orders and designations necessary for the effective implementation of the Act. Section 711 of the Act specifically enables the designation of a Minister to serve in a key administrative capacity.

**Purpose and Significance:**  
- This regulation streamlines governance by removing outdated or superseded administrative directives (P.C. 2019-1366) and aligning current leadership with the Act’s operational needs.
- It ensures clear accountability and continuity in the management of Shared Services Canada, a federal agency responsible for providing centralized, cost-effective services to other federal departments and agencies.
- By formally assigning the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to this role, the government clarifies the chain of responsibility for the agency’s performance, strategic direction, and compliance with federal mandates.

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such regulatory instruments typically come into force upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon the date of issuance. The effective date would generally be the date of publication in the Canada Gazette, Part I, or the date specified in the instrument itself.

**Implications:**  
- Departments and agencies relying on Shared Services Canada will now operate under the authority and direction of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services.
- The designation may influence interdepartmental coordination, budgetary approvals, and policy decisions related to shared services.
- It reflects a strategic realignment of ministerial responsibilities to ensure efficient delivery of public services through centralized administrative structures.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a formal update to the governance framework of Shared Services Canada. It removes an obsolete order and establishes a clear, designated Minister responsible for the agency’s administration under the *Shared Services Canada Act*. This enhances clarity, accountability, and operational efficiency in the delivery of shared services across the Canadian federal government.
