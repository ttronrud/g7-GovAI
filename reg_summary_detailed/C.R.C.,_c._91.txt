**Detailed Summary of the Langley Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled:  
**"Langley Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development near Langley Airport in the Province of British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**:  
  Refers specifically to **Langley Airport**, located within the **Township of Langley, British Columbia**.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A precise geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements.  
  - *Location*: 100 feet (measured northwesterly) from and at right angles to the centerline of **Runway 01–19**, starting at a point 264.79 feet southwesterly along that centerline from the **northeasterly end** of the runway.  
  - *Elevation*: For regulatory purposes, the ARP is **deemed to be 27 feet above sea level**.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), perpendicular to its centerline.  
  - It is defined in **Part III of the Schedule** and is designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by maintaining a clear zone above the runway ends.

- **Strip**:  
  The **rectangular landing area** of the airport, including runways, designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An **imaginary surface** located above and surrounding the airport, extending beyond the strip and approach surfaces.  
  - Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**; it establishes a broader buffer zone to protect aircraft operations from obstructions.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from the **lateral edges** of the strip and its approach surfaces.  
  - Defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**; it provides a gradual transition between the runway and the outer surface.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) that are:
  - Adjacent to or in the **vicinity of Langley Airport**,
  - Within the **outer limits** described in **Part II of the Schedule**,
  - **Excluding** lands that are officially part of the airport itself (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated airport facilities).

> In essence, the regulations cover a defined perimeter around the airport, ensuring that development does not interfere with aviation safety.

---

### **4. Prohibited Development**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the point of location:

- The **approach surface**  
- The **outer surface**  
- The **transitional surface**

> This means that **all structures, including towers, antennas, trees, or even rooftop features**, must remain **below the elevation of these imaginary surfaces** at their exact location.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceeding Regulatory Limits**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the height of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** (formal directive) to the **landowner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that even natural features do not create hazards during aircraft approaches or landings.

> ⚠️ *Note: This section was previously repealed by SOR/81-174, section 1 — however, the current version appears to retain it, possibly indicating a correction or reinstatement. This should be verified with official legal sources.*

### **6. Geographical Boundary (Part II of Schedule)**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a **detailed, legally precise boundary description** in **Part II of the Schedule**, using a sequence of legal land descriptions involving:

- Lot numbers and district plans (e.g., Plan 1749, Plan 45918, etc.)
- Directions (e.g., "northerly", "easterly")
- Distances (e.g., "100 feet", "264.79 feet")
- Reference to highways, roads, and key landmarks (e.g., Highway #10 bypass, Fraser Highway, 64th Avenue, 200th Street, Jericho Road)

This boundary encompasses:
- Residential areas
- Open spaces
- Road corridors
- Rural lands adjacent to the airport

It effectively creates a **regulated zone** around the airport that spans across multiple lots and sections within the Township of Langley.

---

### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of the Langley Airport Zoning Regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**: To prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach.
2. **Consistent Aviation Standards**: To align with international and national aviation safety guidelines (such as those from the Canadian Aviation Regulations).
3. **Environmental and Development Control**: To limit construction and natural growth near the airport to maintain a safe and predictable airspace environment.
4. **Public and Private Land Protection**: To apply uniformly across both public and private land within the defined zone.

---

### **8. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** is the authority responsible for:
  - Issuing directions regarding excessive natural growth.
  - Enforcing compliance with the height restrictions.
- Violations of the regulations may result in legal action, fines, or mandatory removal of structures or vegetation.

---

### **9. Key Implications for Landowners and Developers**

- **No new construction** (buildings, towers, signs, etc.) may exceed the height limits defined by the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.
- **Existing structures** must be assessed to ensure compliance — if they exceed the limits, they may require modification or removal.
- **Tree pruning or removal** may be required if trees grow beyond the defined surfaces.
- **Development proposals** (e.g., homes, commercial buildings, solar panels) must undergo a pre-approval process to confirm compliance with the height and spatial restrictions.

### **10. Summary Table**

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Applicable Area** | All lands adjacent to or near Langley Airport, within the boundary defined in Part II of the Schedule |
| **Key Surfaces** | Approach surface, outer surface, transitional surface |
| **Height Limit** | No structure or natural growth may exceed the elevation of any of these surfaces at the point of location |
| **Reference Point** | 100 ft NW from runway 01–19, at 27 ft above sea level |
| **Enforcement** | Minister of Transport may issue directions for removal of excessive growth |
| **Exemptions** | Lands that are officially part of the airport are excluded |

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Langley Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive framework to ensure **aviation safety** by strictly controlling the **height and placement of structures and natural features** within a defined perimeter of the airport. By defining precise imaginary surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the regulations create a clear and enforceable boundary that protects flight operations from physical obstructions.

These rules are essential for maintaining safe air traffic, especially in a region like Langley, where the airport serves both general aviation and commercial flights. The detailed boundary description ensures that the zone is both legally precise and practically applicable across diverse land types and ownership.

> **Note**: Given the complexity and legal nature of zoning regulations, any proposed development or land use change in this zone must be reviewed by the relevant authorities (e.g., the Ministry of Transportation, local planning department) prior to commencement.
