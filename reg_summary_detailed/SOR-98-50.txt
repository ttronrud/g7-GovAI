**Detailed Summary of the Diversion of Imported Goods Exemption Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Diversion of Imported Goods Exemption Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **subsection 32.2(7)a of the Customs Act**. This provision grants the Minister the authority to make regulations that address specific exemptions related to the temporary diversion or consumption of imported goods during emergencies.

The regulation is formally published under:
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36, s. 152** (Statutory Code of 1997, Chapter 36, Section 152)
- **R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)** (Revised Statutes, Chapter 1, Second Supplement)

---

**Key Definitions:**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Customs Act*, which is the primary legislation governing customs duties, importation, and the movement of goods across borders in Canada.

2. **"Emergency"**  
   Defined broadly to include:
   - A **medical emergency**
   - A **fire**
   - A **flood**
   - **Any disaster** that threatens **life, property, or the environment**

   This definition ensures that the exemption applies to situations where immediate action is required to prevent harm or protect public safety.

**Core Provision – Exemption from Customs Requirements:**

The regulation establishes a legal exemption for **imported goods** that are **temporarily diverted** or **consumed** in response to an emergency. Specifically:

1. **Temporary Diversion of Goods:**  
   If imported goods are **temporarily redirected** to a use other than the one for which they were originally released (e.g., from commercial use to emergency relief), they are **exempt from the application of subsection 32.2(6) of the Customs Act** during the period they are used in response to the emergency.

   - This exemption allows for flexibility in the use of goods during urgent situations without triggering customs compliance obligations such as duty payments or formal declarations.
   - The exemption is **temporary** and only applies for the duration of the emergency response.

2. **Consumption of Goods in Response to Emergency:**  
   If imported goods are **consumed** (e.g., used up or destroyed) as part of an emergency response (such as medical supplies used in a hospital during a pandemic or food distributed during a flood), they are also **exempt from subsection 32.2(6)** of the Customs Act.

   - This provision removes the need to pay duties or meet regulatory requirements when goods are used up in an emergency context.

---

**Purpose and Rationale:**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:
- Enable **rapid and effective response** to emergencies by allowing authorities to use imported goods flexibly.
- Prevent **delays or administrative burdens** that could arise from customs procedures during urgent situations.
- Protect **public safety, health, and environmental integrity** by facilitating timely access to essential supplies.

This exemption supports emergency management, public health responses, disaster relief efforts, and other critical operations where strict adherence to customs rules could compromise outcomes.

---

**Repeal Clause:**

The regulation includes a **repeal clause** indicating that these rules are **no longer in force** as of a specific date. However, the text states:

> "These Regulations come into force on January 1, 1998."

This means:
- The regulations were **enacted and came into effect on January 1, 1998**.
- They were **repealed (replaced or cancelled)** after that date, suggesting that the exemption was superseded by subsequent legislation or policy.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** The inclusion of a "Repeal" clause implies that these regulations are **no longer valid or in effect** as of the date after January 1, 1998. Therefore, while they may have provided a legal basis for emergency exemptions in the early 1990s, they are **not currently applicable** under current Canadian customs law.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Diversion of Imported Goods Exemption Regulations* (1997) provided a temporary legal mechanism allowing imported goods to be used or consumed during emergencies without being subject to customs duties or compliance under subsection 32.2(6) of the *Customs Act*. The exemption covered both temporary diversion and consumption in response to medical, fire, flood, or other emergencies threatening life, property, or the environment.

However, these regulations were **repealed and ceased to apply on or after January 1, 1998**. As such, they are **historical** in nature and **no longer in force**. Current emergency exemptions are likely governed by other, more recent provisions in the *Customs Act* or by administrative directives issued by the Minister of National Revenue under different statutory authorities.

---

**Recommendation for Practitioners:**

When dealing with emergency responses involving imported goods today, legal and customs professionals should refer to **current versions of the Customs Act** and **modern emergency response policies** issued by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) or the Department of Emergency Management and Climate Change, rather than relying on this 1997 regulation.

**Final Status:**  
❌ **Outdated and Repealed** – Not applicable under current Canadian law.  
✅ **Historical significance** – Demonstrates the evolution of emergency provisions in Canadian customs policy.
