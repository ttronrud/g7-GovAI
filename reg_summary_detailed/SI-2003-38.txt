The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-26, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2008-26 (SI/2008-26), specifically **Section 5** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around the date the Statutory Instrument was made and came into force, which is typically in 2008 (as indicated by the year in the SI number).
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 5 of SI 2008-26 explicitly removes or cancels the previously existing regulation. This means the legal provisions previously contained in that regulation are no longer valid, enforceable, or applicable under current law.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or rights derived from the repealed regulation are now obsolete. Legal entities, individuals, or authorities must refer to current legislation for compliance or guidance, as the repealed regulation no longer governs the subject matter.

### Contextual Notes:
- The repetition of the same line five times suggests a possible formatting or data entry error. In official legal databases, such redundancy is not standard and may reflect a technical glitch rather than intentional repetition.
- Statutory Instruments (SIs) are a form of secondary legislation in jurisdictions like Canada, the United Kingdom, or other common law systems. In this case, the repeal is likely part of a legislative update or consolidation effort to modernize or streamline regulations.
- Without additional context (e.g., the original regulation’s title or subject matter), it is not possible to determine exactly what was repealed. However, the fact that it was repealed by SI 2008-26, s. 5 implies it was likely a minor or outdated rule in a broader regulatory framework.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2008-26**. It is no longer in force and should not be relied upon for legal or administrative purposes. Legal practitioners, regulators, or the public should consult current legislation for applicable rules. The repeated entries in the original text are likely a data error and do not affect the substantive legal conclusion.
