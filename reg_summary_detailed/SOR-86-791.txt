**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Compensation Place of Employment Regulations**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The *Government Employees Compensation Place of Employment Regulations* were approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour. This approval is grounded in **Section 10 of the Government Employees Compensation Act**, which empowers the Minister of Labour to make regulations necessary for the effective administration and interpretation of the Act.

**2. Title and Citation:**
The regulations are formally titled the *Government Employees Compensation Place of Employment Regulations* and may be cited as such. This title reflects the core purpose of the regulation: to define and establish the criteria for determining the "place where a government employee is usually employed."

**3. Core Definition:**
The central provision of the regulation establishes that, **for the purposes of the Government Employees Compensation Act**, the *place where an employee is usually employed* is defined as **the place where the employee is appointed or engaged to work**.

This definition is both straightforward and foundational. It establishes a clear, objective criterion for determining the primary workplace of a government employee—specifically, the location designated at the time of employment appointment or engagement.

**4. Purpose and Significance:**
This definition is critical for several key aspects of the compensation framework:
- **Determining Compensation Liability:** In cases of workplace injury or illness, the place of employment directly influences which insurer or compensation fund is responsible for providing benefits. The regulation ensures that compensation claims are appropriately linked to the employee’s official place of work.
- **Establishing Jurisdiction and Coverage:** The regulation helps clarify jurisdictional boundaries for claims processing, ensuring that employees receive benefits from the correct compensation authority based on where they were formally assigned.
- **Avoiding Ambiguity:** By defining "usual place of employment" as the location of appointment or engagement, the regulation eliminates ambiguity that might arise from interpreting "usual" or "primary" work location based on actual work patterns or temporary assignments.

**5. Scope and Applicability:**
The regulation applies to all government employees covered under the *Government Employees Compensation Act*. This includes employees in federal, provincial, or territorial public service organizations, depending on the jurisdiction of the Act. The definition is not limited to permanent or full-time positions but extends to all employees who are formally appointed or engaged in government service.

**6. Interpretation and Practical Application:**
- The term "appointed or engaged to work" implies a formal employment arrangement, such as a contract, appointment letter, or official assignment.
- It does not require the employee to be physically present at the location at all times; rather, it refers to the official designation of the workplace at the time of hiring or assignment.
- The regulation does not address temporary or rotational work unless such assignments are part of the original appointment or engagement.

**7. Regulatory Impact:**
By providing a clear and legally binding definition, these regulations enhance consistency, fairness, and administrative efficiency in the compensation system. They reduce disputes over where an employee’s work is considered to occur and ensure that compensation claims are processed in a transparent and predictable manner.

**Conclusion:**
The *Government Employees Compensation Place of Employment Regulations* serve as a critical interpretive tool under the Government Employees Compensation Act. By defining the "place where an employee is usually employed" as the location of their formal appointment or engagement, the regulations provide clarity, legal certainty, and administrative coherence in determining compensation responsibilities. This ensures that government employees receive appropriate benefits based on their official employment location, thereby supporting a fair and effective compensation framework.
