**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Withdrawal of Certain Lands (South Nahanni River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order, 1971*

---

### **Purpose and Legal Context**
This regulation, formally titled the *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (South Nahanni River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order, 1971*, is a statutory instrument issued under the *Territorial Lands Act* (TLA) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Its primary objective is to **permanently withdraw a specific parcel of land along the South Nahanni River from all forms of disposal or commercial development**, including mining, drilling, or land sales, in order to **protect and prepare the area for future development as a national park**.

The withdrawal is not a creation of a national park per se, but rather a **preliminary step** to reserve the land for that purpose by removing it from the government’s available land pool for private or corporate use.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Withdrawal from Disposal**
The lands described in the schedule are **withdrawn from disposal** under the *Territorial Lands Act*. This means:
- The federal government will **not sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of** these lands for commercial purposes.
- The withdrawal applies to **all surface and subsurface rights**, including:
  - **Minerals** (precious, base, solid, liquid, or gaseous)
  - Any other natural resources beneath the land

> This provision ensures that no future mining or oil and gas exploration can proceed on the withdrawn lands, regardless of economic interest.

#### 2. **Preservation of Existing Rights**
Despite the withdrawal, the regulation **does not extinguish or override** the rights of:
- **Holders of recorded mineral claims** in good standing under the *Canada Mining Regulations*
- **Permit holders or leaseholders** in good standing under the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*

This means:
- Existing mineral claimants and oil/gas permit holders **retain their legal rights** to explore, extract, or develop minerals or hydrocarbons **on their claims or leases**.
- These rights are **protected and preserved**, even though the land as a whole is now off-limits to general disposal.

> This is a critical balance between conservation and recognizing the rights of existing resource users under Canadian land laws.

#### 3. **Designation and Appropriation**
The lands are **formally set apart and appropriated** for the **future development as a national park**. This implies:
- The area is now **legally designated** for conservation and public use.
- It will be managed under the *National Parks Act* or related environmental legislation in the future.
- The government intends to establish a protected area with goals such as biodiversity conservation, scientific research, recreation, and cultural preservation.

### **Area and Size**
- The total area of the parcel is approximately **870 square miles** (about 2,250 square kilometers).
- This vast expanse includes **mountainous terrain, river valleys, and high-elevation peaks**, indicating a diverse and ecologically significant landscape.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Conservation Priority**  
   The South Nahanni River area is a remote, ecologically rich region with high biodiversity. This withdrawal signals a commitment to **protecting natural landscapes** and preserving them for future generations.

2. **National Park Development**  
   The land is being laid out as a foundation for a **national park**, which would likely involve:
   - Protection of wildlife habitats
   - Preservation of pristine water systems (especially the South Nahanni River)
   - Opportunities for scientific research and environmental education
   - Limited public access for recreation and tourism

3. **Legal Precedent**  
   This order sets a precedent for how federal land can be **conserved without disrupting existing mineral rights**, balancing environmental protection with legal accountability to stakeholders.

4. **Cultural and Indigenous Considerations (Implied)**  
   While not explicitly stated in this regulation, the area may contain or pass near Indigenous territories. Future national park development would likely require consultation with Indigenous peoples, although that is not covered in this specific order.

### **Citation and Enforcement**
- The regulation may be cited as:  
  *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (South Nahanni River N.W.T.) from Disposal Order, 1971*  
- It is enforceable under the *Territorial Lands Act* and related federal land and resource management laws.

### **Conclusion**

This 1971 Order represents a foundational step in the **conservation of one of Canada’s most remote and ecologically significant wilderness areas**. By formally withdrawing over 870 square miles of land along the South Nahanni River from disposal and mineral development, the Canadian government has committed to preserving the region for future national park status. Crucially, it does so while **respecting existing mineral rights** under federal regulations, ensuring a balanced and legally sound approach to land use and environmental protection.

This regulation is a key piece of legislation in Canada’s broader effort to protect its natural heritage through strategic land designation and sustainable
