**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Turkey Order**

---

### **Overview**
The *Ontario Turkey Order* is a regulatory instrument established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (the "Act"). It governs the marketing of turkeys—both within Ontario and in interprovincial and export markets—and provides specific powers to the *Ontario Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board* (the "Commodity Board") and the *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (the "Board") to regulate such activities. This Order may be cited as the *Ontario Turkey Order*.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi), which provides the legal framework for the regulation of farm product marketing, including turkeys.
  
- **Board**: The *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*, established under the Act. It has broad regulatory authority over the marketing of farm products, including turkeys, both locally and in interprovincial/export markets.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Ontario Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board*, a specialized body created under the Act to oversee the marketing of turkeys specifically. It is responsible for managing the economic and market-related aspects of turkey production and trade.

- **Turkey**: Defined broadly as a turkey or any class or part thereof that is produced or grown in the Province of Ontario. This includes live birds, parts (e.g., meat, organs), and any derivative products originating in Ontario.

### **Regulatory Authority and Powers**

#### 1. **Shared Regulatory Powers**
Both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are authorized to regulate the marketing of turkeys in:
- Interprovincial trade (sales between provinces),
- Export trade (sales outside of Canada).

For these purposes, they may issue orders that apply to persons and property located within Ontario. These orders grant them **powers equivalent** to those they hold in regulating turkey marketing *within* the province under **section 15A of the Act**. This means they can impose rules, restrictions, or requirements on turkey marketing activities outside of Ontario, just as they can within it.

#### 2. **Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted specific, targeted powers related to the **collection of levies or charges** in the context of interprovincial and export trade. These powers are detailed as follows:

- **Authority to Impose Levies or Charges**:
  - The Commodity Board may make orders to **fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in:
    - The **production** of turkeys,
    - The **marketing** of turkeys,
    within Ontario.

- **Classification of Producers**:
  - The Board may **classify producers into different groups** based on factors such as scale of operation, type of production, or other relevant criteria.
  - Each group may be assigned a **different levy or charge**, allowing for differentiated financial obligations depending on the producer’s role or capacity.

- **Use of Levies and Charges**:
  The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for several key purposes:
  - **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial cushioning for future market downturns),
  - **Payment of expenses and losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of turkeys (e.g., due to market fluctuations or unsold inventory),
  - **Equalization or adjustment of income** among turkey producers.
    - This ensures that producers who benefit from high sales prices during certain periods can contribute to a pool that supports others who may have experienced lower returns (e.g., during poor market conditions or low demand).

- **Time Periods of Application**:
  The Commodity Board may determine **specific time periods** (e.g., annual, seasonal, or multi-year cycles) during which levies or adjustments apply. This allows flexibility in responding to market volatility.

### **Important Note: Revocation**
A prior provision in this Order—specifically, the section granting the Commodity Board authority under section 3 of the Act—has been **revoked** by **SOR/80-90** (Statutory Order 80-90). This indicates that the earlier version of the Commodity Board’s powers under section 3 has been formally removed or superseded. However, the current Order retains the **revised authority** to impose levies and charges, which is now the basis for the Board’s financial management functions.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Ontario Turkey Order are:
- To ensure **stable and fair marketing conditions** for turkey producers in Ontario.
- To provide **financial stability** through the creation of reserves and loss-sharing mechanisms.
- To **equalize returns** among producers, reducing economic disparities caused by market fluctuations.
- To support **long-term planning** and risk management in the turkey industry.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Producer Accountability**: Producers are required to pay levies based on their classification, promoting transparency and fairness.
- **Market Stability**: By collecting and managing funds, the Commodity Board helps buffer producers against market shocks.
- **Economic Equity**: The equalization mechanism helps protect smaller or less-resourced producers from being disproportionately affected by market downturns.
- **Interprovincial and Export Oversight**: The Order enables Ontario to maintain control over how its turkeys are marketed beyond provincial borders, protecting local interests.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Turkey Order* establishes a structured and equitable system for managing the marketing of turkeys in Ontario. By empowering the Ontario Turkey Producers’ Marketing Board to impose and collect levies based on producer classification, and to use those funds for reserves, loss coverage, and income equalization, the Order promotes economic stability and fairness across the turkey sector. While a prior version of the authority has been revoked, the current framework provides a robust and flexible mechanism for managing the financial and market risks associated with turkey production and trade.

This regulation is a critical tool in supporting Ontario’s agricultural economy, particularly in ensuring that producers are protected from volatile market conditions.
