**Detailed Summary of the Indian Affairs and Northern Development Aboriginal Peoples Employment Equity Program Appointments Regulations**

**Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**  
These regulations were issued by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** of Canada on **July 10, 1997**, under **paragraph 35(2)(d)a of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision grants the PSC the authority to create regulations that govern appointments to public service positions, particularly in relation to employment equity programs for Aboriginal peoples.

The regulations are specifically designed to support and implement the **Aboriginal Peoples Employment Equity Program** within the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**. The program was formally agreed upon by the PSC on **May 1, 1995**, and reaffirmed on **March 5, 1997**, at the request of the Deputy Head of DIAND. The regulations operationalize this agreement in accordance with **section 5.1 of the Public Service Employment Act**.

### Key Definitions

1. **Aboriginal Peoples**  
   - Defined in the same way as in **Section 3 of the Employment Equity Act (EEA)**.  
   - This includes **First Nations, Métis, and Inuit** peoples in Canada.  
   - The definition is consistent with federal policy and legal frameworks that recognize Aboriginal peoples as distinct and historically marginalized groups in employment.

2. **Employment Equity Program**  
   - Refers to a formal, government-led initiative to **enhance the recruitment and hiring of Aboriginal peoples** into positions within DIAND.  
   - The program is specifically tailored to address historical underrepresentation and systemic barriers faced by Aboriginal communities in federal employment.  
   - It is **agreed upon and authorized** by the Public Service Commission and implemented under the mandate of **section 5.1 of the PSEA**, which supports equity in employment practices.

### Core Provisions and Exclusions

#### 1. **Exclusion from Standard Appointment Rules**  
Under **subsection (1)**, appointments of Aboriginal peoples to positions in DIAND under the Employment Equity Program are **excluded** from the operation of the following provisions of the Public Service Employment Act:

- **Subsection 29(3)** – Relating to appointment priority for certain categories (e.g., persons with disabilities, veterans, etc.).
- **Subsection 30(1) and (2)** – Governing appointment priorities for specific groups (e.g., women, persons with disabilities).
- **Subsection 39(3) and (4)** – Concerning the application of appointment priorities and the process for determining eligibility for appointments.

This means that when an Aboriginal person is appointed to a position under this employment equity program, the standard appointment priority rules (which apply to other groups) **do not apply** to them. The program is designed to **prioritize Aboriginal recruitment**, regardless of whether they meet the criteria for other appointment priorities.

#### 2. **Exception for Individuals with Priority Entitlements**  
The exclusion in subsection (1) **does not apply** to Aboriginal peoples who already hold **appointment priority entitlements** under:

- Subsections 29(3), 30(1), (2), and 39(3), (4) of the PSEA,  
- And any regulations made under **paragraph 35(2)(a)** of the PSEA.

In other words, if an Aboriginal person has a **pre-existing entitlement** (e.g., due to being a woman, a veteran, or someone with a disability), they are **not excluded** from the standard appointment rules. Their eligibility is not overridden by the employment equity program. This ensures that individuals with overlapping entitlements are still treated fairly under the broader public service appointment framework.

### Purpose and Intent

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Promote equity and inclusion** in federal employment by actively recruiting Aboriginal peoples into DIAND.
- **Address historical underrepresentation** of Aboriginal peoples in government service, particularly in a department with direct responsibility for Indigenous affairs.
- Provide a **clear, legally binding mechanism** for appointments to be made without being subject to standard priority rules that may otherwise disadvantage Aboriginal candidates.
- Ensure that the **employment equity program operates independently** and with a focus on targeted recruitment, rather than being subsumed into general appointment processes.

### Effective Date

The regulations **come into force on July 16, 1997** — just six days after their publication. This rapid implementation reflects the urgency and importance of establishing a formal employment equity framework within DIAND.

---

### Significance and Impact

- **Policy Innovation**: These regulations represent one of the first formal, legally grounded employment equity initiatives within a federal department, specifically tailored to Indigenous communities.
- **Equity Focus**: By removing the standard priority rules, the regulations ensure that Aboriginal applicants are not disadvantaged by competition with other priority groups.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: The requirement that the program be implemented under section 5.1 of the PSEA ensures that it remains within the framework of public service accountability and transparency.
- **Foundation for Future Programs**: This regulation laid the groundwork for subsequent employment equity initiatives in other federal departments and served as a model for similar programs across the public service.

### Conclusion

The *Indian Affairs and Northern Development Aboriginal Peoples Employment Equity Program Appointments Regulations* are a significant step toward achieving employment equity for Aboriginal peoples in the Canadian public service. By legally exempting appointments under the employment equity program from standard appointment priority rules—while preserving the rights of those with overlapping entitlements—the regulations promote targeted, equitable access to federal employment opportunities in a department with deep cultural and historical ties to Indigenous communities.

These regulations not only fulfill a statutory obligation under the Public Service Employment Act but also reflect a commitment to reconciliation, inclusion, and the recognition of Aboriginal peoples’ rights to meaningful participation in government institutions.
