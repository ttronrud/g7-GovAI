**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations Adapting the Employment Equity Act in Respect of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service"**  
*(S.C. 1995, c. 44)*

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The regulation was enacted to **adapt the *Employment Equity Act* (EEA)** to better accommodate the **Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**, taking into account the **unique operational requirements and sensitivity of national security information** associated with CSIS’s functions.

The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Labour, and in consultation with the Solicitor General of Canada (as required under subsection 41(6) of the EEA), issued these regulations under subsection 41(5) of the EEA. The primary objective is to ensure that the enforcement mechanisms of the Employment Equity Act — particularly those involving compliance audits and tribunal proceedings — do not compromise the **integrity, confidentiality, or operational effectiveness** of CSIS.

This adaptation balances the need for **equal opportunity and employment equity enforcement** with the **strict need for protecting national security information**.

## **Key Provisions and Structural Changes**

### **1. New Definitions (Added after the Title of Part II)**

To clarify the scope and application of the regulations in relation to CSIS, the following definitions are introduced:

| Term | Meaning |

| **Commission staff** | Refers to compliance officers or other individuals acting on behalf of or under the direction of the Employment Equity Commission. Includes members of the Commission. |
| **Director** | Refers to the Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). |
| **National security information** | Information whose disclosure would be injurious to CSIS’s ability to perform its duties under the *Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act*. |

| **Special proceedings** | Tribunal proceedings involving CSIS and likely to involve national security information, under subsections 27(1) or 27(2) of the EEA. |
