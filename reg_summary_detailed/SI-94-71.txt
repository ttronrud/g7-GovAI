**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Indians and the War Lake First Nation Band on the Ilford Indian Settlement Remission Order***

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**
This regulation, known as the *Indians and the War Lake First Nation Band on the Ilford Indian Settlement Remission Order*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **subsection 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act**. The purpose is to provide **tax remission** for certain income taxes and goods and services taxes (GST) paid or payable by **Indians** and the **War Lake First Nation Band** in relation to the **Ilford Indian Settlement** in Manitoba.

The regulation is rooted in a determination that it is in the **public interest** to grant such remission, recognizing the historical and socio-economic context of the Ilford Indian Settlement — a non-reserve landholding — and the disproportionate tax burden it places on Indigenous individuals and the Band.

### **Scope of the Remission**

The Order provides **two distinct types of tax remission**:

---

#### **1. Income Tax Remission (Sections 4–5)**  
Applies to **Indians** who are taxpayers under the *Income Tax Act*.

- **Eligibility**:  
  An Indian who is liable for income tax (or interest/penalties) in the **1992 taxation year** or any subsequent year.

- **Remission Amount**:  
  The amount by which the taxes (including interest and penalties) actually paid or payable **exceed** the amount that would have been payable **if the Ilford Indian Settlement had been treated as a reserve** throughout the year.

> In other words, if the settlement were a reserve, certain tax exemptions or reduced rates would apply. The remission compensates for the **tax overpayment** due to the settlement not being classified as a reserve.

- **Tax Covered**:  
  Taxes under **Parts I, I.1, and I.2 of the Income Tax Act** (i.e., general income tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, etc.).

- **General Meaning of Terms**:  
  All other terms used in this section are defined as in the *Income Tax Act*, unless otherwise specified.

---

#### **2. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Remission (Sections 6–7)**  
Applies to both **individual Indians** and the **War Lake First Nation Band**.

- **Eligibility**:
  - **Individuals**: An Indian who receives a **taxable supply** (e.g., goods or services) **on or after the date the Order comes into force**.
  - **Band**: The War Lake First Nation Band, which receives a taxable supply **on or after January 1, 1992**.

- **Remission Amount**:  
  The amount by which the **GST paid or payable** exceeds the GST that would have been payable **if the Ilford Indian Settlement were a reserve**.

> This reflects the principle that reserves are generally exempt from GST, and thus, the non-reserve status of Ilford results in higher GST liability. The remission compensates for this differential.

- **Tax Covered**:  
  The **GST imposed under Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.

- **General Meaning of Terms**:  
  All other terms are defined as in **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, unless otherwise specified.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**

- **Application Requirement**:  
  Remission under **Sections 6 and 7** (GST and individual income tax) is **only granted upon submission of a written application** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.

- **Time Limit for Application**:  
  The application must be submitted **within four years** of the date the tax was paid.

> This creates a strict deadline for individuals or the Band to claim the remission — failure to apply within four years results in **loss of entitlement**.

---

### **Key Principles and Implications**

1. **Recognition of Non-Reserve Status**:  
   The Ilford Indian Settlement is **not a reserve**, which means it does not benefit from the tax exemptions and benefits typically granted to reserves under Canadian federal law. This regulation acknowledges the **disadvantage** of this status and provides **financial relief**.

2. **Equity and Fairness**:  
   The remission aims to correct a **tax imbalance** by treating the Ilford settlement as if it were a reserve for tax purposes — thereby reducing the tax burden on Indigenous individuals and the Band.

3. **Historical and Legal Context**:  
   This Order reflects a broader trend in Canadian policy to **recognize Indigenous land rights and economic realities**, especially in cases where non-reserve land holdings are subject to the same tax regime as non-Indigenous communities.

4. **Limited Scope**:  
   - Applies only to **taxes from 1992 onward**.  
   - Applies only to **specific individuals and the War Lake First Nation Band**.  
   - Does **not extend** to other settlements or Indigenous groups.

### **Legal and Practical Impact**

- **For Individuals**:  
  An Indian who paid more income tax or GST due to the non-reserve status of Ilford can now apply for a refund or remission of the excess amount — provided the application is submitted within four years.

- **For the War Lake First Nation Band**:  
  The Band can claim remission on GST paid on supplies received from or involving the Ilford Indian Settlement, recognizing the financial impact of the non-reserve status.

- **For the Government**:  
  The remission is a **fiscal adjustment** that aligns tax treatment with the status of the land. It also demonstrates a commitment to **Indigenous equity** and reconciliation.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, equitable measure designed to **correct the tax consequences** of the Ilford Indian Settlement not being designated as a reserve. By remitting the difference between taxes paid and those that would have been payable if the settlement were a reserve, it provides **financial relief** to individuals and the War Lake First Nation Band. The requirement for a written application within four years ensures accountability and administrative feasibility.

It stands as a significant example of how federal tax policy can be adapted to reflect the unique status and needs of Indigenous communities, particularly in cases involving non-reserve land holdings.

**Final Note**:  
This Order is a **temporary and specific** legislative intervention, not a broad policy change. It applies only to the Ilford Indian Settlement and individuals or entities directly connected to it. It underscores the importance of **contextual fairness** in tax law and the role of administrative discretion in promoting equitable outcomes.
