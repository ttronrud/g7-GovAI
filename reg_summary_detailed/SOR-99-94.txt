**Detailed Summary of the Tobacco (Seizure and Restoration) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

- These regulations are issued under **section 42 of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (Tobacco Act)**, as amended.
- The regulations were proposed on **June 3, 1998**, and were laid before the House of Commons in the form of an annexed document.
- The House of Commons did **not pass any committee report** on the proposed regulations within **thirty sitting days** of the laying of the proposal.
- As a result, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**, enacted the regulations pursuant to **section 42 of the Tobacco Act**, which allows for the promulgation of regulations when a committee report is not concurred in within the specified timeframe.

> This procedural step ensures that the regulations can proceed without delay, even in the absence of parliamentary committee approval, under the authority of the Act.

---

### **2. Applicable Act**

- In these regulations, the term **"Act"** refers to the **Tobacco and Vaping Products Act** (formerly known as the Tobacco Act).
- This establishes the legal foundation for the rules governing seizure and restoration of tobacco products.

---

### **3. Notification to the Owner or Person in Charge**

- Whenever a **health inspector seizes** a tobacco product or any other item under **subsection 39(1) of the Act**, the inspector is required to:
  - Provide a **copy of these regulations** and
  - Provide a **copy of section 40 of the Act**
  - To the **owner** of the product or to the **person in charge** of the place from which the item was seized.

> This ensures that the individual affected by the seizure is fully informed of their rights and the procedural framework available to them, including the right to apply for the restoration of the seized item.

---

### **4. Notice Requirements for Restoration Application**

- A **notice of intent to apply** for an order of restoration must be served by **registered mail** on the **Minister of Health**.
- The notice must be sent **at least 15 clear days** before the date on which the application is to be submitted to a provincial court judge.

> This 15-day window provides sufficient time for the Minister to review the application and ensures procedural fairness and transparency.

### **5. Contents of the Notice Required Under Section 40(1)**

The notice must contain the following specific information:

1. **Name of the Provincial Court Judge**  
   – The judge to whom the application for restoration will be made.

2. **Time and Place of Hearing**  
   – The exact time and location where the application will be heard in court.

3. **Description of the Seized Item**  
   – The specific tobacco product or other item that was seized.

4. **Evidence to Support the Claim**  
   – A clear statement of the **evidence** the applicant intends to present to prove that they are **entitled to possession** of the seized product or item.

> These requirements ensure that the restoration application is well-documented, transparent, and based on verifiable facts, promoting accountability and reducing the potential for arbitrary seizures.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the official Gazette (S.C. 1997, c. 13).

> This means that once the regulations are formally published and registered, they become legally binding and enforceable immediately.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Fairness and Due Process**: The regulations ensure that individuals who have had their property seized have a clear, structured, and timely process to challenge the seizure and reclaim their items.
- **Transparency**: By requiring the provision of regulations and the Act, and by mandating detailed notice, the rules promote openness and accountability in enforcement actions.
- **Procedural Safeguards**: The 15-day notice period and the requirement to specify evidence help prevent arbitrary or unjust seizures and support judicial review.
- **Enforcement Clarity**: The rules provide clear guidance to inspectors, applicants, and courts on how to proceed in cases involving seizure and restoration.

### **Conclusion**

The **Tobacco (Seizure and Restoration) Regulations** establish a formal, transparent, and rights-based process for individuals to regain possession of tobacco products or other items seized under the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act. By requiring notification, specifying procedural details, and ensuring access to legal remedies, the regulations balance public health enforcement with individual rights and due process. The regulations were enacted through a standard legislative procedure under section 42 of the Act, following the failure of parliamentary committee concurrence, and are now in full force upon registration.
