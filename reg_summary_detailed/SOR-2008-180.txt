**Detailed Summary of the Principal Protected Notes Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Principal Protected Notes Regulations* (the "Regulations") were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under several key statutes:

- **Bank Act** – Sections 459.4a and 576.2b  
- **Cooperative Credit Associations Act** – Section 385.28d  
- **Trust and Loan Companies Act** – Section 444.3f  

These Regulations were enacted to ensure that investors are provided with **clear, accurate, and transparent information** about principal-protected notes (PPNs), which are financial instruments that guarantee the return of principal but may offer variable or limited interest returns. The primary objective is to **protect investors from misleading or inadequate disclosures**, particularly in complex or high-risk investment products.

The Regulations came into force on **July 1, 2008** (S.C. 2007, c. 6, s. 37), and were later amended or updated through subsequent legislation (e.g., SOR/2020-47 and SOR/2021-181), with certain provisions being **repealed or modified** over time.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Institution**  
   - Refers to either:
     - A *retail association* as defined in Section 2 of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, or  
     - A *company* as defined in Section 2 of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.  
   - *Note:* This definition was **repealed in 2021 (SOR/2021-181, s. 104)**, indicating a potential update in regulatory scope or structure, though the current text retains it for historical context.

2. **Interest**  
   - Includes all returns payable by the institution to the investor under the note in respect of the principal amount.

3. **Principal-Protected Note (PPN)**  
   - Has the same meaning as in subsection **627.01(1)** of the *Bank Act*.  
   - A PPN is a note that guarantees the return of the principal amount at maturity, but the interest earned may be variable, dependent on a market index, or subject to limitations.

### **Core Disclosure Requirements**

#### **1. Pre-Entry Disclosure (Minimum Requirements)**  
*Applicable to all agreements to issue a PPN, unless otherwise exempted.*

An institution must provide **at least two days before entering into an agreement** with an investor the following information:

| Disclosure Item | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Term of the note** | How long the note is valid and when principal and interest will be repaid. |
| **Principal repayment and interest payments** | Details on when and how principal and interest are returned. |
| **Charges and their impact** | Any fees (e.g., administrative, redemption) and how they affect interest. |
| **Interest accrual and limitations** | How interest is calculated and whether there are caps or limits. |
| **Risks associated with the note** | Includes the risk that **no interest may accrue** due to index performance or market conditions. |
| **Distinction from fixed-rate investments** | Clear explanation of how PPNs differ from traditional fixed-rate investments in terms of **risk and return**. |
| **When a PPN may be appropriate** | Situations where such a product might suit an investor (e.g., risk-averse investors). |
| **Deposit insurance eligibility** | If the note is **not covered** by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), this must be clearly stated. |
| **Early redemption rights** | Whether the investor can redeem the note before maturity, and if so, whether they will receive **less than the principal**. |
| **Secondary market terms** | If available, details about how and whether the investor can sell the note on a secondary market. |
| **Right to cancel** | Whether the investor can cancel the purchase and, if so, how and under what conditions. |
| **Amendment rights** | Whether the institution can amend the note and, if so, under what circumstances. |
| **Potential conflicts of interest** | Whether the structure or administration of the note may create a conflict of interest for the institution. |

> **Note:** The requirement to provide this information **orally**, **in writing**, and **by a knowledgeable person** ensures that investors receive understandable and accurate information.

#### **2. Exceptions and Alternative Disclosure Methods**

- **Electronic Agreements (excluding certain commitments):**  
  - Institutions **not required** to provide the **oral disclosure** if the agreement is made electronically.  
  - However, they **must**:
    - Provide the **written disclosure** at least two days before the agreement.
    - Provide the **telephone number** of a knowledgeable person who can explain the terms.

- **Agreements Made via Telephone or Electronic Means with a Public Commitment to Cancellation Rights:**  
  - If the institution has publicly committed (under the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*, paragraph 3(2)(c)) to allow investors to **cancel a PPN within two or more days** after the agreement or after disclosure:
    - **Electronic agreements:** No oral disclosure required; written disclosure and a knowledgeable contact number must be provided **before or immediately upon** agreement.
    - **Telephone agreements:** Oral disclosure **must** be provided **before** the agreement is entered into, along with the written disclosure.

#### **3. Timing of Written Disclosure**

- If the written disclosure is sent by **mail**, it is considered provided **five business days after the postmark date**.  
  → This ensures sufficient time for investors to review the material before making a decision.

### **Ongoing and Post-Purchase Disclosure Obligations**

#### **1. Website and Direct-to-Consumer Disclosure**

- Institutions must disclose the required information:
  - **On their websites** (all platforms offering products/services in Canada).
  - **In written format** upon request from any investor.

> This ensures **accessibility and transparency** for all potential investors.

#### **2. Inquiry Response: Value of the Note**

When an investor inquires about the value of their PPN on a **specified day**, the institution must provide:

- Either:
  - The **net asset value (NAV)** of the note on that day and how it relates to interest payments, **or**
  - The **last available index/reference point** before the specified day and how it relates to interest.

> This helps investors understand the current market value and the basis of interest accrual.

#### **3. Amendments to the Note**

Before making any amendment to a PPN that could affect interest payments:

- The institution must **disclose the amendment and its potential impact** in writing to the investor.
- If disclosure cannot be made before the amendment, it must be provided **without delay** after the amendment is made.

> This prevents surprise changes to terms that could materially affect returns.

#### **4. Termination of Index Linkage**

If a PPN **ceases to be linked** to its original index or reference point (resulting in **no interest**), the institution must **disclose this fact to the investor immediately**.

> This ensures investors are aware of a material change in the product’s performance mechanism.

#### **5. Redemption or Early Purchase Requests**

Before redeeming or purchasing a PPN before maturity, the institution must disclose to the investor:

| Disclosure Item | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Value of the note | On the last business day before the request, or based on the last available index measure. |
| Any penalty or charge | For early redemption or purchase. |
| Net amount received | After deducting penalties or charges from the value. |
| How and when value is calculated | Clarifies the method and timing of valuation. |
| Value may differ from prior estimates | Emphasizes that actual value may vary. |

> This protects investors from unexpected financial outflows.

### **Advertising Requirements**

All advertisements for PPNs must include:

1. **How to obtain information** about the notes (e.g., website, phone number, contact details).  
2. **Accrual and limitations of interest** (how interest is calculated and capped).  
3. **Examples of interest scenarios**:
   - If an ad gives an example of interest being paid, it must also include an example where **no interest is paid**.
   - If an ad gives an example of interest **in addition to a minimum guarantee**, it must include a scenario where **only the minimum interest is paid**.
4. **Non-CDIC coverage** (if applicable): Must clearly state that the deposit is **not eligible for CDIC insurance**.

> These requirements promote **balanced, realistic, and non-misleading advertising**.

#### **Past Performance and Hypothetical Examples**

- Institutions **must represent past performance fairly**.
- If hypothetical scenarios are used:
  - The **assumptions** must be **realistic** and **disclosed**.
- The advertisement must include a clear statement that:
  > *"Past market performance is not an indicator of future market performance."*

> This prevents investor misjudgment based on historical trends.

### **Repealed or Superseded Provisions**

- **Section 8 (about availability of information)** was **repealed in SOR/2020-47, s. 9**.
- **The definition of "institution" was repealed in SOR/2021-181, s. 104**.
- These changes suggest regulatory evolution, possibly to align with broader
