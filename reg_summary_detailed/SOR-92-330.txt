**Detailed Summary of the Bank Act Regulations on Insurance Activities (S.C. 1991, c. 46, effective June 1, 1992)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

These regulations, made under **section 416 of the Bank Act**, govern the extent to which **banks in Canada** may engage in **insurance-related activities**, particularly focusing on:

- The types of insurance a bank may administer (i.e., "authorized types of insurance"),
- The relationships between banks and insurance companies, agents, and brokers,
- Restrictions on promotion and marketing of insurance products,
- Prohibitions on sharing sensitive customer information with insurers or intermediaries,
- Safeguards to ensure transparency and prevent conflicts of interest.

The regulations were introduced to **regulate the growing integration of banking and insurance services**, while protecting consumers from misleading or inappropriate insurance promotion and ensuring that banks do not misuse customer data for promotional purposes.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These regulations were **repealed by SOR/2002-269, section 2**, and are no longer in force. However, they provide a historically significant framework for understanding how Canadian regulators approached the intersection of banking and insurance in the 1990s.

## **Core Provisions and Regulatory Framework**

### **1. Scope of Insurance Activities**

#### ✅ **Permitted Activities**
A bank may:
- **Administer** the following types of insurance:
  - Authorized types of insurance (as listed above)
  - Personal accident insurance
- **Provide advice** about authorized types of insurance or services related to them.
- **Administer group insurance policies** for:
  - Its own employees or those of entities it controls (under section 468 of the Bank Act)
  - Employees of:
    - Another bank or its holding company
    - Entities controlled by those banks or holding companies
  - Employees of entities controlled by the bank’s **affiliates** (under sections 522.07, 522.08, or 522.32(1)/(3))
  - Employees in Canada of an **authorized foreign bank** affiliate
  - Employees in Canada of an affiliate of a **foreign bank** (if the foreign bank controls the entity and it operates under section 522.17 or 522.18)

> This allows banks to offer insurance to employees in a coordinated, group-based manner across affiliated entities.

#### ✅ **Advice on Non-Authorized Insurance**
A bank may provide general advice on non-authorized insurance (e.g., life insurance, property insurance), **provided**:
- The advice is **general in nature**
- It does **not** involve:
  - A specific risk
  - A proposal for a life insurance policy or service
  - A particular insurance company, agent, or broker
- The bank **does not refer** customers to a specific insurer, agent, or broker.

> This prevents banks from engaging in targeted or misleading insurance sales.

---

### **2. Promotion Restrictions (Critical Safeguards)**

#### ❌ **Prohibited Promotions**
A bank **shall not promote**:
- An insurance company, agent, or broker **unless**:
  - The company/agent deals **only in authorized types of insurance**, **or**
  - The promotion occurs **outside a bank branch** and is directed to:
    - All holders of credit/charge cards who receive regular statements
    - All natural-person customers who receive regular statements
    - The general public

> This ensures that promotion is limited to appropriate audiences and only for approved products.

#### ❌ **Prohibited Insurance Policies for Promotion**
A bank may only promote:
- An **authorized type of insurance policy**
- A **personal accident insurance policy** (if promoted outside a branch)
- A policy provided by a **corporation without share capital** (e.g., mutual insurance company or fraternal benefit society) that:
  - Offers travel insurance to a natural person
  - Does not provide pecuniary gain to members
- A policy promoted **outside a branch** and directed to:
  - Credit card holders
  - Regular statement recipients
  - General public

> This restricts banks from promoting life, health, or other non-authorized insurance products directly to customers.

---

### **3. Exclusions from Promotion**

A bank may **exclude individuals** from promotional activities if:
- The promotion would violate an Act of Parliament or provincial law
- The individual has **written opt-out** (notified the bank in writing)
- The individual holds a **credit or charge card** with an **account not in good standing**

> This respects consumer privacy and autonomy.

---

### **4. Web Page Restrictions (Digital Marketing Rules)**

#### ✅ **Allowed on Bank Web Pages**
- Promotions related to:
  - An insurance company, agent, or broker that **only deals in authorized types of insurance**
  - A policy of only an authorized type of insurance

#### ❌ **Prohibited on Bank Web Pages**
A bank **shall not**:
- Provide direct or indirect access to a web page that promotes:
  - An insurance company, agent, or broker that **does not deal only in authorized types of insurance**
  - An insurance policy or service that is **not of an authorized type**

> This prevents banks from embedding promotional links to non-compliant insurers on their public-facing websites.

---

### **5. Restrictions on Sharing Customer Information**

A bank **shall not** provide or permit its subsidiaries or affiliates to share **any information** about:
- A **customer in Canada**
- An **employee of a customer in Canada**
- Members of a **customer entity** (if the customer is a corporation with members)
- Partners in a **customer partnership**

> This is a strict privacy rule designed to protect customer confidentiality and prevent misuse of personal or financial data.

#### Exceptions:
- If the bank or subsidiary has:
  - Established **procedures** ensuring that such information will **not be used** for promotion in Canada
  - Received a **written undertaking** from the insurer, agent, or broker (acceptable to the Superintendent) that they will **not use** the information for promotion

> This allows limited exceptions where transparency and trust are ensured through formal agreements.

#### Additional Rule:
- A **bank holding company** may not control a trust or loan corporation if that corporation provides such information to insurers/agents.
- Exceptions apply if:
  - Procedures exist to prevent misuse
  - The insurer/agent gives a binding undertaking to the holding company or trust corporation not to promote using such data

> This prevents systemic data exploitation across corporate structures.

---

### **6. Physical Premises Restrictions**

A bank **shall not carry out business on premises adjacent** to those of an insurance company, agent, or broker **unless**:
- It clearly indicates to customers that its operations are **separate and distinct** from those of the insurer or broker

> This prevents confusion and potential conflicts of interest in physical locations.

---

### **7. Transition Provision (Legacy Coverage)**

Where a bank administered an insurance policy on **May 6, 1992**, and that administration was **not permitted under section 4** (i.e., it was outside the authorized scope), the bank may **continue to administer** the policy for any person who had coverage under that policy on that date.

> This provides a grace period for legacy policies, protecting existing customer coverage.
