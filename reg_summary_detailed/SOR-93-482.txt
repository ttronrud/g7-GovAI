Effective Date: 1991 (as enacted)

---

### **Background and Authority**

These regulations were established under the authority of **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Solicitor General and the Treasury Board) to set fees for certain administrative services, including those related to the verification of criminal records.

The specific purpose of these regulations is to **establish standardized fees** for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to conduct criminal record verifications when such verifications are required for licensing or certification purposes in enterprises related to:

- **Insurance**
- **Real estate**
- **Securities**

This ensures transparency, consistency, and fair cost recovery for the RCMP in providing these critical background checks.

### **Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations apply specifically to:

- **Provincial agencies** that are responsible for licensing or certifying individuals for employment in the above-mentioned industries.
- The **verification of criminal records** by the RCMP on behalf of these agencies.
- The **fees payable** by the provincial agency to the RCMP for the processing and delivery of criminal record information.

The verification must be conducted for the purpose of:

- Licensing an individual
- Certifying an individual for employment
- Any other official determination related to employment in insurance, real estate, or securities sectors

### **Fee Structure**

The regulations prescribe two distinct fees based on the type of criminal record being verified:

1. **$5** – for the verification of **Canadian criminal records**  
   - This covers the RCMP's processing of an individual’s criminal record within Canada.  
   - Includes checks of police records, court records, and other official databases maintained by Canadian authorities.  
   - This fee applies to individuals residing in Canada or those with Canadian criminal history.

2. **$60** – for the verification of **foreign criminal records**  
   - This applies when a provincial agency requires confirmation of an individual’s criminal record from a country outside Canada.  
   - The RCMP may assist in coordinating with foreign authorities or provide access to information from international databases where available.  
   - This higher fee reflects the additional administrative, logistical, and intergovernmental costs associated with international record checks.

### **Key Features and Implications**

- **Fee Responsibility**: The fee is payable by the **provincial agency** (e.g., a provincial licensing authority such as the Ontario Real Estate Board or the Financial Services Regulatory Authority) acting on behalf of the individual or employer.  
- **Purpose-Driven**: The fees are strictly tied to the need for criminal record verification in regulated industries where public trust and integrity are paramount.  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By setting clear, publicly known fees, the regulation ensures that licensing bodies are not subject to arbitrary or undisclosed charges.  
- **Cost Recovery**: The fees allow the RCMP to cover the operational costs of processing verifications, including data retrieval, verification checks, and administrative support.

---

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- The regulations are issued under the *Financial Administration Act*, which grants the federal government broad authority to establish fees for government services.
- The fees are enforceable and must be paid by the provincial agency prior to the RCMP issuing a criminal record certificate.
- The RCMP may refuse to issue a certificate unless the required fee is paid.

### **Conclusion**

The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Criminal Record Verification for Certain Enterprises Fees Regulations* provide a clear, legally grounded framework for the cost of criminal record verification in regulated sectors. By setting a $5 fee for Canadian records and a $60 fee for foreign records, the regulations ensure that:

- Licensing processes remain efficient and reliable  
- Provincial agencies have predictable and transparent costs  
- The RCMP can sustain its role in maintaining public safety in high-risk employment sectors  

These regulations remain in effect as of the date of this summary and are part of Canada’s broader regulatory framework for protecting public interest in financial and real estate services.
