**Detailed Summary of the National Parks Cemetery Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1117**

---

### **Overview and Legal Basis**

The *National Parks Cemetery Regulations* were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, under **subsection 7(1) of the National Parks Act**. These regulations serve to **revoke the previous National Parks Cemetery Regulations (SOR/90-235, SOR/90-32, etc.)** and replace them with updated, more comprehensive rules governing the **control and management of cemeteries within designated national parks in Canada**.

These new regulations specifically apply to **Field Cemetery (in Yoho National Park)** and **Waterton Cemetery (in Waterton Lakes National Park)**. The regulations establish clear standards for burial practices, grave use, monument placement, exhumation, and visitor conduct to ensure respectful, sustainable, and legally compliant management of these sacred spaces.

## **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

- **Ashes**: Cremated human remains.
- **Available grave**: A grave for which no certificate has been issued (i.e., not yet assigned).
- **Cemetery**: A designated burial site within a national park under these regulations.
- **Certificate**: A formal document issued by the Superintendent authorizing burial in a specific grave.
- **Grave**: An excavation in a cemetery plot for burial of human remains or ashes.
- **Holder of a certificate**: The person to whom a certificate is issued, or their estate if deceased.
- **Indigent**: A person who:
  - Was a permanent resident of one or more national parks for at least 25 years cumulatively and lived in the park where burial occurs, **or**
  - At the time of death was a permanent resident of the park where burial occurs and lacks sufficient financial means to pay burial fees.
- **Marker / Tablet**: A memorial placed at ground level (e.g., stone or metal plaque) at the foot of a grave.
- **Monument**: A memorial placed above ground level (e.g., stone or marble) at the head of a grave or plot.
- **Plot**: A numbered lot in the cemetery containing one or more graves.
- **Perpetual care**: The ongoing preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of graves in perpetuity.
- **Superintendent**: The official responsible for administering the cemetery (note: several references to "Superintendent" were revoked in earlier versions; current regulations rely on the role as operational authority).
- **Park**: This term was repealed in 1996 (SOR/96-477, s.1); thus, only specific cemeteries are referenced.

---

## **Scope and Application**

These regulations apply **only to Field Cemetery (Yoho National Park)** and **Waterton Cemetery (Waterton Lakes National Park)**. All other cemeteries previously established in national parks have been **revoked or repealed**, including:
- Banff Cemetery
- Jasper Park Cemetery
- Mountain View Cemetery
- Waterton Park Cemetery
- Cavendish Cemetery
- Immediate next of kin and Superintendent roles were also revoked.

This reflects a shift toward **targeted, sustainable, and site-specific management** rather than broad application across all national parks.

## **Division of Cemetery Areas**

The Superintendent may divide a cemetery into designated areas for specific purposes:
1. **Burial of infants under one year of age**  
2. **Burial of ashes**  
3. **Burial of military personnel** (naval, army, or air forces of Her Majesty or allied forces)

This zoning helps manage space, protect sensitive areas, and respect cultural and historical significance.

---

## **Cemetery Register Requirements**

The Superintendent must maintain a **comprehensive register** for each cemetery, including:
- For each grave with a certificate:
  - Name and address of certificate holder
  - Date and amount paid for certificate
  - Certificate number
  - Other relevant details as deemed necessary
- For each burial:
  - Name, age, sex, nationality, religion, and address prior to death
  - Name and address of next of kin or nearest relative
  - Date and cause of death
  - Name of attending physician
  - Date of burial
  - Additional information as the Superintendent deems appropriate

This register serves both administrative and historical purposes and ensures transparency and accountability.

## **Certificate Issuance and Use**

### **Application Requirements**
- Must be submitted in **Form A (Schedule II)**.
- Must be accompanied by the applicable fee.

### **Eligibility for Certificate Issuance (Section 8)**
If the applicant meets **either of the following conditions**, and there are available graves, the Superintendent shall issue a certificate in **Form B**:
1. The applicant is applying for burial of:
   - A person who was a permanent resident of one or more parks for ≥25 years cumulatively and lived in the park where burial occurs, **or**
   - A person who at death was a permanent resident of the park where burial occurs.
2. The applicant is a **next of kin** (spouse or children) of someone previously buried in the cemetery, and the deceased met one of the above residency criteria.

> Note: The phrase "next of kin" was previously defined but is now largely obsolete due to revocation (SOR/90-32, s.1(E)).

### **Validity and Renewal**
- A certificate is valid for **10 years**.
- It may be **renewed once** at **no additional cost** for another 10-year period.

### **Termination of Certificate Rights**
- **Certificates issued on or after the coming into force of these regulations**:
  - Become void **10 years after issuance** (if not renewed).
  - No burial may occur before expiration.
  - If no burial takes place, the interest in the grave ends **without compensation**.
- **Certificates issued before the regulations came into force**:
  - Become void **49 years after issuance**.
  - After this period, the interest in the grave terminates without compensation.

> This creates a time-limited right to burial, promoting efficient use of limited cemetery space.

### **Reacquisition of Interest**
- A holder of an expired certificate may **reapply** for the same grave by submitting a new application under Section 7.
