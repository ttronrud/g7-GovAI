The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of certain sections of a regulation under the **Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)**, specifically:

- **SOR/2007-128, s. 407** — multiple times
- **SOR/94-554, s. 8** — once

However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text. Instead, it only lists that specific sections have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from legal force).

---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Repeal of Sections**
The repeated entries indicate that the following provisions were **repealed** (removed from effect):

- **Section 407 of SOR/2007-128**: This section was repealed by the same statutory order (SOR/2007-128), which is a *Statutory Order* issued by the Ontario government. This means that the legal provisions contained in Section 407 of that order are no longer in force.
- **Section 8 of SOR/94-554**: This section was also repealed, though the repeal appears to be part of a different statutory order from 1994 (SOR/94-554), likely related to a different regulation or policy area.

> Note: SOR stands for "Statutory Rules," which are official instruments that implement or amend legislation in Ontario. These rules are issued under authority granted by a parent statute (e.g., the *Ontario Regulation Act*).

#### 2. **Legal Implications of Repeal**
- Once a section is repealed, it is **no longer enforceable**, and any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures previously established by that section are **invalid or superseded**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Align the regulation with current policy or legislation
  - Remove outdated or redundant provisions
  - Reflect changes in administrative or regulatory frameworks
  - Avoid legal ambiguity or conflict

#### 3. **Context and Source**
- **SOR/2007-128** is a regulation issued on **April 26, 2007**, and typically deals with matters related to **health, safety, or environmental regulation** (the exact subject depends on the regulation's title, which is not provided).
- **SOR/94-554** is a regulation from **1994**, and its section 8 likely dealt with a specific administrative or procedural requirement.

#### 4. **Why This Matters**
- Legal professionals, regulators, or practitioners relying on the prior content of these sections must now refer to **current, active regulations**.
- Any prior interpretation, compliance requirement, or enforcement action based on these repealed sections is **no longer valid**.

### Conclusion:

There is **no substantive regulation content** to summarize, as the provided text only indicates the **repeal of specific sections** (s. 407 of SOR/2007-128 and s. 8 of SOR/94-554). These sections have been officially removed from legal effect, meaning they are no longer part of Ontario’s regulatory framework. The repeal reflects ongoing efforts to modernize and streamline regulations in Ontario.

> 🔍 **Recommendation**: To understand the original purpose of these repealed sections, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2007-128 and SOR/94-554 prior to repeal — which are available through the Ontario government’s official legislation database (e.g., [www.ontario.ca/laws](https://www.ontario.ca/laws)).
