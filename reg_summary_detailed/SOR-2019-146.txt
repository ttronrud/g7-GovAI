**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Calling in Certain Notes (S.C. 2018, c. 12, s. 230; R.S., c. C-52)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

**Legal Basis:**  
The Order is made under **paragraph 9(1)(b)a of the Currency Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to call in (i.e., withdraw from circulation and cease legal tender status) specific banknotes that are issued under the Bank of Canada Act, when deemed necessary for public policy, economic stability, or security reasons.

**Scope of the Order:**  
The regulation formally calls in (retroactively removes from circulation) the following denominations of banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada:

- One dollar ($1)  
- Two dollars ($2)  
- Twenty-five dollars ($25)  
- Five hundred dollars ($500)  
- One thousand dollars ($1,000)

**Key Implications:**  
- **Legal Tender Status:** Once called in, these denominations are no longer considered legal tender in Canada. This means they cannot be used to settle debts or transactions in commerce.  
- **Currency Circulation:** The Bank of Canada will no longer accept or issue these notes. Existing notes in circulation will be treated as invalid for all financial and commercial purposes.  
- **Public Notice and Compliance:** The Order serves as a formal notice to the public, financial institutions, and businesses that these notes are no longer valid. Institutions are required to stop accepting them and to return or destroy them in accordance with applicable regulations.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on **January 1, 2021**. All provisions of the Order apply from this date onward. Any notes issued in the specified denominations prior to that date remain valid until January 1, 2021, after which they are no longer legal tender.

**Context and Rationale (Implied):**  
The decision to call in these denominations—particularly the $500 and $1,000 notes—was driven by several factors, including:

- **Security concerns:** High-denomination notes are more susceptible to counterfeiting and misuse in illicit activities (e.g., money laundering, tax evasion).  
- **Economic efficiency:** The use of large denominations can complicate cash handling, reduce transparency in transactions, and increase the risk of errors in retail and financial systems.  
- **Modernization of the Canadian currency system:** The move aligns with broader efforts to simplify and modernize Canada’s monetary system, promoting the use of smaller denominations and digital payment methods.  
- **Public confidence:** Removing large notes helps build trust in the currency by reducing the potential for abuse and increasing the reliability of the monetary system.

**Additional Notes:**  
- The Bank of Canada has historically not issued $1,000 notes since 1966, and the $500 note was last issued in 1988. The 2018 Order effectively confirms the de facto withdrawal of these notes from circulation.  
- This Order is part of a broader trend in several developed economies (e.g., the U.S., the U.K., and others) to phase out high-denomination paper currency due to security and economic efficiency concerns.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant step in the modernization and security enhancement of Canada’s currency. By calling in the $1, $2, $25, $500, and $1,000 notes effective January 1, 2021, the Government of Canada ensures that only secure, practical, and widely usable denominations remain in circulation, supporting financial integrity and public confidence in the Canadian dollar.
