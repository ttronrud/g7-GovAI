The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The specific regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on the date specified in **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is **May 15, 2017** (as per the official publication in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*).

**What SOR/2017-84, s. 1 Did**:  
Section 1 of the regulation (SOR/2017-84) states that the regulation being referenced — which appears to be a prior regulation (likely from an earlier year, such as SOR/2014-149 or another related provision) — is **repealed**. This means that the content of the regulation was **officially canceled**, and its provisions are **no longer applicable or enforceable** under Canadian law.

**Context and Purpose of Repeal**:  
Regulations are often repealed when:
- They are outdated or no longer relevant.
- They have been superseded by newer legislation or amendments.
- They conflict with current laws or policy objectives.
- They are redundant or overlapping with other regulations.

In this case, the repeal suggests that the original regulation (which is not explicitly named in your query) was either:
- Replaced by a more current and effective version.
- Removed due to redundancy or obsolescence.
- Part of a broader legislative review or streamlining of rules.

**Legal Consequences of Repeal**:  
Once a regulation is repealed:
- It is no longer legally binding.
- Any actions or decisions based on its provisions are no longer valid under the law.
- Authorities or individuals cannot rely on its terms for compliance or enforcement.

**Source and Authority**:  
The repeal is published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, Part I, Volume 146, No. 22, dated May 15, 2017. This is the official source for amendments and repeals in Canadian federal regulations.
