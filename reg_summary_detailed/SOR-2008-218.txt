The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2016-252, section 27**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from force).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-252**, which is a *Statutory Instrument of Ontario* (SOR = Statutory Rules), issued in **2016**.
- **Section Cited**: **Section 27** of that instrument specifically identifies the repeal of the regulation in question.
- **Repeal Purpose**: The repeal means that the regulation no longer applies, is no longer enforceable, and has been formally replaced or superseded by another law or policy. This is often done to modernize legislation, eliminate outdated provisions, or align with current legal or administrative frameworks.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2016-252, s. 27]" appearing ten times) are likely a formatting or technical error in the original source and do not indicate multiple distinct regulations or provisions. They all refer to the **same repeal**.
- Since the regulation has been repealed, **no active legal requirements or obligations** remain under that provision.
- To understand the **original content** of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation before its repeal — which is not included in the provided excerpt.

### Conclusion:
This summary confirms that **a specific regulation has been formally removed from the legal framework of Ontario** through **SOR/2016-252, section 27**. As such, it is **no longer in effect** and should not be referenced in current legal or administrative applications. Any prior obligations or requirements under that regulation have been terminated.

For further details on the original regulation or the rationale behind its repeal, a search of the full text of **SOR/2016-252** or official Ontario government legal databases (such as the Ontario Laws website) is recommended.
