### **Detailed Summary of the Rainy River First Nations Settlement Agreement Remission Order**

This regulation, issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, establishes a formal **remission of excise taxes** owed by the **Rainy River First Nations (RRFN)** under the *Excise Tax Act* (the "Act") in relation to specific transactions involving land and property. The order is designed to support the implementation of the **Rainy River First Nations Settlement Agreement**, which was finalized in 2005 and governs land rights, reserve entitlements, and financial obligations.

## **1. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this remission order is to **remit excise taxes, interest, and penalties** that would otherwise have been payable by Rainy River First Nations or its agents under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**—specifically those arising from:

- The supply of **additional land** to Rainy River,
- The **sale** of tangible personal property serving as collateral for such land supplies,
- The **cancellation or transfer** of third-party interests in additional land,
- Related **costs and penalties** incurred in these transactions,
- And the **replacement of additional land with replacement land**.

This remission is considered in the **public interest**, and it aligns with the broader goals of the settlement agreement—particularly ensuring fair treatment and financial relief for Indigenous communities in relation to land transfers and reserve development.

## **3. Scope of Remission**

Remission is granted to Rainy River for the following types of tax obligations:

### **(a) Supply of Additional Land**
- Remission is granted for **taxes paid or payable** under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act in respect of:
  - The **supply of additional land** to Rainy River or its agent.
  - **Conditions**: The **cumulative total** of additional land supplied must **not exceed** the quantity of additional land Rainy River is entitled to request as reserve under **section 4.01 of the settlement agreement**.

> ⚠️ This cap ensures that the remission is tied directly to the settlement's land entitlements and prevents overuse or misuse of land.

---

### **(b) Sale of Tangible Personal Property as Collateral**
- Remission applies to **taxes on the sale** of tangible personal property that serves as **collateral** for a supply of additional land.

> Example: If Rainy River uses equipment or assets as security for a land supply, the tax on that sale is waived.

---

### **(c) Cancellation or Transfer of Third-Party Interests in Additional Land**
- Remission applies when:
  - A third party’s interest in additional land is **discharged, released, extinguished, cancelled, or acquired** in accordance with **paragraph 4.40(a)** of the settlement agreement.

> This supports the legal process of transferring or eliminating third-party claims on land designated for the First Nation.

---

### **(d) Incurred Costs and Penalties**
- Remission covers **any costs** incurred by Rainy River or its agent in connection with the above transactions.
- Also includes **interest and penalties** paid or payable under Part IX of the Act for any of the above transactions.

> This provides comprehensive relief—not just on tax, but also on associated financial burdens.

---

## **4. Remission Upon Replacement of Additional Land with Replacement Land**

When **additional land is replaced** by **replacement land**, a special remission formula applies:

> **Remitted amount = (Tax on replacement land + related interest/penalties) – (Previously remitted tax on the replaced additional land + related interest/penalties)**

- The **tax on the replacement land** is considered, but **only after subtracting** the previously remitted amount for the land being replaced.
- This ensures that **no net tax liability is created** when land is replaced in accordance with the settlement.

### **Important Adjustment Rule:**
- If the calculated remitted amount is **negative** (i.e., the replacement land tax is less than the previously remitted amount), the **absolute value** of that difference is **subtracted** from the total remission available for future claims.
- In other words, **future remissions are reduced** if past replacements have resulted in a net tax benefit to the Crown.

> This prevents windfall gains and ensures equitable accounting across land transactions.

---

## **5. Cumulative Land Calculation Rule**

- When additional land is **replaced** by replacement land:
  - The **replaced additional land is excluded** from the cumulative total.
  - The **replacement land is included** in the cumulative total for purposes of determining whether the total additional land supplied exceeds the reserve entitlement under section 4.01.

> This ensures that only **current and active land holdings** are counted toward the reserve entitlement limit.

---

## **6. Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **only granted** if all of the following conditions are met:

1. **No prior remittance**: The tax, interest, or penalty has **not already been refunded, credited, rebated, or remitted** to any person under the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act*.

2. **Written Confirmation by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**:
   - Must confirm in writing that:
     - The claim relates to a **specific quantity** of additional land or replacement land.
     - If the claim involves **replacement land**, the **legal description** of the **additional land being replaced** must be provided.

> This ensures accountability, transparency, and verification of the claim’s validity.

---

## **7. Timelines for Filing Claims**

Claims for remission must be submitted **in writing** to the **Minister** within **two years** of the relevant deadline. The deadline depends on the type of claim:

### **For Claims Related to Additional Land:**

| Scenario | Deadline |
|--------|---------|
| Tax/penalty **paid or became due before** the coming into force of this Order | Within **2 years after the date of coming into force** of the Order |
| Tax/penalty **paid or became due on or after** the coming into force of the Order | Within **2 years after the date the amount was paid or became due** |

> This creates a clear, time-bound window for claims, promoting timely resolution.

---

### **For Claims Related to Replacement Land:**

Deadline is **within two years after the later of**:

1. The day the **replacement land is officially set apart as reserve**, or  
2. The day the **tax, interest, or penalty becomes due or is paid** (without having become due).

> This ensures remission is tied to actual reserve status and financial obligation dates.

---

## **8. Legal and Policy Context**

- This order is a **direct implementation mechanism** of the 2005 Rainy River First Nations Settlement Agreement.
- It reflects a **principle of fairness and equity** in Indigenous land governance, recognizing that land transfers and replacements are part of ongoing reserve development and management.
- By remitting taxes on land transactions, the government supports **Indigenous self-determination**, reduces financial barriers to land stewardship, and reinforces trust in the settlement process.
