The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by the **Statutory Rules (SOR/2017-84, section 1)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Rules 2017-84*, section 1
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2017-84, which was **April 1, 2017** (as per the standard publication date for such rules in Canada).
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The specific regulation referenced was previously a rule under the authority of a federal or provincial statute (not explicitly named in your input). However, because it is listed only as "repealed" without further detail, the original content, purpose, or scope of the regulation is **not available in the provided information**.
- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are rendered obsolete due to changes in law or policy.
  - They are superseded by a more comprehensive or updated regulation.
  - They are redundant or inconsistent with current legislation.
  - They were found to be ineffective or overly restrictive.
- **Implication**: Any legal or operational reference to this regulation is no longer valid. Entities or individuals relying on it must now refer to the current, active rules that have replaced it (if applicable).

### Important Notes:
- The repetition of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggests that this may have been a copy-paste error or a placeholder in a database or document.
- Without the original regulation’s title or statutory basis (e.g., under the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or another statute), it is not possible to determine the specific subject matter (e.g., workplace safety, environmental protection, licensing, etc.).
- To obtain the full context, one would need to consult the **full text of SOR/2017-84**, particularly section 1, which would state the exact regulation being repealed and the reason.

### Conclusion:
This regulation **does not currently exist in force**. It was formally **repealed on April 1, 2017**, under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. The original content, purpose, and applicability are no longer in effect and should not be referenced in legal, administrative, or operational contexts.
