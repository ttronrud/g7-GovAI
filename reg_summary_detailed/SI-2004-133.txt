**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Northern Pipeline Agency Cost Recovery Charge Remission Order, 2004

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)), which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board) to make orders remitting or modifying cost recovery charges when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this order is to provide a financial remission—i.e., a waiver or reduction—of a specific cost recovery charge that Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. is otherwise required to pay under the *Northern Pipeline Act*.

**Scope of the Remission:**  
- **Entity Affected:** Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.  
- **Charge in Question:** The portion of the cost recovery charge under subsection 29(1) of the *Northern Pipeline Act*.  
- **Related Interest:** Any interest (such as late payment penalties or accrued interest) that may be attached to or payable in connection with the charge.  
- **Time Period Covered:** The invoices issued on **September 30, 2004**, and **December 31, 2004**.  

**Key Provisions:**  
1. **Remission Granted:** The full amount of the cost recovery charge (as defined under subsection 29(1) of the Northern Pipeline Act) for the specified invoices is remitted. This means Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. is not required to pay this charge.  
2. **Interest Waived:** Any interest that would have been payable in connection with the charge (e.g., interest on overdue payments) is also waived or remitted.  
3. **Public Interest Justification:** The Governor General in Council has determined that granting this remission is in the public interest. This is a discretionary determination based on factors such as economic impact, operational necessity, or broader policy objectives related to energy infrastructure or regional development.

**Legal Basis and Process:**  
- The order is made pursuant to a formal recommendation from the President of the Treasury Board, indicating administrative and financial review.  
- The *Financial Administration Act* provides the legal framework for such cost recovery remissions, allowing the government to intervene when public interest outweighs the need for full collection of charges.  
- The remission is not a general suspension of fees but a targeted relief for specific invoices issued in the two months of September and December 2004.

**Implications:**  
- Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. avoids financial liability for the cost recovery charge and related interest on those specific invoices.  
- This may reflect broader government efforts to support energy infrastructure operators during periods of financial strain or transition.  
- The decision underscores the balance between fiscal responsibility and public interest considerations in the regulation of pipeline operations.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation constitutes a targeted, time-limited remission of a cost recovery charge to Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., effective for invoices issued on September 30 and December 31, 2004. It is grounded in statutory authority and justified on the grounds of public interest, demonstrating the government’s ability to intervene in cost recovery mechanisms when appropriate.
