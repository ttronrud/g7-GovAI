The primary objective of these regulations is to **identify specific agricultural goods** that may be subject to a **safeguard surtax** when imports from any country are found to be causing or threatening to cause material injury to Canadian producers.

A safeguard surtax is a temporary duty imposed on imported goods to protect domestic industries when a significant increase in imports is found to be undermining the competitiveness or sustainability of local producers.

**4. Goods Prescribed for Surtax**

The regulations prescribe the following **agricultural goods** that are subject to the safeguard surtax:

| **Good** | **HS Code (Harmonized System)** |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Cream | 0401.30.10, 0401.30.20 |
| Powdered whey | 0404.10.21, 0404.10.22 |
| Butter and other fats and oils derived from milk | 0405.10.10, 0405.10.20, 0405.90.10, 0405.90.20 |

These classifications are based on the **Harmonized System (HS)**, which is the international standard for classifying traded products.

---

**5. Scope and Application**

- The prescribed goods apply **to all countries** from which these products are imported.
- The surtax may be imposed **only if** the Canadian government, through the Minister of Finance, determines that imports of these goods are causing or threatening to cause **material injury** to domestic producers.
- The determination is typically made under **section 68 of the Customs Tariff**, which provides the legal basis for initiating and applying safeguard measures.

**6. Key Legal and Procedural Context**

- **Section 68 of the Customs Tariff** is the enabling provision that allows the government to prescribe specific goods and apply a safeguard surtax when necessary.
- The regulations do not impose the surtax automatically; rather, they **establish the list of goods** that may be subject to such a measure in the future, pending a formal investigation and finding of material injury.
- The surtax would be applied **temporarily** and only after a formal assessment by the Department of Industry or relevant authorities, following due process and transparency requirements.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- This regulation reflects Canada’s use of **trade protection mechanisms** to safeguard key agricultural sectors, particularly those vulnerable to foreign competition.
- The focus on dairy products—cream, whey, butter, and milk fats—highlights the importance of the dairy industry in Canada’s agricultural economy.
- The safeguard surtax serves as a **proactive tool** to prevent market disruption and ensure that domestic producers can compete fairly in the face of sudden or substantial import surges.

**8. Conclusion**

The *Safeguard Surtax Regulations, 1995-2* are a targeted, legally grounded regulatory measure that identifies specific dairy-derived agricultural goods as eligible for a safeguard surtax. By prescribing these goods under the authority of section 60.01(7) of the Customs Tariff and section 68, the regulations provide a clear and enforceable framework for potential future protection of Canadian dairy producers from foreign competition. The surtax remains a conditional and temporary measure, activated only after a formal finding of material injury to domestic industry.

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s international trade policy, balancing open trade with the need to protect national industries in times of market imbalance.
