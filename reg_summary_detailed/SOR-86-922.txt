**Detailed Summary of the Service Equipment Cars Regulations (CTC 1986-9 RAIL)**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Service Equipment Cars Regulations* (CTC 1986-9 RAIL) were issued by the **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)** on **August 26, 1986**, under two key statutory authorities:

- **Section 46 of the National Transportation Act**  
- **Section 227 of the Railway Act**

These provisions grant the CTC the power to establish rules governing the **movement and positioning of service equipment cars** in railway trains to ensure **safety, operational efficiency, and protection of personnel and cargo**.

The regulations are formally titled the **Service Equipment Cars Regulations** and came into force on the date of publication.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Marshal**  
   - Defined as *assigning a car to a specific location in a train*, relative to the locomotive or caboose.  
   - This term governs where service equipment cars are placed within the train structure.

2. **Service Equipment Car**  
   - Rolling stock used for non-revenue purposes, including:
     - Housing employees at work sites (e.g., maintenance crews)
     - Transporting railway maintenance-of-way equipment
     - Wrecking auxiliaries (equipment used in accident recovery)
   - Excludes cars used in revenue service (i.e., passenger or freight service for paying customers)

> *Note: The term "wagon de matériel de service" is the French equivalent used in the original regulation.*

### **Core Provisions and Requirements**

#### **1. General Positioning of Service Equipment Cars (Section 1)**

Subject to specific exceptions (see below), a railway company must marshal **occupied service equipment cars** (excluding flangers, plows, spreaders, test cars, and business cars) as follows:

- **Freight Train**:  
  Positioned at the **rear end of the train, immediately ahead of the caboose**.

- **Mixed Freight and Passenger Train**:  
  Positioned **immediately ahead of any passenger cars**.

> This ensures that service equipment cars are kept away from passenger sections and in a safe, accessible location.

---

#### **2. Restrictions on Positioning of Open Top Cars**

No railway company may position an **open top trailer or open top car** (except those with:
- Permanent bulkheads, and  
- Loaded lengthwise with timber, poles, rail, rods, or similar commodities)  
**closer than second from an occupied service equipment car**, and **at least one of the intervening cars must be a full-size steel boxcar or bulkhead-type car**.

> **Purpose**: Prevents risks of cargo spillage, exposure to weather, or unauthorized access during movement.

---

#### **3. Restrictions on Dangerous Goods Cars**

A railway company **must not position a car containing dangerous goods** within a certain distance of an occupied service equipment car, depending on train length:

- **Trains with 7 or more cars**:  
  Must be **at least 6th from** the occupied service equipment car (i.e., not closer than 6th position).

- **Trains with fewer than 7 cars**:  
  Must be **not nearer than second from** the service equipment car, and **not near the middle** of the train.

> **Rationale**: Minimizes exposure of personnel to hazardous materials during train operations.

---

#### **4. Exceptional Positioning – Front of Train (Emergency or Configuration Needs)**

If **track configuration** (e.g., curves, switches, gradients) requires special safety measures during a train set-off (unloading or coupling), a railway company may marshal occupied service equipment cars to the **front of the train, immediately behind the locomotive**.

> This is a **safety exception** for operational necessity.

---

#### **5. Speed and Distance Limits for Trains with Service Equipment Cars**

When service equipment cars are marshalled as per subsection (1):

- The train **shall not move more than 32.18 km (20 miles)** in total distance.
- The train **shall not exceed 32.18 km/h (20 mph)** at any time.

> These limits reduce risks associated with long-distance movement of mixed trains containing non-revenue equipment.

---

#### **6. Maximum Train Length Based on Number of Service Equipment Cars**

- **Trains with 30 or fewer occupied service equipment cars**:  
  Total train length (number of cars) **shall not exceed 60 cars**.

- **Trains with more than 30 occupied service equipment cars**:  
  The train **shall be restricted to service equipment cars only** (no revenue or passenger cars).

> **Purpose**: Prevents excessive train lengths that could compromise safety, control, or operational efficiency.

---

#### **7. Maximum Speed Limit for Trains with Service Equipment Cars**

- **No train with occupied service equipment cars may exceed 56.31 km/h (35 mph)** at any time.

> This applies regardless of the number of service equipment cars, reinforcing safety for all personnel and equipment.

---

#### **8. Equipment and Cargo Security Requirements**

Before moving an occupied service equipment car, the railway company must ensure:

- All **heavy furniture, appliances, and objects** are **securely fastened** to the car structure.
- All **tools and equipment** are stored in a **location isolated from living quarters** (to prevent injury or fire hazards).

> This ensures that internal hazards are minimized during movement and stops.

---

#### **9. Voice Communication and Emergency Equipment**

- Within **two years** of the regulations coming into force, every **occupied service equipment car** must be equipped with:
  - A **means of voice communication** to connect with the train crew in other parts of the train, or
  - Access to an **emergency brake valve**.

> This enhances crew coordination and emergency response capabilities.

---

#### **10. Protection of Service Equipment Cars in Sidings or Back Tracks**

To prevent collisions or unauthorized movements, railway companies must:

- Issue a **train order** under **Rule 203 of the Uniform Code of Operating Rules (No. 0-8)**, or  
- Issue a **Manual Block System Bulletin** under **Rule 323** of the same rules  
- **Spark the switches** (i.e., lock them) of:
  - Back tracks
  - Sidings
  - Other tracks where service equipment cars are stored

> This prevents accidental coupling or movement of trains into areas where service equipment cars are parked.

---

#### **11. Safe Coupling and Movement Procedures**

A railway company **shall not permit** the coupling or movement of occupied service equipment cars unless:

- The **locomotive or train has come to a complete stop** within:
  - **No more than 12 feet** (3.7 meters) from the cars, and  
  - **At least 6 feet** (1.8 meters) from the cars  
- And **employees in or near the cars are notified** by a member of the train crew that a coupling or movement is about to occur.

> This ensures personnel are aware and safe during operations.

---

#### **12. Prohibition on Cutting Off Cars While in Motion**

No railway company may:
- Cut off (uncouple) an occupied service equipment car while it is **in motion**, or
- Cut off other cars while those cars are **moving toward** occupied service equipment cars.

> This prevents dangerous and unpredictable movements that could lead to derailments or collisions.

---

#### **13. Prohibitions on Propane Cylinder Use**

No railway company may:
- **Refill propane cylinders** on the right-of-way (railway land)
- **Carry spare propane cylinders** in occupied service equipment cars

> This reduces fire and explosion risks due to improper storage or refilling.

---

#### **14. Required Safety Features for Propane Systems**

Where propane cylinders are installed in service equipment cars, the railway company must install:

- An **automatic shut-off valve** for each propane cylinder  
- A **pilot flame monitoring device** that automatically shuts off the fuel supply if the pilot flame fails

> These features prevent fuel leaks and uncontrolled combustion, significantly improving safety in case of malfunction.
