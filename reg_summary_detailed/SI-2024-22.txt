**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in Nunavut (Kivalliq Area) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Paragraph 23(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act* (R.S., c. T-7)  
**Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs  
**Regulation Number:** SI/2019-29  
**Effective Date:** The day the Order is made (date not specified in the text)

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer to non-Indigenous parties). This action is taken to **facilitate the negotiation and conclusion of Indigenous land agreements** — specifically, land claims and agreements between the Government of Nunavut, the Government of Canada, and Indigenous groups in the region.

By removing these lands from the disposal process, the government ensures that these areas are preserved for Indigenous self-determination, land use rights, and potential settlement of land claims under the framework of Indigenous rights and self-governance.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

The following **seven tracts of territorial land** are withdrawn from disposal:

- 55D  
- 65A  
- 65B  
- 65C  
- 65F  
- 65G  
- 65H  

These tracts are identified on the **1:250,000 Territorial Resource Base Maps (2023)**, which were jointly agreed upon and finalized by the following parties:

- Ghotelnene K’odtįneh Dene  
- Athabasca Denesųłiné  
- Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI)  
- Kivalliq Inuit Association  
- Government of Nunavut  
- Government of Canada  

Copies of these maps have been officially deposited with the **Regional Manager of Land Administration at the Nunavut Regional Office in Iqaluit**, ensuring transparency and record-keeping.

Each tract includes **both surface and subsurface rights** — meaning that the withdrawal applies not only to the land surface but also to any mineral rights (such as oil, gas, minerals, or other subsurface resources) beneath the land.

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**

The withdrawal from disposal is effective for a **period of 10 years**, beginning on the day the Order is made.

This ten-year period provides sufficient time for Indigenous groups to negotiate, finalize, and implement land agreements related to these tracts.

---

### **Exclusions and Exceptions**

Despite the general withdrawal of these tracts from disposal, **Section 2 of the Territorial Lands Act (which typically governs disposal restrictions)** does **not apply** in the following specific circumstances:

1. **Recording of a Mineral Claim**  
   - If an application to record a mineral claim was submitted **before** the date of the Order, such claims may still be recorded and protected.

2. **Issuance of a Lease under the Nunavut Mining Regulations**  
   - A lease can be issued to a holder of a **recorded mineral claim**, provided the lease covers land within that claim — as long as the claim was already recorded prior to the Order.

3. **Issuance of a Significant Discovery Licence (under Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - If a significant discovery licence is issued to a holder of an **exploration licence issued before the Order**, and the licence covers land subject to that exploration licence, then the licence may proceed.

4. **Issuance of a Production Licence**  
   - A production licence may be issued to a holder of a significant discovery licence (as above), provided the production licence covers land subject to that discovery licence.

5. **Issuance of a Surface Lease**  
   - A surface lease may be issued to a holder of a recorded mineral claim or to someone with an interest under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, **if the lease is necessary** to allow the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest.

6. **Renewal of an Interest**  
   - Renewals of existing mineral or land interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not affected by this withdrawal.

> These exceptions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing operations** — particularly those initiated prior to the Order — are not disrupted or invalidated by the withdrawal.

---

### **Repeal of the Order**

The Order itself is **repealed** (i.e., formally cancelled or revoked) after the 10-year period expires. This means that **after 10 years**, the tracts will return to being available for disposal under normal Territorial Lands Act procedures — unless further orders or agreements extend the protection.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination:** This Order supports the implementation of **Indigenous land claims** in Nunavut by ensuring that key areas are not opened up to private or commercial development during critical negotiation phases.
- **Land Sovereignty and Negotiation Space:** It creates a protected space where Indigenous communities can negotiate land use, ownership, and governance without interference from potential land sales or leases.
- **Legal Clarity:** The exceptions provide a clear legal pathway for ongoing mineral exploration and development activities that were already in progress or legally established before the Order was made.
- **Transparency and Inclusion:** The joint agreement among Indigenous groups and government entities reflects a collaborative and inclusive approach to land governance.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a strategic and legally sound measure to **protect Indigenous land rights** in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut during the negotiation phase of land agreements. By withdrawing seven specific tracts from disposal for a decade, it enables meaningful dialogue and negotiation between Indigenous governments and federal/provincial authorities. At the same time, it preserves existing rights and operational continuity for pre-existing mineral claims and exploration activities, ensuring a balanced and equitable approach to land management.

It is a key example of how Canadian federal and territorial governments are working to uphold Indigenous rights and promote land-based self-determination in the North.

**Key Takeaway:**  
This regulation protects Indigenous land and resources in Nunavut by temporarily removing specific tracts from sale or lease, enabling the negotiation of land agreements, while preserving existing rights and ongoing operations.
