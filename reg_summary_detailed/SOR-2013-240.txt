**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Forage Seed Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The Saskatchewan Forage Seed Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6). This provision grants the Minister the authority to issue orders regulating the marketing of specific agricultural products, including forage seed, in Saskatchewan.

This Order specifically establishes a regulatory framework for the **interprovincial and export trade of forage seed** produced in Saskatchewan.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in its application:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Agri-Food Act, 2004*, S.S. 2004, c. A-15.21 (French: *Loi*). This is the primary legislation governing agricultural marketing in Saskatchewan and provides the legal foundation for the powers conferred to the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the **Saskatchewan Forage Seed Development Commission**, established under the Agri-Food Act, 2004. This body is responsible for developing and overseeing the marketing and quality standards of forage seed within the province.

- **Forage Seed**: Defined as:
  - All **forage grasses and forage legumes** produced in Saskatchewan;
  - **Excludes**:
    - Alfalfa seed;
    - Turf and amenity species (e.g., lawns, ornamental grasses);
    - Reclamation species (used in land restoration).
  - Includes all **grades of forage seed** and **potential mixtures** that are approved under the *Forage Seed Development Plan Regulations* (R.R.S. c. A-15.21, Reg. 3).

- **Supervisory Board**: Refers to the **Agri-Food Council**, which continues to function under the Agri-Food Act, 2004. This body provides oversight and regulatory authority in the broader agricultural sector.

### **3. Regulatory Powers Granted**

The Commodity Board and the Supervisory Board are granted **comprehensive regulatory authority** over the **marketing of forage seed** in both **interprovincial and export markets**, with powers that mirror those they hold for **local marketing within Saskatchewan**.

This includes the ability to regulate:
- The **production, handling, and marketing** of forage seed;
- The **conditions and standards** under which forage seed is traded outside the province or exported.

---

### **4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

A central feature of this Order is the power to **impose, fix, and collect levies or charges** on individuals and entities engaged in the **production or marketing of forage seed** within Saskatchewan.

Specific powers include:

- **Classification of producers into groups**: The Commodity Board and Supervisory Board may categorize producers (e.g., by farm size, type of operation, or level of involvement) into distinct groups.

- **Differential levies or charges**: Each group may be assigned a **different rate** of levy or charge based on factors such as production volume, scale of operation, or market activity.

- **Purpose of levies**: The collected funds may be used for:
  - Creation of **reserves** (financial buffers);
  - Payment of **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of forage seed;
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of financial outcomes among producers.  
    For example, if certain producers benefit disproportionately from market sales, funds may be redistributed to ensure fairer returns across the sector.

This mechanism aims to promote **economic equity**, **financial stability**, and **market resilience** among forage seed producers, especially in volatile interprovincial or export markets.

### **5. Scope and Application**

- The powers conferred apply **only to persons and property located within Saskatchewan**.
- The regulations are **specifically tailored to forage seed**, excluding alfalfa, turf, and reclamation species.
- The Order applies to **all stages of trade**, including production, processing, distribution, and export.

### **6. Effective Date**

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
