**Detailed Summary of the Prosecution of Provincial Offences Regulations (Donkin Coal Block)**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 2007, c. 33*  
*Made under subsection 13(4) of the Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act*

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister of Labour**. The authority to issue these regulations stems from **subsection 13(4)** of the *Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act*. 

This provision empowers the government to make regulations that establish the procedures for prosecuting offences related to the development of the Donkin Coal Block — a specific area of coal resource development in Nova Scotia. The regulations are designed to provide a clear legal framework for handling provincial offences arising under the Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act.

---

### **2. Scope and Application**
The regulations specifically govern the **prosecution of offences** under the *Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act*. These offences are considered **provincial offences**, meaning they are subject to the jurisdiction and procedures of Nova Scotia’s provincial criminal justice system.

---

### **3. Definition of "Nova Scotia Laws"**
The regulations define **"Nova Scotia laws"** as:

- The **Summary Proceedings Act (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 450)** and all its regulations, as amended from time to time;
- **All regulations made under the Summary Proceedings Act** after the coming into force of these regulations, **unless otherwise specified**.

This means that the procedures for initiating and conducting summary prosecutions (i.e., less serious offences tried in lower courts without a jury) are governed by the Summary Proceedings Act and its associated rules. The inclusion of future regulations under that Act ensures that the prosecution framework remains current and consistent with evolving legal standards.

---

### **4. Interpretation Principles**
The **Nova Scotia Interpretation Act (R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 235)**, as amended, applies to the interpretation of the "Nova Scotia laws" referenced in these regulations. This ensures that the regulations are interpreted in accordance with established legal principles of clarity, consistency, and fairness, including principles such as:

- **Plain meaning** of words;
- **Contextual interpretation**;
- **Legislative intent**;
- **Avoidance of ambiguity**.

This provision provides a clear and legally sound basis for judicial and administrative interpretation of the regulations.

---

### **5. Incorporation by Reference**
The *Summary Proceedings Act* and its regulations are **incorporated by reference** into these regulations. This means that the procedural rules for prosecuting offences (such as notice, service of documents, timelines, and court procedures) are directly derived from the Summary Proceedings Act. As such, the prosecution of offences under the Donkin Coal Block Development Opportunity Act will follow the established procedures of that Act.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Statutes of Nova Scotia*. This ensures immediate applicability upon formal adoption, allowing for prompt enforcement and consistency in the administration of justice related to the Donkin Coal Block.
