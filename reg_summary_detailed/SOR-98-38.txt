### **Key Definitions Used in the Regulation**

1. **Act** – Refers to the *Customs Tariff*, the primary legislation governing customs duties, import regulations, and related procedures.

2. **Emergency** – Defined broadly to include:
   - A medical emergency

### **Main Provisions of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Temporary Diversion of Imported Goods for Emergency Use**
- If imported goods are **temporarily diverted** from their original intended use to respond to an emergency (e.g., medical supplies redirected during a public health crisis), they are **exempt from the application of subsection 118(1)** of the *Customs Tariff*.
- The exemption applies **only during the period** the goods are being used in response to the emergency.
- This provision allows flexibility in customs enforcement during urgent situations where immediate use of goods is necessary to prevent loss of life, damage to property, or environmental harm.

#### 2. **Consumption of Imported Goods in Response to an Emergency**
- If imported goods are **consumed** (used up) in response to an emergency (e.g., food or medicine used during a natural disaster), they are also **exempt from subsection 118(1)** of the *Customs Tariff*.
- This exemption removes the requirement to pay duties or comply with certain customs procedures when goods are consumed in emergency response operations.

### **Purpose and Rationale**
The regulation serves a critical function in emergency management by:
- Allowing timely access to imported goods without being hindered by customs procedures that might delay response.
- Ensuring that essential supplies (such as medical equipment, food, or fuel) can be deployed quickly during crises.
- Balancing regulatory compliance with public safety and emergency preparedness.

By exempting goods used in emergencies from the usual application of subsection 118(1), the regulation promotes operational efficiency and supports government and community responses to unforeseen disasters.

### **Effective Date**
The regulation comes into force on **January 1, 1998**. This date marks the start of its operational application, ensuring that the emergency exemption provisions are available for use in emergency scenarios from that point forward.

---

### **Important Notes**
- The exemption is **temporary and conditional** — it only applies during the duration of the emergency and only when the goods are used directly in response to it.
- The regulation does **not** exempt goods from all customs obligations; it specifically targets the application of subsection 118(1), which typically relates to duties or restrictions on the use or disposal of imported goods.
- The definition of "emergency" is broad and includes both natural and human-caused disasters, ensuring wide applicability.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a clear, legally grounded mechanism for exempting imported goods from customs duties or restrictions when they are used in response to emergencies such as fires, floods, medical crises, or environmental disasters. It enhances the government’s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to crises by removing procedural barriers during critical times. The exemption is time-limited and strictly tied to the nature and urgency of the emergency, ensuring that the regulatory framework remains both flexible and accountable.
