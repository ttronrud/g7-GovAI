### **Detailed Summary of the Arviat Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Arviat Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under **section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act** (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.)), which authorizes the Governor General in Council to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada, based on recommendations from the Minister of Transport.

- A **proposed version** of these regulations was previously published in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **August 19 and 26, 1989**, and in two issues of *News/North* on **December 18, 1989, and January 2, 1990**.
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., residents, businesses, environmental groups) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on this public consultation, the Governor General in Council has now formally adopted the regulations.

> **Legal Citation**: These Regulations may be cited as the *Arviat Airport Zoning Regulations*.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms related to airport operations and safety:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Arviat Airport, located near the community of Arviat in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A designated point on the runway used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is located on the centerline of runway 149–329, **609.5 meters from the threshold of runway 329**. Its elevation is **9.0 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 149–329). It ensures visibility for pilots during approach and landing. <br> - Slope: **1 meter vertically to 30 meters horizontally** (1:30 gradient). <br> - Extends **2,500 meters horizontally** from each end of the runway. <br> - Rises to a horizontal line **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**. <br> - The outer ends of this line are **295.0 meters** from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 9.0 m + 45 m = 54.0 m above sea level). <br> - However, if this elevation would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to ensure safety and practicality. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, including the runway. <br> - For runway 149–329: **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline), and **1,339 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, connecting them to the outer surface. <br> - Slope: **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally** (1:7 gradient). <br> - Extends upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Arviat Airport**, including public road allowances.

- The exact boundaries of these lands are **specifically described in Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulations.
- The boundary of the outer limits of these lands is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

---

#### **4. Prohibitions on Construction**

A core principle of these regulations is to **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations.

> **No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations if the highest point of that structure exceeds any of the following surfaces**:
- The **approach surfaces**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surfaces**

This means that:
- Any structure (e.g., houses, towers, wind turbines, or even trees) must remain **below** the defined imaginary surfaces.
- Even small additions (like extensions to existing buildings) are prohibited if they raise the structure’s peak above these limits.

> **Purpose**: To maintain clear visibility for pilots during takeoff, landing, and approach phases, and to prevent hazards such as terrain obstructions or visual confusion.

---

#### **5. Basis of the Zoning Plan**

The regulations are derived from the **Arviat Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2635**, dated **May 4, 1988**, which provides the technical and spatial foundation for the zoning boundaries and surfaces.

- The **ARP**, **strip dimensions**, **approach surfaces**, **outer surface**, and **transitional surfaces** are all directly referenced and described in this plan.
- This plan serves as the authoritative source for the design and implementation of the zoning rules.

#### **6. Key Safety and Operational Implications**

| Feature | Safety/Operational Significance |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Approach Surfaces (1:30 slope)** | Ensures pilots can see the runway during final approach, especially in poor visibility or adverse weather. The 2,500-meter reach provides a safe buffer zone. |
| **Outer Surface (45 m above ARP)** | Provides a consistent, safe boundary beyond which no structures may rise. Prevents interference with aircraft in flight or during climb/descent. |
| **Transitional Surfaces (1:7 slope)** | Smoothly connects the runway edges to the outer surface, avoiding abrupt changes in terrain or elevation that could affect aircraft navigation. |
| **4,000-meter radius boundary** | Defines the area where all development is restricted to protect flight paths and ensure safe separation from the airport. |

#### **7. Revocation Note**

- The term **"Minister"** appears in the original text but has been **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**, which likely reflects a change in administrative responsibility or a subsequent legislative update. This means the current regulations are now issued under the current Minister of Transport (or equivalent), and the prior ministerial designation is no longer valid.

### **Conclusion**

The **Arviat Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive set of spatial and height restrictions designed to **protect aviation safety** at Arviat Airport. By defining precise elevation limits (approach, transitional, and outer surfaces) and establishing a clearly defined geographic boundary (a 4,000-meter radius circle), the regulations ensure that no structures will interfere with aircraft operations during critical phases such as takeoff, landing, and approach.

These rules are grounded in a formal consultation process, are consistent with established aviation safety standards, and are aligned with the original zoning plan approved in 1988. They represent a critical component of Canada’s regulatory framework for managing airport proximity zones and protecting airspace integrity in remote northern communities.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

- **Residents and developers** must ensure all structures (new or existing) comply with the height restrictions.
- **Environmental assessments** and **land-use planning** in the area must incorporate these regulations.
- **Future development proposals** near Arviat Airport must be evaluated against the approach, outer, and transitional surfaces.
- The **9.0 m ARP elevation** and **45 m outer surface** are central to all height calculations.

These regulations remain in force and continue to serve as a vital safety measure for the operation of Arviat Airport, one of Canada’s key northern aviation facilities.
