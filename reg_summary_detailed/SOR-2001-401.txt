## ✅ **Permitted Actions (Subject to Limits)**

### 1. **Acquisition or Increase of Substantial Investment in a Designated Entity**
- A bank holding company **may** acquire or increase a substantial investment in a designated entity **under the following conditions**:
  - This is **permitted under subparagraphs 930(4)(a)(ii), (b)(ii), (c)(ii), and (d)(ii)** of the Bank Act.
- This permission applies **only if** the total value of certain exposures **does not exceed 50% of the bank holding company’s regulatory capital**.

> 🔍 *Note: This is a "minority" investment — the bank holding company does not gain control over the designated entity.*

---

### 2. **Giving Up Control of a Designated Entity (While Maintaining Substantial Investment)**
- A bank holding company **may give up control** of a designated entity **while retaining a substantial investment** in it — **only if**:
  - The bank holding company **controls** the designated entity at the time of the transfer.
  - The total value of the specified exposures (as defined below) **does not exceed 50% of regulatory capital**.

> 📌 This allows for strategic divestiture of control (e.g., going public or selling control) while retaining financial exposure.

---

## ⚠️ **Prohibited Actions (Subject to Exceptions)**

### 1. **Prohibition on Acquiring or Increasing Investment (if over 50% of Regulatory Capital)**
> **Rule**: A bank holding company **must not**:
- Acquire or increase a substantial investment in a designated entity under **paragraph 2(a)** of the Bank Act (i.e., non-controlling investments), **or**
- Give up control of a designated entity under **paragraph 2(b)** of the Bank Act, **if** after such action, the **total value** of the following exceeds **50% of the bank’s regulatory capital**.

#### What is included in the "total value"?
The total value includes:
| Component | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Shares, membership shares, ownership interests** | All beneficially owned shares in designated entities where the bank holding company has a substantial investment but **does not exercise control** — both directly and through entities it controls. |
| **Loans** | All loans made by the bank holding company or its controlled entities to designated entities where it has a substantial investment but no control. |
| **Guarantees** | All outstanding guarantees (by the bank holding company or its controlled entities) on behalf of such designated entities. |

> ✅ The 50% threshold applies to the **aggregate** of these exposures — not per entity.

---

### 2. **Prohibition on Making Loans or Guarantees to Designated Entities (Without Control)**
> A bank holding company **must not**:
- Make a loan to, or
- Give a guarantee on behalf of,
a designated entity **over which it does not exercise control**, **if** after such action, the total value of the following would exceed **50% of its regulatory capital**.

> This applies even if the bank has a substantial investment in the entity — it is a **prohibition on new credit exposure**.

> 🔍 Applies to **loans and guarantees** made by the bank or by entities it controls.

---

## 🚫 **Exclusions from the 50% Threshold**

These items are **excluded** from the calculation of the total value when determining whether the 50% threshold is exceeded:

| Excluded Investments | Reason |
|----------------------|--------|
| Substantial investments acquired under **Sections 933 to 935** of the Bank Act | These are specific, authorized acquisitions under the Act (e.g., under certain risk or capital frameworks). |
| Substantial investments acquired by a **bank controlled by the bank holding company** under **subsection 193(12) or (13)** of the Bank Act | These are investments made by the subsidiary bank, not directly by the holding company. |

> ✅ These exclusions ensure that certain types of investments (e.g., those under specific regulatory pathways) are not double-counted or penalized.

## 📏 How the 50% Threshold is Calculated

To determine compliance:
1. Identify **all designated entities** in which the bank holding company has a **substantial investment but does not control**.
2. For each such entity:
   - Sum the **book value** of shares, membership interests, and ownership interests (beneficially owned by the bank or its controlled entities).
   - Add the **value of loans** made to the entity.
   - Add the **face value of guarantees** provided on its behalf.
3. Total all such values across all such entities.
4. Compare the total to **50% of the bank holding company’s regulatory capital**.
5. **If the total exceeds 50%**, the action (investment, loan, guarantee, or giving up control) is **prohibited**.

> ⚠️ This is a **risk-based limit** designed to prevent overexposure to non-controlled financial entities, which may pose systemic or credit risks.

## 🎯 Purpose and Regulatory Objectives

The Regulations serve several key objectives:

1. **Risk Management**: Limits exposure of bank holding companies to financial risks from non-controlled entities (especially those with material market or credit risk).
2. **Financial Stability**: Prevents concentration of risk in minority investments that could threaten the stability of the banking system.
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: Requires clear calculation and reporting of exposures based on standardized accounting principles.
4. **Strategic Flexibility**: Allows for minority investments and divestitures under controlled conditions, supporting corporate strategy without undermining financial safety.
5. **Alignment with Capital Requirements**: Ties exposure limits directly to **regulatory capital**, ensuring that risk is proportionate to capital adequacy.
