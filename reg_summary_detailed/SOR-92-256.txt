**Detailed Summary of the Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations were enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is grounded in two specific provisions of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*:  
- **Section 531**, which grants the authority to establish regulations related to fees and charges associated with the issuance of security certificates.  
- **Subsection 88(2)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to make regulations in accordance with recommendations from the Minister of Finance, particularly in matters concerning the operations and financial practices of trust and loan companies.

**Regulatory Title:**  
These regulations are officially titled the *Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* and are cited as S.C. 1991, c. 45 — a reference to their enactment in the Statutes of Canada in 1991.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**. This date marks the start of the fee cap's application for all security certificate transfers conducted by eligible companies under the jurisdiction of the Trust and Loan Companies Act.

**Core Provision:**  
The central directive of these regulations is the establishment of a **maximum fee** that a trust or loan company may charge for issuing a security certificate in connection with a transfer of securities. Specifically:  
- A company may charge a fee **not exceeding five Canadian dollars (CAD)** for the issuance of a security certificate related to a transfer.  
- This fee is applicable to all such transactions conducted after June 1, 1992.

**Purpose and Intent:**  
The primary objectives of these regulations are:  
1. To ensure **transparency and fairness** in the transfer process by setting a clear, reasonable upper limit on transfer fees.  
2. To **prevent excessive or arbitrary charges** that could place undue financial burden on investors or transfer agents.  
3. To promote **efficiency and accessibility** in the transfer of securities by standardizing fee structures across trust and loan companies.  
4. To align with broader regulatory goals of protecting the public interest and maintaining confidence in the securities transfer system.

**Scope of Application:**  
The regulations apply to **trust and loan companies** that issue security certificates in respect of transfers. This includes transactions involving the transfer of shares, debentures, or other securities held by such companies. The fee applies specifically to the **issuance of the certificate itself**, not to other associated costs such as administrative processing, notarial fees, or transfer taxes.

**Limitations and Exclusions:**  
- The five-dollar cap is **exclusive** and does not allow companies to charge more than this amount.  
- The regulations do not address fees for other services (e.g., registration, custody, or settlement), which may be governed by separate rules or agreements.  
- The fee is not mandatory — companies may choose not to charge a fee at all, but if they do, it must not exceed CAD $5.

**Enforcement and Compliance:**  
While the regulations do not specify enforcement mechanisms, compliance is expected through the oversight of the relevant regulatory body (such as the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or a similar authority). Violations could lead to penalties, corrective actions, or regulatory intervention under broader financial legislation.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* represent a targeted, cost-control measure designed to ensure affordability and consistency in the transfer of securities within the Canadian trust and loan company sector. By capping the transfer fee at CAD $5, the regulations foster equitable access to securities transfer services and support the integrity of the financial system. The rules remain in effect as of the date of this summary, unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation.
