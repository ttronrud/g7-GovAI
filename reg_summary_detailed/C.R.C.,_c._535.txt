**Detailed Summary of the *Marking of Imported Goods Order***  

---

### **Overview**  
The *Marking of Imported Goods Order* is a Canadian regulatory instrument that mandates the **origin marking** of certain imported goods. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure **transparency and traceability** in the supply chain by requiring that goods of specified descriptions or classes be clearly marked with the **country of origin** in **legible English or French**.  

This marking must be **conspicuous**, **not covered or obscured** by subsequent attachments or modifications, and as **indelible and permanent as the nature of the goods allows**.  

The Order is **subject to Section 3** of the relevant legislation (likely the *Canadian Trade Marks Act* or *Customs Act*), which may provide for exceptions, enforcement mechanisms, or administrative procedures.

---

## **Applicability: When Marking is Required**  
Goods that are **imported into Canada** and fall under a specific item in the Schedule are required to be marked with the country of origin, **provided they are not exempted** under the listed exceptions.

---

## **Exemptions (Goods Not Required to Be Marked)**  
The following categories of goods are **excluded** from the marking requirement:

1. **Donations for charitable purposes** (not for sale)  
2. **Gifts or bequests**  
3. **Antiques**  
4. **Used goods**, **except** iron or steel pipes and tubes  
5. **Goods for exclusive use of the importer or employees**, **not for resale to the public**, **except** iron or steel pipes and tubes  
6. **Goods imported under tariff items**:  
   - 9808.00.00  
   - 9809.00.00  
   - 9810.00.00  
   *(These typically relate to goods like "miscellaneous articles not elsewhere classified")*  
7. **Goods imported for subsequent exportation from Canada**, **except** iron or steel pipes and tubes  

> **Note**: Iron or steel pipes and tubes are an **exceptional case**—they are **included in both the marking requirement and the exemption**, meaning they are **required to be marked**, even when falling under the "for export" or "used goods" categories.
