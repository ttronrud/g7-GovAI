**Detailed Summary of the Safeguard Surtax Regulations, 1995-1**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Safeguard Surtax Regulations, 1995-1* were issued on **January 1, 1995**, under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This action was taken pursuant to **subsection 60.01(7)** of the *Customs Tariff*.

These regulations are part of a broader framework designed to protect domestic agricultural industries from potentially harmful imports that may threaten their viability. Specifically, the regulations establish a **safeguard surtax**—a temporary additional tariff imposed on certain agricultural goods imported from any country—when such imports are found to be causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- **Identify specific agricultural goods** that are subject to safeguard surtax measures.
- Provide a **clear, legally binding list** of tariff classifications (HS codes) for those goods.
- Enable the Canadian government to **monitor and respond** to foreign competition in key agricultural sectors.
- Ensure that any imposition of a safeguard surtax is based on precise and transparent criteria.

This is a **temporary measure** intended to protect domestic producers during periods of sudden or significant increases in foreign competition, particularly when imports are overwhelming or distorting market conditions.
