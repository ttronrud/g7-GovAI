|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which governs the collection and administration of excise taxes, including GST/HST. |
| **Intermediary of a person** | A registrant who acts as an agent or under agreement with a supplier to facilitate or cause a supply to be made. This includes intermediaries such as distributors, brokers, or agents. The intermediary must be identified in the credit/debit note if applicable. |

---

## 📄 **Mandatory Information in a Credit Note or Debit Note (as per subsection 232(3)(a))**

The following information **must be included** in any credit note or debit note issued in respect of one or more taxable supplies:

### 1. **Identification of the Document**
> A clear statement or indication that the document is a **credit note** or a **debit note**.

- Example: “This is a Credit Note” or “This is a Debit Note”.

---

### 2. **Supplier or Intermediary Details**
- **Name** of the supplier or intermediary (as the case may be).
- **Name under which the supplier or intermediary does business** (e.g., trade name or registered name).
- **Registration number** assigned under **section 241** of the *Excise Tax Act* (i.e., the GST/HST registration number).

> This ensures accountability and allows for verification of the issuer’s tax status.

---

### 3. **Recipient Details**
- **Name** of the recipient.
- **Name under which the recipient does business**.
- **Name of the recipient’s duly authorized agent or representative**, if applicable.

> Ensures that the recipient can be properly identified and verified.

---

### 4. **Date of Issuance**
- The **date on which the credit or debit note is issued**.

> Required for audit, record-keeping, and chronological tracking.

---

### 5. **Patronage Dividend Adjustment (Special Case)**
> If the credit note relates to a **patronage dividend** and subsection 233(2) of the Act applies:
- The **amount of the adjustment, refund, or credit of tax** that the issuer is deemed to have made under paragraph 233(2)(b) of the Act.

> Patronage dividends are tax credits provided to businesses for promoting community or customer loyalty. This clause ensures that such tax adjustments are clearly documented.

---

### 6. **Tax Adjustment or Refund (Main Provision – Conditional on Supply Reduction)**

#### ✅ **When the total amount includes a reduction in consideration and tax**:
If the note is issued for a total amount that includes a reduction in:
- The **consideration** (price) for one or more taxable supplies (excluding zero-rated supplies),
- And the **tax calculated thereon**,

Then the following must be included **unless paragraph (e) applies**:

##### Option A:
> The **amount of the adjustment, refund, or credit of tax** included in that total.

##### Option B (if Option A does not apply):
> All of the following:
> - A **statement** indicating that the total includes the adjustment, refund, or credit of tax.
> - The **total tax rate** applied to each taxable supply (not zero-rated) where there is a reduction in tax.
> - Either:
>   - The **total reduction** in consideration and tax for each such supply, **or**
>   - The **total reduction** in consideration and tax for all such supplies where the same total tax rate applies.

> This ensures transparency in how tax reductions are applied across multiple supplies.

#### ❌ **In all other cases**:
> Simply state the **amount of the adjustment, refund, or credit of tax** for which the note is issued.

> This applies when the note is not related to a reduction in price or tax (e.g., a simple tax refund or credit).

## 📅 **Effective Dates and Transitional Provisions**

| Provision | Effective Date | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Sections 1 and 2, and subsections 5(1), (3), and (5)** | Came into force on **December 31, 1990** | Initially applied to the full scope of the regulation. |
| **Reference to “(GST/HST)”** | Before **April 1997**, read as **“(GST)”** | Reflects the transition from GST-only to GST/HST system. Prior to April 1997, HST was not in effect in all provinces. |
| **Sections 3 and 4** | Came into force on **April 24, 1996** | Likely relate to specific formatting or procedural rules for credit/debit notes. |
| **Subsection 5(2)** | Applies to supplies made **after April 23, 1996** | Implies that post-April 1996 supplies are subject to updated rules. |
| **Subsections 5(4) and (6)** | Apply to credit/debit notes issued **after March 1997** | With a **transitional rule** for notes issued **before February 1998**. |

> 🔧 **Transitional Rule (before February 1998)**:
> - For credit or debit notes issued **before February 1998**, clause **3(f)(i)(B)** must be read as:
>   > “A statement to the effect that that total includes the adjustment, refund or credit of tax.”

> This ensures that older notes are not inconsistent with the new rules, even if issued before the full implementation of the updated format.

## 🚨 Key Implications and Purpose

### 🔎 Why These Rules Exist:
- **Transparency**: Ensures that all tax adjustments (credits or refunds) are clearly visible to the recipient and auditors.
- **Compliance**: Helps prevent tax fraud or misrepresentation by requiring standardized, verifiable information.
- **Audit Readiness**: Provides a clear, traceable record of tax adjustments for both businesses and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
- **Intermediary Accountability**: Recognizes that agents or intermediaries may be involved in supply chains and must be properly identified.

### 📌 Practical Example:
Suppose a retailer reduces the price of a product by $100 and reduces the GST (e.g., 5%) accordingly. A credit note issued would need to:
- State it is a credit note,
- List the supplier and GST number,
- List the buyer and agent (if any),
- Include the issue date,
- Show the total amount includes a tax reduction,
- State the tax rate (e.g., 5%),
- Show the total reduction in price and tax.
