**Detailed Summary of the Abatement of Duties Payable Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Abatement of Duties Payable Regulations* are a set of rules established under the *Customs Act* (Act) to allow for a partial refund or reduction (abatement) of customs duties on imported goods that have suffered **damage, deterioration, destruction, or a loss in volume or weight** between the time of shipment to Canada and the time of release. These regulations were introduced to provide fairness and practicality in cases where goods are damaged due to circumstances beyond the importer’s control, while still ensuring that the government collects appropriate duties based on the actual value and condition of the goods at the time of release.

The regulations were promulgated on March 15, 1986, following a public consultation period during which interested parties were given an opportunity to submit comments. They came into force upon the coming into effect of subsection 75(1) and section 81 of the *Customs Act*.

### **Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Title**: *Abatement of Duties Payable Regulations*  
- **Citation**: S.C. 1986, c. 1  
- **May be cited as**: *Abatement of Duties Payable Regulations*

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Customs Act*, which provides the legal framework for customs duties, import procedures, and related administrative powers.

2. **"Qualified Appraiser"**  
   A person who is professionally or commercially qualified—by occupation, business, or profession—to:
   - Appraise the condition of imported goods, and  
   - Determine the **loss in value** of those goods due to damage, deterioration, or destruction.  
   This ensures that valuation is conducted by someone with relevant expertise, enhancing the credibility and consistency of the abatement claim.

### **Eligibility and Scope of Abatement**

The regulations apply to imported goods that have experienced one of the following conditions **between the time of shipment to Canada and the time of release**:

- Damage  
- Deterioration  
- Destruction  
- Loss in volume or weight  

An abatement (i.e., reduction in duty) may be granted **only if** the loss is attributable to **non-negligent, non-avoidable factors**, and the goods are not otherwise excluded under specific exceptions.

### **Rules for Determining the Amount of Duty Abatement**

The amount of duty abatement depends on the **type of goods** and the **nature of the loss**. There are three distinct categories:

#### **1. Perishable Goods or Brittle Goods**  
*(Examples: fresh produce, dairy, crockery, china, glass, glassware)*

- **Abatement Amount**: Equal to the proportion of duties otherwise payable that corresponds to **85% of the loss in value** of the goods.
- **Calculation Basis**:  
  Abatement = (85% of loss in value) / (total value for duty) × original duty payable  
- **Note**: This provides a significant abatement because these goods are highly susceptible to spoilage or breakage, and their value diminishes rapidly.

#### **2. Sugar or Other Saccharine Products (based on polarimetric test)**  
*(Products such as sugar, molasses, or other substances where duty is calculated using the polarimetric test)*

- **Abatement Amount**: Equal to the **difference** between:
  - The duties that would have been payable on undamaged goods, and  
  - The duties that would be payable on the damaged goods **after adjusting the polarimetric reading**.
- **Adjustment Rule**:  
  If the percentage of polarization (a measure of sugar content) is reduced due to saltwater damage, the percentage of salt in the damaged goods is deducted from the polarimetric reading.
  - Specifically, **five times the percentage of salt** (above the level found in undamaged samples) is subtracted from the original polarization value.
- **Purpose**: To account for saltwater contamination that reduces the quality and value of sugar or similar products, which is a common issue in maritime transport.

#### **3. All Other Goods**  
- **Abatement Amount**: Equal to the proportion of duties otherwise payable that corresponds to the **actual loss in value** of the goods.
- **Calculation Basis**:  
  Abatement = (Loss in value) / (Original value for duty) × original duty payable  
- **Note**: This is a straightforward, value-based abatement based on the actual decline in market value.

---

### **Determination of Loss in Value**

- The **loss in value** must be assessed by a **qualified appraiser**.
- The appraiser must be competent to evaluate the condition of the goods and quantify the decline in value due to damage, deterioration, or destruction.
- This requirement ensures objectivity and prevents arbitrary or inflated claims.

### **Special Rules for Bulk Wines and Spirits in Bonded Warehouses**

- **Eligibility**: Applies only to **bulk wines and spirits** stored in a bonded warehouse.
- **Abatement Amount**: Equal to the proportion of duties that corresponds to the **loss in volume or weight** relative to the original volume or weight at warehousing.
- **Limitation**:  
  No abatement is allowed if the loss exceeds:
  - **One-sixth of one per cent (1/600%)** of the original volume or weight, **multiplied by the number of months** since original warehousing, **or**  
  - **Eight per cent** of the original volume or weight — whichever is **lesser**.
- **Rationale**:  
  This cap ensures that only **minor, natural losses** (e.g., evaporation, oxidation) are eligible for abatement. Losses due to negligence, poor storage, or fraud are excluded.

---

### **Exclusions (No Abatement Allowed)**

Under no circumstances will an abatement be granted in the following cases:

1. **Goods with a manufacturer’s or producer’s recommended shelf life or allowable storage-before-use period**  
   - If the damage or deterioration results from the **expiration** of this period.  
   - Example: Food items that spoil after their "best before" date.

2. **Iron, steel, or any manufacture thereof that has rusted**  
   - Rust is considered a form of deterioration due to environmental exposure and is **not eligible** for abatement.  
   - This may reflect the economic reality that rusted metal is not recoverable in value.

3. **Packages of liquids where damage is confined to the packaging only**  
   - If the **liquid contents remain undamaged**, no abatement is allowed.  
   - Example: A bottle of wine with a cracked seal but intact liquid content — only the package is damaged.  
   - This protects against claims based solely on packaging defects.

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fairness** | Allows duty relief when goods are damaged beyond the importer’s control. |
| **Proportionality** | Abatement is directly tied to the extent of loss in value or quantity. |
| **Transparency** | Clear rules based on measurable criteria (e.g., polarimetry, percentage loss). |
| **Prevention of Abuse** | Exclusions and caps prevent misuse, such as claiming abatement for negligence or fraud. |
| **Professional Oversight** | Requires qualified appraisers to ensure valuation is credible and consistent. |

### **Practical Implications for Importers and Customs Authorities**

- Importers must document the **cause, timing, and extent** of damage or deterioration.
- A qualified appraiser must provide a formal assessment of the loss in value or volume/weight.
- For sugar and polarimetric goods, **certified testing** of salt content is required.
- For bulk wines/spirits, storage duration and volume changes must be tracked to stay within the 1/600% or 8% threshold.
- Claims must be submitted promptly and supported by evidence.

### **Conclusion**

The *Abatement of Duties Payable Regulations* provide a **structured, equitable, and rule-based mechanism** for reducing customs duties when imported goods suffer damage, deterioration, or loss in volume/weight. By differentiating treatment based on product type and nature of loss, the regulations balance **economic efficiency** with **practical realities of international trade**. At the same time, clear exclusions and limits prevent abuse and ensure that duties are not unduly reduced in cases of negligence, expiration, or packaging-only damage.

These regulations remain a key component of Canada’s customs framework, promoting both trade fairness and regulatory accountability.
