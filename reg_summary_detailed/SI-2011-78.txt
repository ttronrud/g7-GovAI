**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument:**
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in Nunavut (Eeyou Marine Region) Order*  
**Legal Citation:** R.S., c. T-7 (Territorial Lands Act)  
**Issued by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  
**Pursuant to:** Paragraph 23(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act*

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in Nunavut’s Eeyou Marine Region (EMR)** from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of disposition by the Government of Canada) in order to **facilitate the completion of a Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (CLCA)** between the Government of Canada and the **Crees of Quebec** within the Eeyou Marine Region.

This withdrawal is a temporary measure designed to ensure that land rights and interests are not disrupted during the negotiation and implementation of the land claim agreement, which involves Indigenous rights and self-governance arrangements.

### **Scope of Withdrawal**

#### **1. Geographic Area Withdrawn**
The area withdrawn from disposal is defined by a precise boundary described in the schedule and illustrated on **NTS map sheets 32M, 33D, 33E, 33L, 43A, 43H, and 43I**.

The boundary runs as follows:

1. **Start Point:**  
   On the **Ontario–Quebec boundary**, near **Chiyask Bay**, at approximately  
   **51°27′40″ N latitude and 79°31′05″ W longitude**.

2. **Northwesterly along a geodesic line** to:  
   - **51°47′00″ N, 80°00′00″ W** (southwest of Charlton Island)

3. **Continues northwesterly** to:  
   - **52°45′00″ N, 80°30′00″ W** (east of Akimiski Island)

4. **Continues northwesterly** to:  
   - **54°30′ N, 81°20′ W** (northwest of Bear Island)

5. **Turns northeasterly** to:  
   - **55°00′ N, 81°00′ W** (east of Cape Henrietta Maria, Ontario) — this point coincides with the **Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA)** as defined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.

6. **Easts along 55°00′ N latitude** to:  
   - **80°00′ W longitude** (northwest of Long Island)

7. **Southerly along 80°00′ W longitude** to:  
   - **54°46′ N** (southwest of Long Island)

8. **Southeasterly along a geodesic line** to:  
   - The **Quebec boundary** at the **northwestern tip of Cape Jones (Aahaashaakaach Akuminaan Aanaayaach / Tikiraujaaraaluk)**, near **Pointe Louis XIV**, at approximately  
     **54°38′55″ N and 79°45′00″ W**

9. **Returns to the point of commencement** by following the Quebec boundary.

> This forms a large, irregular polygon encompassing a significant portion of the Eeyou Marine Region in Nunavut.

#### **2. Surface and Subsurface Rights**
The withdrawal applies to **both surface and subsurface rights** over the described lands. This means that no disposition (such as sale, lease, or grant) of the land or its mineral rights can occur during the period of withdrawal.

---

### **Exclusions from Withdrawal**

Despite the broad withdrawal, certain areas and rights are **excluded** from the provisions of this Order, as required by **Schedule 6 of Article 28 of the Nunavik Inuit Land Claim Agreement**:

1. **Grass Island (Aamishkushiiunikaach)**  
   - Centered at approximately **53°47′50″ N, 79°06′40″ W**

2. **A bounded area defined by the following coordinates** (in order, forming a closed polygon):

   - 53°50′06″ N, 79°07′59″ W  
   - 53°50′13″ N, 79°04′11″ W  
   - 53°49′46″ N, 79°04′27″ W  
   - 53°49′40″ N, 79°05′00″ W  
   - 53°49′25″ N, 79°05′35″ W  
   - 53°49′31″ N, 79°07′20″ W  
   - 53°49′49″ N, 79°08′00″ W  

> This bounded area includes the following named islands:

- **Governor Island** (Uchimaauminishtikw) – center at **53°49′45″ N, 79°06′00″ W**  
- **Sam Island** – center at **53°50′00″ N, 79°06′00″ W**  
- **Seal Islands** (Aahchikuminishtikw) – center at **53°49′45″ N, 79°07′30″ W**

> These islands and surrounding lands are **not subject to the withdrawal** and remain available for disposal or other government actions.

> **Note:** All coordinates are referenced to the **North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27)**.

### **Exemptions from Section 2 (Disposal Restrictions)**

Even though the land is generally withdrawn from disposal, **Section 2 of the Order does not apply** to the following specific activities involving mineral rights or claims:

1. **Locating a mineral claim** by a holder of a **prospecting permit issued before** the date of the Order.

2. **Recording a mineral claim** that:
   - Was referred to in paragraph (a), or
   - Was located **before** the date of the Order.

3. **Granting a lease** under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person with a **recorded claim**, if the lease covers an area within that claim.

4. **Issuing a significant discovery licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before** the Order, if the licence covers an area subject to that exploration licence.

5. **Issuing a production licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to:
   - A holder of a significant discovery licence (as above), if the production licence covers an area subject to that discovery licence; or
   - A holder of an exploration or significant discovery licence issued **before** the Order, if the production licence covers an area subject to that licence.

6. **Granting a surface lease** to a holder of:
   - A recorded mineral claim under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations*, or
   - An interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*,  
   **if the surface lease is required** to allow the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest.

7. **Renewal of an interest** (e.g., mineral rights or leases).

> These exemptions ensure that **existing mineral exploration and development activities**—particularly those initiated prior to the Order—are not disrupted. This protects ongoing operations and legal rights under existing regulatory frameworks.

### **Duration of the Withdrawal**

The withdrawal is **temporary** and effective from the **date the Order is made** until **November 30, 2013**.

> After this date, the tracts will revert to being available for disposal unless further orders are issued.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- This Order is part of a broader effort to **resolve Indigenous land claims** in Canada, particularly in the **Nunavik and Eeyou regions**.
- The **Crees of Quebec** (also known as the *Nunavik Crees*) have long-standing land rights and self-governance interests in the Eeyou Marine Region.
- The withdrawal supports the negotiation of a **Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (CLCA)**, which would:
  - Recognize Indigenous rights to land and resources,
  - Provide for self-governance,
  - Establish land use and management frameworks,
  - Ensure fair and equitable outcomes for Indigenous communities.
