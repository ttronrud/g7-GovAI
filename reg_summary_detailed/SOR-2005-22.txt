Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Denatured and Specially Denatured Alcohol Regulations*, enacted under the *Excise Act, 2001* (S.C. 2002, c. 22), as recommended by the Minister of National Revenue and approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Denatured and Specially Denatured Alcohol Regulations (S.C. 2002, c. 22)**

### 🔹 **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
- These regulations were made under **paragraph 304(1)(o) of the Excise Act, 2001**, which authorizes the Minister of National Revenue to prescribe specifications for denatured and specially denatured alcohol.
- The regulations are issued to ensure the **safe, standardized, and legally compliant denaturing of alcoholic spirits** to prevent misuse (e.g., for human consumption) and to facilitate proper taxation and control.

---

### 🔹 **2. Definitions and Core Principles**

#### ✅ **Denatured Alcohol (DA)**
- Denatured alcohol is ethanol that has been rendered unfit for human consumption by mixing it with **denaturants** (unpleasant-tasting, toxic, or hazardous substances).
- The **specification** for each grade of denatured alcohol is defined in **Schedule 1**.

#### ✅ **Specially Denatured Alcohol (SDA)**
- Specially denatured alcohol is a more strictly regulated form of denatured alcohol, often used for industrial or non-consumer purposes.
- The specifications are defined in **Schedule 2**.

> Both types are based on a **standardized mixing ratio**:
> - The quantity of denaturant is **proportional** to the volume of spirits being denatured.
> - For every 100 liters of spirits, a fixed amount of denaturant is used as specified in the relevant schedule.
> - If the volume differs from 100 L, the denaturant quantity must be adjusted **in direct proportion**.

---

### 🔹 **3. Base Composition of Denatured Alcohol**

All denatured and specially denatured alcohol must be based on **ethyl alcohol** with a minimum strength of:

| Grade | Minimum Ethyl Alcohol Strength |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **DA-2J** | 75% absolute ethyl alcohol by volume at 20°C |
| **All other grades** (DA-2A, DA-2B, etc.) | 95% absolute ethyl alcohol by volume at 20°C |

> This ensures consistency in the starting material and allows for predictable denaturing outcomes.

---

### 🔹 **4. Requirements for Spirits Licensees**

A licensed producer or spirit dealer who denatures spirits must:

1. **Thoroughly mix** the spirits and denaturants to ensure uniformity and effective denaturing.
2. **Use only denaturants listed** in the appropriate column of Schedule 1 or 2.
3. Ensure the denaturant **possesses the characteristics** specified in the corresponding column (e.g., toxicity, volatility, odor, chemical properties).

> This ensures compliance with safety, health, and regulatory standards.

---

### 🔹 **5. Approved Denaturants (by Schedule)**

The regulations list specific combinations of denaturants, each corresponding to a particular grade of denatured or specially denatured alcohol. These are detailed in **Schedules 1 and 2**.

Below is a **detailed breakdown** of the listed denaturant formulations:

---

#### 🔸 **Schedule 1 – Denatured Alcohol Grades**

| Denaturant Formula | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Option 1** | 250 mL diethyl phthalate + 700 mg denatonium benzoate + 40 g camphor |
| **Option 2** | 250 mL diethyl phthalate + 175 g sucrose octaacetate + 40 g camphor |
| **Option 3** | 4 L methyl alcohol (methanol) + 1 g denatonium benzoate |
| **Option 4** | 4 L methyl alcohol + 250 g sucrose octaacetate |
| **Option 5** | 1 g denatonium benzoate + 100 mL tert-butyl alcohol |
| **Option 6** | 250 g sucrose octaacetate + 100 mL tert-butyl alcohol |
| **Option 7** | 2 L ethyl acetate + 2 L toluene |
| **Option 8** | 5 L solvent naphtha |
| **Option 9** | 1 L ethyl acetate |
| **Option 10** | Vinegar or glacial acetic acid with **≥6 g/L acetic acid** (for SDA only) |
| **Option 11** | 800 g boric acid or polysorbate 80 (NF) + up to 600 g of any one or a combination of the following essential oils or chemicals (total ≤600 g): <br> - Almond oil, anethole, anise oil, bay oil, benzaldehyde, bergamot oil, camphor, cedar leaf oil, chlorothymol, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamon oil, citronella oil, clove oil, coal tar, eucalyptol, eucalyptus oil, eugenol, guaiacol, lavender oil, menthol, methyl salicylate, mustard oil, peppermint oil, phenol, phenyl salicylate, pine needle oil, pine oil, rosemary oil, safrole, sassafras oil, spearmint oil, spike lavender oil, storax, thyme oil, thymol, tolu balsam, turpentine oil |
| **Option 12** | 23 g potassium iodide + 32 g mercuric iodide (red, NF) <br> OR <br> 27 g thimerosal (USP) <br> OR <br> 22 g phenyl mercuric benzoate / chloride / nitrate (NF) <br> OR <br> 10 L n-butyl alcohol |
| **Option 13** | 800 mg denatonium benzoate + 2 L ethyl acetate + 100 g camphor |
| **Option 14** | 200 g sucrose octaacetate + 2 L ethyl acetate + 100 g camphor |

> ✅ **Note**: These formulations are specific to the grade of alcohol and must be used in accordance with the prescribed ratios and proportions.

#### 🔸 **Schedule 2 – Specially Denatured Alcohol Grades**

- Specially denatured alcohol is subject to **more stringent denaturant requirements** due to its industrial or non-consumer use.
- The denaturants must meet **specific performance and safety criteria**, including:
  - **Odor**: Must have a strong, volatile, petroleum-like smell (characteristic of petroleum naphtha).
  - **Chemical compliance**: Must meet one of the following standards:
    - **CAN/CGSB-3.27-M89** – *Naphtha Fuel* (1989)
    - **CAN/CGSB-1.5-M91** – *Low Flash Petroleum Spirits Thinner* (1991)
    - **CAN/CGSB-3.22-2002** – *Wide Cut Type Aviation Turbine Fuel* (2002)

> These standards ensure that the denaturant is:
> - Flammable
> - Volatile
> - Safe for industrial use (but toxic or unpalatable for human consumption)

---

### 🔹 **6. Performance Criteria for Petroleum-Based Denaturants**

If a petroleum-based denaturant is used (e.g., naphtha or fuel derivatives), it must meet **specific technical specifications** as per **CAN/CGSB-3.5-2004** (*Unleaded Automotive Gasoline*):

| Parameter | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vapour pressure** | ≥ 38 kPa |
| **Antiknock index (AKI)** | ≥ 80 |
| **Distillation temp (10%)** | Between 35°C and 70°C |
| **Distillation temp (50%)** | Between 65°C and 120°C |

> These parameters ensure the denaturant is volatile and suitable for blending with ethanol without compromising stability or safety.

---

### 🔹 **7. Key Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Prevent consumption** of ethanol by making it unpalatable and toxic through denaturing.
2. **Ensure consistency and traceability** in the production and use of denatured alcohol across Canada.
3. **Support tax compliance** by clearly defining what constitutes "denatured" or "specially denatured" alcohol.
4. **Protect public health and safety** by using hazardous or unpleasant substances that deter human ingestion.
5. **Enable industrial use** (e.g., in solvents, fuels, cleaning agents) while maintaining regulatory oversight.
