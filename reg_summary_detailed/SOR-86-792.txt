## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Valuation for Duty Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Origin**: The regulation was published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 15, 1986**, pursuant to **subsection 164(3)** of the *Customs Act*. This provided interested parties with a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** before the final regulations were adopted.
  
- **Legal Basis for Adoption**:
  - The regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**.
  - Authority drawn from multiple sections of the *Customs Act*:
    - **Subsection 48(3)** – Determining whether transaction value approximates other values.
    - **Paragraph 48(5)(a)(iii)** – Determining value of goods or services supplied by the purchaser.
    - **Paragraph 51(4)(a)** – Calculation of commission or profit and general expenses.
    - **Subsection 52(2)** – Determination of costs, charges, and expenses.
    - **Paragraph 164(1)(i)** – General authority to make regulations respecting the determination of value for duty.

- **Effective Date**:
  - The regulations come into force on the day the *Customs Act* (excluding specific provisions: **paragraph 99(1)(b)**, **subsections 99(2) to (4)**, and **sections 192 to 194**) comes into effect.

- **Regulation Title**:  
  **Valuation for Duty Regulations**

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### a) **Act**
- Refers to the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1986, c. 1).

#### b) **Permanent Establishment**
- A **fixed place of business** operated by a person to carry on business.
- Includes:
  - A branch, office, factory, workshop, or place of management.
- Applies to both residents and non-residents when determining duty value.

#### c) **Resident**
- An individual who **ordinarily resides in Canada**.
- A **corporation** that:
  - Carries on business in Canada, and
  - Has management and control in Canada.
- A **partnership or unincorporated organization** that:
  - Carries on business in Canada, and
  - Is managed and controlled by members who reside in Canada (either one member or a majority).

> This definition is critical in determining who qualifies as a "purchaser in Canada" and who may be subject to specific valuation rules.

### **3. Definition of "Purchaser in Canada" (for Subsection 45(1))**

A purchaser in Canada is defined as any of the following:

1. **A resident** (as defined above).
2. **A non-resident with a permanent establishment in Canada**.
3. **A non-resident without a permanent establishment in Canada**, **if**:
   - The goods are imported:
     - For **consumption, use, or enjoyment** by the person in Canada (not for sale), **or**
     - For **sale in Canada**, **provided** that:
       - Before purchasing the goods, the person had **not entered into an agreement to sell** them to a resident.

> This rule ensures that non-residents importing goods for personal use or for resale (without prior resale agreements) are still subject to Canadian valuation rules.

### **4. Determining Whether Transaction Value Closely Approximates Another Value (Subsection 48(3))**

When assessing whether the **transaction value** of imported goods closely approximates another value (e.g., cost, selling price, etc.), the following **factors must be considered**:

#### Factors to Consider:
- **Nature of the goods** being appraised.
- **Nature of the industry** producing the goods.
- **Season** in which the goods were imported.
- Whether a **difference in value is commercially significant**.

#### Additional Considerations (if differences exist in sales being compared):
- Trade levels (volume and market conditions) at which sales occur.
- Quantity levels of the sales.
- Any differences in:
  - Amounts under subsection 48(5) of the Act (e.g., commissions, profit, expenses).
  - Costs, charges, or expenses incurred by a vendor when selling to:
    - **Unrelated** purchasers vs.
    - **Related** purchasers.

> This ensures that differences in pricing due to relationships (e.g., family, ownership) are properly evaluated and not used to distort the true market value.

### **5. Determining the Value of Goods Supplied by the Purchaser (Subparagraph 48(5)(a)(iii))**

The value of goods supplied by the purchaser (e.g., components, raw materials, tools) must be calculated based on the following principles:

#### Method of Determination:
1. **Cost of acquisition or lease** by the purchaser:
   - If acquired or leased from a **non-related party** at the time of acquisition.

2. **Cost of acquisition or lease** by the **person from whom the purchaser obtained** the goods:
   - If that person does **not produce** the goods and is **related** to the purchaser.

3. **Cost of production**:
   - If the goods are produced by the purchaser or a **related party**.

#### Additions:
- **Cost of transportation** to the place where they are used in the production of the imported goods.
- **Value added** through repairs or modifications made **after** acquisition, lease, or production.

#### Deductions:
- **Amount to account for any use** of the goods **after acquisition/lease/production** but **before** their use in the production of the imported goods.

> This rule prevents double-counting or overvaluation of inputs used in manufacturing.

### **6. Determining the Value of Work, Plans, or Sketches (Subparagraph 48(5)(a)(iii)(D))**

For intangible assets like **work, plans, or sketches**, value is determined as follows:

#### Options for Value Determination:
1. **Cost of acquisition or lease** by the purchaser:
   - Only if:
     - The work/plans are **not available generally to the public**, and
     - Acquired or leased from a **non-related party**.

2. **Cost of acquisition or lease** by the person from whom the purchaser obtained them:
   - Only if:
     - The person does **not produce** the work/plans, and
     - Is **related** to the purchaser, and
     - The work/plans are **not generally available**.

3. **Cost to the public** of obtaining copies:
   - If the work/plans are **available generally to the public**.

4. **Cost of production**:
   - If produced by the purchaser or a **related party** at the time of production.

> This ensures fair valuation of intellectual property or design inputs used in manufacturing.

### **7. Procedure for Officers Making Determinations Under Subsection 48(7)**

When an officer suspects that the information supporting the **transaction value** is inaccurate, they must follow a formal process:

#### Steps:
1. **Notify** the person who accounted for the goods (under section 32 of the Act) of the **grounds** for believing the information is inaccurate.
2. **Request in writing** that the person submit **additional information** within **30 days**.
3. **Review** any additional information received.
4. **If no additional information is submitted or if the review shows inaccuracies**, and the officer still believes the information is inaccurate:
   - Must provide **written notice at least 30 days before making the final determination** of the grounds for the belief.

> This ensures transparency, due process, and provides the importer with a fair opportunity to respond.

### **8. Calculation of Commission or Profit and General Expenses (Paragraph 51(4)(a))**

- The amount of **commission or profit and general expenses** must be:
  - Calculated on a **percentage basis**.
  - Based on **sufficient information** prepared in accordance with **generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)**.
  - Supplied by or on behalf of the **importer**.

#### If the calculated amount is inconsistent with:
- The amount generally earned by importers dealing with **unrelated vendors** in Canada,

Then the information must be based on an **examination of sales in Canada** of:

- The **narrowest group or range** of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being appraised (including the goods themselves),
- By importers who deal with vendors in a **non-related manner**,
- And from which **sufficient information can be obtained**.

> This ensures that commissions or profit margins are consistent with market norms and not inflated due to relationships.

---

### **9. Determination of Costs, Charges, and Expenses (Paragraph 52(2)(a))**

- These costs must be determined based on:
  - The **commercial accounts** of the producer, or
  - Other **sufficient information** related to production, prepared in accordance with **GAAP of the country of production**.

> This ensures that cost values are consistent
