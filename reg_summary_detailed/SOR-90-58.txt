**Detailed Summary of the Petro-Canada Limited Transactions Authorization Order, 1990**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the *Petro-Canada Limited Transactions Authorization Order, 1990*, is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. Specifically:

- It is based on **section 122** of the FAA, which allows Petro-Canada to submit a corporate plan outlining proposed transactions.
- The **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** and the **Treasury Board**, exercises its authority under **subsection 91(6)** of the FAA.
- The Governor in Council is satisfied that Petro-Canada and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are legally and operationally empowered to carry out the transactions outlined in the Order.

This Order serves as a formal authorization to enable Petro-Canada and its subsidiaries to conduct specific corporate actions during the calendar year **1990**, without requiring individual ministerial approvals for each transaction—provided the transactions comply with the defined conditions.

### **2. Scope of Authorization**

The Order authorizes **Petro-Canada Limited** and its **wholly-owned subsidiaries** to undertake the following types of transactions during 1990, **subject to strict conditions** set out in the schedule:

---

### **3. Detailed Transaction Types and Conditions**

#### **(1) Incorporation of New Corporations**

- **Permitted Action**: Petro-Canada or its wholly-owned subsidiaries may incorporate new corporations.
- **Conditions**:
  - The new corporation must be formed **for the purpose of carrying out the objectives** of Petro-Canada Limited or its relevant subsidiary.
  - The **investment** (i.e., the amount of Petro-Canada’s equity stake) in each such corporation must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets** as of the end of its **1989 financial year**.

> *Rationale*: This limits exposure to small, targeted entities that support strategic business functions without significantly increasing the company’s overall asset base.

---

#### **(2) Acquisition of Shares in Other Corporations**

- **Permitted Action**: Petro-Canada or its wholly-owned subsidiaries may acquire shares in other corporations.
- **Conditions**:
  - The acquisition must be made **for the purpose of carrying out the objectives** of Petro-Canada or its subsidiary.
  - The **investment value** (i.e., the total amount of shares acquired) in each such acquisition must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada’s consolidated gross assets at the end of 1989**.

> *Note*: This applies even if the shares are acquired through a joint venture or strategic partnership.

---

#### **(3) Acquisition of Assets (All or Substantially All)**

- **Permitted Action**: Petro-Canada or its wholly-owned subsidiaries may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another corporation.
- **Conditions**:
  - The acquisition must be made **to carry out the objectives** of Petro-Canada or its subsidiary.
  - The **purchase price** for the assets of each such corporation must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada’s consolidated gross assets at the end of 1989**.

> *Implication*: This allows strategic asset repositioning or consolidation, but caps the total value of any single asset deal at a very small percentage of the company’s total assets.

---

#### **(4) Sale or Disposition of Shares in Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

- **Permitted Action**: Petro-Canada may sell or otherwise dispose of shares in its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
- **Conditions**:
  - The **proceeds** from each such sale or disposition must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets** as of the end of 1989.

> *Purpose*: Enables divestiture or restructuring of subsidiaries without triggering significant financial exposure or risk to the parent company.

---

#### **(5) Dissolution or Amalgamation of Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

- **Permitted Action**: Petro-Canada may dissolve or amalgamate its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
- **Conditions**:
  - The **net worth** (defined as total assets minus total liabilities) of each subsidiary being dissolved or amalgamated must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets** as of the end of 1989.
  - *Exclusion*: The amalgamation of **Petro-Canada Inc.** itself is not subject to this limit.

> *Significance*: This allows for controlled downsizing or reorganization of the subsidiary structure, ensuring that no single subsidiary represents a large portion of the parent’s total asset base.

---

#### **(6) Sale or Disposition by Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

- **Permitted Action**: Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Petro-Canada may sell or otherwise dispose of:
  - Their own shares, or
  - All or substantially all of their assets.
- **Conditions**:
  - The **proceeds** from each such transaction must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets** as of the end of 1989.

> *Note*: This extends the authority to subsidiary-level actions, allowing flexibility in managing sub-entities while maintaining central control and financial oversight.

---

### **4. Key Financial Threshold**

- The **critical benchmark** for all transactions is **0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets as of the end of the 1989 financial year**.
- This threshold is **uniform across all transaction types** and applies to:
  - Investment in new corporations,
  - Share purchases,
  - Asset acquisitions,
  - Share or asset sales,
  - Subsidiary dissolution or amalgamation.

> *Implication*: The 0.5% cap ensures that no single transaction significantly alters the financial structure or risk profile of Petro-Canada. It acts as a safeguard against overexposure, speculative investments, or large-scale corporate restructuring.

---

### **5. Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

The primary objectives of this Order appear to be:

- To provide **operational flexibility** to Petro-Canada in managing its corporate structure and strategic initiatives.
- To enable **targeted investments** or divestitures in small-scale ventures without requiring extensive regulatory scrutiny.
- To support **corporate efficiency**, such as streamlining operations through subsidiary amalgamations or dissolutions.
- To ensure **financial prudence** by strictly capping the scale of any single transaction relative to the parent company’s overall size.

This reflects a **risk-mitigated approach** to corporate governance, consistent with early 1990s financial administration practices aimed at balancing agility with fiscal responsibility.

---

### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No authority** is granted for transactions exceeding the 0.5% threshold.
- The Order **does not apply** to:
  - Transactions involving non-wholly-owned entities.
  - Mergers or acquisitions involving third-party investors or joint ventures beyond the defined limits.
  - Activities not directly related to the "objects" of Petro-Canada or its subsidiaries.
- **Petro-Canada Inc.** is explicitly excluded from the net worth cap in amalgamation scenarios.

---

### **7. Citation and Legal Status**

- The Order is officially cited as:  
  **Petro-Canada Limited Transactions Authorization Order, 1990**.
- It is binding and enforceable under the Financial Administration Act.
- It is effective for the calendar year **1990** and remains valid only within that timeframe.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Petro-Canada Limited Transactions Authorization Order, 1990* is a **targeted, risk-controlled regulatory instrument** that grants limited but essential corporate flexibility to Petro-Canada and its subsidiaries. By setting a strict 0.5% threshold on all financial transactions involving asset investment, shareholding, or asset sales, the Order ensures that:

- Corporate activities remain aligned with strategic goals,
- Financial exposure is minimized,
- Regulatory compliance is maintained,
- Parent company stability is preserved.

It exemplifies a classic use of administrative authorization under the Financial Administration Act—balancing operational autonomy with fiscal accountability in a state-owned or publicly regulated enterprise.
