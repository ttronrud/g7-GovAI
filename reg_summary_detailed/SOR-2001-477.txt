**Detailed Summary of the *Specialized Financing (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183; S.C. 1991, c. 46)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Specialized Financing (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* are a set of regulatory rules established under the *Bank Act* (specifically sections 929a and 936a) by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations govern the activities of **bank holding companies (BHCs)** in their ownership and control of **specialized financing entities (SFEs)** — entities that engage in specialized financing activities such as vehicle leasing, temporary possession of personal property, or insurance brokering.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **limit systemic risk** in the financial system by restricting the extent to which bank holding companies can invest in or control specialized financing entities, particularly those involved in activities that may pose credit or liquidity risks.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Bank Act*, which provides the legal framework for regulating banks and bank holding companies in Canada.

2. **Balance Sheet Value**  
   The value of shares or ownership interests held by an entity as reported on its **unconsolidated balance sheet**. This means the entity’s financial position is assessed independently, without combining it with other entities (i.e., not consolidated).

3. **Book Value** *(Repealed)*  
   Previously defined but now **repealed** (removed) by SOR/2008-168, s. 3. It was replaced with "balance sheet value."

4. **Specialized Financing Entity of the Bank Holding Company (SFE)**  
   An entity that:
   - Is **controlled by** the bank holding company, or
   - In which the bank holding company has a **substantial investment**.  
   *Note:* This definition is specifically tailored to entities engaged in financing activities that may be considered risky or non-core to banking.

5. **Subsidiary (Exclusion Clause)**  
   A subsidiary of a bank holding company **does not include** a specialized financing entity of the bank holding company. This distinction ensures that SFEs are treated separately from traditional subsidiaries in regulatory calculations.

6. **Non-Controlling Interest**  
   An equity interest in a specialized financing entity held by a person **other than** the bank holding company or any entity directly controlled by it. This is relevant when assessing risk exposure beyond direct ownership.

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply specifically to:
- The ownership by a **bank holding company** of **shares or ownership interests** in a **specialized financing entity**, as defined under **paragraph 930(2)(b)** of the *Bank Act*.

This means the rules apply when a BHC acquires or holds equity in a specialized financing entity — not for general investments in non-financial or non-specialized entities.

---

### **Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

A bank holding company **shall not** acquire control of, hold, or increase a substantial investment in a specialized financing entity **if any of the following conditions are met**:

---

#### **1. Debt-to-Asset Ratio Threshold (Risk of Excessive Debt)**  
The **outstanding debt obligations** (excluding those owed to the BHC or entities it controls) of:
- The specialized financing entity (SFE), and
- Any SFEs controlled by that SFE,

**must not exceed twice** the sum of:
- The **excess of assets over liabilities** of the SFE (on an unconsolidated basis), and  
- The **value of non-controlling interests** in the SFE (on a **consolidated** basis).

> **Rationale**: This prevents excessive leverage in specialized financing entities, which could lead to financial instability if they face losses or defaults.

---

#### **2. Prohibition of Ownership in Prohibited Entities**  
A specialized financing entity **shall not control or hold ownership interests in** any of the following:
- An entity referred to in **paragraphs 930(1)(a) to (j)** of the *Bank Act* (e.g., entities involved in lending, insurance, or investment activities that are considered high-risk or systemic).
- An entity primarily engaged in:
  - **Leasing motor vehicles** in Canada for the purpose of extending credit to customers (e.g., financing car purchases).
  - **Providing temporary possession** of personal property (including vehicles) for purposes other than financing acquisition.
  - Acting as an **insurance broker or agent** in Canada.

> **Rationale**: These activities are considered high-risk or potentially systemic due to exposure to consumer credit, vehicle-related defaults, or insurance market volatility.

---

#### **3. Aggregate Balance Sheet Value Threshold ($250 million)**  
The **combined balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests (excluding those held by the SFE in another SFE it controls) held by:
- The bank holding company,
- The SFE,
- The bank holding company’s subsidiaries,
- And other SFEs of the bank holding company,

in an entity **controlled by the SFE**, must **not exceed $250 million**.

> **Rationale**: This cap limits the concentration of ownership and risk in a single entity, reducing the potential for systemic risk from overexposure.

---

#### **4. Regulatory Capital Threshold (10%)**  
The **sum of the following** must **not exceed 10%** of the bank holding company’s **regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests the BHC and its subsidiaries would acquire in the SFE,
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests held by the BHC and its subsidiaries in **other SFEs** of the BHC,
- The aggregate value of **loans** made by the BHC and its subsidiaries to the SFEs.

> **Rationale**: This ensures that the BHC does not expose itself to excessive risk through direct or indirect lending and equity investments in SFEs.

---

#### **5. Regulatory Capital Threshold (25%)**  
The **sum of the following** must **not exceed 25%** of the bank holding company’s **regulatory capital**:
- The aggregate balance sheet value of shares/interests held by the BHC and its subsidiaries in:
  - The SFE,
  - Entities controlled by the SFE,
  - Entities in which the SFE holds a substantial investment.
- The aggregate value of **loans** made by the BHC and its subsidiaries to:
  - The SFE,
  - Entities controlled by the SFE,
  - Entities in which the SFE holds a substantial investment.

> **Rationale**: This is a stricter threshold than the 10% rule and applies to total exposure, including both ownership and lending. It acts as a **safety net** to prevent overexposure in a chain of investments.

---

#### **6. Long-Term Holding Restrictions (13-Year Rule)**  
A bank holding company **shall not** hold control of or a substantial investment in a specialized financing entity **if**:
- The SFE, or the SFE and one or more of the following:
  - The bank holding company itself,
  - Any other SFE of the BHC,

have held control of or a substantial investment in an entity (other than those described in subsection 4) for **more than 13 consecutive years**.

> **Rationale**: This prevents long-term, entrenched exposure to potentially unstable or high-risk financing activities, promoting diversification and reducing risk concentration over time.

> **Exception**:  
> - If a specialized financing entity **previously held** control of or a substantial investment in an entity **before becoming** an SFE, that period **does not count** toward the 13-year limit.

### **Exemptions from Other Provisions of the Bank Act**

These regulations provide **specific exemptions** from certain provisions of the *Bank Act*:

- **Subsection 930(4)**: Does **not apply** to a BHC’s acquisition or increase of a substantial investment in an entity **through an investment made by a specialized financing entity** of the BHC.
- **Subsections 930(5) and (6)**: Do **not apply** to a BHC’s acquisition of control or increase of a substantial investment in an entity **made via a specialized financing entity**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that the regulatory framework is not overly restrictive when investments are made through SFEs, which are designed to operate in specialized, potentially riskier financing areas.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).

### **Key Regulatory Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Limitation** | Prevents bank holding companies from overexposing themselves to non-core, high-risk financing activities (e.g., vehicle leasing, temporary possession). |
| **Systemic Stability** | Limits leverage, concentration of ownership, and credit exposure to avoid cascading failures. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires clear reporting of balance sheet values, debt levels, and regulatory capital exposure. |
| **Promotion of Diversification** | The 13-year rule encourages periodic re-evaluation and exit from long-term investments in high-risk entities. |
| **Separation of Banking and Non-Banking Activities** | Maintains a clear boundary between traditional banking and specialized financing, reducing cross-contamination of risk. |
