**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Saoyú–Æehdacho (Grizzly Bear Mountain and Scented Grass Hills) National Historic Site) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

## **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal** in order to **establish the Saoyú–Æehdacho (Grizzly Bear Mountain and Scented Grass Hills) National Historic Site** in the Sahtu Region of the Northwest Territories.

This action ensures that these lands are preserved for **cultural, historical, environmental, and ecological significance**, rather than being made available for mineral exploration, development, or other forms of commercial exploitation.

The withdrawal includes both **surface and subsurface rights**, meaning that no future mining claims, leases, or exploration activities can be initiated on these lands under the relevant federal and territorial regulations.

---

## **Key Provisions**

### 1. **Withdrawal of Lands from Disposal**
The following tracts of territorial land — described in **Schedules 1 to 4** — are **withdrawn from disposal** on the day the Order is made:

- All surface and subsurface rights to the designated parcels are excluded from being offered for sale, lease, or other forms of disposal.
- This includes rights to minerals, oil, gas, and other natural resources beneath the surface.

These lands are specifically designated as part of the **Saoyú–Æehdacho National Historic Site**, which is recognized for its **cultural, historical, and ecological importance**, particularly to the Sahtu Dene and Métis peoples.

### 2. **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exceptions)**

Despite the general withdrawal, the following activities are **exempted** and **not affected** by this Order:

| Exception | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mineral claims pre-existing before the Order** | A holder of a prospecting permit issued prior to the Order may locate a mineral claim. |
| **Recording of mineral claims** | Claims that were already located or recorded before the Order are not affected. |
| **Leases covering recorded claims** | A lease granted to a person with a recorded claim (under mining regulations) that covers an area within the claim is permitted. |
| **Significant discovery licences** | A significant discovery licence issued under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of a prior exploration licence (issued before the Order) is allowed if it covers land subject to that exploration licence. |
| **Production licences** | A production licence issued to a holder of a prior exploration or significant discovery licence (issued before the Order) is allowed if it covers land subject to those licences. |
| **Surface leases for claim holders** | A surface lease granted to a claim holder (under mining regulations or petroleum interests) to allow them to exercise rights under their claim or interest is permitted. |
| **Renewal of interests** | Renewal of existing mineral or surface interests is allowed. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: These exceptions apply **only to existing rights or activities initiated before the Order comes into force**. No new claims or leases can be established on these withdrawn lands after the Order is made.
