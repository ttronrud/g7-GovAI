**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Minister of Communications (Library and Archives of Canada) Authority to Prescribe Fees Order (SI/93-200, 1993)**

---

### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation, known as the *Minister of Communications (Library and Archives of Canada) Authority to Prescribe Fees Order*, was issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6), specifically **paragraph 19(1)(b)**. This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Communications and the Treasury Board) to revoke outdated orders and to establish new ones that authorize the Minister to prescribe fees for services provided by federal institutions.

The regulation is a **revocation and authorization** instrument. It formally revokes four prior Orders in Council that had previously governed the fee structure for services provided by the Library and Archives of Canada (LAC), and replaces them with a new, modernized framework that grants the Minister of Communications the authority to prescribe user fees for specific services.

### **Revocation of Prior Orders**

The following Orders in Council are revoked:

1. **P.C. 1978-1060** – April 6, 1978  
   *Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1973*  
   — Established early fee regulations for LAC services.

2. **P.C. 1979-700** – March 8, 1979  
   *Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1129*  
   — Revised fee provisions, likely reflecting changes in service delivery or user access.

3. **P.C. 1986-696** – March 20, 1986  
   *Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1385*  
   — Introduced updated fee structures, possibly in response to financial or operational changes.

4. **P.C. 1986-698** – March 20, 1986  
   *Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1386*  
   — Likely a complementary or related order to P.C. 1986-696.

These orders were rendered obsolete due to changes in the administrative structure of the federal government and the transfer of responsibilities.

### **Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities**

The regulation is grounded in the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, specifically **paragraph 2(a)**, which provides that certain powers, duties, and functions — including those referenced in **subparagraph (b)(i) of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1900** — were transferred from the **Secretary of State of Canada** to the **Minister of Communications**.

This transfer is significant because it legally establishes the Minister of Communications as the current responsible minister for overseeing the operations and financial policies of the Library and Archives of Canada (LAC), including the setting of user fees.

### **Core Purpose and Scope of the New Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize the Minister of Communications to prescribe fees** for specific services provided by the **Library and Archives of Canada (LAC)** to external users.

The Minister is empowered to set fees for the following four categories of services:

1. **Information Systems Services**  
   — Includes access to digital databases, online catalogs, search tools, and other electronic systems used to retrieve information.

2. **Bibliographic Services**  
   — Involves the creation, management, and provision of bibliographic records (e.g., cataloging, subject headings, metadata) to help users locate resources.

3. **Reprographic Services**  
   — Refers to the reproduction of documents or materials (e.g., photocopying, scanning, printing) from LAC’s collections.

4. **Local Delivery Services**  
   — Covers the physical delivery of materials to users at their location, such as in-person visits or mail delivery.

### **Fee Determination Framework**

The fees to be charged are **not arbitrary**. They must be determined in accordance with the **Treasury Board publication on External User Charges**, specifically:

- **"External User Charges for Goods, Services, Property, Rights and Privileges"**  
  - First issued in **August 1986**  
  - Revised in **December 1989**

This publication provides a standardized, transparent, and publicly available framework for setting fees for government services. It includes principles such as:

- Cost recovery (covering direct and indirect costs)
- Fairness and consistency across services
- Transparency and user notification
- Alignment with market and administrative standards

By referencing this publication, the regulation ensures that fee setting is **accountable, equitable, and consistent with broader federal financial governance standards**.

### **Key Legal and Administrative Implications**

1. **Centralization of Authority**  
   The Minister of Communications now holds the authority to set fees, reflecting a shift in administrative responsibility from the Secretary of State to the Minister of Communications.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The requirement to follow the Treasury Board’s fee guidelines ensures that fees are set in a transparent, non-arbitrary manner and are subject to public oversight.

3. **Modernization of Fee Policy**  
   The revocation of outdated orders and the adoption of a new framework signal a move toward modern, user-responsive, and financially sustainable service delivery models.

4. **User-Centric Approach**  
   The fees are intended to cover the actual cost of providing services, ensuring that LAC can maintain its operations while being accountable to users.

5. **Legal Citation and Enforcement**  
   The Order may be cited as:  
   **Minister of Communications (Library and Archives of Canada) Authority to Prescribe Fees Order**  
   This formal citation enables legal reference and enforcement in administrative and judicial contexts.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative update in the governance of the Library and Archives of Canada. It:

- Revokes outdated fee-setting orders;
- Transfers fee-setting authority to the Minister of Communications;
- Authorizes the Minister to set fees for four key service categories;
- Mandates adherence to Treasury Board guidelines to ensure fairness, transparency, and cost recovery.

By aligning LAC’s fee structure with federal financial administration standards, the Order enhances accountability, supports sustainable operations, and ensures that users are charged fairly and consistently for services they receive.

**Final Note:**  
This Order is not a fee schedule itself but a **legal authorization** enabling the Minister to issue future fee orders. The actual fee amounts would be established in subsequent regulatory orders, subject to review, public consultation, and compliance with the Treasury Board’s guidelines.
