## 📅 **Storage Rules and Time Limits**

### 1. **General Rule for Commercial Goods**
- If commercial goods are **not removed from a customs office within 40 business days** after being reported under **section 12 of the Customs Act**, they may be **deposited in a place of safe-keeping** (as authorized under section 37(1)).

> ✅ **Purpose**: Prevents indefinite accumulation of goods in customs offices and ensures timely processing.

---

### 2. **Perishable Goods**
- Perishable goods (e.g., food, fresh produce) must be removed within **4 business days** of reporting.
- If not removed within this period, they may be **deposited in a place of safe-keeping**.

> ⚠️ **Critical**: Perishable goods are at high risk of spoilage; this rule ensures prompt action to avoid loss.

---

### 3. **Nuclear Substances & Prescribed Equipment**
- Goods classified as **nuclear substances** (under section 2 of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*) or **prescribed equipment** (under section 1 of the *General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations*) must be removed within **14 business days**.
- Failure to do so triggers **deposition in a place of safe-keeping**.

> 🔬 **Safety Priority**: These items pose significant risks; strict time limits ensure public and environmental safety.

---

### 4. **Forfeiture Rules (Goods of Prescribed Classes)**

Under **subsection 39.1(1)** of the *Customs Act*, certain goods are **automatically forfeited** if not removed within specific timeframes:

| Goods | Time Limit | Forfeiture Trigger |

| **Tobacco products and vaping products** | 14 business days | Not removed after 14 days |
| **Spirits (alcoholic beverages)** | 21 business days | Not removed after 21 days |

> 🚨 **Important**: These goods are considered high-risk and are subject to strict removal deadlines. Non-compliance results in **automatic forfeiture** (loss of ownership), not just storage.

> 💡 **Note**: These rules apply only to goods **left at a customs office** after being reported under section 12 of the Act.

## 💰 **Storage Charges**

### 1. **General Storage Charges**
- Commercial goods stored in a customs office are subject to **storage charges** starting on the **fourth business day** after they are left at the office.

No storage charges apply if:
- The goods are **imported by mail** (postal delivery).
- The goods **cannot be removed** due to:
  - A **strike** (work stoppage),
  - A **court proceeding** (legal process),
  - An **unauthorized act or omission by a customs officer**,
  - A **mistake by a third party** (e.g., misdelivery),
  - A **natural disaster** (e.g., fire, flood).

> ✅ These exceptions protect legitimate business interests and prevent financial penalties during unforeseeable events.

---

### 3. **Storage Charges for Place of Safe-Keeping (Government-Operated)**
- Storage charges apply to goods stored in a **place of safe-keeping operated by Her Majesty in right of Canada** (i.e., federal government facilities).
- **Exemptions apply** if:
  - The goods were **delivered in error** and are **removed immediately** after being notified of the error.
  - The goods **cannot be removed** due to:
    - Strike,
    - Court proceeding,
    - Unauthorized officer action or omission,
    - Third-party mistake,
    - Natural disaster.
