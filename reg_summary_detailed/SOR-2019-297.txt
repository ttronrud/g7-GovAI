**Detailed Summary of the Fabricated Industrial Steel Components Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)), and is made pursuant to the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**. This provision allows the government to grant remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of anti-dumping and countervailing duties in specific circumstances.

The regulation is rooted in the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**, which governs the imposition and review of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imported goods.

**2. Definition of "Fabricated Industrial Steel Components"**

For the purposes of this Order, the term **"fabricated industrial steel components"** is defined as the **subject goods** as specified in **paragraph 9 of the Statement of Reasons** issued by the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** on **June 9, 2017**, in **Inquiry Number NQ-2016-004**.

- This definition is critical because it establishes the precise scope of goods eligible for remission.
- The CITT’s Statement of Reasons outlines the technical and commercial characteristics of the steel components, including their use in industrial infrastructure, such as structural elements, piping, and support systems.
- The definition ensures that only components meeting specific criteria—such as being manufactured from steel and used in industrial settings—are included.

**3. Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to **fabricated industrial steel components** imported into Canada for use in **two major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects** located in British Columbia:

1. **LNG Canada Development Inc. project** – located near **Kitimat, British Columbia**  
2. **Woodfibre LNG Limited project** – located near **Squamish, British Columbia**

These projects are large-scale, federally supported energy developments designed to produce and export liquefied natural gas. The steel components are essential for the construction of infrastructure such as pipelines, processing facilities, and storage units.

**4. Conditions for Remission**

Remission of anti-dumping and countervailing duties is granted **only if** the following conditions are met:

**a. Timely Claim Submission**  
A claim for remission must be made to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **within two years** of the date of importation of the goods.

> *Note:* The two-year deadline is a strict time limit, emphasizing the importance of prompt action by claimants. Failure to meet this deadline results in the loss of eligibility.

**b. Evidence of Eligibility**  
Upon request, the claimant must provide the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** with **evidence demonstrating eligibility** for remission.

> This requirement ensures that only legitimate and verifiable claims are processed. The evidence may include documentation such as:
> - Import manifests
> - Purchase contracts
> - Project-specific documentation (e.g., construction plans or engineering specifications)
> - Proof of direct use in the LNG Canada or Woodfibre LNG projects

**5. Legal Effect and Implementation**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
- It is a **temporary, project-specific remission** designed to support the development of major energy infrastructure in British Columbia.
- The remission applies **only to the specific goods and projects listed**, and does not extend to other industries or imports.

---

**6. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

- To **support the development of Canada’s LNG industry** by reducing the financial burden on project developers.
- To **facilitate timely construction** of critical infrastructure by allowing project companies to access necessary materials without the added cost of duties.
- To **align with national energy policy goals**, including energy security, economic development, and job creation in key regions of British Columbia.
- To ensure **transparency and accountability** through clear eligibility criteria and a defined claims process.

---

**7. Key Implications**

- **Beneficiaries**: Project developers and contractors involved in the LNG Canada and Woodfibre LNG projects.
- **Impact on Trade**: This remission does not affect general trade rules; it is a targeted exception for specific, federally approved infrastructure projects.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Importers and claimants must maintain detailed records and act promptly to meet the two-year deadline and provide verifiable documentation.

---

**Conclusion**

This regulation provides a targeted, legally grounded mechanism to exempt certain fabricated industrial steel components from anti-dumping and countervailing duties when imported for use in two major LNG projects in British Columbia. It reflects a balance between protecting domestic industries from unfair trade practices and supporting strategic national infrastructure development. The requirement for timely claims and verifiable evidence ensures that the remission remains fair, transparent, and accountable.
