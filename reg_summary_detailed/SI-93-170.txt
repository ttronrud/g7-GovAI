**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Public Service Functions to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology**

**Official Source:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, hereby transfers to the **Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)** the control and supervision of specific public service functions previously held by the Department of Communications.

**Date of Implementation:**  
June 25, 1993 (as part of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489)

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to reorganize and reallocate responsibilities among federal departments to improve efficiency, coherence, and policy alignment.

---

**Functions Transferred:**

The following specific areas of public service operations are transferred from the Department of Communications to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology:

1. **Telecommunications Policy**  
   – Development, formulation, and implementation of national policies related to telecommunications, including infrastructure planning, market regulation, and service standards.

2. **Communications Development and Planning**  
   – Strategic planning for the development of communications infrastructure (e.g., fiber optics, broadband, wireless networks) and long-term investment in communication technologies.

3. **Broadcasting Regulation**  
   – Oversight and regulatory functions concerning radio and television broadcasting, including licensing, content standards, and operational compliance.

4. **Radio Regulatory Branch**  
   – Technical and regulatory responsibilities related to the allocation and management of radio frequencies, spectrum management, and compliance with technical standards.

5. **Engineering Programs**  
   – Programs focused on engineering research, innovation, and technology development in the communications sector, including applied engineering projects and technical training.

**Context of the Transfer:**

Prior to this transfer, these functions were part of a broader reorganization of federal departments. On June 25, 1993, by **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489**, the Department of Communications was amalgamated with two other departments:

- The **Department of the Secretary of State**  
- The **Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship**

This amalgamation aimed to streamline governance and reduce duplication across federal agencies. However, as part of a broader strategic shift in government policy, the core telecommunications and communications regulatory responsibilities were *separated* from the amalgamated Department of Communications and transferred to the **Department of Industry, Science and Technology**.

This move reflected a growing recognition of the importance of telecommunications and digital infrastructure as key drivers of economic growth, innovation, and national competitiveness. By placing these functions under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, the government aimed to:

- Align telecommunications policy with broader industrial and technological development goals;
- Strengthen coordination between science, innovation, and economic policy;
- Improve the integration of communications policy with national strategies for science, technology, and economic advancement.

**Significance of the Transfer:**

- **Policy Integration:** The transfer enabled a more cohesive approach to technology policy, linking telecommunications with industrial development, innovation, and scientific research.
- **Efficiency and Focus:** It allowed the Department of Industry, Science and Technology to take a more strategic, long-term view of communications infrastructure as a component of national economic policy.
- **Regulatory Clarity:** It provided clearer lines of accountability and oversight for broadcasting and spectrum regulation, ensuring that these functions were managed by a department with expertise in technology and industry.

---

**Legal and Administrative Impact:**

- The transfer is not a dissolution of the original departments but a reallocation of functional responsibilities.
- The Department of Communications no longer retains direct control over the listed functions.
- The new responsibilities are now administered under the **Department of Industry, Science and Technology**, which assumes full control, supervision, and operational authority.

The regulation is formally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on page 3235, under **SI/93-143** (Statutory Instrument 1993-143), issued on June 25, 1993.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative and policy shift in the Canadian federal government’s approach to communications governance. By transferring key telecommunications and broadcasting functions to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, the government reinforced the integration of technology policy with broader economic and industrial strategy, laying the groundwork for future digital infrastructure development and innovation in Canada.
