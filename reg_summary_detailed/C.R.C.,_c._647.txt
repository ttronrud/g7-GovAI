---

## 📚 3. **Core Mandate and Powers**

### ✅ **Scope of Farm Product Covered**
The CTMA is empowered to regulate **turkeys and any part thereof**, including:
- Production
- Processing
- Packaging
- Transporting
- Storing
- Selling and reselling (in whole or processed form)

> This includes **interprovincial trade** (movement between provinces) and **export trade**, but **not** for domestic intraprovincial trade unless authorized under a quota.

---

## 📊 4. **Quota System (Core Mechanism)**

### What is a Quota?
- A **quota** is the number of pounds of turkey meat a producer is entitled to market in **interprovincial or export trade** during a specified period.
- Quotas are assigned to producers or classes of producers to prevent oversupply and ensure market stability.

### How Quotas Are Assigned:
- The CTMA establishes a **quota system** in each province.
- Quotas are assigned based on the **total market capacity** of that province, which includes:
  1. Turkey meat produced and marketed in **interprovincial trade** via the Agency or provincial boards.
  2. Turkey meat produced and marketed in **intraprovincial trade** via provincial boards or commodity boards.
  3. Turkey meat **anticipated** to be marketed (not yet authorized) in the same year.

> The total of these three components must **equal the maximum allowable volume** for that province as set out in **Section 3 of the Plan** (a detailed table in the schedule).

### Key Principles in Quota Assignment:
- **No increase in total marketable turkey volume** beyond the approved limit (as per Section 3 of the Plan) without justification.
- The Agency **must consider** the following factors before increasing quotas:
  - **Comparative advantage** in production (which province produces more efficiently)
  - Changes in **market demand**
  - Failures by producers to market their quota
  - Feasibility of increased production
  - Existing **production and storage capacity**
  - **Transportation costs** from different sources

> ❗ **No order or regulation may be made** that increases total marketable turkey beyond the approved annual limit unless the Agency has **demonstrated significant changes** in market size or conditions.

---

## 💰 5. **Marketing and Pricing Controls**

### A. **Producer Obligations**
- Any turkey producer to whom a quota is assigned must **make available to the Agency or its agent** all turkeys produced in excess of their quota.
- The producer must do so at a price **not exceeding** the difference between:
  - The price the Agency receives from selling the turkeys
  - The Agency’s marketing expenses

> This ensures that producers are not disadvantaged when their surplus is marketed by the Agency.

### B. **Agency’s Marketing Authority**
- The CTMA may **market turkeys on an individual or collective basis**.
- It may **pool receipts** from sales and **deduct marketing expenses** before distributing proceeds to producers.
- This allows the Agency to manage risk, stabilize prices, and ensure fair returns.

## 🛡️ 6. **Price Protection and Anti-Price Dumping Rules**

To prevent unfair competition and price manipulation, the CTMA enforces **price controls** in both regulated and unregulated areas.

### A. **In the Regulated Area (from regulated provinces to other provinces)**:
- No person may market turkeys in a province **other than the province of origin** at a price **lower than**:
  1. The price charged at or around the same time for turkeys of **equivalent variety, class, or grade** in the **province of origin**  
  2. Plus **reasonable transportation costs** to the market

> This prevents **price dumping** and protects producers from undercutting prices in other regions.

### B. **From Regulated Area to Unregulated Area**:
- The same rule applies: turkeys shipped from regulated provinces into unregulated areas cannot be sold at a price below:
  - The price in the province of origin
  - Plus reasonable transportation costs

> This ensures **fair pricing across regional boundaries** and protects producers from exploitation.

---

## 💳 7. **Licensing and Levies**

### A. **Licensing System**
- The CTMA may establish a **licensing system** for persons engaged in marketing turkeys in **interprovincial or export trade**.
- Licensing is mandatory in the **regulated area** and optional in the unregulated area.
- Each license must include a condition that the licensee **complies with all Agency orders and regulations**.

### B. **Levies and Charges**
- The Agency may impose **levies or charges** on:
  - Producers
  - Marketers
- Levies may be classified into **groups** (e.g., by province or production scale).
- Levies must be set at levels sufficient to cover:
  - Agency’s **administrative and marketing expenses**
  - Estimated costs and losses
- The Agency may **create reserves** for:
  - Losses from sales
  - Equalization payments between producers
  - Adjustments based on sales performance
- Levies may be collected directly by the Agency or, with **concurrence of a Commodity Board**, by that board on behalf of the Agency.

## 🤝 8. **Cooperation with Provincial Boards**

To ensure harmonization and efficiency, the CTMA is required to:
- **Share records, minutes, and decisions** with each provincial Commodity Board.
- Allow **designated officers** from each Board to **attend Agency meetings** when matters of concern arise.
- Provide **advance notice** of any proposed order or regulation that may affect the operations of a provincial board.

> This fosters **collaboration**, transparency, and alignment with existing provincial marketing systems.

---

## 📅 9. **Review and Adaptation of the Marketing Plan**

- The CTMA must **hold annual meetings** to review:
  - The current marketing plan
  - Existing orders and regulations
  - Whether modifications are needed to achieve its objectives
- A meeting must be held **at least once per year**.
- A meeting may also be called **upon request** from **at least two provincial Commodity Boards**.
