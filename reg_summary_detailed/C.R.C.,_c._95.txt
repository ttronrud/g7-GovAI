**Detailed Summary of the Mont-Joli Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Mont-Joli Airport Zoning Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development in the vicinity of Mont-Joli Airport in the Province of Quebec.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulation defines several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Mont-Joli Airport, located in the Parish of Ste-Flavie, County of Rimouski, Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point defined in *Part I of the Schedule*. It serves as a reference for elevation and directional measurements. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the end of each runway strip (strip), perpendicular to its centerline. It is detailed in *Part III of the Schedule*. This surface defines the maximum allowable height for structures during aircraft approach. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane above the airport area, defined in *Part IV of the Schedule*. It establishes a maximum elevation limit for structures directly above the airport. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral edges of each runway strip and its associated approach surfaces. Defined in *Part VI of the Schedule*. It provides a buffer zone for structures near the sides of runways. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the landing surface designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (e.g., 06-24 or 16-34). Defined in *Part V of the Schedule*. Each strip has its own approach and transitional surfaces. |

> **Elevation Reference**:  
> The **airport reference point is deemed to be 150 feet above sea level** for all calculations and compliance purposes.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
- All lands **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Mont-Joli Airport**.
- Includes:
  - Public road allowances.
  - Land under part of the **St. Lawrence River**.
- **Exclusions**:  
  Lands that are **formally part of the airport** (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated operational areas) are excluded from this zoning restriction.

---

### **4. Core Prohibition Clause**

**No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on any land (including submerged land) within the regulated zone **if the highest point of such structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Horizontal Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means that all new or modified structures must remain **below or at the same elevation** as the imaginary surfaces defined in the schedules. Any structure exceeding these limits would be in violation of the regulation.

---

### **5. Geographic Description of the Regulated Area**

The boundaries of the land subject to these zoning restrictions are precisely defined by a detailed **legal description** in the regulation, beginning and ending at a specific point. The description uses a **surveyor’s method of bearings and distances**, with astronomical bearings referenced to the centerline of **runway 06-24**.

#### **Key Bearings and Reference Points**
- Bearings are based on **astronomical directions** relative to the centerline of runway 06-24.
- The **airport reference point (ARP)** is located at:
  - 3,686.4 feet above sea level.
  - Located at the intersection of:
    - The centerline of runways 06-24 and 16-34.
    - A line with bearing **North 47°19′ West** from the **westerly corner of lot 425**, Parish of Ste-Flavie.

#### **Boundary Description (Summary)**

The boundary is described in a series of directional segments, forming a closed polygon that encircles the airport and extends into surrounding lands. Key features include:

1. **Starts at the St. Lawrence River’s edge** (intersection of lot line between 123 and 124).
2. Follows the **river’s edge** in a general northeasterly direction to a transitional surface limit of **strip 16-34**.
3. Proceeds along lines defined by specific bearings and distances (e.g., North 44°08′39″ West) to reach 6,760 feet from the end of runway 16.
4. Moves to a point at 10,000 feet along the **northeasterly extension of runway 24** (bearing South 51°54′00″ East).
5. Returns to the river edge and continues through various lot lines and public roads.
6. Traverses through several numbered lots, including:
   - Lots 442 to 438 (southwestward)
   - Lots 469, 475–476, 546 (railway terminal areas)
   - Lots 490–10–23 and 494–31–13
   - Street boundaries (e.g., Gaboury Boulevard, Jacques-Cartier Boulevard)
7. Ends at the **lot line between lots 123 and 125**, completing a loop back to the **Point of Commencement**.

> The entire parcel is illustrated on **Department of Transport Plan No. M-3800**, dated **May 4, 1972**.

---

### **6. Land Parcel Composition**

The regulated area comprises a large number of **individual lots and parts of lots**, listed in a sequence from P.9 to P.103 and beyond. This includes:

- **Full lots** (e.g., lot 194-1-4, lot 501-21-14)
- **Partial lots** (e.g., 490-10-23, 494-31-13)
- **Special designations** such as:
  - **Public roads** (e.g., Gaboury Boulevard, Jacques-Cartier Boulevard, Price Road)
  - **Railway properties** (e.g., Canada and Gulf Terminal Railways, Canadian National Railways)
  - **Street boundaries** (e.g., 194-1-28, 194-1-30)

> The list includes **over 100 parcels**, indicating a broad and complex area of land subject to the zoning rules.

---

### **7. Regulatory Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing structures that could interfere with aircraft operations.
- **Maintain clear flight paths** during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- **Protect the airport’s operational integrity** by limiting vertical obstructions near runways and approach zones.
- **Provide a legally enforceable boundary** for land use, particularly in areas adjacent to the airport and along the St. Lawrence River.

---

### **8. Important Notes and Context**

- **Revocation Note**:  
  The term "Minister" appears in the regulation but is **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**. This suggests that the original authority or oversight body for the regulation has been replaced or removed, and the regulation may now be administered under a different legal framework or body.

- **No Development Beyond Surfaces**:  
  Even minor additions (e.g., rooftop extensions, antennas, or signage) are prohibited if they exceed any of the three defined surfaces.

- **Elevation is Critical**:  
  The 150-foot reference point is crucial for all height calculations. Structures must be evaluated at their **highest point relative to the local surface** and compared to the approach, horizontal, and transitional surfaces.

- **Public Roads and Railways Are Included**:  
  Even land used for roads or railways (if adjacent to the airport) is subject to these restrictions if it lies within the defined boundary.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, such regulations are typically enforced by:
- The **Ministry of Transport** or **Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing** in Quebec.
- Local municipalities or regional planning authorities.
- Through **building permits**, **development applications**, and **site inspections**.

Violations may result in:
- Fines
- Orders to remove or modify structures
- Legal action under provincial zoning laws

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Mont-Joli Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to protect aviation safety by restricting vertical development near Mont-Joli Airport. By defining specific **approach, horizontal, and transitional surfaces**, and applying them to a **detailed geographic boundary**, the regulation ensures that no structure — new or existing — will interfere with aircraft operations.

It is a critical piece of **aviation-related land-use regulation**, combining **geographic precision**, **engineering principles**, and **public safety objectives**. The inclusion of railway and road properties underscores its broad application across the surrounding region.

---

**In essence**:  
> These regulations prevent any structure from rising above the legally defined "safe height" zones around Mont-Joli Airport — ensuring safe aircraft approaches, landings, and takeoffs — and apply to a large, precisely mapped area of land and water adjacent to the airport.
