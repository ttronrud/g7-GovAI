## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations**

### 🔍 **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

The **Vessel Pollution and Dangerous Chemicals Regulations** (S.C. 2005, c. 29, s. 16(1)) are a set of Canadian regulations designed to **prevent pollution from ships** and to **ensure safe handling of dangerous chemicals** at sea and in Canadian waters.

These regulations:

- **Supplement and complement** existing international standards, particularly:
  - The **International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), 1973**, and its **1978 Protocol and 1997 Protocol**.
  - The **International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001 (Anti-Fouling Systems Convention)**.
- Are enacted under specific powers in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, including:
  - **Subsection 7(2)** – Authority to make regulations for the safety and pollution prevention of vessels.
  - **Subsection 35(1)a** – Authority to regulate pollution prevention.
  - **Subsection 120(1) and (2)** – Authority to regulate pollution control and hazardous substances.
  - **Paragraph 182(a)** – Authority to regulate pollution from vessels.
  - **Section 190** – Authority to regulate pollution from vessels carrying dangerous chemicals.
  - **Paragraphs 207(2)(a) and 244(a)** – Authority to regulate the handling and discharge of hazardous substances.

> ✅ **Key Objective**: To ensure that Canadian vessels and operations comply with both international standards and national environmental protection goals, particularly in preventing marine pollution from oil, chemicals, waste, and emissions.
