**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

This regulation establishes the official designation and administrative transfer of specific public lands in the province of Quebec to the **Minister of the Environment** for the purposes of **wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation**.

The authority for this action is derived from **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**, which empowers the **Governor General in Council** (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to assign public lands to the Minister for the protection and management of wildlife.

The Governor General in Council has determined, based on scientific and environmental assessments, that the lands described in the schedule are essential for:
- Conducting wildlife research,
- Protecting and conserving wildlife habitats,
- Providing public interpretation and educational opportunities related to wildlife and natural ecosystems.

The area designated under this regulation is the **Baie de l’Isle-Verte National Wildlife Area**, located in:
- The **Province of Quebec**
- The **County of Temiscouata**
- The **Parish of St-Jean-Baptiste de l’Isle-Verte**

This area is not a park or protected area in the traditional sense, but a **National Wildlife Area (NWA)** — a category of protected land established under the Canada Wildlife Act to safeguard critical habitats for native species and support ecological functions.
