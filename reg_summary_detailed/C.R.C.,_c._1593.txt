**Detailed Summary of the Regional Advisory Committee Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Regional Advisory Committee Regulations*  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Regional Advisory Committee Regulations*.

---

**Key Definitions:**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Veterans’ Land Act* (Loi). This is the primary legislation under which the regional advisory committees operate. The regulations are designed to implement provisions of this Act, particularly those relating to the establishment, structure, and functioning of regional advisory committees.

- **Committee**: A *regional advisory committee* established under **Section 44 of the Veterans’ Land Act**. These committees are responsible for providing advisory input on matters related to veterans’ land rights, access, and management within their respective regions.

- **Director**: Refers to *The Director of the Veterans’ Land Act*, who is the administrative head responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act and the operations of the committees.

---

**Structure and Composition of a Committee:**

- A regional advisory committee shall consist of **exactly three members**.  
  This fixed composition ensures a manageable and focused advisory body, capable of making timely and informed recommendations.

---

**Chairmanship of the Committee:**

- The **Chairman** of a Committee is an **officer of the Director** appointed by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal or provincial cabinet-level authority).  
  This appointment process ensures that the Chairman is a senior, qualified official with administrative authority and accountability.

- The Chairman may, **with the approval of the Director**, act as the Chairman of **any other regional advisory committee** in the event that:
  - The regular Chairman of that committee is absent, or  
  - The Chairman is unable to perform their duties due to illness, personal reasons, or other impediments.

  This provision enhances operational flexibility and ensures continuity of committee functions, especially during absences or emergencies.

---

**Quorum Requirements:**

- A **quorum** for a Committee meeting is constituted by:
  - The **Chairman or acting chairman**, **plus one other member**.

  This means a minimum of two individuals must be present for a meeting to be valid and for decisions to be legally binding. It ensures that meetings are not held without sufficient representation and that decisions are made with adequate participation.

---

**Remuneration and Compensation:**

- **Chairman**:
  - The Chairman **receives no salary or additional remuneration** beyond the salary or compensation they receive as an employee of the Director.
  - This reflects the expectation that the Chairman is already compensated through their official government employment and does not require separate payment for serving as committee chair.

- **Other Members (non-Chairman)**:
  - Each member (excluding the Chairman) is entitled to the following compensation:
    1. **$10 per half day or portion thereof** during which the Committee meets.  
       (Example: If a meeting lasts 3 hours, the member is paid $10 × 2 = $20, as 3 hours = 2 half-days.)
    2. **$10 per half day or portion thereof** for travel time to and from meetings.  
       (This covers the time spent traveling to and from the meeting location, ensuring members are fairly compensated for logistical demands.)
    3. **Actual and reasonable disbursements** incurred in the performance of their duties.  
       (This includes expenses such as printing, postage, research, or other necessary costs directly related to committee work.)

  These compensation terms are designed to:
  - Recognize the time and effort of committee members,
  - Provide financial support for travel and administrative costs,
  - Ensure fairness and consistency in remuneration across members.

**Key Principles and Implications:**

1. **Administrative Oversight**: The Director and Governor in Council maintain strong oversight, ensuring accountability and alignment with the Veterans’ Land Act.

2. **Flexibility in Leadership**: The ability of the Chairman to act in multiple committees ensures continuity and avoids disruptions in advisory functions.

3. **Cost-Effective Operation**: The regulations avoid creating a large or expensive committee structure by limiting membership to three and providing modest, needs-based compensation.

4. **Fair Compensation**: The compensation structure is reasonable and proportional to the time and effort required, with clear rules for travel and expenses.

5. **Quorum Protection**: The quorum requirement (two members) ensures that decisions are made with proper representation and reduces the risk of invalid or unrepresentative meetings.

---

**Overall Purpose:**

These Regulations establish a clear, transparent, and efficient framework for the operation of regional advisory committees under the Veterans’ Land Act. They ensure that:
- Veterans’ land matters are reviewed by qualified, representative individuals,
- Committees function effectively with minimal administrative burden,
- Members are fairly compensated for their time and expenses,
- Leadership is stable and responsive to operational needs.

This regulatory framework supports the Act’s objective of providing equitable and accessible land benefits to veterans through well-structured, accountable advisory bodies.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Regional Advisory Committee Regulations* provide a balanced, practical, and accountable structure for regional advisory bodies. They emphasize administrative efficiency, fair compensation, and operational continuity while remaining aligned with the broader goals of the *Veterans’ Land Act*.
