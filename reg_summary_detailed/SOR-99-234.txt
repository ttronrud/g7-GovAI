**Effective Date:**  
The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means their legal effect begins immediately upon official publication, allowing customs authorities to begin applying the designated country list for tariff purposes without delay.

**Key Implications:**

- **Customs Treatment:** Goods imported from these designated countries will be subject to the tariff rate and rules associated with **Tariff Item 9810.00.00**. This may include specific duties, exemptions, or simplified procedures depending on the nature of the item.
  
- **Trade Facilitation:** The designation streamlines customs processing by clearly defining which countries are eligible for this classification, reducing ambiguity and administrative burden for importers and customs officials.

- **Compliance and Enforcement:** The regulation ensures that only imports from the listed countries qualify for the treatment under this tariff item. Imports from non-designated countries would be subject to different tariff classifications or treatment, potentially leading to higher duties or additional scrutiny.

- **Geopolitical and Economic Considerations:** The inclusion of countries such as Japan, Germany (implied via EU countries), and several African and Asian nations suggests a focus on trade with emerging and established economies, possibly reflecting strategic trade relationships or regional economic integration efforts.

**Context and Background:**  
This regulation was issued in **1997** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), indicating it is part of a long-standing framework of tariff classifications and country-specific designations used by Canada to manage international trade. The reference to "1999–1" in the tariff item may reflect a version or update of the tariff schedule for the year 1999.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal list of countries that are eligible for the tariff treatment under **Item 9810.00.00** of the Canadian Customs Tariff. It serves as a critical tool for customs administration, ensuring clarity, consistency, and compliance in the classification and valuation of imported goods. By designating these 57 countries, the Canadian government enables a more efficient and predictable trade environment for imports originating from these nations. The regulation is legally binding and takes effect upon registration in the Canada Gazette.
