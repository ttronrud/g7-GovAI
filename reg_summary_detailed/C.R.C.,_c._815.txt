The regulation you provided appears to be a **repealed or revoked version** of a former Canadian fisheries regulation, specifically from the *Coastal Fisheries Protection Regulations* (SOR/82-771, SOR/93-62, etc.), and is **no longer in force**. This is clearly indicated by multiple references to **"Revoked"** or **"Repealed"** throughout the text.

### 📌 1. **Definitions and Key Terms**

The regulation begins with a series of definitions used throughout the text. Many of these terms have been **revoked or replaced** due to changes in policy, technology, or governance:

| Term | Meaning | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Blackcod trap/pot**, **sablefish trap/pot**, **purse seine net**, **set-line**, **statistical area**, **authorized topside chafer**, **extension measure**, **quota**, **quota period**, **quota table**, **Regional Director-General** | Various fishing gear, species, or administrative terms | ❌ **Revoked** |
| **Cod-end** | Bag-like extension of a trawl net to retain catch | Still used in modern terms, but not defined here |
| **Midwater trawl** | Trawl that does not touch the seabed | Still relevant concept |
| **Mesh size** | Measured by wedge gauge (trawl) or diagonal distance (other nets) | Definition preserved |
| **Fishing Zone 3, 4, 5, 6** | Specific geographic zones in Canadian waters | Still relevant in current system |
| **Flag state** | Country where a foreign vessel is registered | Still in use |
| **Foreign fishing vessel** | Vessel not engaged in scientific research | Still in use |
| **Stock area** | Area where a fish population is managed | Still in use |
| **Subarea / Subdivision / Sub-Zone** | Geographic subdivisions for management | Still in use |
| **Length (swordfish)** | From lower jaw to tail fork | Specific to swordfish |
| **Year** | Calendar year | Still used |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Many definitions were revoked (e.g., "finfish", "incidental catch", "quota") because they were outdated or superseded by more modern regulations.

### 📌 2. **Scope of Application**

#### Applies to:
- Foreign fishing vessels (not engaged exclusively in scientific research)
- Crew members, employees, or those attached to such vessels

> ✅ Applies to **Canadian fisheries waters adjacent to the Atlantic coast** (Part I)  
> ✅ Also applies to **Pacific coast waters** (Part II)

---

### 📌 3. **Prohibited Fishing Activities (Prohibition by Time, Location, Species)**

#### A. **Close Time Restrictions (by Flag State and Stock Area)**
- No person on board a foreign vessel from a flag state listed in **Schedule II (Atlantic)** may fish for species listed in **Schedule X** in a **specific stock area** during the **close time** specified in that schedule.
- Each **flag state has its own close time** — meaning restrictions are **not uniform** across all foreign vessels.
- Example: A vessel from Norway may be banned from fishing for a certain species in a specific zone during winter months, while a vessel from Japan may have different restrictions.

> 🔍 This is a **targeted conservation measure** to protect vulnerable stocks during spawning or migration periods.

#### B. **Prohibitions on Squid Jigger Fishing**
- **No squid jigger fishing** in:
  - **Subarea 3**: December 30 – December 31
  - **Subarea 4**: December 30 – December 31  
> (Likely to protect spawning or seasonal squid populations)

#### C. **Prohibitions on Trawl Net Use for Certain Species**
- In **Division 4VWX**, **no trawling for squid, silver hake, or Argentine** unless within a defined portion bounded by specific coordinates.

> This restricts fishing to **only safe, sustainable zones** to prevent overfishing in sensitive areas.

---

### 📌 4. **Incidental Catch Limits**

#### General Rule:
- If a person is fishing for one species, they may retain an **incidental catch** of another species **only if**:
  - The quantity does **not exceed** a defined **fishing quota**.
  - The quota varies by species and location.

| Species | Quota Limit |
|--------|-------------|
| Haddock | 1% of total weight in Division 4VW, 4X, or Subarea 5 |
| Cod (in Division 4X) | 1% |
| Other species (not listed) | 10% |

> ❗ **Exception**: If the vessel has a valid **annual fishing plan** (issued by the Minister), and the fishing days have not been fully utilized, **section 9 does not apply** — meaning incidental catch limits are waived.

> This encourages **efficient use of fishing days** and prevents overfishing in underutilized zones.

---

### 📌 5. **Minimum Size and Weight Limits (for Protection of Juveniles)**

| Species | Minimum Size/Weight | Exception |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Swordfish** | Must be **≥125 cm** in length | If caught **incidentally** while targeting larger swordfish, up to **15% of longer swordfish** may be retained |
| **Bigeye tuna** | Must weigh **≥3.2 kg** | Incidental catch allowed up to **15% of larger fish** |
| **Yellowfin tuna** | Must weigh **≥3.2 kg** | Incidental catch allowed up to **15% of larger fish** |
| **Bluefin tuna** | Must weigh **≥30 kg** | No exception provided |

> These rules are designed to **protect breeding stock** and ensure sustainable harvests.

---

### 📌 6. **Gear Restrictions (by Species and Zone)**

#### Pacific Hake (in Sub-Zones 5-1 and 5-2):
- Incidental catch limits:
  - **No more than 20% of total Pacific hake weight**
  - Walleye pollock: ≤10%
  - Rockfish: ≤2%
  - Pacific cod & ling cod: ≤1%
  - Sablefish: ≤1%

> Prevents bycatch of non-target species and protects vulnerable populations.

#### Trawl Net Mesh Size Requirements:
- **Pacific hake trawls**:
  - Cod-end: **76 mm to 100 mm**
  - Other parts: **≥89 mm**
- **All other species**:
  - Trawls must have **≥89 mm mesh** in all parts

> These mesh sizes help **avoid catching juvenile fish**, reducing mortality in early life stages.

---

### 📌 7. **Inspection and Equipment Compliance**

#### Fishery Officers May:
- **Place numbered marks/seals** on inspected gear
- **Issue a certificate of inspection** if gear is in compliance
- **Seals must not be removed or tampered with** while vessel is in Canadian waters

> This ensures **transparency, accountability, and compliance** with gear standards.

---

### 📌 8. **Vessel and Gear Separation Requirements**

- A foreign vessel must maintain a **minimum distance of 1/2 nautical mile** between:
  - Its own vessel
  - Any attached gear or equipment
  - Any **set fishing gear** (defined as gear anchored, drifting, or attached to vessel)

> Prevents **accidental collisions**, **gear entanglement**, and **interference with navigation**.

---

### 📌 9. **Geographic Definitions (Sub-Zones in Pacific Fisheries)**

#### Sub-Zone 5-1A:
- East of a line from:
  - 49°00′N, 126°15′W → 48°30′N, 125°55′W → intersects outer perimeter of Fishing Zone 5 at 48°21.2′N, 125°20.85′W

#### Sub-Zone 5-1B:
- West of 5-1A, east of a line from:
  - 49°00′N, 126°15′W → 48°30′N, 126°00′W → south to outer perimeter of Fishing Zone 5

#### Sub-Zone 5-2:
- South of 49°23′N latitude, **excluding** Sub-Zone 5-1

> These precise boundaries allow **zone-specific management** of fish stocks in the Pacific.

1. **Protect vulnerable fish stocks** through time-based closures and size/weight limits.
2. **Prevent overfishing** via gear restrictions (mesh size, gear type).
3.
