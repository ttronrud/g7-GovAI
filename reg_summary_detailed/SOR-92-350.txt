**Detailed Summary of the *Protection of Assets (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*, S.C. 1991, c. 45**

---

### **Overview**

On the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and pursuant to paragraph 531(g) of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, His Excellency the Governor General in Council has revoked two previous regulations—  
- *Protection of Securities (Loan Companies) Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1031*  
- *Protection of Securities (Trust Companies) Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1568*  

In their place, the **Protection of Assets (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations** have been enacted to provide a modern, comprehensive, and more effective framework for the protection and maintenance of assets held or owned by trust and loan companies. These regulations aim to enhance accountability, security, and transparency in how such companies manage their financial assets.

The new regulations are designed to ensure that trust and loan companies safeguard their assets against loss, fraud, theft, and destruction, while also aligning with international best practices and legal obligations.

  - **Bond**: A contract of insurance under which one party agrees to indemnify another for losses arising from the act of a third party (e.g., dishonest or criminal acts by employees).

  - **Security**: A negotiable security (such as shares, bonds, or debentures) **owned or held by the company**, or held **in trust** by the company.  
    → *Excludes securities issued by the company itself.*

### **Applicability and Exemptions**

These regulations **do not apply** in the following circumstances:

1. **Jurisdictional Compliance**:  
   If a company is operating in a jurisdiction and is complying with local laws that are **inconsistent** with these regulations — the local law prevails in that regard.

2. **Estate or Trust Administration**:  
   To the extent that the regulations conflict with:
   - A legal duty imposed on the company in administering an estate or trust; or  
   - The company’s responsibilities as an agent (e.g., acting on behalf of a client or beneficiary).

> This ensures flexibility in cases where statutory duties in other jurisdictions or fiduciary roles require different handling of assets.

---

### **Core Obligations of Companies**

#### 1. **Asset Handling Procedures**
- A company must **maintain a written record** outlining the procedures for handling and safeguarding its assets.
- This record must be **shared with all directors, officers, employees, and agents** who have access to or involvement in managing these assets.

> Purpose: Ensures transparency, accountability, and consistency in asset management practices across the organization.

#### 2. **Complete Security Register**
- The company must maintain an **up-to-date record** identifying every security it owns or holds.

> This enables auditability and traceability, reducing the risk of loss or mismanagement.

#### 3. **Secure Custody of Securities**
- **General Rule**: Every security must be kept securely, preventing unauthorized access, and in the custody of:
  - The company itself; or  
  - An entity authorized by law to act as a **custodian of securities**, **depository**, or **clearing agency** in the jurisdiction where it operates.

> *Exception (Subsection Exception)*:
- Does **not apply** to:
  - Securities under government control (e.g., government-issued securities);
  - Securities pledged as collateral;
  - Securities loaned under a written agreement;
  - Securities in transit.

> **Requirement for Custodial Agreements**:  
A company **must enter into a written custodial agreement** before placing any security with a third-party custodian (e.g., a depository or clearing house).

#### 4. **Daily Deposit of Net Proceeds from Security Transactions**
- On a **daily basis**, any net proceeds from a security transaction (e.g., sale or redemption) must be deposited into one of the following:
  - An account held by the company;
  - A **financial institution authorized** to accept deposits in the jurisdiction where it operates;
  - A **trust company authorized** to hold money in trust in that jurisdiction;
  - The **government** of the jurisdiction where the company operates, or an agency thereof (e.g., a government securities custodian);
  - **CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.** (a recognized clearing and depository service provider).

> This ensures liquidity is not left unsecured and reduces exposure to misappropriation or fraud.

#### 5. **Registration of Securities**
- Generally, every security must be **registered in the company’s name** in the register of the issuing entity.

> *Exceptions*:
- If registration is **impossible due to circumstances beyond the company’s control**;
- If the security is under government control;
- If held as **collateral or for safekeeping**;
- If registered in the name of a **nominee** (e.g., a third party designated by the company);
- If held under a **book-entry, certificateless, or immobilization system** (e.g., electronic systems where physical certificates are not used);
- If temporarily held by an agent, liquidator, trustee, or issuer for purposes such as reorganization, amalgamation, or voting.

> This exception recognizes technological and operational realities in modern financial systems.

#### 6. **Flexible Holding of Securities (Where Protection is Sufficient)**
If a security is **adequately protected** against loss, fraud, theft, or destruction, the company may:
- Hold it in **bearer form** (i.e., without registration to a named owner); or  
- Hold it in **registered form in a name other than the company’s name** (e.g., in the name of a nominee).

> This allows flexibility when physical or administrative protection is sufficient, but only where risks are demonstrably mitigated.

---

### **Insurance Requirements**

#### 1. **Insurance Against Dishonest or Criminal Acts**
- The company must **acquire and maintain** at least one **bond** (insurance policy) issued by an entity authorized to insure risks under the laws of the jurisdiction where it operates.
- This bond must indemnify the company for **losses arising from dishonest or criminal acts** by its officers or employees.

> Purpose: Protects against internal fraud, embezzlement, or misconduct.

#### 2. **General Insurance Against Physical Loss or Damage**
- The company must also maintain **insurance policies** covering:
  - Damage to, destruction of, or mysterious disappearance of assets;
  - Any other usual contingency (e.g., fire, natural disaster, theft).

> Purpose: Covers both physical and operational risks to assets.

#### 3. **Non-Cancellation Clause (30-Day Notice Requirement)**
- Any bond or insurance policy acquired under these regulations **cannot be cancelled or terminated** until **at least 30 days** after:
  - The insurer or insured receives a **written notice** from the Superintendent of the Trust and Loan Companies (or relevant regulatory authority) of its intention to cancel or terminate the policy.

> This provides regulatory oversight and prevents abrupt termination of critical protections.

#### 4. **Determining Insurance Amounts**
- The required amount of insurance must be established by the company’s **directors**, based on:
  - The **nature and value** of the assets owned or held;
  - The **procedures and safeguards** in place for handling and protecting those assets;
  - Any other factors that could influence the potential loss (e.g., risk profile, geographic exposure).

> Ensures insurance is proportionate and relevant to actual risk exposure.
