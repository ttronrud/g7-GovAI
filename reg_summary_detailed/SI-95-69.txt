**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, outlines a formal transfer of specific governmental responsibilities and functions between two federal ministers in Canada. Here is a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Issuing Authority**
- **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**: This is the formal title used for the executive branch of the Canadian government when acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. It signifies that the decision is made by the federal government, in accordance with constitutional conventions and legislative authority.
- **On the recommendation of the Prime Minister**: The transfer was not initiated independently but was proposed and endorsed by the Prime Minister, indicating that it was a politically and administratively sound decision within the government’s policy framework.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision allows the government to reassign powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers, typically to improve efficiency, streamline operations, or align with broader policy goals.

---

### **3. Date of Effectiveness**
- The transfer takes effect on **June 2, 1995**. This is a key administrative date, marking when the new minister (Minister of Finance) assumes responsibility for the specified functions.

---

### **4. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**
- The powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** are being transferred in respect of **one specific program**:
  - **The Transfer Payments to the Territorial Governments Program**.
- This program is specifically referenced in:
  - **Indian Affairs and Northern Development Vote 50** of the **Appropriation Act No. 1, 1995–96**.
  - This vote is part of the annual federal budget and appropriations process, meaning the program is formally funded and designated under the ministry’s budgetary allocation.

---

### **5. Program Description**
- The **Transfer Payments to the Territorial Governments Program** involves the federal government providing financial support to the three Canadian territories (Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon) to enable them to carry out their administrative and service delivery functions.
- The transfer of responsibility includes the **administration** of this program — meaning the Minister of Finance will now be responsible for:
  - Managing the funding disbursements,
  - Monitoring compliance,
  - Ensuring proper use of funds,
  - Reporting on program performance,
  - And implementing any policy or procedural changes related to the program.

---

### **6. Implications of the Transfer**
- **Shift in Responsibility**: The Minister of Finance (a key economic and financial minister) now oversees the financial administration of a program traditionally managed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, which historically dealt with Indigenous affairs and northern development.
- **Policy Integration**: This move likely reflects a broader government strategy to integrate financial oversight of territorial funding into the central finance ministry, potentially improving accountability, transparency, and alignment with national fiscal policy.
- **Continuity of Service**: Despite the change in administrative oversight, the program itself continues to operate without disruption. The core funding and support to the territories remain unchanged.

---

### **7. Context and Rationale (Implied)**
- While not explicitly stated in the regulation, such a transfer may be motivated by:
  - A desire to centralize financial management of federal transfers.
  - A need for greater fiscal discipline or audit oversight.
  - A shift in government priorities toward economic and financial efficiency.
  - A recognition that territorial funding is a financial matter that aligns more closely with the responsibilities of the Minister of Finance.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a formal administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. On **June 2, 1995**, the **Minister of Finance** assumes administrative responsibility for the **Transfer Payments to the Territorial Governments Program**, previously under the purview of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This transfer is legally grounded in the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act and is specific to the funding mechanism outlined in Vote 50 of the 1995–96 Appropriation Act. The change enhances financial oversight and reflects a strategic reallocation of ministerial responsibilities to improve governance and fiscal accountability.

**Note**: This regulation does not alter the program’s funding, eligibility, or objectives — only the administrative oversight and reporting responsibilities. The program remains a vital component of federal support to Canada’s territorial governments.
