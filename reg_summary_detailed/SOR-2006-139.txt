**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulatory instrument is a **formal rescission** of a prior decision by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) regarding pilotage tariffs for the **Laurentian Pilotage Authority (LPA)**. The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Canada Transportation Act** and is grounded in specific provisions of the **Pilotage Act**.

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

- **Section 40 of the Canada Transportation Act**:  
  This section empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial advice) to respond to a petition from a Pilotage Authority to rescind a prior decision made by the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA). In this case, the **Laurentian Pilotage Authority** has formally petitioned the Governor in Council to **rescind Decision No. 618-W-2005**, which had previously set pilotage tariff rates for the LPA.

- **Section 33 of the Pilotage Act (S.C. 1998, c. 10, s. 149)**:  
  This provision establishes that a Pilotage Authority must, with the approval of the Governor in Council, adopt regulations that set pilotage charges. These tariffs must:
  - Be **fair and reasonable**;
  - Permit the Authority to operate on a **self-sustaining financial basis**;
  - Be approved by the Governor in Council.

This legal framework ensures that pilotage charges are both financially viable for the Authority and in the public interest.

### **2. Key Facts and Context**

- The **Laurentian Pilotage Authority** (LPA) published proposed tariff increases in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 5, 2005**.
- These increases came into effect on **July 1, 2005** (as noted in SOR/2005-162).
- The CTA had previously issued **Decision No. 618-W-2005** on **October 14, 2005**, which likely reviewed or challenged these proposed tariff increases, possibly finding them excessive or contrary to public interest.

- The **Governor in Council** has now determined that:
  - The **tariff increases** implemented by the LPA on July 1, 2005, are **not prejudicial to the public interest**.
  - This assessment is based on a review of the financial sustainability of the LPA, the fairness of the charges, and their impact on shipping operations, safety, and the broader maritime economy.

### **3. Action Taken**

- On the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities**, the **Governor in Council** has officially:
  - **Rescinded Decision No. 618-W-2005** of the Canadian Transportation Agency.
  - This means that the prior CTA decision—likely a rejection or modification of the LPA’s tariff proposal—is **officially canceled**.

- By rescinding this decision, the federal government **validates the LPA’s tariff structure** as set in force on July 1, 2005, under the authority of section 33 of the Pilotage Act.

### **4. Significance and Implications**

- **Financial Viability**: The LPA is now permitted to operate without the financial constraints imposed by a prior CTA decision, allowing it to maintain services at a level that supports its operational needs.

- **Public Interest**: The government has concluded that the tariff increases do not harm the public interest. This includes considerations such as:
  - Fairness to shipping operators;
  - Safety and efficiency of maritime navigation;
  - Cost-effectiveness for commercial vessels;
  - Avoidance of undue financial burden on users.

- **Regulatory Clarity**: The rescission provides legal certainty to the LPA and stakeholders, affirming that the tariff structure is acceptable and enforceable.

- **Administrative Efficiency**: It streamlines the regulatory process by removing an outdated or conflicting CTA decision, allowing the LPA to continue operating under its approved, self-sustaining tariff regime.

### **5. Legal Authority and Process**

- The decision is issued under the **Canada Transportation Act**, specifically **section 40**, which allows for the Governor in Council to act on a petition from a Pilotage Authority to rescind a CTA decision.
- The Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities provides the **recommendation**, ensuring that the decision is made with appropriate policy and operational input.
- The Governor in Council acts as the **final decision-maker**, exercising its authority to balance public interest, financial sustainability, and regulatory consistency.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **legally sound and policy-aligned decision** to **remove a prior CTA ruling** that had challenged the Laurentian Pilotage Authority’s tariff increases. Based on the assessment that the increases are fair, reasonable, and financially sustainable, the federal government has affirmed the LPA’s ability to operate independently under its current tariff structure. This action supports the efficient functioning of Canada’s inland waterway system while upholding the principles of fairness, transparency, and public interest enshrined in the Pilotage Act and Canada Transportation Act.
