The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2009-230, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2009-230, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
  
  The provision previously existed as a rule or statute under a prior regulation, but it is no longer in force. The repeal was enacted through **Supplemental Order 2009-230**, specifically under **section 1** of that order.

- **SOR/2009-230**:  
  This stands for *Statutory Instrument of 2009, No. 230*, a formal amendment or correction order issued by the Government of Canada. Such instruments are used to update, modify, or repeal existing regulations in a legal or administrative framework.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2009-230**:  
  This section explicitly **repeals** one or more prior regulations or provisions. In this case, the repeated references suggest that the regulation in question was one of several that were formally canceled. The exact name or subject matter of the repealed regulation is not provided in your input, but the repealing instrument (SOR/2009-230, s. 1) confirms its legal termination.

- **Implications of Repeal**:
  - The regulation is **no longer enforceable**.
  - Any legal or administrative actions based on it are **invalid**.
  - The repeal may have been due to:
    - Obsolescence (e.g., outdated or redundant rules),
    - Inconsistency with newer legislation,
    - A change in policy or administrative structure,
    - Merger with another regulation,
    - Or as part of a broader regulatory modernization effort.

- **Public Access and Legal Effect**:
  - Repealed regulations are typically archived in official databases (e.g., CanLII, the Canadian government’s legislation website).
  - Legal professionals and institutions will no longer cite or apply the repealed provision.
  - The repeal is binding and takes effect as of the date of the SOR (which is the date of publication — typically in 2009).
