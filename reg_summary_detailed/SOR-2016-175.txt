## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Product** | Any item that: <br> - Is made of ceramic or glass (completely or partially); <br> - Has a coating, glaze, or decoration containing lead or cadmium; <br> - Is reasonably foreseeable to be used for storing, preparing, or serving food (as defined in Section 2 of the *Food and Drugs Act*). |
| **Drinking Vessel** | Any hollowware used for consuming liquids (e.g., mugs, cups, pitchers). |
| **Cup or Mug** | A small hollowware designed for liquid consumption (e.g., coffee mugs). |
| **Hollowware** | Any hollow product with internal depth >25 mm (measured from lowest interior point to overflow plane). |
| **Small Hollowware** | Hollowware with capacity **less than 1.1 L**. |
| **Large Hollowware** | Hollowware with capacity **1.1 L or more**. |
| **Flatware** | Hollowware with internal depth ≤25 mm (e.g., shallow plates, spoons). |
| **Pitcher** | A large hollowware used for storing and dispensing liquids — **excludes** creamers, coffee pots, or teapots. |
| **Permanent Warning** | A warning that remains legible throughout the product’s lifetime under normal use and cleaning conditions. |

## 🚨 Core Regulatory Provisions

### 1. **Lead and Cadmium Migratable Limits (General Rule)**

> Applies to **products in specific categories** listed in a table (not shown here, but referenced in the regulation).

- **Testing Method**: As per the **ISO 6486-1:2019** standard (test for lead and cadmium release from ceramic/glassware in contact with food).
- **Limit Requirements**:
  - The product must **not release lead in excess of the migratable limit** (column 2 of the table).
  - The product must **not release cadmium in excess of the migratable limit** (column 3 of the table).
- **Scope**: Applies to all **products in designated categories** (e.g., mugs, cups, bowls, pitchers) when tested using the ISO method.

> ⚠️ *Note: The actual numerical limits are not included in the text provided, but would typically be found in the table referenced in the regulation (e.g., 0.1 mg/L for lead in small items, 0.05 mg/L for cadmium).*

### 2. **Special Rule for Drinking Vessels with Decorative Patterns Near the Rim**

> Applies to any drinking vessel with a **distinctive exterior decorative pattern within 20 mm of the rim**.

- **Testing Method**: Based on **ASTM C927-80 (2019)e1**, which specifically tests the rim and lip areas of glass tumblers with ceramic glazes.
- **Migratable Limits**:
  - **Lead**: Must not exceed **4 mg/L**.
  - **Cadmium**: Must not exceed **0.4 mg/L**.
- **Rationale**: Decorative glazes near the rim are more likely to leach metals into liquids due to contact with food and frequent use.

> ✅ This rule is more stringent than general product limits, reflecting the higher risk of exposure when decorative elements are close to where liquids are consumed.

---

### 3. **Exemptions for Non-Food-Intended Products**

A product **not intended for food use** may exceed the migratable limits **if** one of the following conditions is met:

#### ✅ Condition 1: Design Feature Renders It Unsuitable for Food Use
- The product has a physical feature (e.g., a hole, mounting hook, latch, or open base) that makes it **unsuitable for storing, preparing, or serving food**.
- Example: A decorative vase with a hook for hanging — not meant to hold food.

#### ✅ Condition 2: Permanent Warning is Clearly Displayed
- The product must display, in **English and French**, in **capital letters**, at least **3 mm in height**, a permanent warning stating one of the following:

| Warning Text (Lead/Cadmium) | French Equivalent |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| DANGER! CONTAINS LEAD — CONTIENT DU PLOMB | |
| DO NOT USE FOR FOOD — NE PAS UTILISER POUR LES ALIMENTS | |
| DANGER! CONTAINS CADMIUM — CONTIENT DU CADMIUM | |
| DO NOT USE FOR FOOD — NE PAS UTILISER POUR LES ALIMENTS | |
| DANGER! CONTAINS LEAD AND CADMIUM — CONTIENT DU PLOMB ET DU CADMIUM | |
| DO NOT USE FOR FOOD — NE PAS UTILISER POUR LES ALIMENTS | |

> 🔍 The warning must be:
> - **Permanent** (legible for the entire lifetime of the product),
> - Clearly visible,
> - In both official languages,
> - At least 3 mm in height,
> - Located where it can be easily seen by the consumer.

> ❌ If the product is used for food, even with a warning, it is still subject to the migratable limits.

## 🔬 Testing Methods (Standardized Procedures)

### ✅ Method 1: General Lead/Cadmium Release Test (ISO 6486-1:2019)

Used for most glazed ceramics and glassware (especially large or small hollowware):

1. **Handwash** the product with a **non-acidic detergent**.
2. **Rinse** with distilled water and **air dry**.
3. Fill the product to **within 5 mm of overflow** with a 4% (v/v) **acetic acid solution** in water.
4. Cover with an **inert, opaque lid**.
5. Allow to **stand at 22 ± 2°C for 24 hours**.
6. **Stir** the solution to ensure homogeneity (without abrading the surface).
7. Take an **aliquot** and analyze within **8 hours** using an analytical method compliant with **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)**.
8. Report results as **mg/L of lead or cadmium in the extraction solution**.

> 🔍 Purpose: Simulates real-world exposure to acidic food or beverages (e.g., lemon juice, wine, acidic drinks).

---

### ✅ Method 2: Rim-Specific Test (ASTM C927-80 (2019)e1)

Used only for **drinking vessels with decorative patterns within 20 mm of the rim**:

1. **Handwash** and air dry the vessel.
2. Measure internal volume (V₂) by filling with distilled water to 5 mm below overflow.
3. Invert the vessel into a container with:
   - Diameter between **1.25× and 2×** the external rim diameter.
4. Add **4% acetic acid solution** to fully submerge the rim by **20 mm**.
   - Record the volume of solution used (V₁).
5. Cover and incubate at **22 ± 2°C for 24 hours**.
6. Remove vessel, stir solution.
7. Take an aliquot and analyze within **8 hours** using a GLP-compliant method.
8. Calculate **concentration relative to internal volume**:

\[
\text{Concentration (mg/L per internal volume)} = \frac{C \times V_1}{V_2}
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = concentration of lead or cadmium (mg/L) in extraction solution,
- \( V_1 \) = volume of extraction solution (mL),
- \( V_2 \) = internal volume of drinking vessel (mL).

> 🔍 Purpose: Focuses on the **high-risk area** (rim) where decorative glazes are applied and where liquid contact occurs.

---

## 📝 Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)

- The analytical techniques used to detect lead and cadmium must comply with the **OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17)**.
- **Key principles** include:
  - Validity and accuracy of data,
  - Proper documentation,
  - Quality control,
  - Traceability,
  - Use of certified reference materials,
  - Calibration of instruments,
  - Personnel training and competence.

> 🔍 Ensures that test results are scientifically reliable and reproducible.
