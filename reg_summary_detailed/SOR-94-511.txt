**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Repeal of the British Columbia Milk Order and Introduction of the British Columbia Milk Marketing Board Order**

---

### **Background and Purpose**
This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, formally **repeals the outdated British Columbia Milk Order (C.R.C., c. 143)** and replaces it with a modern, comprehensive framework that grants the **British Columbia Milk Marketing Board (the "Board")** the legal authority to regulate the **marketing of milk in interprovincial trade and in export markets**.

The repeal was enacted on **April 13, 2001**, under *SOR/2001-16, section 14*, and marks a significant shift in how milk is managed in British Columbia’s agricultural sector. It reflects a move toward aligning milk marketing practices with broader provincial and national agricultural policy frameworks, particularly by transferring control from a specific, outdated order to a more flexible, institutionally based system governed by the **Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act**.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Definitions**
The regulation establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Acts**: Refers to two foundational pieces of legislation:
  - *Milk Industry Act*  
  - *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*  
  These laws provide the legal basis for the Board’s powers and responsibilities.

- **Board**: The **British Columbia Milk Marketing Board**, established under the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*. This body now has expanded regulatory authority over milk marketing beyond local markets.

- **Milk**: Defined as milk or cream from cows produced in British Columbia for **consumer use in liquid form within Canada**. This definition excludes non-consumer uses (e.g., industrial processing) and ensures focus on domestic consumption and trade.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan established and amended over time under the *Acts*. These plans govern pricing, distribution, and other marketing strategies, and are subject to periodic review and adjustment by the Board.

---

#### **2. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Trade**
Under **subsection (1)**, the Board is authorized to regulate the marketing of milk in **interprovincial trade** (i.e., trade between provinces) and in **export trade** (i.e., sale of milk outside Canada).

This authority includes:
- The power to exercise **all or any powers** that the Board currently holds in regulating the **local marketing of milk within British Columbia**, including:
  - Setting prices
  - Establishing marketing standards
  - Managing supply and demand
  - Regulating quality and handling procedures

> This means the Board can apply the same mechanisms used domestically—such as pricing controls, quotas, or quality standards—to ensure fair and stable marketing conditions in interprovincial and export markets.

---

#### **3. Exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission Powers**
A critical limitation is explicitly stated:

> *"The authority to regulate the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade does not include any power that is exercised by the Canadian Dairy Commission under the Canadian Dairy Commission Act in relation to the marketing of milk in interprovincial trade."*

This means:
- The Board **does not** have jurisdiction over functions previously managed by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)**, such as:
  - National pricing mechanisms
  - Federal-level trade agreements
  - National supply and demand balancing
- The CDC retains its own authority under federal law, and the Board operates independently in this domain.

This exclusion ensures that federal and provincial responsibilities remain distinct and avoids overlap or conflict in policy implementation.

---

#### **4. Powers to Impose Levies and Charges**
The Board is granted significant financial and operational powers under **subsection (1)**, specifically:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on:
  - Milk
  - Any component of milk (e.g., butterfat, lactose)
- These levies may be **differently applied** based on the type of producer or marketer, allowing the Board to:
  - Classify producers into groups (e.g., small farms, large dairies, processors)
  - Set **different rates** for different groups

> Example: A small family farm might pay a lower levy than a large dairy operation, reflecting differences in scale and market access.

- **Collect** these levies directly from producers and marketers who are engaged in:
  - Production
  - Marketing (distribution, sale, export)

---

#### **5. Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to buffer against market downturns)
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, marketing campaigns)
- **Covering losses** incurred due to:
  - Poor market conditions
  - Unfavorable pricing
  - Disposal of unsold milk
- **Equalization or adjustment** of income among milk producers:
  - Ensures that producers who earn less due to market fluctuations receive compensation
  - Helps stabilize income and reduce economic risk for farmers

> This mechanism supports **producers' equity**, especially during periods of market volatility, and promotes long-term sustainability in the dairy sector.

---

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Modernization of Milk Marketing**  
   Replacing the old, rigid British Columbia Milk Order with a flexible, board-led system allows for better responsiveness to changing market dynamics, including global trade and evolving consumer preferences.

2. **Provincial Autonomy**  
   The Board operates under provincial legislation (*Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*), giving British Columbia greater control over its dairy marketing strategy without relying on federal frameworks.

3. **Stability for Producers**  
   By enabling income equalization and loss coverage, the regulation provides financial security for dairy farmers, particularly small and medium-sized producers who are vulnerable to price swings.

4. **Clarity in Jurisdiction**  
   The explicit exclusion of Canadian Dairy Commission powers prevents duplication and ensures that national and provincial roles remain clearly defined.

5. **Support for Export Markets**  
   The ability to regulate export trade gives British Columbia a structured approach to selling milk abroad, helping maintain quality standards and market access.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a pivotal reform in British Columbia’s agricultural policy. By repealing the outdated British Columbia Milk Order and empowering the **British Columbia Milk Marketing Board**, it creates a more adaptable, equitable, and market-responsive system for managing milk in interprovincial and export trade.

It balances **provincial self-governance** with **financial stability for producers**, while respecting federal responsibilities. The framework ensures that milk marketing remains fair, transparent, and sustainable—critical components for the long-term health of Canada’s dairy industry.

> **Note**: This regulation is now **repealed** as of April 13, 2001, under *SOR/2001-16, section 14*. However, its principles and structure may have been incorporated into later regulatory frameworks or replaced by updated legislation. For current status, further consultation with the BC government or the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act* is recommended.
