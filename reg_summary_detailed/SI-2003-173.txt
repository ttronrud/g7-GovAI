## 📝 **Major Amendments to the Agreement**

### ✅ **Article 1: Coverage and Legislative Reference**
- **Change to (1)(a)**:  
  Replaces “the territory in which the legislation specified in Article 2(1)(a) applies” with **“the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany”**.  
  → Clarifies that German legislation applies only within Germany’s current territorial boundaries.

- **Change to (1)(d)**:  
  Updates references from “Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs” to **“Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs”** in both English and German (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Sozialordnung).  
  → Reflects the formal restructuring of German government institutions post-reunification.

---

### ✅ **Article 2: Pension Coverage and Legal Application**
- **Deletes and replaces (1)(a)**:  
  Restructures coverage to include only specific German pension schemes:
  - **Pension Insurance (Rentenversicherung)**  
  - **Steelworkers’ Supplementary Insurance (Hüttenknappschaftliche Zusatzversicherung)**  
  - **Farmers’ Old Age Security (Alterssicherung der Landwirte)**  
  → Limits scope to relevant, core social insurance programs.

- **Adds new Paragraph (3)**:  
  > *"Subject to point 2(d) of the Final Protocol, this Agreement shall also apply to laws and regulations which amend, supplement, consolidate or supersede the legislation specified in subparagraphs (1)(a) and (b)."*  
  → Ensures the Agreement remains relevant even as German law evolves through amendments.

---

### ✅ **Article 11: Spouse and Common-Law Partner Status**
- **Replaces “spouse” with “spouse or common-law partner”**.  
- **Replaces “during any period of residence” with “during any period of presence or residence”**.  
  → Broadens recognition of non-marital relationships and reflects modern family structures.

---

### ✅ **Article 13: Pension Calculation and Benefit Eligibility**
- **Deletes subparagraphs (c) to (g)** and replaces with new provisions:
  - **Earnings points** are calculated **solely based on periods of coverage under German legislation**.
  - **Reference periods** (for mandatory contributions) are extended by:
    - Periods of receiving **Canadian invalidity or old-age pensions**  
    - Periods of **sickness, unemployment, or industrial injury benefits** in Canada  
    - Periods of **child raising in Canada**  
  - For **self-employed craftsmen**, periods of coverage under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** are counted toward exemption thresholds.

> ⚖️ **Significance**: Allows Canadian residents who worked in Germany and later received benefits in Canada to have those periods counted toward pension eligibility — improving fairness and reciprocity.

---

### ✅ **Article 14: Residency and Old Age Security (OAS) Eligibility**
- **Replaces old eligibility rules** with new, more flexible criteria:
  - A period of coverage or residence in Germany **after the age at which Canadian residence is creditable** is treated as a **period of residence in Canada**.
  - **Pre-1990 residence** in areas of German reunification (e.g., former East Germany) is recognized as **residence in Canada**.
  - If a person is entitled to OAS **only through Article 12**, the Canadian agency will calculate the benefit **only on Canadian residence periods** — not German ones — and apply **partial pension rules**.
  - **Eligibility for OAS outside Canada** requires that **total coverage periods equal or exceed the minimum Canadian residence requirement**.
  - **Allowances and Guaranteed Income Supplements (GIS)** are only payable to the extent allowed under Canadian law.

> 📌 **Key Implication**: A German resident who has lived in Germany after age 65 may still qualify for OAS if they meet the minimum Canadian residence threshold — even if they never lived in Canada.

---

### ✅ **Article 15: Benefit Ratios and Application**
- **Changes in (b)(i)**:  
  Replaces list of benefits with **“a benefit”** → generalizes coverage.
- **(b)(ii)**:  
  Clarifies that **no ratio can exceed 1.0** (i.e., no benefit can be more than 100% of the equivalent Canadian benefit).
- **Deletes (c)**:  
  Removes a redundant or outdated clause.

> 🔍 Ensures that benefits are not overpaid and maintains fiscal balance.

---

### ✅ **Article 18: Application to War Victims’ Assistance**
- Adds a new sentence:  
  > *“The second sentence shall also apply to decisions of courts and notifications issued in connection with the German Law Governing War Victims’ Assistance (Gesetz über die Versorgung der Opfer des Krieges) and those laws which declare the first-mentioned law to be applied accordingly.”*  
  → Extends the Agreement’s reach to war victims, including those from WWII and the Holocaust.

---

### ✅ **Article 19(3): Application of Benefits**
- **Replaces original clause** with:
  > An application for a benefit under one country’s law is **deemed to be an application under the other country’s law** if:
  - The applicant **requests it** or
  - Provides **evidence of coverage** under the other country’s system.

> 📝 Encourages mutual recognition and simplifies application processes.
