### **Detailed Summary of the Prohibited Activities Respecting Real Property (Foreign Banks) Regulations**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is grounded in **section 978a of the Bank Act** (Canada), which empowers the government to establish rules governing the activities of foreign banks in Canada—particularly those involving real property.
- The regulation is formally part of the **Bank Act**, a key piece of financial regulation that governs the operations, activities, and oversight of banks in Canada.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- The primary objective is to **prohibit or restrict certain activities** by **foreign banks** and **entities associated with foreign banks** concerning **real property in Canada**.
- Specifically, it targets activities involving the **holding, managing, or dealing with real property** in Canada that involve:
  - The **making of loans** or **advances**,
  - The **acquiring of loans or advances**,
  - And these loans or advances are **secured by real property located in Canada**.

This ensures that foreign banks do not engage in activities that could pose risks to the stability of Canada’s financial system, particularly through exposure to real estate-related lending, which may involve higher credit risk or speculative behavior.

#### **3. Scope of Application**
- The provisions apply to:
  - **Foreign banks** (banks incorporated outside of Canada),
  - **Entities associated with foreign banks** (such as subsidiaries, affiliates, or holding companies that are linked to or controlled by foreign banks).
- The regulation applies specifically to **real property located in Canada**.
- The prohibition applies to any activity that involves **security interest** (i.e., collateral) in Canadian real property.

#### **4. Legal Framework Reference**
- The regulation is implemented under **paragraphs 510(1)(a) and (510)(b)** of the Bank Act.
  - **Paragraph 510(1)(a)**: Prohibits a foreign bank or associated entity from holding, managing, or dealing with real property in Canada if such activities involve making or acquiring loans or advances secured by that real property.
  - **Paragraph 510(1)(b)**: Reinforces the prohibition by extending it to any dealing with real property that results in such loans or advances being made or acquired.

These provisions are part of a broader regulatory framework designed to protect Canadian financial institutions and the broader economy from undue exposure to foreign banking risks, especially in real estate markets.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulation **comes into force on the date when section 514 of the Bank Act becomes effective**.
- Section 514 of the Bank Act was enacted by **section 132 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act**, which was passed as **chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001**.
- This means the regulations became enforceable on **October 24, 2001** (as noted in the footnote).
- This date is significant because it aligns with the broader modernization of Canada’s financial regulatory regime, particularly in response to international financial trends and the need for stronger oversight of foreign financial institutions.

#### **6. Regulatory Context and Background**
- The regulation was introduced in response to growing concerns about:
  - The potential for foreign banks to use Canadian real estate as collateral for loans that could destabilize local markets.
  - The lack of adequate regulatory oversight over foreign banks' real estate activities.
- It reflects Canada’s effort to **align with international standards** and to **protect domestic financial stability** by limiting foreign exposure to high-risk real estate lending.

#### **7. Key Implications**
- **Foreign banks** are now **prohibited from engaging in real estate lending** in Canada unless such lending is fully compliant with the rules set out in the Bank Act and these regulations.
- Any **real property transaction** involving a loan secured by Canadian real estate must be carefully assessed to ensure it does not fall under the prohibited activities.
- The regulation enhances **transparency and accountability** in the financial dealings of foreign banks in Canada.

#### **8. Reference to Prior Legislation**
- The regulation is cited in relation to:
  - **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183** – This refers to the specific statutory provision that authorizes the regulation.
  - **S.C. 1991, c. 46** – Likely refers to an earlier legislative or regulatory framework that established the foundation for foreign bank oversight.
- The **Note** at the end confirms that the regulations were in force as of **October 24, 2001**, and are referenced via **SI/2001-102** (Statutory Instrument 2001-102).

### **Conclusion**
The *Prohibited Activities Respecting Real Property (Foreign Banks) Regulations* serve as a critical tool in Canada’s financial regulatory framework. By explicitly banning foreign banks and their associated entities from making or acquiring loans secured by real property in Canada, the regulation strengthens financial stability, reduces systemic risk, and ensures that foreign financial institutions operate under clear, enforceable rules consistent with Canadian financial policy.

It is a key example of how Canada manages cross-border financial activities to protect its domestic economy and maintain confidence in the banking sector.
