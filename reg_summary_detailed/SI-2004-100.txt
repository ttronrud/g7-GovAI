**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, constitutes a formal transfer of administrative responsibility within the Canadian public service under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Authority of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign functions, responsibilities, and control within the public service. This provision allows for structural adjustments to improve efficiency, accountability, or alignment with government priorities.

2. **Transfer of Function:**  
   The regulation specifies that the **control and supervision** of a specific component of the public service — the **Crown Corporations Secretariat** — is being transferred.

3. **Scope of the Transfer:**  
   The portion of the Crown Corporations Secretariat that relates specifically to the **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** is being transferred. This means that the administrative oversight, policy guidance, and operational supervision of CMHC’s public service functions — previously managed under the Office of Infrastructure of Canada — will now fall under the purview of a different department.

4. **Departmental Transfer:**  
   The transferred responsibilities move from the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada** to the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development (HRSD)**. This shift reflects a broader government strategy to align public service functions with human capital, workforce development, and organizational effectiveness, rather than infrastructure or corporate governance.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **July 20, 2004**. This date marks the point at which the new administrative control and reporting lines take effect, and all related public service operations, personnel, and policy decisions for CMHC under the Crown Corporations Secretariat are now managed by the Department of HRSD.

**Implications and Context:**

- This move likely reflects a broader government initiative to streamline public service operations and place greater emphasis on human resources, governance, and skills development.
- By transferring oversight of CMHC (a major Crown corporation involved in housing finance and policy) to HRSD, the government may be signaling a focus on workforce management, performance evaluation, and human capital strategy within Crown corporations.
- The Crown Corporations Secretariat typically provides administrative and policy support to Crown corporations. Its transfer to HRSD suggests a shift in how such entities are governed and supported — possibly integrating them more closely with human resource policies and performance management frameworks.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally reassigns the administrative control and supervision of the CMHC-related functions within the Crown Corporations Secretariat from the Office of Infrastructure of Canada to the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, effective July 20, 2004. The transfer is grounded in statutory authority and aligns with government efforts to restructure public service responsibilities for greater efficiency and alignment with human resource and organizational development priorities.
