**Detailed Summary of the Carrier Exemption Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Carrier Exemption Regulations*  

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Carrier Exemption Regulations*.

---

**1. Reference to the Governing Act**  
The term "**Act**" in these Regulations refers to the *Freshwater Fish Marketing Act*. This Act establishes the regulatory framework for the marketing and distribution of freshwater fish in Canada, including provisions related to transportation, licensing, and market control.

---

**2. Scope of Exemption**  
Under the provisions of **Section 4** of the *Freshwater Fish Marketing Act*, certain carriers—specifically those to which the legislative authority of the **Parliament of Canada** extends—are **exempted** from specific obligations under **paragraphs 21(1)(b) and (c)** of the Act.

- **Paragraph 21(1)(b)**: Likely relates to restrictions on the transportation or sale of fish without proper licensing or authorization.
- **Paragraph 21(1)(c)**: Likely relates to requirements for documentation or reporting when fish are transported.

Thus, the exemption allows designated carriers to operate without being subject to these two specific regulatory requirements, provided certain conditions are met.

**3. Conditions for Exemption**  
The exemption under **Section 3** of the Act applies **only** when:

- The exempted carrier is **requested** to:
  - Send, convey, or carry fish;
  - Receive fish for carriage and delivery;

- And such fish are those **defined under the Act** as "fish" (typically meaning freshwater fish, such as trout, bass, or other species specified in the legislation).

- The request must come from:
  - The **Corporation** (the regulatory body established under the Act, likely the *Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation*);
  - An **agent of the Corporation**; or
  - A **person or persons licensed by the Corporation**.

This ensures that only authorized entities and their designated representatives can trigger the exemption, preventing misuse or unauthorized transportation of fish.

---

**4. Requirements for Carriage Documentation**  
When a carrier is exempted under Section 3, all **bills of lading** or **other contracts of carriage** issued by the carrier must include one of the following:

- The **number of the licence** issued to the sender or vendor by the Corporation; **OR**
- A **signed statement** attesting that the sender or vendor is an **authorized agent of the Corporation**.

This requirement ensures transparency and traceability in the fish transportation chain. It allows regulatory oversight to verify that the fish are being transported under legitimate and authorized arrangements, and that the carrier is acting within the scope of the exemption.

---

**Key Objectives of the Regulations**  
- To facilitate efficient and lawful transportation of freshwater fish by exempting qualified carriers from certain compliance burdens.  
- To ensure that only authorized parties (the Corporation or its licensed agents) initiate the transportation process.  
- To maintain accountability by requiring clear documentation linking the shipment to a valid licence or authorized agent status.

---

**Limitations and Important Notes**  
- The exemption is **not automatic** and is conditional upon the sender being authorized by the Corporation or a licensed individual.  
- The exemption **does not apply** to all carriers—only those within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.  
- The exemption **does not relieve** carriers of other obligations under the Act unless explicitly stated.  
- The documentation requirement (licence number or signed statement) is mandatory and must be clearly visible on the carriage contract.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Carrier Exemption Regulations* provide a targeted exemption for certain carriers from specific compliance obligations under the *Freshwater Fish Marketing Act*, but only when fish are being transported under the authority of the Corporation or its licensed agents. The regulations emphasize accountability through mandatory documentation, ensuring that the exemption is used appropriately and in compliance with the broader goals of market integrity and fish marketing oversight.
