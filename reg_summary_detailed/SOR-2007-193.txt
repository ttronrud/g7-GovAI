**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2007–1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Radiocommunication Act* of Canada. Specifically, it is made pursuant to **subsection 3(2)a** of the Act, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry) to issue exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for **security, safety, or international relations**.

The primary objective of this Order is to **exempt specific governmental operations** — in this case, the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** — from the normal regulatory requirements of the Radiocommunication Act during a defined period and geographic area. This exemption enables the RCMP to conduct **deliberate interference or obstruction of radiocommunications** for critical operational purposes without violating the Act’s general rules governing radio frequency use and interference.

### **2. Scope of the Exemption**

#### **Applying Entity**
- The exemption applies to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- This means the RCMP is authorized to carry out authorized interference with radio communications under this Order.

#### **Exempted Provisions**
The exemption covers:
- **Subsection 4(1)** of the *Radiocommunication Act*: which normally prohibits the intentional interference with radiocommunications.
- **Paragraph 9(1)(b)** of the Act: which generally prohibits the obstruction or interference with radiocommunications.

These provisions are typically designed to protect the integrity and lawful operation of radio services. This Order overrides them temporarily for specific, high-priority reasons.

---

### **3. Time Period**
- The exemption is **temporary** and applies only for a **one-day period**:
  - **From August 20, 2007, to August 21, 2007** (inclusive).
- This short duration reflects the temporary and mission-specific nature of the activity.

---

### **4. Geographic Limitation**
The exemption is **geographically restricted** to a specific quadrilateral area within the provinces of **Ontario and Quebec**. The boundaries are defined by four geographic coordinates:

| Point | Latitude | Longitude |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 45°31′ N | 75°45′ W |
| 2 | 45°39′ N | 74°35′ W |
| 3 | 45°36′ N | 74°36′ W |
| 4 | 45°18′ N | 75°42′ W |

This area is located in central Ontario and eastern Quebec, likely near or overlapping with regions of strategic importance — such as border areas, national security zones, or international border regions — where coordinated communication disruptions may be necessary.

> **Note**: The area is not a large or broad region but rather a focused zone, indicating targeted use of the exemption.

---

### **5. Conditions for Exemption Use**

#### **Purpose Requirement**
The interference or obstruction must be conducted **only for one of the following purposes**:
- **Security**
- **Safety**
- **International relations**

This ensures that the exemption is not used for arbitrary or unrelated activities. The use must serve a legitimate and urgent national interest.

#### **Applicable Equipment and Operation**
- The radio apparatus used must be **installed, operated, or possessed** specifically to carry out interference or obstruction **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- This means the equipment and operations must be **planned, authorized, and executed** under the specific conditions outlined in the Order.

#### **Prohibition of Unauthorized Use**
Any interference not carried out under the strict conditions of this Order — particularly without a valid security, safety, or international relations justification — would remain prohibited under the Radiocommunication Act.

---

### **6. Principle of Minimization**
To ensure that the impact on other radio services is minimized, the Order mandates that:
> *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This principle reflects a **proportionality and necessity standard**:
- Interference should be **targeted** (limited to the smallest area).
- Only **necessary frequencies** should be affected.
- The **duration** of interference should be as short as possible.

This requirement helps prevent collateral damage to civilian or commercial radio services (e.g., emergency services, aviation, or public safety communications).

---

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Office of the Registrar of Regulations.
- Registration typically occurs shortly after publication in the *Canada Gazette*, which is the official publication of federal regulations.

---

### **8. Key Legal and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Temporary Nature** | The exemption is not permanent; it is limited to one day, reflecting a precautionary and narrowly scoped intervention. |
| **Government Accountability** | The use of such a powerful tool (interfering with communications) requires strict justification and oversight, ensuring it is not abused. |
| **National Security Context** | This Order likely supports operations related to border security, counter-terrorism, or intelligence gathering involving real-time disruption of enemy or hostile communications. |
| **Public Safety and Interference Risk** | While the Order allows interference, the minimization clause ensures that public safety services (e.g., police, fire, ambulance) are not inadvertently disrupted. |
| **International Relations** | The exemption may support diplomatic efforts, such as disrupting foreign signals during sensitive negotiations or intelligence operations. |

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This **Exemption Order No. 2007–1** is a **temporary, narrowly tailored, and highly regulated authorization** that allows the RCMP to interfere with or obstruct radio communications within a defined geographic area and time frame — specifically on **August 21, 2007** — for **security, safety, or international relations** purposes.

It operates under strict conditions to:
- Ensure operational necessity,
- Minimize unintended effects on other radio users,
- Maintain compliance with the Radiocommunication Act,
- And preserve the integrity of Canada’s communication infrastructure.

Such orders are critical tools in national security operations but are designed to be used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, with clear oversight and accountability mechanisms.

**Note**: This Order is dated **2007**, and as such, it is no longer in effect. However, it serves as a model for how Canada regulates and authorizes temporary interference with radio communications in exceptional circumstances. Modern equivalents may exist under updated legislation or policy frameworks.
