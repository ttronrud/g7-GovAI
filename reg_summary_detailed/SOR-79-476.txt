The provided text consists of four repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Authority**: It was repealed by **Statutory Instrument No. 2017-84**, specifically under **section 1** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **June 2017**, as SOR/2017-84 was published in that year.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: While the original content of the regulation is not provided in the query, the repeated references suggest that it was a prior rule or provision that had been in force before its repeal. Given the context of such repeals in Canadian regulatory frameworks (especially in areas like health, safety, or licensing), it likely governed a specific administrative or operational requirement—possibly related to a licensing, inspection, or compliance process—though the exact subject matter is not specified here.

### Implications of Repeal:
- The regulation is **no longer in force** and **cannot be cited or applied**.
- Any legal or operational obligations previously derived from it are now superseded by newer legislation or regulations.
- Entities or individuals who were previously subject to the regulation must now comply with the current, updated rules (if any) that replaced it or with general statutory provisions.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the query has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer valid**. The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which formally removed it from the legal framework. Without the original text of the regulation, the precise scope or purpose of the repealed provision cannot be determined, but its removal indicates a change in policy, administrative structure, or legislative intent.

> **Note**: To obtain the original content or purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2017-84.
