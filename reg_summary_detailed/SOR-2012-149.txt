**Detailed Summary of the Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations (International Bridges and Tunnels)**  
*Issued by the Minister of Transport, pursuant to Section 43 of the International Bridges and Tunnels Act*  
*Ottawa, July 6, 2012*  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 2007, c. 1*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish a framework for administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) for violations of specific provisions under the *International Bridges and Tunnels Act* (the "Act"). The Minister of Transport issued these regulations under **Section 43** of the Act, which authorizes the creation of administrative penalty regimes for breaches of certain rules.

The primary objective is to provide a clear, enforceable mechanism to ensure compliance with statutory obligations related to the operation, maintenance, safety, and management of international bridges and tunnels in Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *International Bridges and Tunnels Act*.
- **"Designated provisions"** are specific clauses from:
  - The *International Bridges and Tunnels Act* (column 1 of Part 1 of the Schedule)
  - The *International Bridges and Tunnels Regulations* (column 1 of Part 2 of the Schedule)

These designated provisions are those whose **contravention constitutes a "violation"** that may be prosecuted under **Sections 45 to 55 of the Act**, which govern administrative penalties and enforcement procedures.

---

### **3. Penalty Structure**

The regulations prescribe **maximum monetary penalties** for violations of designated provisions, differentiated by the type of offender:

| Category | Maximum Penalty |
|--------|------------------|
| **Corporation** | $25,000 |
| **Individual** | $5,000 |

- The amount in **Column 2** of the Schedule applies to **corporations**.
- The amount in **Column 3** applies to **individuals**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The penalties are **maximums**—actual fines may be lower depending on the severity of the violation, the offender's history, and other factors determined by the Minister or the enforcement authority.

### **4. Scope of Violations Covered**

The regulations define two categories of violations:

#### **(a) Violations of Designated Provisions (Section 43(1))**
- Contravention of specific provisions in:
  - The *International Bridges and Tunnels Act* (Part 1 of the Schedule)
  - The *International Bridges and Tunnels Regulations* (Part 2 of the Schedule)

These are the **primary violations** for which penalties are authorized under Sections 45–55 of the Act.

#### **(b) Violations of Orders or Directives (Section 43(2))**
- Contravention of:
  - **Orders** made under Sections 9, 13, 15.1, or 26 of the Act
  - **Directives** made under Sections 17 or 18 of the Act

These are also considered violations that may be enforced under the same penalty framework (Sections 45–55).

> This includes enforcement actions related to operational standards, safety requirements, environmental protections, and compliance with project-specific directives.

---

### **5. Enforcement Authority and Process**

- The Minister of Transport has the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings under **Sections 45 to 55** of the Act.
- These sections outline the process for:
  - Issuing notices of violation
  - Conducting investigations
  - Determining the appropriate penalty
  - Serving penalties on individuals or corporations
- The process is **administrative**, meaning it does not require a full criminal trial, and is designed to be efficient and proportionate.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.
- **Note**: The regulations are effective from **August 1, 2012**, indicating that they were intended to take effect after a transition period for implementation and public awareness.

---

### **7. Key Implications**

- **Clarity and Accountability**: The regulations provide clear, measurable penalties for non-compliance, promoting accountability among operators of international bridges and tunnels.
- **Proportionality**: Penalties are tiered—corporations face higher penalties than individuals—reflecting differences in capacity and potential impact.
- **Enforcement Flexibility**: The inclusion of orders and directives ensures that temporary or project-specific requirements (e.g., emergency safety measures) can also be enforced with penalties.
- **Legal Consistency**: The penalties are aligned with the broader administrative penalty regime in Canadian law, ensuring consistency with other regulatory frameworks.
