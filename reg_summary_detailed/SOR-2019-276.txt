#### **3. Provisions with Force of Law**
The following provisions of the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)** are incorporated directly into Canadian law and have **full legal force and effect**:

| Provision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Article 3.1** | Defines the general principles of origin, including the requirement that goods must be produced or manufactured in one of the two Parties (Canada or Israel) to qualify as originating. |
| **Paragraph 1 of Article 3.2** | Establishes the rules for the origin of goods produced in one Party and subsequently processed or transformed in the other Party. |
| **Articles 3.3 to 3.10** | Detail specific rules for different types of goods (e.g., agricultural products, manufactured goods, textiles, etc.), including requirements for substantial transformation and value addition. |
| **Paragraph 1 of Article 3.11** | Specifies conditions under which goods may be considered originating even if they contain components from a third country, provided they meet certain thresholds. |
| **Articles 3.12 to 3.14** | Address special rules for certain sectors such as services, digital products, and goods subject to specific processing or manufacturing conditions. |
| **Annexes 3.4 and 3.12** | Provide detailed, sector-specific rules of origin (e.g., for specific industries or product categories), including lists of eligible inputs, thresholds, and exceptions. |
