### **5. Replacement Cheques (When Original is Lost, Stolen, or Not Received)**

#### General Rule:
If a payee or holder for value reports:
- The cheque was **not received**, or
- It was **lost, destroyed, or stolen**,

Then the **Receiver General or a signing officer** may issue a **replacement cheque** for the **same amount**, provided the payee/holder:
- Submits a **form of undertaking** (as defined below).

#### Requirements for the Form of Undertaking:
- Must include:
  - Name and address of the payee/holder;
  - Amount, date of issue, and purpose of the original cheque;
  - An undertaking that:

- An **affidavit or statutory declaration** sworn or declared before a **commissioner for oaths, justice of the peace, or other legally authorized person** in Canada or abroad, confirming the non-receipt, loss, destruction, or theft.

> ⚖️ This is a **safeguard against fraud** for large-value payments.

#### Exception: No Undertaking Required
A replacement cheque may be issued **without requiring an undertaking** if:
- The payee requests it in writing, and
- The cheque represents:
  - A **recurring payment in a fixed amount authorized by an Act of Parliament**, or
  - A payment under a **program where the payee is already required to provide an undertaking** as part of the program terms.

#### Emergency Exception (No Undertaking Required)
If the **Receiver General is notified** by:
- An employee or public officer,
- Canada Post,

- RCMP,
- Or a provincial/municipal police force,

That the cheque **cannot be delivered** due to:
- Act of God,
- Fire,
