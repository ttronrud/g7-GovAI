**Detailed Summary of the "Submission of Samples of Fabrics for Importation Regulations" (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Submission of Samples of Fabrics for Importation Regulations* were issued on March 22, 1986, under subsection 164(3) of the *Customs Act*, following a public notice period in *Part I of the Canada Gazette*. This notice provided interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections to the proposed regulations. Based on those inputs, the Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, formally adopted the regulations under paragraph 164(1)(d) of the *Customs Act*.

These regulations establish specific requirements for the submission of fabric samples when importing fabrics into Canada. They are designed to ensure accurate classification, proper valuation, and effective customs control over imported textiles.

The regulations came into force upon the coming into effect of paragraph 164(1)(d) of the *Customs Act*, which grants the Minister authority to regulate the submission of samples for imported goods.

### **Regulation Title**

**Submission of Samples of Fabrics for Importation Regulations**  
(Reference: S.C. 1986, c. 1)

---

### **Scope and Applicability**

#### **Applicable to:**
- All persons importing fabrics into Canada **except** those listed in the **Schedule** (exemptions).

#### **Exempted Fabrics (Not Covered by the Regulations):**
The regulations do **not apply** to the following types of fabrics as specified in the Schedule:
- Fabrics listed in the tariff item **5911.20.90** (List of Tariff Provisions)
- Fabrics solely composed of **jute or hemp**
- Fabrics containing **asbestos**
- **Floor coverings**
- **Oilcloth**
- **Fabrics coated with asphalt or tar**
- **Coated or impregnated fabrics** where the coating/impregnation exceeds 50% of the finished fabric’s weight (except as otherwise noted)
- **Sensitized fabrics for photographic use**
- **Long pile, terry, chenille, felt (non-clothing), tire cord, lace, embroidered fabrics**, and others — *note: these are explicitly included in the scope, so clarification is needed.*

> **Important Note:** The list of exempted fabrics appears to be a misstatement in the original text. The text says "These Regulations do not apply in respect of the imported fabrics listed in the schedule," but then lists several fabric types that *are* subject to the rules. This suggests a possible error in drafting — likely, the **Schedule contains a list of exempted items**, and the rest are subject to the sample requirement.

Therefore, the **core principle** is:
> **All imported fabrics are subject to the sample submission rule, except those explicitly listed in the Schedule as exempt.**

---

### **Key Requirements**

#### 1. **Mandatory Sample Submission**
Every person importing fabrics into Canada must ensure that:
- A **sample of every quality or style** of the imported fabric is attached to the **accounting document** required under subsection 32(1) of the *Customs Act*.

> This ensures that customs officials can verify the nature, design, and characteristics of the imported goods for classification, valuation, and compliance purposes.

---

#### 2. **Specifications for the Sample**
A valid sample must:
- Be of a size sufficient to **identify the design or pattern**, if any, woven into or imprinted on the fabric.
- Be **at least 10 × 10 cm** in dimension.

> This standard ensures that the sample is large enough to allow proper visual inspection and comparison with the actual goods.

---

#### 3. **Exemptions Based on Type or Quantity**

The regulations **do not apply** to the following categories of fabrics:

| Category | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **Fabrics imported by individuals for personal use (not for resale)** | Exempt from sample submission due to non-commercial nature. |
| **Fabrics imported in lengths not exceeding 23 meters** | Exempt — likely to reduce administrative burden for small, non-commercial imports. |
| **Fabrics imported in lengths not exceeding 2 meters** | Further narrow exemption for very short lengths. |
| **Fabrics imported by custom tailors in lengths not exceeding 23 meters** | Tailors may import small quantities for use in custom work. |
| **Fabrics valued at $4.38 or less per meter and imported in lengths not exceeding 32 meters** | Lower value and limited quantity exemptions. |

> Note: These exemptions suggest a tiered approach — smaller quantities, lower values, or personal use are exempted to avoid unnecessary compliance burdens.

---

#### 4. **Applicable to Specific Fabric Types (Subject to Sample Requirement)**

The following **fabric types are covered** by the sample requirement:

- **Long pile fabrics** (e.g., velvet)
- **Terry fabrics** (e.g., towel fabric)
- **Chenille or tufted fabrics**
- **Felts other than those used for clothing** (e.g., industrial felts)
- **Tire cord fabrics** (used in tire manufacturing)
- **Lace and embroidered fabrics**
- **Fabrics classified under tariff item 5911.20.90** — *this appears contradictory to the exemption clause; likely a typographical or structural error in the original text.*
- **Fabrics solely of jute or hemp** — *exempted*, so not subject to rule*
- **Fabrics containing asbestos** — *exempted*
- **Floor coverings** — *exempted*
- **Oilcloth** — *exempted*
- **Fabrics coated with asphalt or tar** — *exempted*
- **Coated fabrics** (other than those listed in item 17) or **impregnated fabrics** where coating/impregnation exceeds **50% of the finished fabric’s weight** — *subject to sample requirement only if below 50% weight threshold*

> This indicates that **only certain coated/impregnated fabrics** (those with <50% coating) are subject to the sample rule — a significant distinction.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Accurate Classification**  
   To ensure that imported fabrics are correctly classified under the tariff system, which affects duties, taxes, and trade policies.

2. **Proper Valuation**  
   To support accurate valuation of imported goods, particularly for fabrics with complex designs or variable costs.

3. **Customs Compliance and Control**  
   To provide customs authorities with physical evidence of imported goods, enabling verification of claims and detection of fraud or misrepresentation.

4. **Risk Management**  
   To target high-risk or complex fabric types (e.g., long pile, terry, coated) that may be subject to misclassification or overvaluation.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 164(3)** of the *Customs Act*: Allows publication of proposed regulations with a reasonable opportunity for public comment.
- **Paragraph 164(1)(d)**: Grants the Minister of National Revenue the authority to make regulations concerning the submission of samples of imported goods.

### **Important Observations and Interpretations**

1. **Exemption List vs. Applicable List**  
   There is a potential inconsistency in the original text. The regulation states that it "does not apply" to fabrics listed in the schedule, yet then lists several fabric types as being subject to the rules. This suggests that the **Schedule contains a detailed list of exempted fabrics**, and the rest are subject to the sample requirement.

2. **Personal Use Exemption**  
   Individuals importing fabrics for personal use (non-commercial) are exempt — this aligns with common customs practices to reduce administrative burden on private consumers.

3. **Quantity-Based Exemptions**  
   Exemptions based on length (e.g., ≤23m, ≤2m) and value (≤$4.38/m) reflect a proportionate approach — small-scale or low-value imports are not required to submit samples.

4. **Coated Fabrics Threshold**  
   The 50% weight threshold for coating/impregnation is a key technical detail — it distinguishes between fabrics that are substantially coated (which may be treated differently) and those that are only lightly treated.

5. **Fabric Classification Matters**  
   The rules are tied to specific tariff classifications and fabric types — meaning that even within a broad category (e.g., "fabrics"), the rules vary based on technical characteristics.

### **Conclusion**

The *Submission of Samples of Fabrics for Importation Regulations* (S.C. 1986, c. 1) is a targeted regulatory measure that establishes clear, practical requirements for the submission of fabric samples during importation. It applies to a wide range of fabrics, particularly those with complex designs, high value, or potential for misclassification, while providing meaningful exemptions for personal use, small quantities, low-value goods, and certain specialized or hazardous materials.

The regulation balances **customs enforcement needs** with **practicality and fairness**, ensuring that commercial importers are held accountable while minimizing administrative burdens on individuals and small-scale operators.

### **Recommendations for Compliance**

- Importers should:
  - Verify whether their fabric type is listed in the Schedule as exempt.
  - Check the length and value of the fabric to determine if exemptions apply.
  - Prepare and retain a sample of **at least 10 × 10 cm** that clearly shows any pattern or design.
  -
