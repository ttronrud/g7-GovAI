**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
A formal directive issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) under **section 157 of the Financial Administration Act**.

**Purpose:**  
To discontinue the requirement that certain annual reports from specific federal departments be prepared and laid before either House of Parliament.

---

### **Legal Basis**
The directive is grounded in **section 157 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to determine whether documents required by statute to be laid before Parliament contain sufficient information—either equivalent to or less than that provided in the Public Accounts or in official expenditure estimates.

If such documents fail to meet or exceed the level of transparency and detail found in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates, they may be discontinued to avoid duplication, redundancy, or inefficiency in parliamentary oversight.

---

### **Key Provision**
The Governor in Council has determined that the **annual reports** of the following seven federal departments **contain no more information than is already available in the Public Accounts or in expenditure estimates** submitted to Parliament.

As a result, these reports are **discontinued** effective immediately. This means:

- No further preparation of these annual reports will be required.
- These reports will no longer be submitted to either the House of Commons or the Senate.
- The departments are no longer legally required to produce or circulate these reports under their respective Acts.

### **List of Discontinued Annual Reports**

| Department | Relevant Statutory Provision |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Department of Agriculture | Section 6 of the *Department of Agriculture Act* |
| Department of Communications | Section 7 of the *Department of Communications Act* |
| Department of Energy, Mines and Resources | Section 5 of the *Department of Energy, Mines and Resources Act* |

> Note: The list includes **eight departments**, not seven. The original text lists eight items. The header says “seven,” but the actual enumeration includes eight entries.

### **Rationale for Discontinuation**
The Government has concluded that:

1. **Redundancy:** The content of these annual reports duplicates information already disclosed in the Public Accounts or in the annual estimates of government expenditures.
2. **Lack of Added Value:** These reports do not provide new, unique, or essential information that would enhance parliamentary scrutiny or accountability.
3. **Efficiency and Cost Reduction:** Eliminating redundant reporting reduces administrative burden, saves public funds, and streamlines the legislative process.
4. **Alignment with Oversight Standards:** The Public Accounts and expenditure estimates already serve as the primary tools for Parliament to monitor government spending, performance, and accountability. Additional departmental reports are not necessary when this core information is already available.

---

### **Implications for Departments**
- Departments must cease preparing these annual reports.
- They are no longer required to submit them to Parliament.
- Any future reporting obligations for these departments must be re-evaluated and aligned with current accountability frameworks (e.g., performance reporting, budgetary transparency, or specific legislative mandates).

---

### **Implications for Parliament**
- Parliament will no longer receive these specific annual reports as part of its oversight process.
- The oversight of departmental performance will now rely on:
  - Public Accounts
  - Expenditure estimates
  - Other forms of performance reporting (e.g., budget reviews, audits, or reports under specific acts)
- This change may affect how Parliament assesses departmental performance, particularly in areas where detailed operational or financial reporting was previously expected.

---

### **Governance and Accountability Considerations**
- The decision reflects a shift toward **focused, evidence-based oversight**, where Parliament relies on high-quality, comprehensive financial and performance data rather than numerous repetitive reports.
- It underscores the principle that **information should be transparent, non-redundant, and strategically valuable** to democratic accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant streamlining of federal government reporting requirements. By discontinuing eight annual departmental reports deemed redundant or insufficient in content, the Government enhances transparency, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures that parliamentary oversight is based on the most relevant and comprehensive information available—particularly the Public Accounts and expenditure estimates.

It demonstrates a commitment to **efficiency, accountability, and cost-effectiveness** in public administration, while maintaining the integrity of parliamentary scrutiny through better data management and information flow.

**Final Note:**  
This directive is binding and enforceable under the Financial Administration Act. Departments must comply with the discontinuation, and any failure to do so may be subject to administrative or legal review.
