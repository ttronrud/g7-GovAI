### **Detailed Summary of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Registration Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**
These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 73(1)a of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA)**.  
The primary purpose is to establish **registration requirements** for **money services businesses (MSBs)** and **foreign money services businesses (FMSBs)** in Canada. The regulations ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards.

They implement provisions of the PCMLTFA that require entities engaging in regulated financial services — such as money transmission, foreign exchange, or cash handling — to register with the **Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)**.
