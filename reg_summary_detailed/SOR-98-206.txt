**Detailed Summary of the *Authorizations to Transport Restricted Firearms and Prohibited Firearms Regulations* (S.C. 1995, c. 39, as amended by SOR/98-206)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were made under **section 117 of the Firearms Act** (referred to as "the Act") and were laid before both Houses of Parliament on **November 27, 1996**, in accordance with **section 118** of the same Act. This ensured that the proposed regulations had at least **30 sitting days of parliamentary review** prior to enactment — a procedural requirement to ensure transparency and democratic accountability.

The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, formally enacted these regulations on **December 1, 1998**, establishing a legal framework for the **authorization of transporting restricted and prohibited firearms** in Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Firearms Act*.
- The regulations apply to **restricted firearms** and **prohibited firearms**, which are defined under the Act.
- The central authority responsible for issuing authorizations is the **chief firearms officer** (CFO), who has discretion to determine whether transportation of such firearms between specified locations poses a safety risk.

---

### **3. Eligibility and Conditions for Authorization to Transport**

#### **General Rule**
A chief firearms officer may issue an **authorization to transport** a restricted or prohibited firearm **only if** the officer determines that:
- The transportation will **not pose a threat to the safety** of the individual or any other person.

#### **Special Case: Transporting a Handgun from a Port of Entry**
An authorization to transport a **handgun from a port of entry** is permitted **only if** one of the following conditions is met:

1. **Valid Registration Certificate**  
   - The individual holds a registration certificate for the handgun.  
   - The application for the certificate was made **before the regulation came into force** under **section 54 of the Act**.

2. **Authorization to Carry**  
   - The individual has an active **authorization to carry** the handgun under **section 20 of the Act**.

3. **Sporting Purpose (Olympic/Paralympic)**  
   - The individual trains, competes, or coaches in a **handgun shooting discipline** on the official program of:
     - The **International Olympic Committee (IOC)**  
     - The **International Paralympic Committee (IPC)**  
   - The individual must provide a **written letter** from a recognized **provincial or national sport shooting governing body** confirming:
     - The individual's involvement (training, competing, coaching);
     - The specific discipline;
     - That the handgun is necessary for that activity.

4. **Non-Resident Exception**  
   - For non-residents, a **customs officer** must confirm, under **section 35 of the Act**, a prior **declaration and authorization to transport** for the handgun.

> This provision reflects a balance between enabling legitimate sporting and personal needs and maintaining strict controls on firearm movement across borders.

### **4. Application Process – Telephone Submissions**

Under **section 1.2**, applications for authorizations to transport may be made **by telephone**, in addition to the prescribed written form. This is a significant accessibility measure.

#### **All Telephone Applications Must Include:**
- Applicant’s name  
- Reason for transporting the firearm  
- Frequency, dates, and times of transport  
- Place of departure and destination  

#### **Additional Information by Applicant Type:**

| Applicant Type | Additional Required Information |

| **Non-Resident without Licence** | - Confirmation number from customs officer (under section 3 or 3.1 of Importation and Exportation Regulations)<br>- Residence and mailing address |
| **Non-Resident with Licence** | - Licence number<br>- Make, model, type, action, and serial number of firearm<br>- Quantity of ammunition the magazine can hold |

> This ensures that all essential details are captured even when applications are submitted verbally, reducing the administrative burden while maintaining compliance and traceability.

### **5. Renewal of Authorizations**

- Under **subsection 67(1) of the Act**, an authorization to transport may be **renewed** in any manner in which it can be initially issued (i.e., via written application, telephone, or other approved method).
- This provides flexibility for individuals who need to transport firearms for ongoing purposes (e.g., training, competition).

---

### **6. Format and Content Requirements for Authorizations**

An authorization to transport may cover:
- One or more restricted or prohibited firearms.

If the authorization is issued as a **condition attached to a licence**, it must clearly specify:

- All firearms covered by the authorization  
- The **period of validity**  
- The **specific places** between which the firearms may be transported  
- The **reasons** for transportation (e.g., training, competition, travel)

Additionally, **every authorization must include** a condition that:
> The firearm be transported by a route that, in all the circumstances, is **reasonably direct**.

This ensures that transportation is efficient and safe, avoiding unnecessary detours or risks.

---

### **7. Revocation of Authorizations**

A chief firearms officer may **revoke** an authorization to transport if:

1. The individual’s **licence to possess** any of the firearms in the authorization is:
   - Revoked, or  
   - Expires

2. The officer becomes aware that the individual’s **physical or mental state has deteriorated** to a degree that could compromise personal or public safety.

> This safeguards public safety and ensures that authorizations are only valid when the individual remains fit and legally eligible to possess the firearm.

---

### **8. Notice and Communication Requirements**

A notice of refusal or revocation must be **sufficiently given** if it is:

- Sent to the applicant at:
  - The address listed in the original application, **or**
  - A **new address** previously notified to the CFO

Delivery methods acceptable include:

- **Courier**: On the fifth working day after the **date of shipment on the waybill**  
- **Electronic**: On the day of transmission  

> This ensures legal clarity and provides a clear timeline for applicants to respond or appeal decisions.

### **9. Amendments to the Regulations**

- **Paragraph 1.5(a)** of the original regulations was **replaced** by the following (effective December 1, 1998):
  > *"the confirmation number of the applicant’s declaration provided by a customs officer under subsection 3(1) or section 3.1 of the Importation and Exportation of Firearms Regulations (Individuals)"*
