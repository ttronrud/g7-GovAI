Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

## **Application of the Pay Equity Act to Ministers’ Offices Regulations**  
*(S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 416)*  
*Made under paragraph 181(1)(p) of the Pay Equity Act*

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**
This regulation applies the **Pay Equity Act** to the **grouping of ministers’ offices** in the federal government. It establishes how the Pay Equity Act governs the pay equity obligations of ministers’ offices, which are otherwise not subject to the Act under normal circumstances.

The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 181(1)(p)** of the Pay Equity Act, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour) to apply the Act to specific groups of employers — in this case, the offices of federal ministers.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Pay Equity Act*.
- **Grouping**: The grouping of ministers’ offices under the *Order Grouping Ministers’ Offices for the Purpose of a Pay Equity Plan*. This grouping is treated as a single employer for the purposes of the Pay Equity Act.

---

### **3. When the Grouping Becomes Subject to the Act**
Despite the general exclusion in sections 6 to 8 of the Pay Equity Act, the **grouping is automatically brought within the scope of the Act** under the following conditions:

- **On the day the Order Grouping Ministers’ Offices comes into force** — this is the initial activation date.
- **Upon the appointment of a new Prime Minister** — the grouping is deemed to become subject to the Act and is recognized by the Pay Equity Commissioner as a single employer **on the date of that appointment**.

> This ensures that changes in leadership do not disrupt the pay equity framework, and that the grouping remains subject to the Act regardless of political transitions.

---

### **4. Applicability of Pay Equity Act Provisions**
**General Rule**:  
All provisions of the Pay Equity Act and any regulations made under it that apply to **groups of employers recognized as a single employer under section 106** of the Act **apply to the grouping**.

> This means that the grouping is treated as one employer for the purposes of pay equity planning, reporting, and compliance.

---

### **5. Effect of a New Prime Minister’s Appointment**
- The **existing pay equity plan** posted by the grouping **ceases to apply** to the ministers whose offices are part of the grouping.
- The **obligations arising from the prior plan** (e.g., reporting, compensation, committee formation) **also cease**.

> This is a significant change — it resets the pay equity obligations when a new Prime Minister is appointed.

---

### **6. Appointment of a New Minister (Without Prime Minister Change)**
- If a new minister is appointed **without a change in the Prime Minister**, the **existing pay equity plan** is **deemed to have been posted by the new minister**.
- The new minister **assumes all the same obligations** as other ministers in the grouping (e.g., responsibility for updating the plan, establishing a committee, etc.).

> This ensures continuity of pay equity obligations during ministerial changes.

---

### **7. Exclusions from Certain Provisions**
The following provisions of the Pay Equity Act **do not apply** to the grouping:

- **Section 30** (provisions relating to certain types of employee classifications)
- **Subsections 61(2) and 62(4)** (specific obligations related to certain employee categories)
- **Section 63** (provisions on certain types of pay equity claims)
- **Subsection 78(2)** (specific obligations related to unionized employees)
- **Sections 107 and 113** (provisions on penalties and enforcement in certain contexts)

> These exclusions are made to tailor the Act’s application to the unique structure and nature of ministerial offices.

---

### **8. Adaptations to Key Provisions of the Act**

#### **Section 17 – Establishment of a Pay Equity Committee**
- The grouping **must make all reasonable efforts to establish a pay equity committee** for the pay equity plan it is required to establish.
- This mirrors the requirement for individual employers but applies to the grouping as a whole.

#### **Subsections 68(1) to (3) – Updating the Pay Equity Plan**
- The grouping **must make all reasonable efforts to establish a pay equity committee** when updating its pay equity plan.
- This ensures ongoing oversight and accountability in the plan’s revision process.

#### **Paragraphs 71(a) and (b) – Employee Count Thresholds**
The grouping’s employee count is determined based on the **average number of employees across all employers in the grouping**, calculated for the fiscal year immediately before the year in which the plan is posted.

- **If the sum of the average number of employees ≥ 100**, the grouping is considered to have **100 or more employees**.
- **If the sum of the average < 100**, the grouping is considered to have **less than 100 employees**.

> This is a key threshold that determines which provisions (e.g., penalties, plan requirements) apply.

#### **Subsection 83(1) – Posting of Revised Pay Equity Plan**
- Each employer in the grouping must post:
  - The **final version of the revised pay equity plan**, and
  - The **document referred to in subsection 79(2)** (e.g., a summary or supporting document)
- **Deadline**: No later than the **third anniversary** of:
  - The day the original plan was posted (under section 55 or subsection 57(2)); or
  - The day the previous final version of the revised plan was posted (under subsection 85(2)).

> This ensures regular updates and transparency in the plan.

#### **Subsection 88(2) – Lump Sum Compensation**
- If an employee is entitled to a **lump sum** for a period that begins on or after the day the **previous pay equity plan was posted** and ends by the day the **revised plan is posted**, the employer must pay that lump sum **on the day compensation is required to be increased** under subsection (4).

> This provides compensation for employees affected by changes in pay equity, ensuring fairness during transitions.

---

### **9. Adaptations to Penalties (Section 57 of the Pay Equity Regulations)**

Penalties for violations are adjusted based on the **size of the employer** and the **nature of the violation**.

#### **Applicable Violation Scenarios**:
- An employer with **less than 100 employees** at the time of violation, **that has not posted a notice under subsection 65(1)** of the Act.
- An employer referred to in **paragraph 127(2)(a)(ii)** of the Act (e.g., a bargaining agent).
- The **grouping** if the **sum of the average number of employees** is less than 100.
- A **bargaining agent** representing unionized employees of an employer in the above categories.

#### **How Employee Count is Determined**:
- **If the grouping has posted one or more notices under subsection 66(1)** (i.e., updated its pay equity plan), then:
  - The **sum of the average** is based on **paragraph 71(b)** (the average from the fiscal year before the plan update).
- **Otherwise**, the average is deemed to be the **number of employees at the time of the violation**.

> This ensures that the employee count used for penalties reflects the most recent and relevant data.

---

### **10. Adaptations to Penalty Calculations (Sections 57(5) and (6))**

#### **For Paragraphs (3)(a) and (4)(a)** (penalties for first/second/third violations):
- If the employer has posted a notice under subsection 65(1), the average is based on **paragraph 69(a)** (most recent notice).
- Otherwise, the average is the number of employees at the time of violation.

#### **For Paragraphs (3)(b) and (4)(b)** (penalties for certain types of violations):
- If the grouping has posted one or more notices under subsection 66(1), the **sum of the average** is based on **paragraph 71(a)**.
- Otherwise, the average is the number of employees at the time of violation.

> These adjustments ensure penalties are consistent with the grouping’s status and recent activity.

---

### **11. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **day they are registered**.
