**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Defining Local and Distant Signals under the Copyright Act**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** and the **Minister of Communications**, pursuant to **subsection 28.01(3)** of the *Copyright Act* (S.C. 1988, c. 65, s. 63).  

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define what constitutes a "local signal" and a "distant signal"** for the purposes of **subsection 28.01(2)** of the Copyright Act. This classification is critical in determining the scope of copyright protection for broadcast content—specifically, whether a signal qualifies as "local" (and thus subject to certain rights or exemptions) or "distant" (and thus not).

> **Note**: These regulations were previously amended and partially repealed by *SOR/2004-33, s. 2*, but the current version remains in force as a key technical definition for copyright purposes.

## **1. Definition of "Area of Transmission"**

The term *area of transmission* defines the geographic region in which a broadcast signal can be reliably received. It varies depending on the type of station (terrestrial TV, FM radio, AM radio) and the signal type (analog or digital).

---

### **A. Terrestrial Television Stations**

#### **Analog Signals**
- The **area of transmission** includes:
  1. The area **within the predicted Grade B contour** of the station.
     - This contour is determined using a standardized method outlined in the **Schedule** to the regulations.
     - Grade B refers to a field strength level that ensures reception under typical conditions.
  2. An additional **32 km buffer zone** extending outward from the Grade B contour.

> **Purpose**: To account for both the primary coverage area and the practical reach of analog signals, which are more susceptible to terrain and atmospheric interference.

#### **Digital Signals**
- The **area of transmission** includes:
  1. The area **within the noise-limited bounding contour** of the station.
     - This contour is based on the **BPR-10 document** (Application Procedures and Rules for Digital Television Undertakings, Issue 1, published by the Department of Industry in August 2010).
     - The noise-limited contour reflects the maximum distance at which a digital signal can be received with acceptable quality (i.e., without degradation due to noise).
  2. An additional **32 km buffer zone** extending from that contour.

> **Note**: Digital signals are more efficient and less prone to interference than analog signals, so their coverage is defined by a more precise technical standard (noise-limited contour).

---

### **B. Terrestrial FM Radio Stations**

- The **area of transmission** is defined as:
  - The area **within the predicted 0.5 mV/m field strength contour**.
  - This contour is derived using the method specified in the **Schedule** to the regulations.

> **Field Strength Standard**: 0.5 mV/m is a widely accepted threshold for reliable FM reception in most urban and suburban environments.

---

### **C. Terrestrial AM Radio Stations**

- The **area of transmission** is defined as:
  - The area **within a radius of 32 km from the principal studio** of the station.

> **Rationale**: AM signals travel long distances via ground wave propagation, especially at night, and their coverage is often not strictly defined by a fixed contour. Therefore, a fixed radius of 32 km is used as a practical approximation for copyright purposes.

---

## **2. Definition of "Local Signal" (for subsection 31(2) of the Copyright Act)**

A **local signal** is defined as a signal that originates from a terrestrial radio or television station whose transmission area **fully covers** a specific portion of a cable retransmitter’s service area.

### **Two Scenarios**:

1. **Entire Service Area of a Cable Retransmitter**  
   → A local signal is one where the **area of transmission of the terrestrial station covers the entire service area** of the cable retransmitter.

2. **Portion of the Service Area of a Retransmitter**  
   → A local signal is one where the **area of transmission of the terrestrial station covers all of that specific portion** of the retransmitter’s service area.

> **Implication**: If a cable system retransmits a signal from a terrestrial station whose coverage includes the entire or a part of the cable’s service area, that signal is considered a "local signal" and may be subject to different copyright rules (e.g., fair dealing or limited use rights).

---

## **3. Definition of "Distant Signal"**

- A **distant signal** is **any signal that is not a local signal**.

> This is a straightforward negative definition. If a signal does not meet the criteria for a local signal (i.e., its area of transmission does not fully cover any portion of the cable retransmitter’s service area), it is classified as a distant signal.

> **Copyright Implication**: Distant signals are generally treated differently under copyright law—often requiring more stringent licensing or authorization for reproduction or distribution.

## **4. Methodology for Determining Antenna Height Above Average Terrain (HAAT)**

HAAT (Height Above Average Terrain) is a key technical parameter used in determining signal reach and contour lines.

### **Steps to Determine HAAT**:

1. **Mark the transmitting site** on a topographical map using its **geographical coordinates**.
2. **Draw two concentric circles**:
   - One with a **radius of 3 km** (inner circle)
   - One with a **radius of 16 km** (outer circle)
3. **Draw eight radial lines** from the site, spaced **every 45°** (0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°).
4. For **each radial**, draw a **profile graph**:
   - X-axis: distance in kilometers (from 3 km to 16 km)
   - Y-axis: elevation in meters above mean sea level
   - The graph reflects the actual topography of the terrain between 3 km and 16 km.
5. **Calculate average terrain elevation** for each segment:
   - Using a **planimeter** (to measure area under the profile)
   - Or by dividing the segment into equal sectors and averaging the median elevations
   - Or by taking elevations at **sufficiently spaced points** to represent terrain accurately
6. **Calculate HAAT** for each radial:
   - HAAT = Height of antenna above sea level (at center of radiation)  
     − Average elevation of terrain (in that radial segment)

> **Note**: HAAT is calculated separately for each radial due to terrain variation. It is a critical input for propagation modeling.

## **5. Field Strength Thresholds for Television Contours**

The **predicted Grade B contour** (for analog TV) is defined by specific field strength levels depending on the channel:

| Channel Range | Field Strength |
|-------------|----------------|
| Channels 2 to 6 | 47 dB above 1 µV/m |
| Channels 7 to 13 | 56 dB above 1 µV/m |
| Channels 14 to 69 | 64 dB above 1 µV/m |

> **Explanation**:
> - These values represent the **minimum signal strength** required for a viewer to receive a clear and usable signal.
> - Higher dB values indicate stronger required signals, reflecting the increased transmission power or better propagation characteristics for higher channels.

---

## **6. Determining Signal Reach Using Propagation Curves**

To determine the **distance to the contour point** (i.e., the edge of the coverage area):

1. Use the **HAAT** and **Effective Radiated Power (ERP)** values.
2. Apply the appropriate **F(50,50) propagation curves** (Tables I to III).
   - These are standardized models that predict how radio waves propagate over terrain and distance.
   - F(50,50) refers to a specific propagation model used for 50% of the time and 50% of the terrain, providing a realistic estimate of signal reach.
3. For directional antennas:
   - Use the **ERP value in the direction of each radial**.
4. For omnidirectional antennas:
   - Use the ERP in the plane of maximum radiation.

> **Reference Line**: The **40 dB line** is used as a reference for an ERP of **1 kW**. This helps standardize comparisons between different stations and signal strengths.

---

## **7. Constructing the Contour Line**

- After calculating the distance to the contour point on each radial, the points are **joined by a smooth curve** to form the final **predicted contour**.
- This contour represents the boundary of the area where the signal is strong enough to be considered reliably receivable.

## **Key Implications for Copyright Law**

These regulations directly impact **copyright protection and licensing** for broadcast content:

- **Local signals** (those whose transmission area fully covers a portion of a cable retransmitter’s service area) may be subject to **more favorable copyright exceptions**, such as:
  - Fair dealing for private use
  - Limited reproduction or retransmission
- **Distant signals** (those not meeting the local signal criteria) are generally **subject to stricter copyright rules**, requiring:
  - Licensing
  - Compensation
  - Prohibitions on unauthorized use
