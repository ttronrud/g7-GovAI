**Detailed Summary of the Teleglobe Canada Pension Protection Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Teleglobe Canada Pension Protection Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of State (Privatization)** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to **Section 25 of the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act** (*S.C. 1987, c. 12*).

This regulatory instrument is designed to **protect the pension rights of public service employees** who were transitioning from the federal public service to a newly established private corporation — Teleglobe Canada — as part of a broader privatization process.

These regulations may be cited as the **Teleglobe Canada Pension Protection Regulations**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act*, which provides the legal framework for the restructuring and divestiture of Teleglobe Canada.
- **New Corporation**: Refers to the newly formed private corporation (Teleglobe Canada) resulting from the reorganization and divestiture under the Act.

---

### **3. Applicability of Existing Pension Laws**

The regulations state that **all provisions of the following Acts and their associated regulations apply to employees referred to in paragraph 25(1)(d) of the Act**, *except where specifically adapted* under Sections 4 and 5 of the Act:

- **Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act (SRBA)**  
- Regulations made under those Acts (as amended)

This means that the standard pension rules governing public servants generally continue to apply to these employees — but with **key modifications** to account for the transition from public service to a private entity (Teleglobe Canada).

### **4. Adaptations to the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**

#### **Section 25 of the Act – Adaptation of Subparagraphs 9(7)(b)(i) and (ii)**

These provisions relate to the **determination of pensionable service years** and how retirement is calculated.

**Key Change:**
- The **year in which a person ceased to be employed in the Public Service** is now treated as the **year in which they ceased to be employed by the new corporation**.

👉 This effectively **aligns the retirement date** for pension purposes between public service and employment with Teleglobe Canada. It prevents a gap or mismatch in pension calculations due to the transition.

#### **Section 25 of the Act – Adaptation of Sections 11 and 12 of the PSSA**

These sections govern the **calculation of pensionable service** and **eligibility for pensions**.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Inclusion of Service with the New Corporation**:
   - The number of years of pensionable service, and any periods of employment, **shall include** any service or employment with the new corporation during the period:
     - Starting on the **day the person ceases to be employed in the Public Service**, and
     - Ending on the **day immediately preceding the day** the person ceases to be employed by the new corporation.

   👉 This ensures that the **transition period** between public service and employment with Teleglobe Canada is **counted as pensionable service**, preserving pension benefits.

2. **Retirement Date Adjustment**:
   - For all purposes **except subsection 11(4)**, the **day a person ceases to be employed in the Public Service** is considered the **same day** they cease to be employed by the new corporation.

   👉 This eliminates a potential discrepancy in retirement eligibility dates and ensures that pension entitlements are not disrupted by the change in employer.

> *Exception*: Subsection 11(4) of the PSSA (which may relate to specific pension benefits like early retirement or disability) is **not affected** by this adaptation.

---

### **5. Adaptations to the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act (SRBA)**

These provisions relate to **supplementary retirement benefits**, including contributions and retirement eligibility.

#### **Section 25 of the Act – Adaptation of Subsection 4(3)**

- The **retirement year or retirement month** of a person is considered to be:
  - **1987**, or
  - **April 1987**, depending on the individual’s circumstances.

👉 This adjustment ensures that **all employees are treated uniformly** in terms of retirement year for purposes of calculating benefits, even though their actual employment may have ended at different times. It reflects the timing of the reorganization (April 1987) and provides consistency in benefit calculations.

#### **Section 25 of the Act – Adaptation of Subparagraphs 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii)**

These paragraphs relate to the **year in which a person ceased contributing** to the Supplementary Retirement Benefits Account (SRBA).

- The year in which a person ceased contributing to the SRBA is considered to be the **year in which they ceased to be employed by the new corporation**.

👉 This ensures that **contribution periods** are aligned with employment with Teleglobe Canada, not with the earlier public service employment. It avoids confusion in tracking when contributions stopped and ensures accurate benefit calculations.

### **6. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force **on and after April 4, 1987**.

This date coincides with the official start of the transition period from public service to Teleglobe Canada, making it a critical milestone in the privatization process.

---

### **7. Purpose and Significance**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure continuity and fairness** in pension entitlements for public service employees transitioning to Teleglobe Canada.
- **Prevent loss of pension benefits** due to the change in employer status.
- **Provide clarity and consistency** in how pensionable service, retirement dates, and contribution periods are calculated during the transition.
- **Protect employees** from adverse outcomes that might otherwise result from a sudden shift from a public to a private employer.

By adapting key provisions of the PSSA and SRBA, the regulations effectively **bridge the gap** between public service pension rules and private-sector employment, ensuring that employees are not disadvantaged by the reorganization.

### **Conclusion**

By carefully adapting key pension provisions, the regulations ensure that employees’ pension rights are **protected, consistent, and fairly calculated** throughout the transition from public service to Teleglobe Canada. They reflect a balance between administrative efficiency and employee protection, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to privatization that respects long-term financial commitments.
