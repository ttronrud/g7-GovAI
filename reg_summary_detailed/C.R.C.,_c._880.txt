**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Compensation Regulations**

---

### **Regulation Title**  
*Government Employees Compensation Regulations*  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Government Employees Compensation Regulations*.

---

### **Purpose and Scope**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **extend compensation rights to government employees and their dependants** in cases where a disease arises not from an industrial (workplace-related) cause, but due to **specific occupational or environmental factors tied to the employee’s job**, or due to **environmental conditions in a location outside Canada** to which the employee was assigned.

This regulation establishes that **certain non-industrial diseases**—though not traditionally classified as industrial diseases—may still qualify for compensation under the *Government Employees Compensation Act*, provided they are directly linked to the nature of the employee’s employment or to environmental conditions abroad.

---

## **Key Provisions**

---

### **1. Compensation for Diseases Due to the Nature of Employment (Non-Industrial Diseases)**

> *An employee who is disabled by reason of a disease that is not an industrial disease but is due to the nature of his employment and peculiar to or characteristic of the particular process, trade or occupation in which he is employed at the time the disease was contracted, and the dependants of a deceased employee whose death is caused by reason of such a disease, are entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as they would be entitled to receive under the Government Employees Compensation Act if the disease were an industrial disease.*

#### **Key Elements:**
- **Eligibility**: Applies to employees with a disease that:
  - Is **not classified as an industrial disease** (i.e., not caused by workplace hazards like machinery, chemicals, or physical strain in the traditional sense).
  - Is, however, **inherently linked to the nature of the employee’s job**.
  - Is **peculiar or characteristic** of the specific process, trade, or occupation in which the employee works.
- **Compensation**: The employee or dependant is entitled to receive **the same rate of compensation** as if the disease were an industrial disease.
- **Equal Treatment**: The right to compensation and the amount of such compensation are determined **in the same way** as if the disease were industrial—by the same **board, officers, or authorities**, using the same **criteria, procedures, and standards**.

#### **Example**:  
An employee working in a high-altitude mining operation may develop a respiratory condition due to low oxygen levels—this is not a typical industrial disease, but it is a known occupational hazard of the job. Under this regulation, such a disease would be treated as an industrial disease for compensation purposes.

### **2. Compensation for Diseases Caused by Environmental Conditions Abroad**

> *Any employee, except an employee engaged locally outside Canada, who is disabled by reason of any disease that results from the environmental conditions of any place outside Canada to which he was assigned and the dependants of a deceased employee whose death is caused by reason of such a disease, are entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as they would be entitled to receive under the Government Employees Compensation Act if the disease were an industrial disease, and the right to and the amount of such compensation shall be determined by the same board, officers or authorities and in the same manner as if the disease were an industrial disease.*

#### **Key Elements:**
- **Eligibility**: Applies to employees **assigned to a location outside Canada** (excluding those who are "engaged locally outside Canada").
- The disease must result from **environmental conditions** in that foreign location (e.g., extreme heat, cold, radiation, high altitude, poor air quality, etc.).
- Compensation is **equal in amount and treatment** to what would be granted for an industrial disease.
- The determination process (who reviews the claim, how it is assessed, what standards apply) is **identical** to that used for industrial diseases.

#### **Example**:  
A government employee posted to a remote Arctic research station develops a severe respiratory illness due to prolonged exposure to cold and dry air. This illness is not an industrial disease in the traditional sense but is directly attributable to the environmental conditions of the assignment. The employee and their dependants are entitled to compensation under the same rules as if it were an industrial disease.

### **3. Medical Certification Requirement (Revoked)**

> *For the purposes of determining whether an employee or his dependants are entitled to receive compensation under this section, a certificate of a medical doctor employed by the Department of National Health and Welfare certifying that the disease is clearly attributable to environmental conditions of the place outside Canada to which the employee was assigned, and [Revoked, SOR/86-942, s. 1] shall be accepted as prima facie proof that the disease results from the environmental conditions of the place outside Canada to which the employee was assigned.*

> *[Revoked, SOR/86-942, s. 2]*

#### **Summary of the Provision (as originally intended):**
- A **medical certificate** from a doctor employed by the Department of National Health and Welfare would have been **accepted as prima facie (initial) evidence** that a disease resulted from environmental conditions abroad.
- This meant that such a certificate would **carry significant weight** in the determination of eligibility, reducing the burden on the claimant to prove causation.

#### **Status: Revoked**  
- This provision has been **revoked** by **SOR/86-942, sections 1 and 2** (Statutory Order 86-942).
- As a result, **the requirement for a certificate from a Department of National Health and Welfare doctor is no longer in force**.
- The current process for establishing causation likely relies on **independent medical evidence**, **expert testimony**, or **other forms of documentation**, rather than a specific government-issued certificate.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The revocation means that **no longer is a certificate from a Department of Health and Welfare doctor required or automatically accepted** as proof. Claimants must now provide **medical evidence** (from any qualified physician) demonstrating that the disease is attributable to environmental conditions abroad, and this evidence will be evaluated by the compensation board on its merits.

## **Key Implications and Interpretations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Broader Scope** | Expands compensation beyond traditional industrial diseases to include occupational diseases tied to job-specific conditions or environmental exposure abroad. |
| **Equal Compensation** | Employees with non-industrial diseases linked to work or foreign assignments receive **the same benefits** as those with industrial diseases. |
| **Consistent Review Process** | The compensation process remains **transparent, uniform, and governed by the same standards** as industrial disease claims—ensuring fairness and consistency. |
| **Revoked Certification Requirement** | The reliance on a government medical certificate has been removed, shifting the burden to **independent medical evidence**. This may increase the burden of proof on claimants but also ensures more flexibility and objectivity in assessing causation. |

## **Conclusion**

These Regulations establish a **significant expansion of compensation rights** for government employees suffering from diseases that arise from:
1. The **nature of their employment** (e.g., occupational hazards unique to a trade or process), or  
2. **Environmental conditions abroad** during overseas assignments.

Despite the revocation of a specific medical certification requirement, the core principle remains: **such diseases are treated as if they were industrial diseases** for the purpose of compensation eligibility, amount, and review process.

This ensures that employees who suffer health consequences due to their work environment—whether at home or abroad—are not denied benefits simply because the disease is not traditionally classified as industrial.

---

**Note on Legal Status**:  
As of the revocation in SOR/86-942, the medical certificate requirement is **no longer valid**. All claims must now rely on **medical evidence from qualified physicians**, evaluated by the compensation board according to established standards.

These regulations reflect a progressive approach to workplace health protection, recognizing that work-related health risks can manifest in diverse and non-traditional forms.
