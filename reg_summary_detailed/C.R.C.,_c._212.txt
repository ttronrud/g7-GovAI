### **Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply **only** to:
  - The **marketing** of greenhouse vegetables in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export** (sales outside Canada).
  - Persons and property **located within the Province of Ontario**.

> Importantly, the rules do **not** extend to intra-provincial sales, local retail distribution, or private consumption.

---

### **Compliance with National Standards**

#### **Section 1: Grade Compliance**
- **No producer** may deliver a product to a shipper if it does **not meet the grades** established under the *Canada Agricultural Products Standards Act* (CAPSA).
- **No shipper** may accept delivery of a product that fails to meet CAPSA grade requirements.

> This ensures uniformity and quality across Canada, protecting consumers and maintaining market integrity.

---

### **Packaging and Labeling Requirements**

- Every person who packs greenhouse vegetables must **mark all containers** according to:
  - The *Farm Products Grades and Sales Act of Ontario*,
  - And the regulations made under that Act.

> This includes labeling with variety, weight, date of harvest, and other required information to ensure transparency and traceability.

---

### **Product Inspection and Cooling Requirements**

#### **1. Inspection Requirement**
- Every shipper must **inspect** each product received to verify that it complies with the provisions of **Section 4** (which refers to the grading and quality standards under CAPSA).

> This ensures quality control at the point of receipt before further handling or shipment.

#### **2. Cooling Requirement (Within 12 Hours)**
- Any product **received on the same day it is shipped** must be **cooled to between 13°C and 18°C within 12 hours** of receipt.

> This temperature range helps preserve freshness, prevent spoilage, and maintain quality during transit.

> *Note:* This applies only to products not shipped on the day of receipt.

---

### **Rail Transport Requirements**

- When shipping greenhouse vegetables via **railway car**, the product must be loaded:
  - In accordance with **loading and refrigeration instructions** provided by the railway company,
  - And in compliance with those instructions required for the **safe arrival** of the product at its destination.

> This ensures safe transport and minimizes damage or quality loss due to improper loading or temperature fluctuations.

---

### **Motor Vehicle Transport Beyond 100 Miles**

- For shipments by **motor vehicle** to destinations **beyond a 100-mile radius**:
  - The product must be **kept at a temperature between 13°C and 18°C** until it reaches its safe destination.

> This maintains product quality during long-distance transport and prevents spoilage due to temperature excursions.

---

### **Order of Shipment (First-In, First-Out Principle)**

- Every shipper must ship each **variety of greenhouse vegetable** in the **exact order in which it was received**.

> This prevents mixing of different batches and ensures traceability, quality consistency, and fair market practices.

---

### **Product Redistribution (Directed Delivery)**

- If the Commodity Board issues a **written direction**, a shipper must:
  - Deliver to a designated other shipper a specified quantity of the product currently in their possession.

> This allows for market stabilization, distribution balancing, or emergency supply during shortages.

- The **remuneration (payment)** for the product delivered will be **divided between the delivering shipper and the receiving shipper**, as determined by the Commodity Board.

> This promotes equitable compensation and encourages cooperation among shippers in the supply chain.

---

### **Inspection Rights of the Commodity Board**

- All **platforms, storage facilities**, and **shipment records** of every shipper must be:
  - **Available for inspection** by authorized representatives of the Commodity Board,
  - During **normal business hours**.

> This enables the Board to monitor compliance, ensure quality control, and enforce standards effectively.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Quality Assurance**: Enforces compliance with national grading standards to maintain product quality and consumer trust.
2. **Traceability & Accountability**: Requires labeling, inspection, and record-keeping to track products through the supply chain.
3. **Temperature Control**: Protects product integrity during transport via strict cooling and temperature guidelines.
4. **Market Stability**: Facilitates equitable distribution through directed deliveries and fair compensation.
5. **Compliance & Enforcement**: Empowers the Commodity Board to inspect facilities and shipments to ensure adherence to rules.
