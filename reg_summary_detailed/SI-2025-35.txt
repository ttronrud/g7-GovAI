**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of Parks Canada Agency  
**Legal Basis:** Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  
**Applicable Statute:** R.S., c. P-34 (The Public Service Act)  
**Governing Authority:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Provision Reference:** Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act

**Summary of the Regulation:**

On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, the **Governor General in Council** has formally transferred the **control and supervision** of the **Parks Canada Agency** from the **Minister of the Environment** to the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

This transfer is not a change in the agency’s mandate or operations, but rather a reassignment of administrative oversight and policy direction within the federal public service structure. It reflects a strategic realignment of federal departments and ministries to better align with broader government priorities, such as cultural heritage, national identity, and the integration of natural and cultural assets.

**Key Points:**

1. **Agency Involved:**  
   - The **Parks Canada Agency** is responsible for managing and protecting Canada’s national parks, including their natural, cultural, and recreational resources. It operates under the broader mandate of conserving and promoting Canada’s natural heritage.

2. **Transfer of Responsibility:**  
   - The **control and supervision** of the agency — meaning the authority to set policy, allocate resources, and oversee management — is being transferred from the **Minister of the Environment** to the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to reassign administrative responsibilities among federal ministers.

4. **No Change in Agency Mandate:**  
   - The operational functions, scientific management, and conservation responsibilities of Parks Canada remain unchanged. The transfer affects only the political and administrative oversight of the agency.

5. **Strategic Rationale:**  
   - This realignment likely reflects a broader government initiative to strengthen the integration of **natural heritage and cultural heritage** under a single ministry. The Minister of Canadian Heritage has a broader mandate that includes museums, historical sites, Indigenous heritage, and cultural programming — areas that often overlap with the cultural and historical significance of national parks.

6. **Effective Date:**  
   - While not explicitly stated in the excerpt, such transfers typically take effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette and are effective immediately upon formal notification.

7. **Implications:**  
   - Parks Canada will now operate under the policy direction and budgetary oversight of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. This may lead to greater coordination between park management and cultural heritage initiatives, such as Indigenous partnerships, historical preservation, and national identity programs.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal government. It shifts the oversight of Parks Canada from a ministry focused on environmental protection to one focused on cultural heritage. While the agency’s core mission of protecting natural landscapes remains intact, the change in ministerial responsibility underscores a growing emphasis on the cultural and historical dimensions of Canada’s natural spaces.

This transfer is consistent with broader federal efforts to streamline governance and enhance interdepartmental coordination in areas where environmental and cultural values intersect.
