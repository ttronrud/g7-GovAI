**Detailed Summary of the 2017 Toronto Invictus Games Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S. c. F-11)**. The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) has determined that it is in the **public interest** to provide a financial remission (i.e., waiver) of certain fees associated with temporary resident visa applications for individuals participating in the **2017 Invictus Games**.

The Invictus Games, a global sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick service members and veterans, was held in Toronto in 2017. The purpose of this Order is to facilitate participation by removing financial barriers for eligible individuals, thereby supporting the success and accessibility of the Games.

**3. Fees Remitted and Conditions**

Two specific fees are waived under this Order:

1. **Remission of the $100 processing fee**  
   - This fee is normally charged under **subsection 296(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)**.  
   - It covers the cost of processing an application for a **temporary resident visa (TRV)**.  
   - **Condition**: The applicant must be a participant as defined above.

2. **Remission of the $85 biometric information fee**  
   - This fee is charged under **subsection 315.1(1) of the IRPR**.  
   - It covers the cost of providing biometric information (such as fingerprints and photographs) as part of the visa application process.

**4. Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**

The remission is granted to:
- Promote participation in the 2017 Invictus Games by reducing financial burdens on eligible individuals.

- Recognize the importance of international collaboration and participation in such events.

By waiving these fees, the Government enables more individuals — including those from low-income or underrepresented backgrounds — to participate without financial disincentives.

**6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- Applicants must submit a valid application for a temporary resident visa and provide documentation confirming their participation or accreditation status.
- IRCC will process such applications with the waived fees applied automatically, provided the applicant meets the defined criteria.
