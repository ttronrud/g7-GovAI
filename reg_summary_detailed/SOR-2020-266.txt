**Detailed Summary of the *Denial of Licences for Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Regulations, 2021***  
*(S.C. 2019, c. 16, s. 78; R.S., c. 4 (2nd Supp.); SOR/97-180)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, under **section 78a of the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act (FOAEAA)**.  

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish the specific requirements for applications to deny a licence** under the FOAEAA. A licence is a legal authorization that allows a provincial enforcement service (e.g., a provincial government agency) to enforce a family order or agreement (such as a support order) against a debtor. A denial of such a licence prevents enforcement actions from being carried out, typically when there are concerns about the debtor’s identity or the legitimacy of the enforcement.

This regulation sets out the **mandatory information** that must be included in a licence denial application and outlines the **procedures for submission**, including delivery methods and effective dates.

---

### **2. Scope of the Regulation**
The regulation applies to:
- **Licence denial applications** under **subsection 67(2)** of the FOAEAA.
- **Requests for licence denial** under **subsection 72(2)** of the FOAEAA.

These are formal requests made by a provincial enforcement service to the federal government (via the Department of Justice) to block or deny the issuance of a licence to enforce a family order or agreement.

- The **date** on which the provincial enforcement service sent the notice (as referenced in **paragraph 67(3)(c) of the Act**) to the debtor.

> *Note: This notice is typically sent to inform the debtor of the enforcement action and to provide an opportunity to respond.*

#### **C. Declaration of Accuracy**

  - That all information provided in the application is **true and accurate**.
  - That the information was provided **specifically for the purpose of applying for a licence denial** under the Act.

- **Language of choice for correspondence**, if known

> *Note: This level of detail is intended to help verify the identity of the debtor and prevent enforcement actions against the wrong person. It reflects a strong emphasis on identity verification and fraud prevention.*

#### **E. Information About the Support Order**
The application must include:
- The **name of the court** that issued the support order.
- The **date the support order was issued**.
- The **names of the parties** involved in the support order (e.g., the debtor and the person entitled to support).

### **5. Repeal of Previous Regulations**
These regulations **repeal the previous *Denial of Licences for Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Regulations*** that were in force. This means that the current version is the **only applicable regulation** governing licence denial applications under the FOAEAA.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
The regulations come into force on:
- The day that **subsection 73(2) of the *Act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act and the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act*** comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> *Note: The regulation is referenced as being in force on November 12, 2021, under SI/2020-75.*

### **7. Key Implications and Rationale**

- **Identity Verification**: The detailed personal information required reflects a commitment to **preventing identity fraud** and **enforcement of the wrong person**—a major concern in family law enforcement.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement for a declaration of accuracy and the need for a formal notice date ensure that all applications are properly documented and traceable.
- **Provincial-Federal Coordination**: By requiring pre-agreed electronic communication, the regulation promotes **efficient and secure cooperation** between provincial enforcement bodies and the federal Department of Justice.
- **Legal Clarity**: The regulation provides **clear, standardized procedures** for when and how a licence denial can be requested, reducing ambiguity in enforcement practices.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Denial of Licences for Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Regulations, 2021* establish a **comprehensive, transparent, and identity-focused framework** for provincial enforcement services to request the denial of licences to enforce family orders. By mandating detailed personal and financial information, requiring formal declarations, and specifying submission protocols, the regulation strengthens the integrity of enforcement while protecting individuals from wrongful enforcement actions.

It represents a significant step in balancing the need for effective enforcement of family support orders with the imperative to protect personal privacy and prevent identity misuse.

**Final Note**: These regulations are part of a broader effort to modernize and clarify the enforcement mechanisms under the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, ensuring that enforcement actions are both lawful and fair.
