**Detailed Summary of the Faro Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The Faro Airport Zoning Regulations are established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5** of the Aeronautics Act: This section provides for the publication of proposed regulations in official government publications (e.g., *Canada Gazette Part I* and local newspapers like *The Whitehorse Star*) to allow for public comment.
- **Section 5.4** of the Aeronautics Act: This section authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed zoning regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input has been provided.

On **August 12 and 19, 1995**, a proposed version of the regulations was published in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I*, and in two successive issues of *The Whitehorse Star* on **July 12 and 13, 1995**. This ensured that interested parties—including landowners, developers, aviation stakeholders, and the public—had sufficient time to submit representations or objections to the proposed rules.

Following this public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, formally enacted the regulations on **September 1995** (implied by the date of issuance in the text).

### **2. Official Title and Citation**

These regulations are officially titled:  
👉 **Faro Airport Zoning Regulations**  
They may be cited as: **Faro Airport Zoning Regulations** (S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10)

### **3. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several critical terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Faro Airport, located in the vicinity of Faro, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a benchmark for elevation and spatial measurement. Located on the centerline of runway 08–26, 609.5 meters from the threshold of runway 08. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 08–26). These define safe zones for aircraft during landing approaches. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing field designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. For Faro Airport, this is associated with runway 08–26. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes that rise from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending outward and upward to a defined height. These protect aircraft during approach and departure phases by reducing interference from terrain or obstructions. |

---

### **4. Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **711.4 meters above sea level**.  
- All measurements and height limits in the regulations are referenced to this point.

---

### **5. Geographic Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all land**, including **public road allowances**, that lies **directly beneath**:

- The **approach surfaces**, or  
- The **transitional surfaces**

These surfaces are defined in **Parts II and IV of the Schedule** to the regulations and are based on the *Faro Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3043*, dated March 9, 1995.

This means that any land falling within the area under or adjacent to these imaginary planes is subject to the restrictions outlined in the regulations.

---

### **6. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**

#### **General Prohibition:**
No person may:
- Erect or construct a **building, structure, or object**, or
- Add to an existing **building, structure, or object**

**if the highest point of that object exceeds**:
- The **approach surface**, or  
- The **transitional surface**,  
at the location of that point.

This restriction ensures that no obstruction—whether man-made or natural—interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

> **Purpose**: To maintain safe visual and physical clearance for aircraft, especially during critical phases of flight when visibility and terrain are most vulnerable.

---

### **7. Regulation of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on land subject to these regulations grows to a height that **exceeds** the elevation of:
  - The approach surfaces, or  
  - The transitional surfaces,  
then the **Minister of Transport** may require the **owner or lessee** of the land to **remove the excess growth**.

> **Note**: This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural landscapes while still protecting aviation safety. It prevents trees or tall plants from becoming hazards during approach or departure.

### **8. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located on the centerline of runway 08–26.
- 609.5 meters from the threshold of runway 08.
- Serves as the origin point for all elevation and distance measurements.

#### **B. Approach Surfaces (Runway 08 and 26)**

Each approach surface is an inclined plane rising from the end of the runway strip:

- **Slope**: 1 meter vertically to 30 meters horizontally (i.e., 1:30 gradient).
- **Length**: Extends 2,500 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.
- **Top Plane**: At a horizontal distance of 2,500 meters from the end, the plane reaches an imaginary horizontal line:
  - 83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway.
  - The outer ends of this horizontal line are 295 meters from the centerline of the runway.
- Applies to both **runway 08 (approach)** and **runway 26 (approach)**.

> **Purpose**: To provide a clear, safe zone where aircraft can approach the runway without being blocked by terrain or structures.

#### **C. Strip (Runway 08–26)**

- **Width**: 90 meters total (45 meters on each side of the centerline).
- **Length**: 1,339 meters.
- Defines the active area of the runway where takeoffs and landings occur.

#### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

- **Slope**: 1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally (1:7 gradient).
- **Extent**: Extends upward and outward from:
  - The lateral edges of the strip, and  
  - The approach surfaces.
- **Height Limit**: Rises to a maximum of **45 meters above the elevation of the ARP (711.4 m)**.
- These surfaces protect aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, and departure phases by ensuring no obstructions are present beyond the runway edges.

> **Purpose**: To prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during vertical movement near the runway, especially during takeoff and departure when aircraft are climbing rapidly.

---

### **9. Legal and Operational Implications**

- The regulations are **binding and enforceable** under the Aeronautics Act.
- Violations may result in enforcement actions by the Minister of Transport, including:
  - Orders to remove structures or vegetation.
  - Fines or penalties (implied under related statutes).
- The rules are **technology-neutral**—they apply regardless of whether the land is privately owned, public, or used for roads or development.

### **10. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Faro Airport Zoning Regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining safe vertical and horizontal clearance for aircraft during all phases of flight.
2. **Protect flight operations** at Faro Airport, which is a key regional aviation hub in Yukon.
3. **Prevent interference** from buildings, structures, or natural growth during approach, takeoff, and landing.
4. **Provide clear, measurable boundaries** through defined geometric surfaces (approach and transitional zones) based on engineering standards.

### **11. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Landowners** | Must ensure all structures and vegetation do not exceed the approach or transitional surfaces. |
| **Developers** | Cannot build or expand any structure within the designated zones without prior approval. |
| **Environmental Managers** | Must monitor natural growth and remove any vegetation exceeding height limits. |
| **Ministry of Transport** | Has authority to enforce compliance and issue removal orders. |
