The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of various sections of a regulation, specifically indicating that multiple provisions have been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2009-315, section 103**, and in some cases by **SOR/96-116** (a prior statutory regulation order) or **SOR/2002-170**.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Text**
The content is **not a regulation itself**, but rather a **list of repeals** — a list of previously enacted sections of a regulation that have been officially removed from force. The repeated entries such as:
- `[Repealed, SOR/2009-315, s. 103]`
- `[Repealed, SOR/96-116, s. 3]`
- `[Repealed, SOR/2009-315, s. 103]`

indicate that multiple provisions from various statutory regulation orders (SORs — Statutory Orders) have been **canceled or superseded** by a later legislative action.

#### 2. **Key Repealing Instrument**
- **SOR/2009-315, s. 103** is the primary repealing provision.
  - This section of the **Statutory Order 2009-315** (issued on June 19, 2009) specifically **repeals numerous sections** of earlier regulations.
  - The repeated appearance of this section in the list confirms that **a large number of provisions were removed** under this order.

#### 3. **Repealed Regulations and Sections**
The list references sections from two main sources:
- **SOR/96-116** (a regulation from 1996), which includes sections such as:
  - s. 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34
- **SOR/2002-170** (a 2002 regulation), specifically:
  - s. 6

These sections were previously part of regulatory frameworks, likely related to **public safety, health, environmental standards, or licensing**, depending on the original regulation. However, without knowing the original regulation name (e.g., *Regulation respecting the use of certain substances*, or *Regulation under the Health Protection Act*), the exact subject matter cannot be precisely identified.

#### 4. **Purpose of the Repeal**
The repeals likely occurred to:
- **Modernize outdated or obsolete rules**
- **Eliminate overlapping or conflicting provisions**
- **Align with new legislation or policy directions**
- **Simplify the regulatory framework**

For example, if the original regulation was outdated due to changes in technology, law, or public health, the repeal allows for a cleaner, more relevant regulatory structure.

#### 5. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- **No active legal effect**: Since all listed sections are **repealed**, they no longer apply.
- **No enforcement or penalties** can be applied under these sections.
- Any legal or administrative actions previously based on these provisions are now **invalid or superseded**.
- Regulators or authorities must now refer to **current, active regulations** for compliance.

#### 6. **Limitations of the Summary**
- The text **does not contain the original regulation** or its content.
- It does **not specify the subject matter** (e.g., food safety, hazardous materials, environmental protection).
- It lacks context such as the **name of the parent regulation** or the **reason for repeal** (e.g., merger, obsolescence, policy shift).

### Final Summary:

> The provided text is a list of **repealed sections** from various statutory regulations, primarily under **SOR/96-116** and **SOR/2002-170**, which were officially **canceled by SOR/2009-315, section 103**. These repeals indicate that multiple provisions — including sections from s. 3 to s. 34 of SOR/96-116 and s. 6 of SOR/2002-170 — are no longer in force. The repeal likely reflects a legislative effort to modernize, simplify, or update outdated regulatory requirements. As of the date of SOR/2009-315, these sections have **no legal effect** and must be replaced by current, active regulations. Without access to the original regulation name or context, the specific subject area (e.g., health, safety, environment) cannot be definitively identified.
