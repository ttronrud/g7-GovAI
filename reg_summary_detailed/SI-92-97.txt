**Detailed Summary of the Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order*, was issued on **October 24, 1991**, under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act** (specifically subsection 23(2.1)).

The primary purpose of the Order is to **grant remission (i.e., a partial or full cancellation) of unemployment insurance (UI) premiums** that certain employees of the **Cape Breton Development Corporation (CBDC)** had previously paid under the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (UI Act), in specific circumstances related to pre-retirement employment and disability pension eligibility.

The decision was made in the public interest, following recommendations from the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**, reflecting a policy aimed at providing relief to employees who experienced unique employment and retirement conditions.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is authorized under **subsection 23(2.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on ministerial advice) to make orders for the remission of certain payments, including unemployment insurance premiums, when it is in the public interest.

This provision provides flexibility in administrative and fiscal policy, particularly in cases involving specific employee groups with unusual or transitional employment arrangements.

### **3. Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order*  
- **Citation**: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
- This Order may be cited as such and is part of the broader legislative framework governing unemployment insurance contributions and benefits.

---

### **4. Key Definitions**

The Order includes the following key definitions to clarify its scope and application:

- **"Act"** refers to the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (Loi). This establishes the legal foundation for the UI system and the rules governing contributions and benefits.

- **"Individual"** includes not only the person themselves but also their **heir or legal representative**. This ensures that the remission benefit extends beyond the original employee to cover beneficiaries in the event of death or legal succession.

- **"Severance benefit"** is defined as an amount payable under **subsection 19(2)** of the *Unemployment Insurance Act*, **as that section read before October 23, 1990**.  
  - This is a critical definition because it limits the scope of the remission to a specific historical version of the severance benefit provision.  
  - The reference to the pre-October 23, 1990 version indicates that the Order applies only to severance payments made under the older, pre-amended version of the Act, which may have different rules or thresholds than current ones.

---

### **5. Scope of Remission**

The remission applies to **specific employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation** who meet the following criteria:

#### **Eligibility Criteria**:
- The individual must have:
  - Paid an **unemployment insurance premium** as an employee under the **Cape Breton Development Corporation’s Pre-Retirement Leave Plan**;
  - During a period for which the individual **received a disability pension** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**.

#### **Remission Provision**:
- For such individuals, **remission of the unemployment insurance premium** is granted **in full** (i.e., the amount is forgiven or waived), **except** for:
  - The amount of any **severance benefit** paid to that individual.

> In other words:  
> **Remission = Full cancellation of UI premium**  
> **Minus = Amount of severance benefit received**

This means that if an employee received both a UI premium and a severance payment under the old Act, the premium is remitted (canceled), but only **after deducting the severance benefit**.

---

### **6. Temporal and Contextual Context**

- The policy applies to employees who:
  - Were employed under the **Pre-Retirement Leave Plan** of CBDC;
  - Paid UI premiums **after 1971** and **before June 8, 1989**;
  - Received a **disability pension** from the **Canada Pension Plan** during a period of employment under the CBDC’s plan.

This timeframe reflects a historical period when employment structures in public corporations like CBDC were transitioning toward retirement and pension systems, and when UI rules were evolving.

The exclusion of severance benefits (specifically under the pre-October 23, 1990 version) suggests that the government recognized that severance payments were a form of compensation that should not be double-counted or offset against UI premiums.

---

### **7. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor in Council determined that it was in the **public interest** to grant this remission. This likely stems from:

- Recognizing the unique employment and retirement conditions of CBDC employees;
- Acknowledging that these individuals were in a transitional phase (pre-retirement) and may have faced financial hardship due to disability;
- Avoiding double taxation or financial burden on employees who were already receiving CPP disability benefits;
- Promoting fairness and equity in the treatment of employees in public development corporations.

---

### **8. Practical Implications**

- **For Eligible Employees**:  
  They will no longer be required to pay the UI premium for the specified period of employment under the Pre-Retirement Leave Plan, even if they had previously contributed.

- **For Severance Payments**:  
  The amount of severance benefit received under the old Act (before October 23, 1990) will be **deducted** from the total remission.  
  Example:  
  - UI premium: $1,000  
  - Severance benefit: $300  
  - Remitted amount: $700  

- **For Legal Representatives or Heirs**:  
  If the employee passed away, their legal representative or heir may be entitled to the remission under the definition of "individual."

---

### **9. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Employees who did not participate in the Pre-Retirement Leave Plan;
  - Employees who did not receive a CPP disability pension during the relevant period;
  - Employees who paid premiums after June 8, 1989;
  - Severance benefits paid under the post-October 23, 1990 version of the Act (as the definition is tied to the pre-1990 version).

- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond the defined time period (post-1971, pre-June 8, 1989).

---

### **10. Conclusion**

The *Cape Breton Development Corporation Employees Pre-Retirement Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable measure designed to:

- Provide financial relief to employees of the Cape Breton Development Corporation who faced dual challenges—contributing to unemployment insurance and receiving disability benefits;
- Recognize the unique nature of pre-retirement employment plans;
- Ensure fairness in the UI system by adjusting contributions based on specific circumstances;
- Reflect the public interest in supporting employees during transitional retirement phases.

It is a **historical and policy-specific** regulation, not applicable to general employees or other corporations, and remains relevant only to those individuals meeting the narrow eligibility criteria outlined.

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
This Order is a **special remission provision** that cancels unemployment insurance premiums for CBDC employees who received CPP disability pensions during their pre-retirement employment, **with a deduction for severance benefits paid under the pre-October 1990 version of the Act**. It underscores the government’s recognition of the complex interplay between employment, retirement, and social insurance in public-sector contexts.
