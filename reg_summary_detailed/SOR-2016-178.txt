**Detailed Summary of the Charcoal Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Charcoal Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, are a set of safety rules designed to protect consumers from the dangers associated with the improper use of charcoal for domestic cooking or heating. These regulations were introduced to address the health risks posed by toxic fumes released when charcoal is burned without proper ventilation.

The regulations came into force on the day they were registered with the Government of Canada and are administered by the **Minister of Health**, on the recommendation of the Governor in Council.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Charcoal**  
   - Defined as *charcoal for use in domestic cooking or heating*.  
   - Excludes charcoal used for industrial or commercial purposes outside the home.  
   - Applies specifically to consumer-grade charcoal sold in Canada for household use.

2. **Principal Display Surface (PDS)**  
   - Refers to the surface of a container that is visible to the consumer at the time of sale or when the charcoal is being used.  
   - This includes the front, top, or any other surface that is prominently visible during retail display or during use.  
   - The warning must appear on this surface to ensure it is seen by consumers before purchase or during usage.

---

### **Mandatory Warning Requirements**

Every container of charcoal sold to consumers must carry a **clear, prominent, and easily legible warning** on each principal display surface. The warning must be presented in **both English and French**, as required by Canadian bilingualism laws.

#### **Content of the Warning**

The warning must clearly convey two key safety messages:

1. **Toxic fumes may occur and cause death if the charcoal is burned without adequate ventilation.**  
   - This highlights the danger of carbon monoxide (CO) and other toxic gases produced during incomplete combustion.

2. **The charcoal should not be used for cooking or heating indoors without a ventilation system that carries all the fumes outdoors.**  
   - Emphasizes that indoor use is unsafe unless equipped with a proper exhaust system (e.g., a chimney or ventilation hood) that vents all combustion byproducts to the outside.

### **Formatting and Design Requirements**

To ensure the warning is effective and noticeable, the following formatting rules apply:

- **Must begin with:**  
  - “**Warning**” in English  
  - “**Avertissement**” in French  
  - These words must be in **bold-face or medium-face type** and at least **9 mm in height**.

- **Information in paragraph 2(b)** (the safety messages) must be in **bold or medium-face type** and at least **4.5 mm in height**.

- **Visual prominence:**  
  - The warning must be **easily legible** and **clearly visible**.  
  - It must be **set apart from other text, images, or graphics** on the container to avoid being overlooked.  
  - It must be **enclosed by a borderline** (a border or frame) to visually distinguish it from surrounding content.

- **Color contrast:**  
  - The warning and its enclosing border must use a **color that contrasts sharply** with the background of the container.  
  - This ensures high visibility, even under different lighting conditions or on various container surfaces (e.g., dark vs. light).

### **Purpose and Public Health Objective**

The primary goal of these regulations is to:

- Prevent accidental exposure to **carbon monoxide**, a colorless, odorless, and potentially fatal gas.  
- Educate consumers about the **risks of burning charcoal indoors** without proper ventilation.  
- Reduce the number of preventable poisoning incidents and fatalities related to indoor charcoal use.  
- Ensure that consumers are fully informed before purchasing or using charcoal for cooking or heating at home.

---

### **Exclusions and Scope**

- The regulations **do not apply** to:
  - Charcoal used in outdoor settings (e.g., grilling in a backyard).
  - Charcoal used in commercial or industrial applications.
  - Charcoal used in camping or recreational settings where ventilation is not a concern.

- The rules apply **only to consumer products** sold in Canada for domestic use.

---

### **Repeal Note**

The regulations include a note stating “[Repeal]” — indicating that this regulation may have been replaced or superseded by a later amendment or new legislation. However, as of the date of this summary, the regulation remains in effect and is still referenced as a valid safety standard under the CCPSA.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada.  
- Registration occurred in 2010, meaning they have been in effect since that time.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Charcoal Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s consumer product safety framework. By mandating clear, visible, and easily understood warnings on charcoal containers, the regulations empower consumers to make informed decisions about safe use. The emphasis on bilingual communication, visual prominence, and color contrast ensures that even individuals with limited literacy or visual impairments can recognize and understand the risks involved in burning charcoal indoors.

These rules reflect a proactive approach to public health, aiming to prevent deaths and serious illness caused by carbon monoxide exposure in homes and private spaces.
