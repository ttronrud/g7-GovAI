**Key Provisions:**

1. **Designation of Minister:**

3. **Legal Basis and Process:**  
   - The designation is made pursuant to the **Public Service Employment Act**, specifically **Section 47**, which allows for the appointment of a Minister to act in a specific administrative capacity.

This may be necessary to provide a clear point of accountability and decision-making in matters related to public service employment, such as disciplinary actions, employment standards, or the administration of public service policies. It may also support the Minister’s role in ensuring compliance with employment equity, human rights, or other employment-related obligations under federal law.

6. **Constitutional and Administrative Context:**
