**Detailed Summary of the Tents Regulations (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67; S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The **Tents Regulations** are a regulatory instrument issued under **Section 37a of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. These regulations establish specific safety, flammability, and labelling requirements for tents and their components in Canada. They are designed to protect consumers—particularly children—from fire hazards associated with tent materials and to ensure that tents are safe for use in outdoor environments.

The regulations came into force on the day they were published in *Canada Gazette, Part II*, and were introduced to align with updated safety standards, particularly the **CAN/CGSB-182.1-2020** standard on flammability and labelling of tents.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Tent**  
   A structure that meets all of the following criteria:
   - Portable (designed to be easily transported)
   - Intended to shelter people from outdoor elements such as rain, sun, wind, or insects
   - Made, in whole or in part, of fabric or other pliable materials
   - Has a top
   - Has at least one side that constrains egress (i.e., limits exit)
   - Is **not subject** to the *National Building Code of Canada 2020* (which governs permanent structures)

   > *Note:* For the purposes of the safety standard, "tent" has the same meaning as defined here.

2. **Components and Accessories**  
   Items intended to be used with a tent, such as:
   - Side panels
   - Curtains
   - Footprints (flooring)
   - Flies (top coverings)
   - Gear lofts (storage areas)

   **Excluded from this definition:**
   - Packaging (e.g., bags for tents, poles, or stakes)
   - Threads, zippers, ropes, hook-and-loop fasteners, and webbing
   - Labels and logos with surface area ≤ 1,000 cm² (as calculated per Annex A of the safety standard)
   - Fabric or other pliable material with surface area ≤ 1,000 cm²

   > *Purpose:* This definition ensures that only significant, functional parts of a tent are subject to flammability and safety testing, while excluding minor, non-structural elements.

3. **Safety Standard**  
   The **CAN/CGSB-182.1-2020**, titled *Flammability and Labelling Requirements for Tents*, as amended from time to time.  
   This standard sets out:
   - Flammability performance requirements
   - Labelling requirements
   - Testing procedures

---

### **Core Safety and Compliance Requirements**

#### 1. **Flammability Requirements (Fabric and Pliable Materials)**  
When tested according to the safety standard:
- **All fabric and pliable materials** (in the tent or in components/accessories) must meet the flammability requirements specified in **Section 5.2.1** of CAN/CGSB-182.1-2020.

#### 2. **Flooring Material Requirements (if not meeting 5.2.1)**  
If a tent’s flooring material fails to meet the flammability standard in **Section 5.2.1**, it must instead meet the requirements in **Section 5.3.1** of the safety standard.  
> *This provides a safety fallback for floor materials that may be more combustible.*

#### 3. **Labelling Requirements**  
Tents must comply with the labelling requirements in **Section 6 of the safety standard**, which includes:
- Clear identification of the product (e.g., brand, model)
- Flammability rating (e.g., “Flame Spread Rating”)
- Age or user group warnings (e.g., “Not for children under 14”)
- Any applicable safety warnings or instructions

> *Note:* The term **"children’s tent"** in the standard refers to a tent:
- Intended for use by a child under 14 years of age
- Not intended to be used with a cooking or heating device (an "appliance")

> *Definition of "appliance":* A cooking or heating device (e.g., camp stove, heater).

### **Transition and Continuity Provisions (Grace Periods)**

To allow manufacturers and importers time to adapt to the new standard, the regulations include **transition periods**:

1. **For New Versions of the Safety Standard**  
   A tent that met a requirement **before the publication of a new version of the safety standard** may continue to meet that requirement:
   - For **manufacture or import**: for **1 year** from the date the new standard is published
   - For **advertising or sale**: for **2 years** from the date the new standard is published

2. **For Consumer Products Before Regulation Implementation**  
   Any consumer product (tent or toy) that met the applicable requirements **immediately before the coming into force of these regulations** is deemed to continue meeting those requirements for **2 years**, beginning on the day these regulations come into force.

> *Purpose:* These grace periods reduce disruption to the market, allowing time for compliance without penalizing existing products.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

- The **previous Tents Regulations** (which were superseded by this version) are **repealed**.
- This ensures that only the current, updated regulations apply.

---

### **Regulatory Enforcement and Application**

- The regulations apply to:
  - The **manufacture** and **importation** of tents into Canada
  - The **advertising** and **sale** of tents in Canada
- Compliance is enforced by the **Consumer Product Safety Act**, with the **Minister of Health** responsible for recommending the regulations to the Governor General in Council.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Consumer Safety**  
   Prevent fire hazards caused by flammable tent materials, especially in environments where tents are used by children or in proximity to open flames.

2. **Clear Labeling**  
   Ensure consumers (especially parents) are informed about the safety characteristics of the tent, including flammability and age-appropriate use.

3. **Market Clarity and Fairness**  
   Provide a consistent, science-based standard for all tents, while offering reasonable transition periods to avoid market disruption.

4. **Alignment with International Standards**  
   The adoption of CAN/CGSB-182.1-2020 reflects Canada’s alignment with global best practices in product safety.

### **Conclusion**

The Tents Regulations represent a modern, safety-focused update to Canada’s approach to tent product safety. By adopting the CAN/CGSB-182.1-2020 standard, the regulations ensure that tents are made from flame-resistant materials, clearly labeled, and suitable for safe use—especially by children. The inclusion of transition periods demonstrates a balanced regulatory approach that protects public safety while respecting the practical realities of industry compliance.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s broader consumer product safety framework, reinforcing the principle that safety standards must be both effective and practical.
