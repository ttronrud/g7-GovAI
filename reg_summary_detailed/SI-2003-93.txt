**Legal Basis and Authority:**  

1. **Canada Wildlife Act (CWA):**  
   - The regulation is grounded in the *Canada Wildlife Act*, which provides legal tools for the protection and management of wildlife and their habitats.  
   - **Subsection 4(3)a** allows the Governor General in Council (on ministerial recommendation) to authorize the Minister of the Environment to exercise certain powers when public lands are needed for wildlife research, conservation, or interpretation.  
   - **Subsection 4(2)c** grants the Minister of the Environment the power to designate or manage lands for wildlife purposes, including restrictions on land use, access, or development.  

2. **Joint Recommendation:**  
   - The decision was made jointly by the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of National Defence**, reflecting a collaborative assessment of the need for these lands in ecological and scientific contexts.  
   - This joint input underscores that the lands in question are under the administrative control of the Department of National Defence (e.g., military bases or defence-related infrastructure), but are being set aside for environmental purposes due to their ecological value.

3. **Governor General in Council:**  
   - The formal authorization is issued by the Governor General in Council, which is the constitutional mechanism by which federal ministers can enact regulations with the force of law. This reflects the federal government's authority under the Canada Wildlife Act to manage wildlife-related land use.

**Purpose and Justification:**  

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **designate specific public lands for wildlife research, conservation, and public interpretation**. This includes:  
- Conducting scientific studies on species, habitats, and ecosystems  
- Protecting and restoring native wildlife populations  
- Providing opportunities for public education and environmental awareness through interpretive programs  

The lands are deemed essential for these purposes due to their ecological significance, biodiversity, or unique natural features.  

By designating these areas, the government ensures that:  
- Development or activities that interfere with wildlife habitats are restricted  
- Research and monitoring activities can proceed without interference  
- Public access (where appropriate) is managed to support environmental education  

---

**Key Implications:**  

1. **Land Use Restriction:**  
   - The designated areas are no longer available for general land use (e.g., commercial development, agriculture, or construction) without prior approval.  
   - Any activity that could disrupt wildlife or habitat must be approved under the Canada Wildlife Act or other applicable environmental laws.

2. **Co-Management:**  
   - The **Minister of the Environment** is empowered to manage the lands for conservation and research purposes.  
   - However, this authority is exercised **only with the concurrence of the Minister of National Defence**, ensuring that military operations or defence-related activities are not compromised.

3. **Exclusion of Mineral Rights:**  
   - The exclusion of mines and minerals ensures that the conservation and research objectives are not undermined by mineral exploration or extraction. This supports long-term ecological integrity.

4. **Legal Enforceability:**  
   - The regulation is legally binding and enforceable under the Canada Wildlife Act. Violations may lead to penalties under the Act.

**Conclusion:**  

This regulation is a formal federal designation that protects and designates approximately **45,807 hectares (113,191 acres)** of public land in southern Alberta—specifically Areas "B" and "C" of the South Alberta Land Registration District—for the purposes of **wildlife research, conservation, and public interpretation**.  

It demonstrates a balance between national defence responsibilities and environmental stewardship, allowing for the preservation of ecologically significant areas while maintaining coordination between the Department of National Defence and the Department of the Environment. The regulation is a key tool in Canada’s broader strategy to protect biodiversity and support scientific understanding of natural systems.
