Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, including its context, legal basis, key provisions, and implications.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Background and Context**
The regulation is issued under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**, a Canadian law that enables the federal government to impose economic sanctions on individuals and entities associated with regimes or actions that threaten international peace, security, or Canada’s national interests.

The key factual background includes:
- The **Russian Federation’s actions**, particularly its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, are described as constituting a **grave breach of international peace and security**.
- These actions have triggered a **serious international crisis**, prompting Canada to take targeted economic measures against individuals linked to the Russian government or its elites.
- The individual in question is **Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich**, a Russian national who does not ordinarily reside in Canada.
- There is **property in Canada** (specifically, financial assets) that is **owned, held, or controlled directly or indirectly** by Abramovich.

This property is tied to a financial account held by **Manticore Fund (Cayman) Ltd.** at **Citco Bank Canada**, a financial institution operating in Canada.

#### **2. Legal Authority**
The regulation is grounded in specific provisions of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**:
- **Paragraph 4(1)(b)a**: Allows the Governor in Council to impose measures on individuals who are nationals of a country that is engaged in actions that constitute a grave breach of international peace and security.
- **Subsection 4(1.1)b**: Provides for the **restraint of financial assets** (i.e., freezing or restricting access) of individuals or entities linked to such actions, particularly when those assets are located or held in Canada.

These provisions are part of a broader framework of sanctions targeting individuals and entities associated with the Russian Federation’s actions, especially following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

#### **3. Specific Order**
The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, issues the following order:
- **Restrain (freeze)** the amount of **US$26,073,990.35**.
- This amount is:
  - Owned, held, or controlled **directly or indirectly** by Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich.
  - Credited to a **bank account held by Manticore Fund (Cayman) Ltd.** at **Citco Bank Canada**.
- The restraint is imposed in such a way that **no dealing** (i.e., no transfer, withdrawal, sale, or use) of the funds can occur.

This is a **financial freeze** — a common tool in international sanctions — designed to prevent the individual from accessing or using the funds, thereby limiting their ability to benefit from or support actions that undermine international peace and security.

#### **4. Legislative References**
The regulation is cited under:
- **S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(1)**: This refers to the specific section of the *Special Economic Measures Act* that authorizes the order in this case.
- **S.C. 2017, c. 21, s. 17(2)**: This is a general provision of SEMA that supports the authority to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to Russia.
- **S.C. 1992, c. 17**: This is the original enactment of the *Special Economic Measures Act*, which provides the foundational legal framework for such sanctions.

These references confirm that the order is both **authorized by statute** and **consistent with established legal precedent** under Canada’s sanctions regime.
