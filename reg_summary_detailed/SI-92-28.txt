**Detailed Summary of the Farm Equipment Income Tax and Canada Pension Plan Contributions Remission Order**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose of the Order**

This regulation, known as the **Farm Equipment Income Tax and Canada Pension Plan Contributions Remission Order**, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to specific provisions of the **Financial Administration Act** (specifically subsections 23(2) and (2.1)).

The primary purpose of the Order is to **remit (i.e., forgive or refund)** certain **income taxes and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions** that were previously assessed or paid by specific taxpayers due to reassessments under the *Income Tax Act* related to **trade-in allowances on farm equipment**.

The remission applies to taxpayers who were reassessed in the taxation years **1984, 1985, or 1986** for how trade-in allowances were treated in determining the cost basis of farm equipment used in agricultural operations.

### **2. Legal Basis and Citation**

- **Legal Authority**: The Order is made under subsections 23(2) and (2.1) of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empower the Governor General in Council to make orders for the remission of taxes and contributions when it is in the public interest.
- **Citation**: The Order may be cited as the **Farm Equipment Income Tax and Canada Pension Plan Contributions Remission Order**.
- **Reference to the Act**: "Act" refers to the *Income Tax Act*.

### **3. Key Definitions in the Order**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Income Tax Act* (Loi) |
| **Taxes** | Includes income taxes payable under Parts I to I.2 of the Act, any relevant refundable investment tax credit, and associated penalties and interest. |
| **Contributions** | CPP contributions (and any related penalties or interest) that were or would have been payable under the Canada Pension Plan. |
| **Taxpayer** | A person whose taxes were reassessed in 1984, 1985, or 1986 due to the treatment of trade-in allowances on farm equipment. |
| **Trade-in Allowance** | The amount agreed upon by the taxpayer and the vendor when farm equipment is traded in. This is not a fixed value but is determined by negotiation between buyer and seller. |

> *Note: The Order focuses on the treatment of trade-in allowances in calculating the "cost" of farm equipment for tax purposes.*

### **4. What Remission Is Granted**

Under **Section 3**, the Order grants a **remission** (a refund or cancellation) of taxes and contributions to each eligible taxpayer **only if** the following two conditions are met:

#### **Condition 1: For Farm Equipment Acquired**
> The **cost of farm equipment** acquired by the taxpayer must be equal to:
> - The **trade-in allowance** received, **plus**
> - The **value of any other consideration** (e.g., cash, goods) paid by the taxpayer.

This means that if the taxpayer received a trade-in allowance (e.g., $5,000) and paid $10,000 in cash, the total cost of the equipment is $15,000. The tax system previously may have incorrectly treated the trade-in allowance as a reduction in cost, leading to a higher taxable income. This Order corrects that error by allowing remission when the actual cost is properly calculated.

#### **Condition 2: For Farm Equipment Traded In**
> The **proceeds from the sale or disposition** of the traded-in equipment must equal the **trade-in allowance**.

This ensures that the value received from selling the old equipment matches the amount offered as a trade-in. If the proceeds were less than the trade-in allowance, the taxpayer may have been overcharged or over-assessed due to an incorrect cost calculation.

> ⚠️ **Important**: The remission applies only when both conditions are satisfied. If either condition fails, the remission does not apply.

### **5. Conditions for the Remission to Be Effective**

The remission is **not automatic**. It is conditional upon the taxpayer fulfilling the following requirements within **90 days** of receiving a notice from the **Department of National Revenue** about this Order:

#### **Requirement 1: File an Undertaking and Waiver**
The taxpayer must submit to the Minister of National Revenue:
- A **written undertaking and waiver** that is acceptable to the Minister.

This undertaking includes two key commitments:

##### **(a) Agreement to Pay Future Amounts**
The taxpayer agrees to pay **when due** to Her Majesty (i.e., the Crown) the difference between:
- The amount of taxes and contributions that **would have been payable** (had the taxpayer’s equipment cost been correctly calculated under the rules in this Order), and
- The amount actually paid or deemed paid by the taxpayer.

> In simpler terms: If, in a future year, the taxpayer had followed the correct rules (i.e., cost = trade-in allowance + other payments), and the taxes or CPP contributions that would have been due under those rules were **higher** than what was actually paid, the taxpayer will pay the difference.

##### **(b) Waiver of All Objections and Appeals**
The taxpayer **fully waives and withdraws**:
- All current or future objections, appeals, or challenges to any assessment or reassessment related to:
  - The original reassessment (1984, 1985, or 1986)
  - Any subsequent assessments or reassessments arising from the same issue

> This is a significant legal and financial commitment. It effectively closes the door on any future legal challenge regarding the tax treatment of trade-in allowances on farm equipment.

### **6. Scope and Timing**

- Applies to **taxation years 1984, 1985, and 1986**.
- Applies only to **farm equipment**.
- Applies only to taxpayers who were **reassessed** in those years due to the treatment of **trade-in allowances**.
- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond those years — it only applies to the reassessments made in those years.
- The taxpayer must act within **90 days** of receiving the Department of National Revenue notice to qualify.

---

### **7. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council determined that it is in the **public interest** to provide this remission because:
- Farm equipment is a key asset in agriculture.
- Trade-in allowances are common and reasonable business practices.
- The original reassessments likely resulted in **unfair tax burdens** on farmers due to incorrect cost calculations.
- The remission helps correct past errors and promotes fairness in the tax treatment of agricultural investments.

### **8. Key Implications for Taxpayers**

| Implication | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ **Refund of Overpaid Taxes** | Taxpayers who were overcharged due to incorrect treatment of trade-in allowances may receive a refund. |
| ⚠️ **No Automatic Refund** | Remission only occurs if both cost and proceeds conditions are met. |
| ⚠️ **Future Obligations** | Taxpayers must agree to pay future differences in taxes if the correct cost rules apply — this creates a long-term financial obligation. |
| ❌ **No Appeal Rights** | Once the undertaking is filed, all appeals and objections are waived. |
| 📅 **Strict Deadline** | Must respond within 90 days of receiving the notice — failure to act means no remission. |

### **9. Summary in Plain Language**

This Order allows certain farmers who were reassessed in 1984, 1985, or 1986 for how trade-in allowances on farm equipment were treated to **get a refund** of income taxes and CPP contributions — **only if**:
- The cost of the new equipment equals the trade-in allowance plus any other payment, **and**
- The proceeds from selling the old equipment equal the trade-in allowance.

To qualify, the taxpayer must:
- Respond within **90 days** of receiving the notice,
- Sign a document agreeing to pay future tax differences if the correct cost rules apply,
- **Give up all rights to appeal or challenge** any related tax assessments.

This is a **one-time correction** of a past tax error, aimed at ensuring fairness in agricultural tax treatment.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Farm Equipment Income Tax and CPP Contributions Remission Order is a targeted, corrective measure designed to:
- Right past tax assessments that incorrectly treated trade-in allowances,
- Reduce the tax burden on farmers who relied on standard business practices,
- Promote fairness and consistency in the tax treatment of agricultural equipment purchases.

However, it comes with **strict conditions**, including a binding agreement to pay future tax differences and a permanent waiver of appeals. It reflects a balance between public interest and administrative accountability.

**Final Note**: This Order is historical in nature, as it pertains to reassessments from 1984–1986. It is not applicable to current or future tax years. Modern tax treatment of trade-in allowances may differ under current regulations.
