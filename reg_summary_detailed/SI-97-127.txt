Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

## **Indians and Bands on Certain Indian Settlements Remission Order (1997)**  
*Issued under subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act*  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This Order provides for the **remission (forgiveness or refund) of certain taxes** paid or payable by:
- Individuals who are **Indians** residing on specific **Indian Settlements**, and  
- Bands (groups of Indians) established on those settlements,

in respect of **income tax and goods and services tax (GST)**, under specific conditions.

The purpose is to **recognize and alleviate the financial burden** on Indigenous communities when their lands are not formally designated as reserves, despite being used for traditional or community purposes. It reflects a policy decision in the public interest to support Indigenous self-governance and economic stability.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Band** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. Refers to a group of registered Indians living together in a community. |
| **Indian** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. A person who is recognized as a member of a band under the Act. |
| **Indian Settlement** | A defined geographic area listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**. These are not reserves but areas where Indians live, often with historical or cultural significance. |
| **Reserve** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act*. A land parcel set aside by the Crown for the use of a band. |

> *Note:* The definitions ensure consistency with existing legal frameworks in the *Indian Act*.

---

### **3. Scope and Duration of the Order**

- This Order applies **to any Indian Settlement** until such time as:
  - The area is **formally set aside as a reserve** (in whole or in part) by an Order of the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government).

> This means the remission benefits remain in effect until the land is officially recognized as a reserve.

---

### **4. Taxation Context**

The Order applies to two types of taxes:

#### **A. Income Tax (Section 5)**
- Applies to **individual Indians** whose income arises from property located on an Indian Settlement.
- Remission is granted for:
  - The **taxation year** specified in **Column 3 of the Schedule** for that settlement, and
  - **Each subsequent year** after that year.

> **Amount of Remission**:
> The difference between:
> - The taxes, interest, and penalties **actually paid** by the taxpayer, and  
> - The taxes, interest, and penalties that **would have been payable** if the entire Indian Settlement had been treated as a reserve throughout the year.

> **Key Point**: The remission is based on the **hypothetical tax liability** if the settlement were a reserve — effectively recognizing that such areas are treated differently under tax law than reserves.

> **Condition for Remission**:
> - A **written application** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the tax was paid.

---

#### **B. Goods and Services Tax (GST) (Section 6)**
- Applies to **individuals** and **bands** who receive **taxable supplies** (e.g., goods or services subject to GST) made **on or after a specific date**.

> **Date Threshold**:
> - For individuals: tax remission applies only for supplies made on or after the **date in Column 4** of the Schedule.
> - For bands: tax remission applies only for supplies made on or after the **date in Column 5** of the Schedule.

> **Amount of Remission**:
> The difference between:
> - The GST actually paid or payable by the individual or band, and  
> - The GST that would have been payable **if the Indian Settlement were a reserve**.

> **Condition for Remission**:
> - **For individuals**:
>   - If tax was paid **between the date in Column 5 and Column 4**, application must be submitted within **two years of the latter date** (i.e., the Column 5 date).
>   - If tax was paid **on or after the Column 4 date**, application must be submitted within **two years of the actual payment date**.

> - **For bands**:
>   - Application must be submitted within **two years of the date the tax was paid**, regardless of when the supply occurred (subject to the date threshold in Column 5).

> *Note:* This creates a **tiered application window**, reflecting different timelines for when supplies began and when remission became available.

---

### **5. General Interpretation**

- **"Tax"** in each section refers to:
  - For income tax: taxes under **Parts I, I.1, and I.2 of the Income Tax Act**.
  - For GST: tax under **Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.

- All other terms used in this Order are interpreted **as defined in the relevant Act** (Income Tax Act or Excise Tax Act), unless otherwise specified.

---

### **6. Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fairness & Equity** | Treats Indian Settlements as if they were reserves for tax purposes, even though they are not legally designated as such. This recognizes the economic and social reality of Indigenous communities. |
| **Financial Relief** | Reduces the tax burden on individuals and bands by refunding the difference between actual tax paid and what would have been due if the area were a reserve. |
| **Time-Bound Application** | Requires timely action (within 2 years of payment) to claim remission — preventing indefinite claims and ensuring administrative feasibility. |
| **Differential Treatment** | Different dates for individuals and bands (Columns 4 and 5) reflect differences in how supplies are made and received — allowing for more precise targeting. |
| **Temporary Nature** | Remission ends when the settlement is officially designated as a reserve. This ensures the policy does not create permanent tax exemptions. |

### **7. Summary of Application Process**

| Party | Eligibility | Remission Condition | Deadline for Application |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Individual Indian** | Lives on an Indian Settlement and earns income from property there | For taxation years starting from the year in Column 3 onward | Within 2 years of tax payment |
| **Individual receiving taxable supply** | Receives supply on or after Column 4 date | GST remission based on difference vs. reserve tax | <ul><li>If supply after Column 5 date: within 2 years of Column 5 date</li><li>If supply after Column 4 date: within 2 years of tax payment</li></ul> |
| **Band receiving taxable supply** | Band established on an Indian Settlement and receives supply on or after Column 5 date | GST remission based on difference vs. reserve tax | Within 2 years of tax payment |

---

### **8. Legal Authority**

- The Order is made under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to issue orders for public interest purposes.
- It is **not a general tax relief policy**, but a **targeted, jurisdiction-specific measure** for defined Indian Settlements.

---

### **9. Conclusion**

This regulation is a **significant step toward equitable taxation** for Indigenous communities in Canada. By granting tax remission for income and GST on Indian Settlements — areas not formally designated as reserves — it:

- Recognizes the **distinct status and rights** of Indigenous peoples,
- Addresses **historical and structural inequities** in tax treatment,
- Supports **economic development and self-reliance** in Indigenous communities,
- And operates within a **clear, rule-based, and time-bound framework**.

It serves as both a **practical policy tool** and a **symbolic acknowledgment** of the importance of Indigenous lands and communities in Canada’s social and economic fabric.

---

### **Final Note**
This Order remains in force until the **federal government formally designates** the relevant Indian Settlements as reserves. Any future changes would require new legislation or a new Order by the Governor in Council.
