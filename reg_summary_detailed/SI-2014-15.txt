### **I. Overview and Legal Framework**

This is a **bilateral social security agreement** between **Canada** and the **Republic of Bulgaria**, aimed at harmonizing social security rights and obligations for individuals who work or reside in both countries. The agreement ensures that eligible individuals can access pensions, disability benefits, and survivor benefits from either country without being penalized for residing in the other.

The agreement entered into force on **March 1, 2014**, following a formal process under Canadian law and the mutual compliance of both governments with the requirements outlined in the **Agreement on Social Security** and the **Administrative Agreement** for its implementation.

The agreement was approved by the Canadian Parliament under the **Old Age Security Act**, specifically **subsection 42(2)**, which mandates that an Order in Council becomes effective on the **thirtieth sitting day after being laid before both Houses of Parliament**—a process completed on **May 23, 2013**. The exchange of written notifications confirming compliance occurred in **November 2013**, triggering the entry into force on **March 1, 2014**.

### **VI. Creditable Periods and Pension Eligibility (Totalizing Rules)**

This is the **core mechanism** for determining pension eligibility when a person has worked or lived in both countries.

#### **1. For OAS Pension Eligibility (Canada):**
- A **creditable period in Bulgaria** counts as a **period of residence in Canada**.
- This applies to the person and their **spouse or common-law partner**, and **dependants living with them**, **provided** they are not subject to Bulgarian legislation due to employment or self-employment.

#### **2. For CPP Pension Eligibility (Canada):**
- A calendar year in which the person has **at least 90 days (3 months)** of creditable periods under Bulgarian legislation counts as **one creditable year** under the CPP.

#### **3. For Bulgarian Pension Eligibility:**
- A **calendar year** of creditable periods under the **Canada Pension Plan** counts as **one creditable year** under Bulgarian law.
- A **creditable period under the OAS Act** (not overlapping with CPP) counts as a creditable period under Bulgarian law.
- For **disability or survivor pensions in Bulgaria**, a calendar year of CPP creditable periods counts as a creditable year under Bulgarian law.

#### **4. Special Rule – Activity or Occupation Requirements**
- If a Party requires a period to be completed in a **specific occupation or activity**, then periods completed under the other Party’s legislation are only valid **if performed in that specific activity**.

#### **5. Totalizing of Periods**
- If a person is **not eligible** due to insufficient creditable periods, eligibility is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods from both countries
  - Creditable periods from **third countries** with which both Parties have bilateral social security agreements that allow period totalization.

#### **6. Minimum Threshold Rule**
- If the **total duration of creditable periods** is **less than one year**, and under that total, the person does **not qualify** for a pension under the legislation of a Party, then:
  - That Party **does not have to pay** a pension for those periods.
  - However, those periods **are still considered** when determining eligibility under the **other Party’s legislation**.

#### **7. Partial Pension Calculation (OAS Only)**
If a person is eligible for OAS **solely through totalizing**, the amount is calculated as follows:
- **Earnings-related portion**: Based on CPP pensionable earnings.
- **Flat-rate portion**: Pro-rated by multiplying:
  - The flat-rate amount under CPP
  - By the **fraction** of the person’s CPP contribution period relative to the **minimum qualifying period** required under CPP (maximum value is 1.0).

> Example: If someone contributed for 15 years out of a required 40, the flat-rate portion is reduced to 15/40 = 37.5%.

#### **8. Bulgarian Pension Calculation**
- For individuals eligible under Bulgarian law, pensions are calculated **only on Bulgarian creditable periods and income** on which contributions were made.

#### **9. Adjustment for Invalidity Pensions (Bulgaria)**
- The insurance period between **invalidity and the date of acquiring an old age pension** is **reduced** by the number of years of CPP contributions made **after** the date of invalidity.

> This prevents double counting of periods and ensures fair treatment.
