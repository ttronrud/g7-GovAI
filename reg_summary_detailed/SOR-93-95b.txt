**Detailed Summary of the "Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993"**

---

### **Overview**

The *Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993* is a regulatory instrument issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada and the Public Service Commission) to establish specific employment conditions for temporary workers in the Department of Forestry. These regulations govern the hiring, service duration, and termination of individuals employed for **one or more periods of less than three months**, with the **total aggregate duration across any 12-month period not exceeding six months**.

The regulations are **specifically applicable during the period from March 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**, and apply only to certain job groups within the Department of Forestry.

---

### **Background and Rationale**

The Public Service Commission (PSC) determined that:

1. **It is not practicable nor in the best interest of the Public Service** to apply the full provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA) to temporary appointments in the Department of Forestry for short-term roles.

2. The nature of work in certain categories — such as clerical, administrative, technical, and operational support roles — often involves **short-term, project-based, or seasonal needs** that do not justify long-term employment under standard public service employment rules.

3. Applying the full PSEA (which includes provisions on employment terms, tenure, rights, and protections) to such short-term appointments would create **administrative burdens and inefficiencies** and would not align with the operational realities of the Department.

Therefore, the Commission concluded that it was **desirable to create special regulations** to allow flexibility in hiring and managing temporary staff in these roles.

### **Legal Basis**

The regulations are enacted under two key provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Section 41(1)**: Allows the Public Service Commission to **exclude persons from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act** when it is not practicable or in the public interest.
- **Section 37(1)**: Enables the Governor in Council to **make regulations** to implement specific employment arrangements, based on recommendations from the Public Service Commission and the Secretary of State.

These legal authorities were used to:
- **Exclude** certain temporary employees from the full scope of the PSEA.
- **Create specific rules** governing the recruitment, appointment, and termination of temporary workers in designated roles.

### **Scope of Application**

#### **Applicable Department**
- The **Department of Forestry** (ministère de la Forêt).

#### **Applicable Job Groups**
The regulations apply to appointments in the following **categories and groups**:

| Category | Specific Groups |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Administrative Support** | Clerical and Regulatory group; Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing group |
| **Technical Support** | Engineering and Scientific Support group; Social Science Support group |
| **Operational Support** | Heating, Power and Stationary Plant Operation group; General Labour and Trades group; General Services group |

> Note: These are **not** applicable to all public service roles, only to these specific groups within the Department of Forestry.

#### **Time Period**
- **March 1, 1993 – December 31, 1993**  
> This is a **limited, time-bound** application. The regulations do not extend beyond this period.

#### **Duration Criteria**
A person may be appointed for:
- **One or more periods of less than three months each**, and
- The **total aggregate duration** of all such appointments during **any consecutive 12-month period must not exceed six months**.

> Example: A person could be hired for two 2-month periods in a year (totaling 4 months), or one 5-month period, but not three 3-month periods (totaling 9 months) in a year.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Recruitment and Appointment**
- The **Deputy Head** of the Department (or an individual authorized by them) has the authority to:
  - Recruit, select, and appoint individuals for temporary positions.
- This provides operational flexibility for the Department to respond quickly to short-term staffing needs without going through formal public service hiring processes.

#### 2. **Termination of Employment**
- The Deputy Head or an authorized individual may terminate the employment of a temporary worker **without notice** in the following circumstances:
  - **For cause** (e.g., misconduct, failure to perform duties).
  - **Due to lack of work** or **discontinuance of a function** in the Department.

> However, **at least one day’s notice** must be given to the employee **before termination** in the case of non-causal reasons (e.g., project ending or reduced demand).

> This provision ensures that employees are not terminated arbitrarily and provides a minimal level of procedural fairness.

---

### **Exclusion from Public Service Employment Act**

- The regulations **exclude** individuals appointed under these rules from the full application of the *Public Service Employment Act*.
- This means that:
  - Temporary workers are **not entitled** to the same rights and protections as permanent public servants (e.g., job security, tenure, certain benefits, or protections against unfair dismissal).
  - The rules are **not subject to standard public service employment standards** such as minimum service requirements, probationary periods, or grievance procedures.

> This exclusion is justified by the Commission as being **practical and in the public interest**, given the temporary and project-based nature of the work.

### **Regulatory Name and Citation**

- The regulations are officially titled:  
  **"Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993"**  
  (Cited as: *Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993*)

---

### **Definitions**

- **Department**: Refers to the Department of Forestry.
- **Deputy Head**: The Deputy Minister of the Department or an individual authorized by them.
- **Order**: Refers to the *Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993*, which provides the legal basis for excluding temporary workers from the PSEA.

### **Key Implications and Considerations**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Flexibility** | Allows the Department to respond rapidly to changing operational demands. |
| **Cost-effectiveness** | Reduces administrative overhead and avoids long-term contracts. |
| **Limited Protections** | Temporary staff have fewer rights compared to permanent employees. |
| **Transparency** | Recruitment and termination are governed by clear, rule-based procedures. |
| **Temporary Nature** | Employment is not intended to be a long-term or career path. |
| **Time-Limited** | Only valid for 1993; not a precedent for future use without new authorization. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Department of Forestry Terms Under Three Months Regulations, 1993* is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure that provides the Department of Forestry with the flexibility to hire temporary staff in key support roles during a specific period. It achieves this by:

- Excluding temporary workers from the full scope of the *Public Service Employment Act*,
- Establishing clear rules for recruitment and termination,
- Ensuring that employment is limited to short-term, project-based needs.

This regulation reflects a balance between **operational efficiency** and **public service accountability**, recognizing that not all public service roles require the same level of employment protection. However, it also underscores the importance of **context-specific policy decisions** in public administration.

> **Note**: As the regulations are only valid for 1993, they are no longer in force. Any future temporary staffing arrangements would require new legislative or regulatory approval.
