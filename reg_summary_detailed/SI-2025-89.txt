**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Text:**
> *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under section 3 of the Building Canada Act, designates the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada, a member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada, as the Minister for the purposes of the Building Canada Act.*

**1. Legal Authority and Source:**
- This regulation is issued under **section 3 of the Building Canada Act**, which grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) the authority to designate individuals as "Ministers" for the purposes of the Act.
- The Act itself is a federal legislative measure introduced to strengthen Canada’s housing and infrastructure development goals, with a focus on building affordable, sustainable, and accessible homes and communities.

**2. Key Designation:**
- The **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada** is designated as a **Minister** under the Building Canada Act.
- The President of the Privy Council is typically the **Prime Minister** in office, as the Prime Minister holds the position by constitutional convention and is a member of the Privy Council.
- However, in this specific case, the designation appears to be of the **President of the Privy Council**, who is a member of the King’s Privy Council, and is being formally recognized as a Minister *for the purposes of the Building Canada Act*.

**3. Interpretation and Purpose:**
- The designation is not a new ministerial portfolio in the traditional sense (such as Minister of Housing or Minister of Infrastructure), but rather a **formal assignment** to enable the President of the Privy Council to act as a Minister under the specific legislative framework of the Building Canada Act.
- This may serve several strategic purposes:
  - To ensure **strong political and institutional oversight** of the Act’s implementation.
  - To provide **centralized leadership** in advancing national building policy, especially during a period of significant housing and infrastructure investment.
  - To facilitate coordination between the federal government and key policy areas such as housing, urban development, and economic growth.

**4. Constitutional and Procedural Context:**
- The Governor General in Council acts as the formal legislative authority, but only **on the recommendation of the Prime Minister**, reflecting the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister leads the government and advises the Crown.
- The designation is **not a creation of a new office**, but a **functional assignment** under a specific Act to allow a senior government figure to assume ministerial responsibilities in that Act's context.

**5. Implications:**
- This designation enables the President of the Privy Council (i.e., the Prime Minister) to:
  - Sign directives, policies, or funding decisions related to the Building Canada Act.
  - Chair or participate in relevant committees or task forces.
  - Represent the federal government in public or intergovernmental discussions on housing and construction policy.
- It may also signal a **top-down commitment** to the priorities of the Building Canada Act, reinforcing its importance within the federal government’s agenda.

**6. Limitations and Scope:**
- The designation is **limited to the purposes of the Building Canada Act**. The President of the Privy Council does not become a Minister in other Acts or departments.
- The powers and duties conferred are **specific to the Act**, and do not extend to other ministerial responsibilities unless otherwise provided.

**7. Timing and Context (as of 2025):**
- The regulation is dated **S.C. 2025, c. 2, s. 4**, indicating it was passed in early 2025 as part of a broader legislative initiative.
- It likely follows a government commitment to address the national housing crisis and accelerate infrastructure development, aligning with broader policy goals such as the *National Housing Strategy* or *Canada’s Infrastructure Bank*.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation formally designates the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada (typically the Prime Minister) as a Minister under the *Building Canada Act*. It is a procedural and strategic move to ensure high-level executive involvement in advancing national housing and construction policy. While not creating a new ministerial role, it strengthens the political and administrative framework for implementing the Act, ensuring that its priorities are led by the highest level of government leadership.

This designation reflects the importance of the Building Canada Act in shaping Canada’s future built environment and underscores the federal government’s commitment to addressing housing shortages and infrastructure gaps through coordinated, top-down governance.

*Note: In practice, the Prime Minister is already a member of the Privy Council and holds ministerial responsibilities. This regulation may serve more as a formal recognition or clarification of their role under this specific Act, rather than a new appointment.*
