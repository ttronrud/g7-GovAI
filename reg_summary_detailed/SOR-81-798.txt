**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*IAC Limited Shareholders Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to subsection 10(3) of *An Act to Incorporate Continental Bank of Canada* (S.C. 1980, c. 40)

**Purpose of the Order:**  
This regulatory order formally dispenses with the requirement that a proposed amalgamation agreement between *Continental Bank of Canada* and *IAC Limited* be submitted to the shareholders of IAC Limited for approval.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Dispensation from Shareholder Approval Requirement:**  
   Under normal corporate and banking regulations, a proposed amalgamation involving a financial institution—such as a bank—typically requires shareholder approval, especially when it involves a merger or acquisition. However, this Order specifically waives that requirement for the proposed amalgamation between Continental Bank of Canada and IAC Limited.  

   As a result, the proposed amalgamation agreement does **not** need to be presented to or approved by the shareholders of IAC Limited.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The Order is grounded in subsection 10(3) of *An Act to Incorporate Continental Bank of Canada*, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to exempt certain amalgamation transactions from shareholder approval when deemed appropriate in the public interest or for reasons of financial stability, operational efficiency, or regulatory oversight.

3. **Exemption from the Bank Act:**  
   The Order explicitly states that *notwithstanding any provision of the Bank Act*, the requirement for shareholder approval in this case is suspended. This means that even if the Bank Act generally mandates shareholder approval for significant corporate actions like mergers, this exemption applies specifically to the amalgamation between Continental Bank of Canada and IAC Limited.

4. **Citation and Legal Status:**  
   The Order is officially titled the *IAC Limited Shareholders Order* and may be cited as such. It carries the force of law and is binding on all parties involved in the transaction, including the shareholders of IAC Limited, the boards of directors, and relevant regulatory bodies.

**Implications and Significance:**

- **Streamlined Regulatory Process:** The Order accelerates the merger process by removing a potentially time-consuming and contentious step—shareholder approval—thereby enabling a smoother transition.
- **Regulatory Justification:** The decision reflects a judgment by the Minister of Finance and the federal government that the amalgamation serves the public interest, such as enhancing financial stability, improving service delivery, or promoting economic efficiency.
- **Exemption Scope:** The exemption is limited to the specific amalgamation between Continental Bank of Canada and IAC Limited and does not extend to other transactions or entities.
- **No Shareholder Consultation:** Shareholders of IAC Limited are not consulted or given the opportunity to vote on the proposed merger, which may raise concerns about transparency or democratic governance, though such concerns are balanced against the regulatory and financial rationale provided.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a formal, legally binding exemption that allows the proposed merger between Continental Bank of Canada and IAC Limited to proceed without requiring shareholder approval. It is issued under specific statutory authority and serves to facilitate a strategic financial consolidation while ensuring compliance with applicable regulatory frameworks, albeit by overriding a standard requirement under the Bank Act. The decision underscores the government’s role in overseeing financial institutions and approving mergers that are deemed in the public interest.
