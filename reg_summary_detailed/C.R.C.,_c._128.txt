**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Egg Order**

---

**Title and Citation:**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Alberta Egg Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader legislative framework of the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* (the "Act") in the Province of Alberta.

---

**Key Definitions in the Order:**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* of Alberta (in French: *Loi*). This is the primary legislation that provides the legal basis for the Commodity Board’s authority to regulate the marketing of agricultural products, including eggs.

2. **"Commodity Board"**  
   Refers to the *Alberta Egg and Fowl Marketing Board* (in French: *Office de commercialisation*), an agency established under the Act. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing of eggs and poultry products in Alberta, including setting prices, managing trade, and ensuring fair distribution and financial stability in the industry.

3. **"Egg"**  
   Defined broadly to include:
   - The egg produced by a hen in Alberta; and  
   - Any egg product (such as processed or prepared forms like egg whites, yolks, or other derivatives) that is produced and prepared in Alberta.  
   This definition ensures that both raw and processed egg-based products fall under the regulatory scope of the Order.

4. **"Hen"**  
   Defined as any domestic chicken belonging to the species *Gallus Domesticus*, regardless of breed or class. This ensures that the regulation applies to all hens used for egg production in the province.

**Core Authority Granted to the Commodity Board:**

The Alberta Egg Order grants the Commodity Board specific powers related to the **marketing of eggs in interprovincial and export trade**. These powers are limited in scope and are focused on ensuring fair pricing, financial stability, and equitable distribution among producers.

Specifically, the Board is authorized to:

1. **Make Orders Fixing, Imposing, and Collecting Levies or Charges**  
   - The Board can establish, set, and collect levies or charges from individuals or entities operating within Alberta who are involved in the marketing of eggs.  
   - These levies or charges are not general taxes but are specifically tied to egg marketing activities.

2. **Classify Marketers into Groups**  
   - The Board has the discretion to categorize egg marketers into different groups based on factors such as size of operation, type of business, volume of sales, or market segment.  
   - This classification allows for differentiated levies or charges depending on the group, promoting fairness and proportionality in the financial burden.

3. **Fix Levies or Charges at Different Amounts per Group**  
   - Each group may be assigned a distinct levy or charge amount. For example, small producers may pay a lower rate than large distributors or exporters.  
   - This enables the Board to tailor financial obligations to the economic realities of different market participants.

4. **Use Levies or Charges for Specific Purposes**  
   The funds collected through these levies or charges may be used for:
   - Creating **reserves** (financial buffers to manage market fluctuations);  
   - Covering **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., unsold inventory, price drops, or market disruptions);  
   - Facilitating **equalization or adjustment** among egg producers.  
     - This means that if some producers benefit from high sales prices while others face lower returns, the Board can use the collected funds to redistribute income so that all producers receive a more equitable share of the profits generated from egg sales over a defined period.

5. **Determine the Duration of Such Periods**  
   - The Board may specify the time periods (e.g., quarterly, annually) during which these levies or charges apply and during which equalization or adjustment will occur.  
   - This flexibility allows the Board to respond to market conditions and seasonal variations in egg production and demand.

**Important Note on Revocation:**  
The section of the Order that originally granted these powers was **revoked by SOR/80-90** (Statutory Order 80-90). This indicates that the current version of the Alberta Egg Order may not contain the full scope of original authority, or that the powers described here were either restructured, replaced, or suspended as of that date.

However, the current text of the Order reflects a **continuation or reassertion** of these powers in a revised form, suggesting that the Board still has the authority to manage egg marketing through levies and financial adjustments—though the historical revocation implies that this authority may be subject to further review or legislative change.

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

This Order is designed to:
- Stabilize the egg market by creating financial safeguards for producers;
- Ensure fair and equitable returns across different segments of the egg industry;
- Provide a mechanism for managing price volatility and market shocks;
- Support long-term sustainability of egg production in Alberta through financial planning and risk-sharing.

---

**Conclusion:**

While the Alberta Egg Order grants significant discretion to the Alberta Egg and Fowl Marketing Board in regulating egg marketing, particularly through the imposition of levies and charges, it operates within a framework that has been historically revised (notably by SOR/80-90). The current version reflects a targeted, producer-focused approach to financial management in the egg sector, emphasizing equity, stability, and resilience in interprovincial and export markets. However, stakeholders should be aware that the original authority was revoked, and the current provisions may be subject to future legislative or administrative review.

This Order remains a key tool for managing the economic aspects of egg marketing in Alberta, particularly in times of market uncertainty or fluctuation.
