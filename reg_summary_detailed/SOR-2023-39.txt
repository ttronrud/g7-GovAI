**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Framework**
This Order is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of the Act (S.C. 2002, c. 29).  
- **SARA** is a Canadian federal law designed to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery.  
- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA establishes that the critical habitat of a listed species is the area that is essential for the survival or recovery of that species.  
- **Subsections 58(4) and (5)** empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and regulate critical habitat for species listed as threatened under SARA.

### **2. Species at Stake: Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis)**
- The **Silver Shiner** is a small freshwater fish species native to certain regions of Canada, particularly in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River basins.
- It is classified as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**, indicating that it is at risk of extinction in the wild due to various threats such as habitat degradation, pollution, and climate change.

---

### **3. Basis for Designation of Critical Habitat**
The Order is grounded in the following key facts:

#### a) **Inclusion in the Recovery Strategy**
- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Silver Shiner was developed and published in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**.  
- This strategy identifies the specific **critical habitat** required for the species' survival and recovery.  
- The critical habitat identified in this strategy is now legally recognized and incorporated into the regulatory framework under SARA.

#### b) **No Conflict with Protected Areas (Subsection 58(2)b)**
- The Order specifies that **no portion** of the designated critical habitat lies within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA.  
- This subsection protects areas that are **set aside for the use or benefit of Indigenous bands** (such as reserves or traditional lands).  
- The absence of overlap ensures that the designation of critical habitat does **not infringe upon Indigenous lands designated under this provision**, thereby avoiding potential legal or constitutional conflicts.

---

### **4. Consultation with Indigenous Communities**
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** has determined that the annexed Order may affect **reserves or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of a band**.  
- Under **subsection 58(7)c** of SARA, the MFO is required to consult with:
  - The **Minister of Indigenous Services**, and  
  - The **specific Indigenous band** whose lands may be affected.
- This consultation process was completed, ensuring that Indigenous rights, interests, and traditional knowledge were considered in the designation process.  
- This reflects Canada’s commitment to **Indigenous partnership and co-management** in species conservation under SARA.

---

### **5. Purpose and Legal Effect of the Order**
- The Order **formally designates** the specific geographic areas that constitute the **critical habitat** of the Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis).  
- These areas are legally recognized as essential for the species’ survival and recovery.  
- The designation is **binding** and serves to:
  - Protect the habitat from harmful development or alteration.
  - Ensure that any future projects or activities impacting these areas are assessed under the **Species at Risk Act** and may require permits or mitigation measures.
- The Order is issued under the authority of **subsections 58(4) and (5)**, which allow the Minister to designate critical habitat when it is identified in a recovery strategy and meets legal criteria.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government.  
- Registration typically occurs in the Gazette or through official government publication.  
- This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal adoption.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**
- This Order strengthens the conservation of the Silver Shiner by legally protecting its essential habitat.
- It demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to:
  - Scientific-based conservation planning,
  - Compliance with Indigenous rights and consultation requirements,
  - Environmental protection in accordance with SARA.
- It also serves as a model for how critical habitat designations can be made transparent, legally sound, and inclusive of Indigenous perspectives.

### **Conclusion**
The **Critical Habitat of the Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis) Order**, issued on **March 6, 2023**, legally designates and protects the essential habitat required for the survival and recovery of this threatened fish species. The designation is based on a formal recovery strategy, is free from conflict with Indigenous reserves (as per subsection 58(2)b), and includes full consultation with Indigenous authorities under subsection 58(7)c. This Order reflects a balanced, science-based, and inclusive approach to species conservation under the Species at Risk Act.
