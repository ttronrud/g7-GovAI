### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

#### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Organizations in the Province of British Columbia Exemption Order*

#### **Legal Basis and Authority**  
The Order is made under **paragraph 26(2)(b)** of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*, which allows the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to exempt certain organizations from the application of Part 1 of PIPEDA — the personal information protection provisions — **if** those organizations are already subject to provincial privacy legislation.

Specifically, the Order is based on the **provincial legislation** known as the *Personal Information Protection Act, S.B.C. 2003, c. 63* (BC PIPA), which is **substantially similar** to Part 1 of PIPEDA. This means that organizations operating in British Columbia that are governed by BC PIPA are already complying with core privacy principles (such as collection, use, and disclosure of personal information) under provincial law.

#### **Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant an exemption** from the federal *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)* for certain organizations operating in British Columbia — specifically, those that are subject to the provincial *Personal Information Protection Act (BC PIPA)* — **in respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information**.

This exemption applies **only to personal information that occurs within the Province of British Columbia**.

#### **Scope of the Exemption**  
- **Exempt Organizations**:  
  Organizations **other than federal government bodies, federal works, or federal businesses** that are subject to the *Personal Information Protection Act (S.B.C. 2003, c. 63)* in British Columbia.  
  This means that if a private organization (e.g., a hospital, school, or non-profit) in BC is governed by BC PIPA, it is **exempt from Part 1 of PIPEDA** for its activities within BC.

- **Exemption Applies To**:  
  The **collection, use, and disclosure** of personal information — the core activities regulated under Part 1 of PIPEDA — **within the Province of British Columbia**.

- **Limitation**:  
  The exemption **does not apply** to:
  - Federal government entities or federal businesses.
  - Activities that occur outside of British Columbia.
  - Other areas of PIPEDA (e.g., the federal regime’s requirements for cross-border data transfers or specific privacy obligations under Part 2 or other sections).

#### **Key Legal Principle**  
This Order reflects the principle of **jurisdictional overlap and regulatory harmonization**. Since BC already has a comprehensive privacy law (BC PIPA) that is functionally equivalent to PIPEDA’s Part 1, the federal government recognizes that **dual application** (federal and provincial) would create unnecessary duplication and regulatory burden. Therefore, it is appropriate to exempt such organizations from PIPEDA in the province where they operate.

#### **Governor in Council and Ministerial Recommendation**  
- The Order was made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- This reflects a standard administrative process where federal departments recommend exemptions based on regulatory efficiency and provincial legal frameworks.

#### **Effective Date**  
The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette* or the provincial register). This is a common practice in Canadian regulatory instruments to ensure clarity and legal certainty.

### **Important Notes and Clarifications**  
1. **Error in Text**:  
   The original text incorrectly refers to “the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Acta” — this is a typo. The correct name is the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*.

2. **Misstatement of Provincial Law**:  
   The *Personal Information Protection Act, S.B.C. 2003, c. 63* is the **correct provincial law** in British Columbia. It is indeed substantially similar to Part 1 of PIPEDA and provides comparable privacy protections.

3. **No Federal Jurisdiction Over BC-Subject Organizations**:  
   This Order does **not** mean that federal privacy laws are entirely removed. It only means that **Part 1 of PIPEDA does not apply** to these organizations **within BC** — because they are already regulated under BC PIPA.

4. **Interpretation of "Federal Work, Undertaking or Business"**:  
   The exemption explicitly excludes federal entities, which remain subject to PIPEDA. This ensures that federal operations (e.g., federal government departments, federal contractors) are still governed by federal privacy rules.

5. **Applicability to Data Flow**:  
   If a BC-based organization shares personal information with a federal entity, or if data flows across provincial and federal boundaries, other parts of PIPEDA (e.g., cross-border data transfers) may still apply — this exemption only covers the **collection, use, and disclosure within BC**.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This Order serves as a **regulatory exemption** that prevents regulatory duplication by recognizing that organizations operating in British Columbia under the provincial *Personal Information Protection Act (BC PIPA)* are already compliant with the core privacy principles of PIPEDA. As such, they are **exempt from Part 1 of PIPEDA** for activities occurring within the province. The exemption is limited in scope, applies only to specific organizations and activities, and is effective upon registration.

This is a practical example of how **federal and provincial privacy laws** can coexist through targeted exemptions, promoting regulatory efficiency and consistency in privacy governance.

✅ **Final Summary in One Sentence**:  
The *Organizations in the Province of British Columbia Exemption Order* exempts certain non-federal organizations in BC — those subject to the provincial *Personal Information Protection Act* — from Part 1 of PIPEDA for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information within the province, effective upon registration, to avoid regulatory duplication.
