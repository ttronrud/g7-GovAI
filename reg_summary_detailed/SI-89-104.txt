**Background and Context:**

1. **United Nations Resolution 632 (1989):**  
   On February 16, 1989, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 632, which established the **United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)**. The purpose of UNTAG was to:
   - Verify and confirm the implementation of the Namibian independence process;
   - Supervise the transition of Namibia from South African administration to full independence;
   - Ensure that the political and electoral processes were conducted fairly and in accordance with international agreements.

2. **Canada’s Commitment to UNTAG:**  
   The United Nations Secretary-General requested Canada to provide **military logistics support and headquarters personnel** for UNTAG. In response, Canada formally committed to contributing to the mission.

3. **Rationale for Canadian Involvement:**  
   Given Canada’s obligations under the UN resolution and its international responsibilities, it was deemed advisable and appropriate for Canada to actively participate in verifying, confirming, and supervising Namibia’s peaceful and lawful transition to independence under UN auspices.
