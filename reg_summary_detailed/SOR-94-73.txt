The provided text consists solely of repealer notices indicating that a specific regulation has been repealed by subsequent statutory instruments:

- **SOR/2001-415, s. 2**  
- **SOR/2006-318, s. 4** (repeated three times)

### Summary:

This information does **not** describe a regulation in active force; rather, it indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by the following:

1. **SOR/2001-415, section 2** – This statutory instrument (S.O. 2001-415) repealed a prior regulation under section 2 of that instrument.
2. **SOR/2006-318, section 4** – This instrument, issued in 2006, repealed the same regulation again, and this repeal is noted three times—likely due to a typographical or formatting repetition.

### Interpretation:

- The regulation referenced was **previously in force** but is now **no longer valid**.
- The repeal means that the content of the regulation has been **removed from the legal framework** and is **not enforceable**.
- The repealer instruments (SOR/2001-415 and SOR/2006-318) likely updated or modernized the regulatory framework, rendering the prior rule obsolete—possibly due to changes in policy, administrative efficiency, or legislative revision.

### Conclusion:

There is **no detailed summary of a regulation** being described here because the entry only lists repeals. The regulation itself has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. Therefore, no substantive content, provisions, or implications of the original regulation can be provided based on this information.

If you have the name or subject matter of the original regulation (e.g., related to licensing, environmental standards, or workplace safety), I can help identify what it may have addressed prior to repeal.
