**Date of Repeal:**  
The repeal of SI/2016-47 was enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument or legislative amendment. The exact date of repeal would typically be included in the official record of the repeal. However, without the full title or the instrument that repealed it, the precise date cannot be determined from the information provided.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
Statutory instruments are often repealed when:
- They are rendered obsolete by new legislation.
- They are found to be inconsistent with current law.
- They were intended to be temporary or transitional and have fulfilled their purpose.
- A more comprehensive or modern piece of legislation has been introduced to replace them.

**Legal Implications:**  
Once a statutory instrument is repealed:
- It is no longer legally binding.
- Any provisions previously contained in it are no longer enforceable.
- Legal references to the instrument must be updated to reflect the current law.

**How to Find the Full Details:**  
To obtain the full title, content, and reason for repeal of SI/2016-47, one should consult:
- The [UK Government's official Statutory Instruments database](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/)
- The specific entry for SI 2016/47, which will list the title, date of coming into force, and the instrument that repealed it (if applicable).

**Example (hypothetical):**  
If SI/2016/47 were titled *The [X] (Amendment) Regulations 2016*, it might have amended a previous regulation on workplace safety. If it was later repealed by SI/2020/12, the repeal would be noted in the database, stating that the original regulation was no longer in force.
