**Detailed Summary of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis for the Order**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in two key provisions of the *Indian Act*:

- **Paragraph (c) of the definition of "band" in subsection 2(1)** of the *Indian Act*, which allows for the designation of a group of individuals as a "band" for the purposes of the Act.
- **Subsection 73(3)** of the *Indian Act*, which provides the legal mechanism for creating or re-establishing a band when there is a need to recognize a distinct group of Indigenous people with a shared identity and heritage.

This regulatory action formally establishes the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation** as a recognized band under the *Indian Act*.

**2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Band Order is to:

- Legally recognize and formally establish the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation** as a distinct and recognized band under the *Indian Act*.
- Define the membership of the band in accordance with the current list of individuals who are recognized as part of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq community.
- Provide a legal basis for the band to access federal programs, services, land rights, governance structures, and other benefits afforded to First Nations under the *Indian Act*.

**3. Definition of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation**

The Order declares that the **Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation** is the body of Indians (i.e., individuals recognized as status Indians under the *Indian Act*) who are included in the **Schedule** attached to the Order.

> *Note: The original Schedule has been repealed by SOR/2018-139, section 1. This means the current membership list is no longer based on the previous Schedule.*

**4. Current Membership Criteria (as of February 14, 2023)**

The current definition of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation is based on the **list of founding members** provided by the **Enrolment Committee** to:

- The **Government of Canada**
- The **Federation of Newfoundland Indians**

This list, submitted on **February 14, 2023**, serves as the official and legally binding basis for membership in the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation.

Key points:
- The list is not a static document; it reflects a formal, transparent, and evidence-based process involving community input and administrative review.
- The Enrolment Committee, which is responsible for determining who qualifies as a member of a First Nation under the *Indian Act*, has conducted a review and confirmed the individuals who meet the criteria for inclusion.
- This list is central to the band’s legal identity and determines who is eligible for status benefits, governance participation, and other rights under the *Indian Act*.

**5. Legal and Historical Context**

- The Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation is one of the many Mi’kmaq communities in Canada, historically located in the Atlantic provinces, particularly in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.
- The recognition of the Qalipu Mi’kmaq as a distinct band reflects a long-standing effort to restore Indigenous governance and self-determination, especially in the context of historical disenfranchisement and the impacts of colonial policies.
- This Order is part of a broader movement to recognize Mi’kmaq identity and status, including through the **Mi’kmaq Claims and Self-Governance** processes, and to affirm the rights of Mi’kmaq people to govern themselves and manage their lands and resources.

---

**6. Repeal of Previous Schedule**

- The earlier Schedule attached to the Order (which had previously defined the band’s membership) has been **repealed** by **SOR/2018-139, section 1**.
- This repeal indicates that the **2023 list of founding members** is now the authoritative and current source of membership.
- The repeal ensures that the band’s membership is updated to reflect current community consensus, legal standards, and administrative review processes.

---

**7. Implications and Significance**

- **Legal Recognition**: The Order grants the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation formal legal standing under the *Indian Act*, enabling it to operate as a distinct First Nation with its own governance structure.
- **Membership Clarity**: It provides clarity on who is recognized as a member, which is essential for access to services, land, and cultural programs.
- **Self-Determination**: This recognition supports the Mi’kmaq people’s right to self-governance, cultural preservation, and participation in decision-making processes.
- **Historical Justice**: The Order reflects a step toward reconciliation by acknowledging the historical status of Mi’kmaq communities and affirming their rights under Canadian law.

**Conclusion**

The Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation Band Order is a legally binding instrument that formally establishes the Qalipu Mi’kmaq as a recognized band under the *Indian Act*. It replaces outdated membership criteria with a current, community-driven list of founding members approved by the Enrolment Committee in February 2023. This Order is a significant step in affirming Mi’kmaq identity, self-governance, and legal rights, and it ensures that the Qalipu Mi’kmaq First Nation can move forward with full recognition and access to federal programs and services.
