**Detailed Summary of the General Import Permit No. 81 — Specialty Steel Products**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
This General Import Permit (GIP) No. 81 is issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** under specific provisions of the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**:

- **Subsection 8(1.1)a** and **Section 10b** of the EIPA.
- Legislative references:
  - *S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 108(1)*
  - *S.C. 2006, c. 13, s. 113*
  - *R.S., c. E-19*

The permit was issued on **February 20, 2012**, in Ottawa.

---

### **2. Scope of the Permit**
The permit authorizes **any resident of Canada** to import into Canada **goods described in Item 81 of the Import Control List**.

- This applies specifically to **specialty steel products**, which are defined as steel products with unique chemical compositions, mechanical properties, or manufacturing processes that distinguish them from standard commercial steels.
- The list of goods is not fully detailed here but is referenced in the official Import Control List, which would contain specific product descriptions, classifications, and technical specifications.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
- **Country of Melt and Pour**:  
  This is a critical term defined in the permit. It refers to the **country where the raw steel is first produced in liquid form** in a steel-making furnace and then poured into its first solid state. This solid form may be:
  - A **semi-finished product** (e.g., slab, billet, or ingot), or  
  - A **finished steel mill product** (e.g., sheet, bar, or rod).
  
  This definition is more precise than "country of origin" because it focuses on the **initial production phase** of the steel, which is important for regulatory tracking and compliance purposes.

### **4. Accounting and Reporting Requirements**
If the imported goods are subject to accounting under **Section 32 of the Customs Act**, the importer must:

- Include the statement **“GIP81”** or **“LGI81”** in the prescribed accounting form at the time of accounting or interim accounting — whichever comes first.

> - **GIP81**: General Import Permit No. 81  
> - **LGI81**: Likely stands for "Listed Goods Import Permit 81" (common in Canadian customs terminology)

This ensures traceability and transparency in customs reporting for goods under this permit.

---

### **5. Record-Keeping and Inspection Obligations**
All residents importing goods under this permit must comply with the following obligations:

#### **(a) Response to Department Requests**
- Within **10 days** of receiving a request from the **Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD)**, the importer must:
  - Provide all documents and records referenced in **Section 4** of the EIPA (which typically includes commercial invoices, shipping documents, certificates of origin, and other relevant records) for the specified import period.

#### **(b) Availability for Inspection**
- At **all reasonable times**, the importer must:
  - Make the required documents and records available for inspection by any person authorized by the Minister.
  - Provide **all reasonable assistance** to facilitate such inspections.

#### **(c) Timely Submission of Records for Determinations**
- Provide to the Department any documents and records necessary for the Minister or its agents to determine:
  - The **country of origin**
  - The **country of melt and pour**
  - The **import value**
  - The **quantity** of the imported specialty steel products

#### **(d) Disclosure at Time of Import**
- At the time of importation, the **country of melt and pour** must be clearly specified in the form and manner determined by the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)**.

> This requirement ensures that CBSA has accurate data for customs valuation, classification, and compliance monitoring.

### **6. Exemptions from Certain Provisions**
Two key exemptions apply to this permit:

#### **Exemption from Section 2 and Paragraph 3(d) of the Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations**

- These provisions **do not apply** to a **CSA importer** (as defined in Section 2 of the Accounting Regulations) when goods are released under **paragraph 32(2)(b) of the Customs Act**.

> - **CSA Importer**: Refers to a person who imports goods under a **General Import Permit** or other authorized exemption, typically involving low-value or non-sensitive goods.
> - **Paragraph 32(2)(b)** of the Customs Act allows for the release of goods without full customs accounting if they meet certain criteria (e.g., low value, non-commercial use, or exempt status).

Thus, importers under GIP81 may avoid full accounting requirements in specific cases, provided they are classified as CSA importers and goods are released under this provision.

---

### **7. Additional Exemptions from Paragraph 3(d)**
Paragraph 3(d) — which generally requires full accounting and documentation — **does not apply** if:

- The **total duty value** of the imported goods does **not exceed $5,000**, or  
- The goods are one of the following types:
  - **Stranded wire, ropes, cables or the like**, **not electrically insulated**
  - **Barbed wires or fencing wires**
  - **Wire nails, tacks, pins, staples or the like**

> This exemption simplifies compliance for low-value or non-essential steel products used in construction, fencing, or minor industrial applications.

---

### **8. Record Retention Requirements**
Importers must **retain all relevant documents and records** for a period of **six years** after the year in which the import was made. These records must include:

| Required Information |
|----------------------|
| Name and address of the importer or consignee |
| Proof of Canadian residency |
| Date of entry of goods into Canada |
| Quantity of goods (in kilograms) |
