**Detailed Summary of the Indian Bridge Workers Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Indian Bridge Workers Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**. This Order is designed to provide a **remission (forgiveness or reduction)** of income tax, interest, and penalties for specific individuals and related parties connected to the employment of Indigenous people (referred to as "Indians") on international bridges at **Cornwall Island**, particularly those employed by **The Seaway International Bridge Corporation, Ltd.**

The Order is intended to address a long-standing issue of **tax overpayment** caused by the inclusion of "bridge pay" in the taxable income of certain Indigenous individuals, which resulted in higher tax liabilities than would have been the case had that income been excluded from taxation.

### **Scope and Application**

The Order applies to:

1. **Bridge Pay Received Between January 1, 1984, and the Date of Final Resolution**  
   - The remission applies to income (bridge pay) received during the period starting **January 1, 1984**, up to the date when:
     - A **withdrawal**, **abandonment**, or **final, unappealable decision** is made in the case of *Sunday (Mitchell) et al. v. The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority et al.*, which was pending before the **Federal Court** at the time this Order came into effect.

> This means the Order covers bridge pay received from 1984 until the court case concluded (or was otherwise resolved permanently), which was a key legal dispute concerning the tax treatment of bridge pay.

### **Remission Provisions**

#### **1. Remission for Taxpayers Who Are Indians**

- A taxpayer who is an **Indian** is entitled to a remission of income tax, interest, and penalties for **taxation years after 1983**.
- The amount of remission is equal to the **difference** between:
  - The taxes, interest, and penalties **actually paid** by the taxpayer (with bridge pay included in income), and  
  - The taxes, interest, and penalties that would have been payable **if bridge pay had not been included** in the taxpayer’s taxable income.

> In simpler terms: if an Indian worker was taxed more because their bridge pay was counted as income, the government will refund the *excess* tax paid due to that inclusion.

#### **2. Remission for Persons Whose Income Is Affected by the Taxpayer’s Bridge Pay**

- A **third party** (not necessarily an Indian) whose income is affected by the inclusion of the Indian’s bridge pay in tax calculations is also eligible for remission.
- The remission amount is equal to the difference between:
  - The taxes, interest, and penalties paid by the affected person, and  
  - The taxes, interest, and penalties that would have been payable **if the Indian’s bridge pay had not been included** in the calculation of the taxpayer’s income.

> This provision recognizes that the inclusion of bridge pay in one person’s income may indirectly affect the tax liability of others (e.g., family members, dependents, or joint filers), and provides relief in those cases as well.

### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the remission, the taxpayer or affected person must:

- **File an undertaking and waiver** with the Minister of National Revenue.
- The undertaking must be in a **form acceptable to the Minister**.
- The undertaking must include:
  - A **clear commitment to withdraw** any relevant objections or appeals.
  - A **waiver of any right to object or appeal** related to the tax treatment of bridge pay under the Income Tax Act.

> This condition ensures that the remission is granted only after the taxpayer voluntarily gives up the right to challenge the tax treatment of bridge pay in future legal proceedings. It serves as a **finality mechanism** to prevent ongoing litigation and to close the door on appeals related to this specific issue.

### **Legal and Policy Rationale**

- The Order responds to a **historical inequity** in tax treatment where Indigenous workers were subjected to higher tax burdens due to the inclusion of bridge pay in taxable income, despite the nature of their employment and the economic context of the time.
- It reflects a **public interest** decision under **section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General, on ministerial recommendation, to make orders to promote public interest, including fairness and equity in taxation.
- The Order is closely tied to the **federal court case *Sunday (Mitchell) et al. v. The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority et al.***, which was a pivotal legal challenge to the tax treatment of bridge pay. The resolution of that case (or its finality) marks the endpoint of the remission period.

### **Key Impacts and Implications**

1. **Tax Relief for Indigenous Workers**  
   - Provides direct financial relief to Indigenous individuals who were overtaxed due to the inclusion of bridge pay.

2. **Broader Equity and Recognition**  
   - Acknowledges the unique socio-economic and historical context of Indigenous employment in infrastructure projects.

3. **Finality and Closure**  
   - The requirement to file a waiver ensures that the matter is closed, reducing the potential for future legal disputes and administrative costs.

4. **Administrative Efficiency**  
   - Streamlines the tax treatment of bridge pay by establishing a clear, one-time remission mechanism.

5. **Limited Scope**  
   - Applies only to bridge pay from 1984 onward and only to those cases where a final decision has been reached in the referenced litigation.

### **Conclusion**

The *Indian Bridge Workers Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable, and legally grounded measure designed to correct a historical tax overpayment for Indigenous workers employed on the international bridges at Cornwall Island. By remitting excess taxes and interest, it promotes fairness and acknowledges the disproportionate impact of tax policy on Indigenous communities. The requirement to file a formal waiver ensures finality and administrative closure, while the Order remains a significant example of how federal policy can respond to both legal and social equity concerns.

This Order stands as a **symbol of reconciliation and justice** in the context of Indigenous rights and economic inclusion, while also serving a practical function in tax administration.
