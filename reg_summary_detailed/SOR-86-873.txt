### **Overview**

The *Reporting of Imported Goods Regulations*, enacted on March 29, 1986, and coming into force upon the effective date of relevant provisions in the *Customs Act*, establish the procedural framework for how imported goods must be reported to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). These regulations ensure timely, accurate, and consistent reporting of goods entering Canada, with provisions for both electronic and oral reporting depending on the type and circumstances of the import.

This summary provides a comprehensive breakdown of the key components, definitions, reporting requirements, exceptions, and procedural details of the regulations.

## **I. Legal Authority and Background**

- The regulations were published in *Part I of the Canada Gazette* on March 29, 1986, pursuant to **subsection 164(3) of the Customs Act**, which allows for public consultation before finalizing proposed regulations.
- A reasonable opportunity was given for interested parties (e.g., importers, carriers, stakeholders) to submit representations to the Minister of National Revenue.
- The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, enacted the regulations under:
  - **Section 12** of the *Customs Act* (general reporting obligations),
  - **Subsections 14(2)** and **18(2)** (specific reporting obligations),
  - **Paragraph 164(1)(i)** (regulatory authority to make rules).
