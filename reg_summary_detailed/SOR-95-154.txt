The provided text consists of four identical entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2008-153, s. 1]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Regulation SOR/2008-153, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Nature of the Entry**: The notation "[Repealed, SOR/2008-153, s. 1]" means that the regulation in question was formally canceled or abolished by a subsequent legislative or administrative action.
  
- **SOR/2008-153**: This refers to the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* issued in 2008, specifically Order No. 153. These are administrative instruments used by federal or provincial governments to amend or repeal existing rules and regulations.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2008-153**: This section contains the legal provision that formally repeals a prior regulation. The exact regulation being repealed is not specified in the provided text, only that it was repealed under this section.

- **Implication**: The regulation previously referenced (which is not listed in the text) is no longer in force. Any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously established by that regulation have been removed and are no longer applicable.

- **Context**: Such repeals often occur when:
  - A regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - A new regulation supersedes it.
  - There is a need to simplify or modernize the regulatory framework.
  - A regulatory change is made due to policy or operational reasons.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not** contain the actual regulation being repealed — only a notice of its repeal. Therefore, a detailed summary of the *content* of the repealed regulation is not possible from this information alone. However, the summary of the **repeal notice** is as follows:

> The regulation referenced in this notice has been formally repealed by Section 1 of Supplemental Order 2008-153 (SOR/2008-153, s. 1). This means the regulation is no longer legally valid or enforceable. The repeal was enacted to remove outdated or obsolete provisions, likely to align with updated policy, administrative efficiency, or a new regulatory framework. The specific subject matter of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided text.

To obtain the full details of the repealed regulation (e.g., its title, scope, or provisions), one would need to consult the original version of the regulation or the full text of SOR/2008-153.
