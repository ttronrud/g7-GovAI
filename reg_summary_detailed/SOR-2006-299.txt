### **Summary of the Civil Remedies (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Bank Act**:
- Subsections **271(1)a, (3)a, and (6)a**
- Subsection **978(1)b**

These provisions empower the government to establish rules governing civil remedies in cases involving **banks and bank holding companies**, particularly in relation to insider trading, take-over bids, and the disclosure of confidential information.

The regulation is formally published in the **Statutes of Canada, 2005, c. 54, s. 57 and s. 135**, and references earlier legislation such as **S.C. 1991, c. 46**.

---

#### **2. Purpose and Scope**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- Define key thresholds and conditions under which civil penalties or remedies may apply.
- Clarify the interpretation of specific provisions in the Bank Act regarding **insider trading**, **confidential information**, and **take-over bids**.
- Provide consistent, enforceable definitions that apply across jurisdictions and over time.

The regulations apply specifically to:
- Banks
- Bank holding companies
- Federal credit unions (in certain contexts)

---

#### **3. Key Definitions and Thresholds**

##### **(a) Voting Rights Threshold – Paragraph 271(1)(d) of the Bank Act**
- **Prescribed percentage of voting rights**:  
  → **10%**  
  This means that for the purposes of determining control or influence over a bank or bank holding company, any shareholder holding **10% or more** of the outstanding voting shares is considered to have a significant interest.
- **Application**: This threshold triggers certain obligations or reporting requirements under subsection 271(1)(d) of the Bank Act.

##### **(b) Membership Shares Threshold – Subsection 271(1.1) of the Bank Act**
- **Prescribed percentage of membership shares**:  
  → **10%**  
  This applies to **federal credit unions** under subsection 271(1.1) of the Bank Act.
- **Application**: A member holding **10% or more** of the membership shares in a federal credit union is deemed to have a significant interest, triggering corresponding disclosure or reporting obligations.

##### **(c) Definition of "Take-Over Bid" – Subsection 271(3) of the Bank Act**
- A **"take-over bid"** is defined as a bid made under any applicable legislation listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- The Schedule includes various provincial and federal securities acts (e.g., the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5; the Securities Act, R.S.Q., c. V-1.1; etc.).
- This definition ensures that any offer to acquire a bank or bank holding company (or related entity) through a formal take-over process is recognized under the Bank Act and triggers specific civil remedy provisions.

##### **(d) Insider Trading Circumstances – Paragraph 271(6)(c) of the Bank Act**
This section defines **prescribed circumstances** under which an insider may be exempt from liability for purchasing or selling securities **after acquiring confidential information**. The exemptions are limited to specific, pre-existing, and legally binding actions:
1. **Pursuant to a specific unsolicited order** to buy or sell securities (e.g., a client request or trade instruction received before the confidential information was obtained).
2. **Participation in an automatic plan** (e.g., dividend reinvestment plan, share purchase plan) entered into **before** the acquisition of confidential information.
3. **Purchase or sale to fulfill a legally binding obligation** (e.g., a contract or commitment entered into prior to gaining access to confidential information).
4. **Purchasing or selling as agent or trustee** in the circumstances described in (b) or (c).

> **Key Implication**: These provisions protect insiders from liability if their trading activity is directly tied to pre-existing, legitimate, and non-proprietary obligations — thereby preventing abuse of confidential information.

---

#### **4. Cross-Referencing with Other Securities Acts**
The regulation explicitly references and incorporates the **definition of "take-over bid"** from a wide range of provincial and federal securities legislation, including:
- **R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5** (Ontario)
- **R.S.Q., c. V-1.1** (Quebec)
- **R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418** (New Brunswick)
- **S.N.B. 2004, c. S-5.5** (Newfoundland and Labrador)

- **S.N.W.T. 1996, c. 19** (Northwest Territories)
- **S.N.W.T. 1996, c. 19** (Nunavut)

> **Purpose**: To ensure **consistency and harmonization** of the definition of "take-over bid" across jurisdictions. This prevents regulatory gaps or conflicts when a bank or holding company operates across multiple provinces or territories.
