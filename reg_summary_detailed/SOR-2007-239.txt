**Detailed Summary of the First Nations Tax Commission Review Procedures Regulations (S.C. 2005, c.9)**

---

### **Overview**

The *First Nations Tax Commission Review Procedures Regulations*, made under **section 33, paragraph 36(1)(b) and subsection 36(3)** of the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act*, establish a formal, transparent, and culturally sensitive procedural framework for the **First Nations Tax Commission (Commission)** to conduct reviews of tax-related matters involving First Nations. These regulations govern how reviews are initiated, managed, heard, and concluded—particularly in cases where individuals or First Nations challenge decisions related to revenue laws, tax administration, or compliance with fiscal regulations.

The regulations are designed to ensure **fairness, accountability, efficiency, and cultural appropriateness**, while allowing flexibility in procedures to accommodate the unique needs of First Nations communities.
