**Detailed Summary of the DOMCO Remission Order No. 2**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
*DOMCO Remission Order No. 2*  
**Enacted Under:** Section 101 of the *Customs Tariff*  
**Issued By:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance  
**Statutory Citation:** S.C. 1987, c. 49  
**Effective Date:** July 1, 1988 (as a condition of eligibility)  
**Citation:** DOMCO Remission Order No. 2

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to grant a **customs duty remission** (i.e., a partial or full exemption from customs duty) on specific rotogravure printing rolls imported by **DOMCO Industries Limited**, a Canadian manufacturing company based in Farnham, Quebec. This remission is intended to support the competitiveness and operational viability of DOMCO in the production of resilient floor coverings—such as rubber or vinyl flooring—by reducing the cost of essential equipment.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**
The remission applies specifically to:
- **Rotogravure printing rolls** imported by **DOMCO Industries Limited**.
- The remission covers the **customs duty** that would otherwise be payable under the *Customs Tariff* on these rolls.
- **Exclusion:**  
  A **20% duty component** is **not remitted**—this portion corresponds to the duty on the value of work performed **outside Canada** to increase the rolls’ value or alter their condition through manufacturing or other processes. This reflects the principle that duties on foreign value-added processing are not waived under Canadian customs policy.

---

### **Conditions for Eligibility**
To qualify for the remission, the imported rotogravure printing rolls must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Date of Importation**  
   The rolls must be imported **on or after July 1, 1988**.  
   → This establishes a clear timeline for the applicability of the remission, ensuring it is not retroactive and aligns with policy development or economic assessments made prior to that date.

2. **Use in Manufacturing Resilient Floor Coverings**  
   The rolls must be **used exclusively or primarily** in the **manufacture of resilient floor coverings** by DOMCO Industries Limited.  
   → This ensures the remission is tied to a specific, legitimate industrial application and prevents misuse or diversion to other purposes.

3. **Minimum Face Width Requirement**  
   The rolls must have a **face width of at least 144 inches**.  
   → This specification likely reflects the technical and industrial requirements for large-scale printing in floor covering production, ensuring that only high-capacity, industrial-grade equipment qualifies.

4. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within three years** of the date of importation.  
   → This establishes a strict deadline to ensure accountability, prevent long-term administrative burdens, and allow the government to monitor compliance and audit claims.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff** provides the legal basis for such remissions, allowing the government to grant duty relief in specific cases where public interest, economic development, or industrial necessity is demonstrated.
- The **partial exemption (80% remission)**—excluding 20% on foreign value-added work—demonstrates a balance between supporting domestic industry and maintaining the integrity of customs duties on foreign processing.
- The **targeted nature** of the order (specific company, specific product, specific use) reflects a **sectoral or enterprise-specific incentive**, rather than a broad-based duty relief policy.
- The **three-year claim window** ensures that the government can manage administrative costs and maintain fiscal accountability.

### **Administrative and Compliance Requirements**

- DOMCO Industries Limited is responsible for:
  - Maintaining records of imports.
  - Confirming that the rolls meet the technical and usage criteria.
  - Submitting a formal claim to the **Minister of National Revenue** within the three-year period.
- The Minister of National Revenue has the authority to:
  - Review and approve or reject claims.
  - Conduct audits or investigations if necessary.
  - Ensure compliance with the conditions set out in the Order.

### **Economic and Industrial Rationale**
This remission supports the **Canadian manufacturing sector** by:
- Reducing capital and operational costs for DOMCO in acquiring essential printing equipment.
- Encouraging investment in domestic production of resilient floor coverings.
- Enhancing Canada’s competitiveness in the flooring industry, particularly in high-volume, high-precision printing applications.

---

### **Conclusion**
*DOMCO Remission Order No. 2* is a targeted, conditionally granted customs duty relief designed to benefit a specific Canadian manufacturer engaged in a key industrial process. It balances fiscal responsibility with industrial support by:
- Exempting most of the duty on qualifying rotogravure printing rolls,
- Excluding duty on foreign value-added processing,
- Imposing strict eligibility and compliance requirements.

This regulation exemplifies how Canadian customs policy can be used to promote domestic industry growth while maintaining sound fiscal and administrative controls.
