### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Statement Limiting the Right to Equitable Remuneration of Certain Rome Convention or WPPT Countries**

This regulation, issued by the **Minister of Industry** of Canada on **June 30, 2014**, and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, is a **Statement under the Copyright Act** that **limits the right to equitable remuneration** for sound recordings made by citizens or residents of certain countries that are members of the **World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)** or the **Rome Convention**.

The regulation is grounded in **Section 12(1) and (2)** of the *Copyright Act* (S.C. 2012, c. 20), and is made under **Sections 20(2) and (2.1)** of the same Act. It serves to **clarify and restrict** the scope of the Canadian right to equitable remuneration (a form of compensation) for the **public performance** or **public communication by telecommunication** of sound recordings, based on the **national origin** of the recording’s maker.

---

## **Background and Purpose**

- The **Minister of Industry** observed that **certain countries** (listed in the annex) do **not provide a right of remuneration** for public performance or telecommunication of sound recordings that is **similar in scope and duration** to the rights granted in **subsections 19(1.1)a and (1.2)b** of the *Copyright Act*.
- Canada, as a signatory to the **WPPT (1996)**, has a duty to ensure that **foreign performers and sound recording makers** are fairly compensated when their works are used in Canada.
- However, the **Canadian law provides a right to equitable remuneration** for certain foreign sound recordings **only if** the maker (at the time of first fixation) was a Canadian citizen/permanent resident or a Canadian-based corporation.
- This regulation **modifies** that right by **excluding or limiting** the right for sound recordings made in certain **WPPT or Rome Convention countries**, where such rights are not available or are limited.

> The goal is to **avoid overreach** in applying Canadian equitable remuneration rights to foreign works where such rights are already provided (or not provided) under international treaties.

### **1. Duration of Right to Equitable Remuneration**

- **Bolivia and Lesotho**:  
  A right to equitable remuneration applies **only for 20 years** for:
  - Public performance  
  - Public communication by telecommunication  
  *(This is a limited duration compared to the standard Canadian rights)*

---

> - Internet broadcasts  
> - Satellite transmissions

---

### **3. Special Case: Unpublished Sound Recordings (Deemed Published)**

- If a sound recording is **not published** but is **deemed published under Section 19.2** of the *Copyright Act*, and the maker was a **citizen or resident of Japan**, then:

## **Legal and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **International Alignment** | Reflects Canada’s commitment to the WPPT by aligning its domestic rights with international standards — where foreign countries do not offer similar remuneration rights. |
| **Fairness and Practicality** | Prevents Canada from overextending its equitable remuneration obligations to foreign works where such rights are not available under international law. |
| **SARs Exception (Hong Kong & Macao)** | Recognizes the unique legal status of Hong Kong and Macao, allowing Canadian rights to apply to works made there, despite being part of China. |
| **Exclusions for Free Broadcasts & Background Music** | Encourages free access to music in public and commercial settings, while protecting the interests of Canadian creators. |
| **Duration Limitations** | Limits the period of protection (e.g., 20 years for Bolivia and Lesotho), which may reduce long-term compensation for foreign rights holders. |

---

## **Repeal and Status Update**

- Several provisions (especially those related to **Singapore**, **Costa Rica**, and **broadcast exclusions**) were **repealed** by **SOR/2020-82, s.1**.
- This means that:
  - The **exclusions for free terrestrial radio broadcasts** and **background music** in Singapore and Costa Rica are **no longer in effect**.
  - The **limited duration** for Bolivia and Lesotho may also be under review or revised.

> **Current Status (as of 2024)**:  
> The regulation remains **in force**, but **some of its key exclusions have been repealed**. The **Hong Kong and Macao exceptions** are still valid and remain a key part of Canada’s international copyright policy.
