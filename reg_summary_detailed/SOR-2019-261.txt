**Detailed Summary of the Large Diameter Line Pipe Anti-Dumping Duty Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.  
- The authority to issue such a remission order is derived from the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**, specifically section 115a, which allows for the remission of anti-dumping duties under certain conditions.

**Statutory References:**
- S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)
- S.C. 1997, c. 36 (the original framework of the Special Import Measures Act)

### **2. Scope of the Order**
The Order applies to **large diameter line pipe**, defined in accordance with the **Statement of Reasons** issued by the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** on **November 4, 2016**, in **Inquiry Number NQ-2016-001**.

> **Definition of "Large Diameter Line Pipe"**  
> This refers to specific types of steel pipes used in pipeline systems, typically with a diameter exceeding certain thresholds (e.g., over 12 inches), intended for transporting oil, gas, or other fluids over long distances. The exact technical specifications are detailed in the CITT’s Statement of Reasons.

### **3. Purpose of the Remission**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or reduce) anti-dumping duties** that certain companies have paid or are obligated to pay on imports of large diameter line pipe, under specific conditions.

This remission is not a blanket exemption but a **targeted relief** for qualifying transactions, particularly those involving strategic infrastructure projects.

---

### **4. General Remission Conditions (Applicable to Most Companies)**

A company is eligible for remission **only if**:
1. **Application is submitted within two years** of the Order coming into force.
2. The applicant **provides requested evidence or documentation** to the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** upon request, to verify eligibility.

> *Note:* The application must include proof of the transaction (e.g., import records, invoices, shipping documentation) and demonstrate that the goods fall within the defined category of "large diameter line pipe."

### **5. Specific Remission for Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P.**

A **special provision** applies to **Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P.**, a major Canadian energy infrastructure company involved in the **Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMX Project)**.

#### **Remission Amount and Limit**
- Remission is granted **up to the amount of anti-dumping duties** that would have been paid on the importation of **2,963,565 kg** of large diameter line pipe.
- This cap ensures that remission is limited to the volume of pipe actually imported under the project.

#### **Eligibility Conditions (for Trans Mountain)**
The following conditions must all be met:
1. An application for remission must be made to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the responsible minister under SIMA).
2. The application must be submitted **within two years of the date of importation** (not the date the Order comes into force).
3. The amount claimed **must not be subject to remission under section 2** of the Special Import Measures Act (i.e., it must not overlap with other existing remission provisions).
4. The large diameter line pipe must be **supplied by JFE Steel Corporation**, a Japanese steel manufacturer.
5. The pipe must be **intended for use in the Trans Mountain Expansion Project**, a major pipeline project aimed at expanding Canada’s capacity to transport crude oil from Alberta to the U.S. Pacific coast.

> This targeted remission supports national energy infrastructure development and promotes energy security by reducing costs for critical pipeline construction.

### **6. Schedule of Amounts and Transaction Numbers**
The Order includes a **schedule** listing:
- Company names (in column 1)
- Amounts of anti-dumping duties (in column 2)
- Transaction numbers (in column 3) — used to identify specific import records

> Example entries:
> - 365,145.42 CAD (transaction: 17848827194872)
> - 1,546,459.58 CAD (transaction: 17848827614654)
> - 1,651,907.62 CAD (transaction: 17848828821247)
> - ...and others

These figures represent the **actual anti-dumping duty amounts** that may be remitted for each qualifying transaction, provided all conditions are met.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The list appears to contain a mix of monetary values and transaction numbers. The monetary values likely represent the duty amounts due; the transaction numbers are identifiers for individual import entries.

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (i.e., the official publication date).

---

### **8. Key Implications and Policy Rationale**

| Aspect | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Targeted Relief** | The remission is not general but focused on specific companies and products, especially those supporting national infrastructure. |
| **Strategic Infrastructure Support** | By reducing costs for Trans Mountain’s expansion, the government supports energy security, economic development, and long-term energy supply. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires applicants to provide evidence and respond to CBSA requests — ensuring that remissions are not abused. |
| **Prevention of Overlap** | The exclusion of amounts already covered under section 2 of the Act prevents double remission or overlap. |
| **Importation-Based Eligibility** | The requirement that the application be made within two years of importation ensures timely action and accountability. |

### **9. Conclusion**

This **Large Diameter Line Pipe Anti-Dumping Duty Remission Order** is a targeted, legally grounded measure that:
- Provides financial relief to specific importers (notably Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P.) for anti-dumping duties on large diameter line pipe.
- Supports the construction of critical energy infrastructure.
- Maintains compliance with Canadian trade law by requiring strict eligibility criteria and evidence submission.
- Is designed to balance fair trade practices with national economic and strategic interests.

It reflects the government’s ability to use administrative tools under the Special Import Measures Act to support key infrastructure projects while ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to international trade obligations.

**Final Note:**  
While the schedule includes a list of transaction numbers and duty amounts, the **core legal and procedural framework** is clearly defined in the text. The actual monetary values may be used to determine the exact remission amount per transaction, but the **eligibility rules** remain the central mechanism for determining who qualifies.

This Order is a practical application of Canada’s anti-dumping regime to serve public interest objectives in the energy sector.
