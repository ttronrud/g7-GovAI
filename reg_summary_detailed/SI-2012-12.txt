---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Urban Aboriginal Youth and Community Programs Unit

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), and is implemented by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**.

**Subject Matter:**  
The regulation transfers the **control and supervision** of a specific unit within the federal public administration — the **Urban Aboriginal Youth and Community Programs Unit** — from the **Department of Canadian Heritage** to the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)**.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2012**.

**Key Details of the Transfer:**

- The **Urban Aboriginal Youth and Community Programs Unit** is a component of the Department of Canadian Heritage that historically administered programs aimed at supporting Aboriginal youth and community development in urban areas.
- The transfer of control and supervision means that DIAND will now be responsible for:
  - Overseeing the management, operations, and implementation of the unit’s programs.
  - Allocating resources, setting priorities, and ensuring compliance with federal policies and guidelines.
  - Providing policy direction and accountability for the unit’s activities.
- The actual program funding, service delivery, and operational functions remain unchanged — only the administrative oversight and supervisory responsibility are transferred.

**Rationale and Context (Implied):**  
This transfer reflects a broader policy shift to strengthen the role of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in delivering services to Indigenous communities. By placing urban Aboriginal youth programs under DIAND’s purview, the government aims to:
- Improve coordination between Indigenous services and community development.
- Ensure that programs are culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs of Aboriginal peoples.
- Enhance accountability and integration within a department with direct responsibility for Indigenous affairs.

**Legal Basis and Citation:**  
- Primary legislation: *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, 2003 (S.C. 2003, c. 22)
- Specific section: Section 207 (which authorizes the transfer of duties and control between departments)
- Statutory reference: *Revised Statutes of Canada*, Chapter P-34 (the current version of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)

**Significance:**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the federal public service, signaling a strategic realignment of responsibilities to better align with Indigenous self-determination and community-based programming. It underscores the government’s commitment to integrating youth and community development services within a framework that prioritizes Indigenous governance and cultural relevance.

**Note on Accuracy and Interpretation:**  
While the regulation appears to be a straightforward administrative transfer, the actual impact on program delivery, funding, and community engagement would depend on subsequent policy development, staffing, and implementation within DIAND. This transfer is not a dissolution of the unit, but a shift in administrative oversight.

In conclusion, this regulation formally assigns administrative control of the Urban Aboriginal Youth and Community Programs Unit from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, effective April 1, 2012, under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The move is intended to improve the alignment of youth and community programs with Indigenous priorities and governance structures.
