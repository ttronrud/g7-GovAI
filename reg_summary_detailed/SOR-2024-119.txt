**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Basis**

This regulation is issued under **section 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* (R.C.M.P. Pension Continuation Act), which authorizes the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) to modify pension benefits in the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund** when it is determined that the fund’s reserves are substantially in excess of what is required to meet future pension obligations.

The rationale for this action stems from a **report made under section 56** of the same Act. This report indicates that the fund currently holds significantly more assets than necessary to adequately cover the projected future payments to beneficiaries—particularly widows and dependants of former RCMP members. This surplus suggests that the fund has sufficient financial capacity to provide benefit increases without compromising long-term solvency.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **increase pension benefits** for certain categories of beneficiaries in a phased, structured manner. The adjustments are designed to:

- Improve the financial well-being of widows and other dependants of former RCMP members;
- Reflect the fund’s surplus capacity;
- Ensure equitable and sustainable benefit growth over time;
- Maintain the integrity and stability of the pension fund while providing meaningful support to beneficiaries.

### **3. Key Benefit Increases**

The Order specifies three distinct types of benefits that will be increased, with specific timelines and percentage increases:

#### **(a) Widows’ Pensions**

- **Increase of 5%** effective **April 1, 2023**  
- **Increase of 1.2%** effective **April 1, 2024**  
- **Increase of 1.2%** effective **April 1, 2025**

> This means that the monthly pension amount received by a widow of a former RCMP member will rise by 5% in 2023, and then by 1.2% each year in 2024 and 2025. These increases are cumulative and apply to all current and future widows who are eligible under the plan.

#### **(b) Lump Sum Benefits on Death of a Former Member (without a surviving widow)**

- **Increase of 5%** effective **April 1, 2023**  
- **Increase of 1.2%** effective **April 1, 2024**  
- **Increase of 1.2%** effective **April 1, 2025**

> This applies to lump sum payments made upon the death of a former RCMP member who contributed to the pension plan and who is **not survived by a widow**. The increase ensures that beneficiaries who do not receive a widow’s pension still receive a larger lump sum, enhancing their financial security in the event of a member’s death.

#### **(c) Residual Amounts for Widows Who Die During the 2024, 2025, or 2026 Plan Years**

This provision is more complex and relates to **residual benefits**—payments made to a widow after her own death, based on the former member’s deemed contributions.

- The **former member’s deemed contributions** as of **April 1, 2022** are to be increased by:
  - **5%** on **April 1, 2023**
  - **1.2%** on **April 1, 2024**
  - **1.2%** on **April 1, 2025**

> These adjusted contributions will be used to calculate the residual amount payable to the widow’s estate or surviving dependants if the widow dies during the plan years of **2024, 2025, or 2026**. This ensures that even in the case of a widow’s death after the member’s death, the residual benefit is adjusted upward to reflect the increased value of the member’s contributions.

---

### **4. Timing and Implementation**

- The increases are **phased over three years**, beginning with April 1, 2023.
- Each increase takes effect on **April 1** of the specified year.
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada, which typically occurs shortly after formal approval by the Governor in Council.

---

### **5. Legal Authority and Procedural Background**

- The Order is made under **subsection 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* (R.S.C. 1970, c. R-10).
- The decision is based on a formal **report under section 56**, which assesses the financial health and surplus of the Dependants Pension Fund.
- The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness provides the recommendation, ensuring that the adjustment is both necessary and consistent with the fund’s long-term sustainability.

---

### **6. Implications and Significance**

- **Beneficiary Impact**: Widows and surviving dependants will experience a tangible improvement in their financial security through higher pensions and lump sums.
- **Equity and Fairness**: The phased increases ensure that benefits grow in a predictable and fair manner, avoiding sudden or disproportionate changes.
- **Funding Sustainability**: The adjustment leverages the fund’s surplus to enhance benefits without jeopardizing future obligations or requiring new funding.
- **Long-Term Planning**: By adjusting deemed contributions for residual benefits, the Order strengthens the financial foundation of the pension structure for future beneficiaries.

### **7. Conclusion**

This Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order is a targeted, evidence-based enhancement of pension benefits for widows and dependants of former RCMP members. It reflects the fund’s financial strength and demonstrates a commitment to supporting the families of RCMP personnel through improved financial outcomes.
