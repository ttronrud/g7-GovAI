### **Key Background and Motivations (Whereas Clauses)**

The proclamation begins with several **"Whereas" clauses**, outlining the rationale and context for establishing the National Day Against Gun Violence. These clauses emphasize:

1. **Public Concern**: Canadians are deeply concerned about gun violence and are actively seeking government action to protect their communities.

2. **Devastating Impact**: Gun violence has severe and long-lasting consequences — not only physical harm, but also **psychological trauma** affecting victims, their families, and entire communities.

3. **Call for Government Action**: The government is expected to take meaningful steps to **address both the symptoms and root causes** of gun violence.

4. **Awareness and Education**: Increasing public understanding of **firearm-related laws**, the **causes**, and the **risks** associated with gun violence is essential to prevention.

5. **Collaborative Approach**: Effective action requires **partnership** with:
   - Victims and survivors
   - Families affected by gun violence
   - Community organizations
   - Provincial and municipal governments

6. **Legal Foundation**: This proclamation builds upon **Order in Council P.C. 2023-436**, issued on May 12, 2023, which authorized the proclamation of a national day.

### **Main Provision: Establishment of a National Day Against Gun Violence**

- **Date of Observation**:  
  The **first Friday in June** of every year is designated as the **National Day Against Gun Violence**.

- **Purpose of the Day**:  
  The day is intended to:
  - Raise public awareness about gun violence
  - Promote dialogue and education on the causes and prevention of gun violence
  - Honor victims, survivors, and communities affected by gun violence
  - Encourage collaboration among stakeholders to develop and implement effective prevention strategies

- **Mandatory Observance**:  
  All Canadians, institutions, and organizations are **required to take notice** and **govern themselves accordingly** — meaning they are encouraged (and expected) to observe the day in a meaningful way, such as:
  - Hosting educational events
  - Participating in community dialogues
  - Supporting victim services
  - Advocating for stronger public safety measures

### **Legal and Symbolic Significance**

- **Formal Recognition**: The proclamation is a formal, official act of the Canadian government, issued with the **advice of the Privy Council**, signifying national commitment.
- **Symbolic Leadership**: The proclamation is signed by **Mary May Simon**, Governor General of Canada, who holds multiple honors (e.g., Companion of the Order of Canada, Commander of the Order of Military Merit, etc.). This underscores the national importance and moral weight of the initiative.
- **Public Engagement**: Unlike legislation, this is a **non-binding but highly symbolic and educational** measure designed to foster national unity, awareness, and action.

### **Historical and Contextual Notes**

- This proclamation follows similar initiatives in other countries (e.g., the U.S. National Day of Remembrance and Action to Combat Gun Violence), but is unique in being a **formal, annual national observance** established by the Canadian government.
- It reflects a broader shift in Canadian policy toward **public health and social prevention** approaches to gun violence, rather than solely relying on law enforcement or criminal justice responses.
- The timing — in June — allows for a seasonal emphasis on community well-being and public safety initiatives.
