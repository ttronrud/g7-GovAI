### ⚖️ **Critical Evaluation: Is This a Real Regulation?**

**No. This is not a real or legally valid regulation.** Here’s why:

#### 1. ❌ **Incorrect Sovereign Reference: Victoria Day is Not the Birthday of the Current Sovereign**
- Victoria Day is **not** the birthday of King Charles III.
- It commemorates the **birth of Queen Victoria**, who was born on **24 May 1819**.
- The current monarch, **King Charles III**, was born on **14 November 1948**.
- Therefore, **no such proclamation could legally or historically designate Victoria Day as the birthday of the current sovereign**.

> ✅ **Fact Check:** The Canadian government has **never** declared Victoria Day as the birthday of King Charles III. This would be a major constitutional and historical error.

#### 2. ❌ **Misrepresentation of the Governor General’s Role**
- The **Governor General of Canada** (currently **Mary Simon**) is a constitutional officer who acts on the advice of the **Prime Minister and Cabinet**, not independently.
- The proclamation claims that the Governor General "does by this Proclamation" fix the date — implying executive authority over a national holiday.
- In reality, **the establishment and observance of national holidays in Canada is not governed by a royal proclamation** in this manner.
- **Victoria Day** was established in 1977 as a **national holiday** through **Parliamentary Act**, not by royal proclamation.

> ✅ **Correct Legal Basis:** Victoria Day is a statutory holiday established under the **Canada Day and Victoria Day Act (1977)**, passed by Parliament.

#### 3. ❌ **Misuse of the Great Seal and Royal Proclamation Format**
- The Great Seal of Canada is used only for **official, legally binding documents** such as treaties, constitutional changes, or major legislation.
- A simple proclamation declaring a holiday as the birthday of the sovereign would **not** require the Great Seal.
- Furthermore, such a proclamation would **not** be issued by the Governor General acting alone — it would require **Parliamentary approval** and be published in the *Canada Gazette*.

> ✅ **Reality:** No such proclamation has ever been issued by the Crown or Governor General to reassign Victoria Day as the birthday of the current monarch.

#### 4. ❌ **Incorrect Date and Reign Reference**
- The proclamation claims to be issued on **May 9, 2023**, in the **first year of the reign of King Charles III**.
- King Charles III’s reign began on **8 September 2022** (after the death of Queen Elizabeth II).
- Therefore, **May 9, 2023** is in the **second year** of his reign, not the first.

> ✅ This is a factual error and undermines the document’s authenticity.

#### 5. ❌ **Name and Title Errors**
- Mary May Simon is **not** the Governor General of Canada as of 2023.
- As of 2023, the Governor General of Canada is **Mary Simon**, but her full title and roles are:
  - Governor General of Canada
  - Chancellor of the Order of Canada
  - Commander of the Order of Military Merit
  - Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces
- However, she **did not** serve as Chancellor of the Order of Military Merit or Police Merit at the time of this proclamation (those are typically held by senior officers or appointed individuals).
- More importantly, **she is not a "Principal Companion" of the Order of Canada** — that is a title given to members of the Order, not a role of office.

> ✅ These titles are either misused or inaccurate in this context.

#### 6. ❌ **No Legal Authority to Change a National Holiday**
- The **Canadian Constitution** (particularly the *Constitution Act, 1867*) and the *Canada Day and Victoria Day Act* establish holidays through **Parliamentary legislation**.
- The Crown or Governor General **cannot unilaterally change or reassign** a national holiday.
