Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and structured summary** of the *Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Regulations*, enacted under the *Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act* (S.C. 2014, c. 7), as referenced in your text.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Regulations**

### 🔹 **Purpose of the Regulations**
These regulations establish and govern the **maximum fees that promoters (third-party service providers)** can charge for processing disability tax credit (DTC) claims on behalf of individuals in Canada. The goal is to **prevent exploitation, ensure affordability, and protect claimants** from excessive or unfair fees when seeking eligibility for the Disability Tax Credit under the Income Tax Act.

The regulations apply specifically to **requests made by promoters**—such as independent consultants, financial advisors, or third-party service providers—on behalf of a claimant (an individual applying for a DTC).

---

## 🔹 **Key Provisions**

### 1. **Maximum Fees for Disability Tax Credit Requests**

The maximum fee a promoter may charge is strictly capped, depending on the type of request:

| Type of Request | Maximum Fee |
|----------------|-------------|
| A request for a determination of **disability tax credit eligibility** under **subsection 152(1.01)** of the Income Tax Act | **$100** (one-time fee) |
| A request for a **deduction under subsection 118.3(1) or (2)** of the Income Tax Act | **$100 per taxation year** |
| A request for **any deduction or overpayment of tax** that is **contingent upon eligibility** under subsection 118.3(1) or (2) | **$100 per taxation year** |

> ⚠️ **Important Limitation**:  
> If **more than one request** is made in respect of the same claimant during a single taxation year (under either paragraph (b) or (c) above), the **total fee** that the promoter may accept or charge **must not exceed $100**.

> ✅ Example:  
> If a promoter makes two separate requests for a claimant in the same year (e.g., one for a deduction and one for an overpayment), the combined fee cannot exceed $100.

---

### 2. **Inflation-Adjusted Fee Schedule**

To account for inflation, the maximum fees are **adjusted periodically** to maintain their real purchasing power.

#### 🔹 Definition: "Inflationary Adjusted Year"
- The base inflationary adjusted year is **2025**.
- Subsequent inflationary adjusted years occur **every five years** after 2025:  
  → 2030, 2035, 2040, etc.

> This means the fee adjustment process happens every five years, starting in 2025.

---

#### 🔹 Fee Adjustment Formula (Applied on December 1)

On **December 1** of each inflationary adjusted year, the maximum fee is adjusted using the following rule:

> The new maximum fee is set equal to the **greater of**:
>
> **Option A**: The fee determined by the formula below  
> **Option B**: The fee described in the original description of A in paragraph (2)(a)

---

##### 📌 Formula for Adjustment:

Let:
- $ F $ = the maximum fee on **November 30** of the particular inflationary adjusted year
- $ C_{\text{current}} $ = the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 12-month period ending on **September 30** of the current inflationary adjusted year
- $ C_{\text{base}} $ = the CPI for the 12-month period ending on **September 30** of the **last inflationary adjusted year** when the fee was last adjusted

Then:

> **Adjusted Fee** = $ F \times \left( \frac{C_{\text{current}}}{C_{\text{base}}} \right) $

This result is:
- Rounded to the **nearest one-thousandth** (i.e., three decimal places)
- If equidistant between two values, **round up** to the higher value

---

##### 🔹 Special Cases by Year:

| Inflationary Adjusted Year | CPI Period Used |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **2025** | CPI for 12-month period ending **September 30, 2025** divided by CPI for **September 30, 2019** |
| **Any other year (e.g., 2030, 2035)** | CPI for 12-month period ending **September 30, current year** divided by CPI for **September 30, last adjusted year** |

> 📝 Note: The base year (2019) is used for the first adjustment (2025), and all subsequent adjustments use the most recent previous adjusted year as the base.

---

### 3. **Threshold for Applying the Adjustment**

The adjustment **only applies if**:

> The calculated adjusted fee exceeds the **original maximum fee (as described in A in paragraph 2(a))** by **$5 or more**.

> ✅ Example:  
> If the base fee is $100, and the adjusted fee is $105.00, the adjustment applies.  
> If the adjusted fee is $102.00, it does **not** apply.

> ❌ If the increase is less than $5, the fee remains unchanged.

---

### 4. **Rounding Rules**

- After applying the formula, the final adjusted fee is:
  - Rounded to the **nearest dollar**
  - If equidistant between two dollars (e.g., $102.50), **round up** to the higher value (e.g., $103)

> This ensures consistency and prevents fractional fees.

---

### 5. **Definition of Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

The CPI used in the adjustment is calculated as follows:

1. **Aggregate CPI**: Sum all monthly CPI values for Canada (as published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*) for each month in the 12-month period.
2. **Average CPI**: Divide the total by 12.
3. **Final Value**: Round the result to the **nearest one-thousandth** (e.g., 0.001), with **rounding up** if equidistant.

> This ensures a statistically accurate and transparent inflation measure.

---

### 6. **Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the **day the Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Act comes into force**.
- If the regulations are **registered later**, they take effect on the **date of registration**.

> 📌 Reference:  
> These regulations were in force as of **November 15, 2021** (SI/2021-10).

## 🔍 Key Implications and Practical Considerations

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fee Caps** | Promoters cannot charge more than $100 for any DTC-related request, even if multiple services are involved. |
| **Per-Year Limit** | For deductions tied to 118.3(1) or (2), fees are capped **per tax year**, not per request. |
| **Anti-Exploitation** | Prevents promoters from charging excessive fees by limiting total fees per claimant per year. |
| **Inflation Protection** | Ensures fees keep pace with inflation, maintaining fairness over time. |
| **Transparency** | Uses publicly available CPI data from Statistics Canada, enhancing accountability. |
| **Annual Review** | Adjustments occur every five years, ensuring long-term sustainability. |

## 📌 Summary in Plain Language

- Promoters can **charge a maximum of $100** for any disability tax credit claim.
- If a claimant has **multiple requests** in one year (e.g., for deductions or overpayments), the **total fee cannot exceed $100**.
- The fee is **adjusted every five years** (starting in 2025) to reflect inflation.
- The adjustment uses **official CPI data** from Statistics Canada and only applies if the increase is **$5 or more**.
- Fees are **rounded to the nearest dollar** at the end of the adjustment process.
- These rules help **protect vulnerable individuals** from being overcharged by third-party service providers.

The *Disability Tax Credit Promoters Restrictions Regulations* serve as a **critical safeguard** in the Canadian tax system. By imposing clear, transparent, and inflation-adjusted limits on promoter fees, they ensure that individuals seeking disability tax credit support are not burdened by excessive or exploitative charges. The regulations promote **accessibility, fairness, and accountability**, particularly for individuals who may be financially vulnerable and rely on third-party assistance to navigate complex tax rules.
