### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Context of the Transfer**  
   This transfer is part of a broader government restructuring initiative aimed at improving the efficiency, accountability, and strategic alignment of federal public services. The reorganization reflects a shift in how infrastructure responsibilities are managed within the federal government.

2. **Subject of the Transfer**  
   - **Unit Responsible for Federal Bridges in the Region of Montreal**  
     This unit is responsible for the management, maintenance, operation, and oversight of federal bridges located in the Montreal region. These bridges are critical components of Canada’s transportation infrastructure, serving major highways and connecting key urban and economic centers.

3. **Transfer of Authority**  
   - The **control and supervision** of this unit — including administrative, operational, and financial oversight — is being formally transferred from the **Department of Transport** to the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada**.  
   - This means that the Office of Infrastructure will now have the authority to direct policy, allocate resources, and manage day-to-day operations of the Montreal bridges unit.

4. **Purpose and Rationale**  
   - The move is intended to align bridge management with broader national infrastructure priorities.  
   - The Office of Infrastructure of Canada is designed to provide centralized oversight of federal infrastructure assets (such as bridges, roads, and transit systems), ensuring consistency in standards, safety, and long-term planning.  
   - By transferring bridge responsibilities, the government aims to improve coordination, reduce duplication, and enhance accountability across infrastructure portfolios.

5. **Legal Authority**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign functions and responsibilities among federal departments and agencies. This provision allows for structural adjustments in the public service to better meet policy and operational needs.

6. **Applicability and Scope**  
   - The transfer applies **only** to the specific unit within the Department of Transport related to federal bridges in the Montreal region.  
   - It does not affect other units within the Department of Transport or other regions.  
   - The transfer is effective as of **February 13, 2014**, meaning all administrative, financial, and operational responsibilities shift to the Office of Infrastructure on that date.

7. **Implications**  
   - Staff, budgets, and programs related to the Montreal bridges unit will now fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of Infrastructure.  
   - The Office of Infrastructure will be responsible for ensuring that the bridges are maintained to safe and sustainable standards, in line with national infrastructure policies.  
   - This may also lead to better integration with other infrastructure projects and regional planning efforts.
