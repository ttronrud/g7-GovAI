**Detailed Summary of the "Payments to the Provinces Regulations" (S.C. 2006, c. 13)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Payments to the Provinces Regulations* (S.C. 2006, c. 13) are a set of administrative rules established under the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* (the "Act"). These regulations govern how the federal government, through the Minister of National Revenue, calculates and distributes payments to certain Canadian provinces based on the revenue generated from the softwood lumber export charge and associated costs.

The purpose of these regulations is to ensure a fair and transparent allocation of revenue and cost-sharing between the federal government and the provinces—specifically those that are part of the "non-excluded provinces"—in relation to softwood lumber exports to the United States.

---

### **Key Provisions and Components**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
- The regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of:
  - The **Minister for International Trade**
  - The **Minister of National Revenue**
- This action is authorized under **subsection 100(2)** of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*.

---

#### **2. Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* (Loi). |
| **Non-excluded provinces** | Specifically defined as: **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta**. These provinces are eligible to receive payments under this regime. |

> Note: The term "excluded" implies that other provinces (e.g., New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia) are not included in the payment framework under these regulations.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to the **amount of payments** made by the **Minister of National Revenue** to the provinces under **Section 99 of the Act**.
- Section 99 establishes the mechanism for distributing funds derived from the export charge on softwood lumber products.

---

#### **4. Periodicity of Calculations**

| Type of Calculation | Time Period |
|--------------------|------------|
| **First calculation** | From **October 12, 2006**, to **September 30, 2007** |
| **Subsequent calculations** | For each **calendar quarter** (January–March, April–June, July–September, October–December) |
| **Annual reconciliation** | Conducted **annually**, except for the final reconciliation at the end of the reporting period |

> This structure ensures regular, periodic assessment of revenue and cost allocations, with annual reviews to verify accuracy and consistency.

---

#### **5. Revenue Attribution to Provinces**

- The **amount of revenue attributed to a province** is defined as:
  > The **revenue derived from the export charge** imposed under **Section 10 or 15 of the Act** on softwood lumber products that **originated in that province** and were exported to the United States.

> This means provinces only receive a share of the revenue generated from lumber products that are *originally produced within their borders*.

---

#### **6. Cost Attribution Formula**

The regulations specify a **cost-sharing formula** to determine how much of the administrative and operational costs associated with the export charge are allocated to each non-excluded province.

##### **Formula for Costs (Sections 99(1)(a) and (99)(b))**:

\[
\text{Cost attributed to a province} = \left( \frac{\text{Costs known during the period}}{\text{Total volume of softwood lumber exported from all non-excluded provinces to the U.S.}} \right) \times \text{Volume exported from the specific province}
\]

Where:
- **Costs known during the period** = The total costs that the Minister becomes aware of during the reporting period (e.g., administrative, compliance, enforcement costs).
- **Volume in board feet** = The quantity of softwood lumber exported from a province (or all non-excluded provinces) to the U.S. under export permits.

##### **Application of the Formula**
- This formula applies to **costs under paragraph 99(1)(a)** (general administrative costs).
- It **also applies to costs under paragraph 99(1)(b)** (costs related to export permits and compliance), **unless the Minister determines otherwise** under Section 99 of the Act.

> This provides flexibility—should the Minister determine that a different allocation method is more appropriate (e.g., due to unique circumstances or data limitations), they may deviate from the formula.

---

#### **7. Implementation and Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- Registration typically occurs shortly after the regulations are published, ensuring immediate legal effect upon publication.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

These regulations serve several key functions:

1. **Revenue Sharing**: Ensure that provinces that produce softwood lumber and export it to the U.S. receive a fair share of the revenue generated from the export charge.
2. **Cost Allocation**: Distribute the administrative and operational costs of managing the export charge fairly across provinces based on their export volumes.
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: By specifying clear formulas and timelines for calculations and reconciliations, the regulations promote transparency and accountability in the payment process.
4. **Fairness and Proportionality**: The volume-based cost attribution ensures that provinces with higher export volumes bear a proportionate share of costs, while also receiving a share of revenue.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Provincial Benefit**: Provinces like BC, Ontario, and Alberta—major softwood producers—benefit directly from this payment mechanism.
- **Federal Oversight**: The Minister of National Revenue maintains control over the calculation process, ensuring consistency and compliance with the Act.
- **Data-Driven Process**: The use of actual export volumes (in board feet) and known costs makes the system measurable and objective.
- **Annual Review**: The annual reconciliation ensures that the final figures are accurate and that any discrepancies are resolved.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Payments to the Provinces Regulations* establish a structured, data-driven, and equitable framework for distributing revenue and costs related to the softwood lumber export charge. By linking payments to actual export volumes and known costs, the regulations ensure that provinces are fairly compensated for their role in the softwood export industry while maintaining fiscal responsibility and transparency in federal-provincial financial relations.

These regulations remain a critical component of Canada’s trade policy framework, particularly in managing the economic impact of softwood lumber exports to the United States.
