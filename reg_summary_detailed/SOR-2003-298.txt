**Detailed Summary of the *Disclosure of Interest (Retail Associations) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Disclosure of Interest (Retail Associations) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Cooperative Credit Associations Act (Act)**:

- **Section 385.09a** – Grants the authority to regulate disclosure of interest rates for retail cooperative credit associations.
- **Subsection 385.1(6)a** – Specifies conditions under which financial institutions must disclose interest rate details to customers.
- **Sections 385.28a and 463b** – Provide further regulatory framework for interest rate transparency and disclosure requirements.

These regulations were enacted under the legislative authority of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* and came into force upon registration in the *Statutes of Canada*.

> **Relevant Statutes**:
> - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 313 and s. 339 (providing the enabling powers and scope)
> - S.C. 1991, c. 48 (original framework for disclosure requirements)

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define three core terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, which governs the operations of cooperative credit associations in Canada. |
| **Deposit Account** | An interest-bearing deposit account held by a natural person in Canada. This includes savings accounts, term deposits, and similar instruments that earn interest. |
| **Point of Service** | A physical location where the public can access services and open or initiate a deposit account. This includes branches, kiosks, or any place where retail associations conduct business directly with individuals. |

> *Note: The term "point of service" is critical as it defines where disclosures must be made available to the public.*

### **3. Disclosure Requirements Upon Opening a Deposit Account**

A retail association must provide **clear and accessible information** about interest rates and interest calculation methods when a customer requests to open a deposit account.

#### **Option 1: If a Statement of Account is Provided**
- The association must deliver a **written statement** to the customer **at or before the time the account is opened**.
- This statement must include:
  - The **annual rate of interest**
  - The **frequency of interest payment** (e.g., monthly, quarterly)
  - The **manner, if any, in which the account balance affects the interest rate** (e.g., variable rate based on balance)
  - **Any other circumstances** that affect the interest rate (e.g., minimum balance requirements, caps, promotional periods)

#### **Option 2: If No Statement of Account is Provided**
- The association must ensure that the required information is available through one of the following:
  1. **Written statements** displayed in **each branch** where deposit accounts are held (copies must be available).
  2. A **general notice** displayed in:
     - All branches where deposit accounts are kept
     - All **points of service**
     - On the association’s **websites** offering deposit accounts in Canada

> This ensures transparency even when a formal statement is not issued at account opening.

### **4. Special Requirement for Telephone Account Openings**

Under **subsection 385.1(3)** of the Act, if a customer opens a deposit account via **telephone request**, the retail association must:

- Provide a **written statement** within **seven business days** of account opening.
- The statement must clearly state:
  - The **annual rate of interest**
  - The **frequency of interest payment**
  - The **manner, if any, in which the balance affects the interest rate**
  - Any other relevant circumstances affecting the interest rate

> This provision ensures that customers who open accounts remotely are not left without clear information about their financial product.

---

### **5. Timing and Delivery of Written Statements**

- A **written statement sent by mail** is deemed to have been provided to the customer on the **fifth day after the postmark date**.
- This establishes a clear and enforceable timeline for delivery and ensures that customers receive the information within a reasonable timeframe.

---

### **6. Disclosure of Changes to Interest Rates or Calculation Methods**

A retail association must **immediately inform customers** of any change in:

- The **interest rate** applicable to a deposit account
- The **manner of calculating interest**

The changes must be disclosed through **one or more of the following methods**:

1. A **written statement delivered directly** to the account holder.
2. Copies of a written statement **available and displayed in each branch** where deposit accounts are kept.
3. A **general notice** displayed in:
   - All branches
   - All points of service
   - On the association’s **websites** offering deposit accounts in Canada

> This ensures that customers are aware of changes that could impact their returns, promoting financial transparency and informed decision-making.

### **7. Disclosure in Advertising**

In all **advertisements** related to interest-bearing deposits, the retail association must include a **clear statement** that explains:

- The **manner, if any, in which the balance in the deposit account affects the interest rate**
- All **other circumstances** that affect the interest rate (e.g., minimum balance, promotional periods, caps, or rate adjustments)

> This requirement ensures that advertising does not mislead consumers by omitting key details about how interest is determined.

> *Note: This provision was previously repealed in SOR/2009-46, s. 4, but the current version appears to have been reinstated or replaced, indicating an ongoing commitment to consumer protection in advertising.*

### **8. Effective Date**
