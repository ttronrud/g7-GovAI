**Detailed Summary of the *Former Members of Parliament Counting of Service Regulations***  
*(Under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**

The *Former Members of Parliament Counting of Service Regulations* (the "Regulations") allow certain former members of Parliament (MPs) who contributed to the **Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Account (MPRA)** to **count their period of service as pensionable service** under the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act (RCMP Act)**.

This provision enables MPs who have retired under the *Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act* (MPRA Act) to have their service in Parliament recognized as qualifying for retirement benefits under the RCMP’s pension system — specifically, for purposes of **Part I of the RCMP Superannuation Act**, which governs pension eligibility and benefits for RCMP members.

These Regulations were introduced in 1992, amended in 1999 and 2009, and are currently in force under the authority of the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, pursuant to specific provisions of the RCMP Superannuation Act.

### **2. Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

#### **2.1 Eligibility to Count Service as Pensionable Service**

- A **contributor** (an individual who previously served as a Member of Parliament) may **elect to count any period of service** in which they contributed to the MPRA as **pensionable service** under the RCMP Superannuation Act.
- This applies only to periods of service where contributions were made to the MPRA under subsection 3(1) of the MPRA Act.

> **Note**: This is not automatic — it requires a formal written election.

---

#### **2.2 Timing of Election**

- The election **must be made no later than the day on which the contributor ceases to be a member of the Force** (i.e., when they retire from public service).
- The election must be made **in writing**, **signed, and dated**.
- The election is **effective on the day it is signed**.

---

#### **2.3 Conditional Election for Retirees with MPRA Allowance**

- If the contributor is **entitled to a retirement allowance under the MPRA Act** for a period of service, then the election to count that service as pensionable service is **conditional**.
- To make the election, the contributor must **surrender their entitlement to that retirement allowance**.

> This means that choosing to count Parliament service under the RCMP pension system results in giving up the MPRA retirement benefit for that period.

---

#### **2.4 Submission of Election Document**

- The signed election document must be **sent to the Commissioner of the RCMP within one month** of the date it is signed.
- The **date of mailing or delivery** (with postmark as evidence) is the effective date of submission.

---

#### **2.5 Exception: Errors in Information from Authorized Advisors**

- If a contributor **received erroneous or misleading information** from an **authorized advisor** (someone who normally provides advice on these matters), and **did not make the election while still a member**, they may still make the election **within one year** of:
  - Receiving the **corrected information**, or
  - The **date these Regulations come into force**, whichever is later.

> This provides a **one-year grace period** for individuals who were misled by advisors.

---

#### **2.6 Right to Revoke the Election**

A contributor may **revoke** the election under the following conditions:

1. If they received **erroneous or misleading information** from an authorized advisor and:
   - Failed to make the election while still a member, and
   - Made the election **within one year** of receiving corrected information, or
   - Made the election **after ceasing to be a member** and after receiving corrected information.

> **Important**: Upon revocation, the contributor is **deemed to have made the election on the day after receiving the erroneous or misleading information**.

> This ensures fairness and protects individuals from being locked into a decision due to misinformation.

---

#### **2.7 Determination of Annual Rate of Pay for Pension Calculation**

For the purposes of calculating pension benefits, the contributor is deemed to have received an **annual rate of pay** during the service period. This rate is determined as follows:

- **If the election is made within one year** of the day they most recently became a contributor:  
  → Use the **annual rate of pay** they were receiving on that day.

- **If the election is made after one year**:  
  → Use the **annual rate of pay** they are receiving on the day the election is made.

> **For part-time members**:  
If the contributor was part-time on the day of contribution or the election, the annual rate of pay is calculated as:
- The amount that would have been paid if they had been a **full-time member** at that time.
- If working in multiple positions:  
  → Sum the weekly average hours across all positions, then apply the full-time equivalent rate.

---

#### **2.8 Payment of a Replacement Amount (for Withdrawal Allowances)**

A contributor who previously received a **withdrawal allowance** under the MPRA Act and now makes this election must **pay a replacement amount** to the **RCMP Pension Fund**.

The amount depends on **when the withdrawal allowance was paid**:

| Period | Amount Payable |
|-------|----------------|
| Before January 1, 2000 | As per subsection 5(1) of the Act as it read on December 31, 1999 |
| After 1999, before January 1, 2004 | As per subsection 5(1) of the Act as it read on December 31, 2003 |
| After 2003, before January 1, 2013 | As per subsection 5(2) of the Act as it read on December 31, 2012 |
| After 2012 | As per subsection 5(1) of the Act |

> **If the election is made more than one year after becoming a contributor**, the amount is:
> - The amount that would have been payable **if made within one year**, **plus interest**.
> - Interest is calculated on the annual rate of pay deemed under subsection 3(2), compounded annually.

#### **2.9 Payment Terms (Installments or Lump Sum)**

Contributors may choose to pay the required amount in either:

1. **Monthly installments**, or  
2. **A lump sum**

##### **Monthly Installments**

- Must begin on the **first day of the month after the election is made**.
- Must continue until the **earlier of**:
  - The end of the chosen period (maximum of **20 years or the contributor’s 65th birthday**), or
  - The contributor’s death.
- Each installment must be **at least $5.00**, except the last one.
- Installments are calculated using:
  - **Mortality rates** from the most recent actuarial valuation report laid before Parliament (as per section 30 of the Act).
  - **Interest**: Compounded annually at the **projected rate of return** of the RCMP Pension Fund used in that valuation report.

> *If the valuation report is laid in the same month or the prior month, the immediately preceding report is used.*

##### **Prepayment and Adjustment Options**

- A contributor may:
  - **Prepay** any unpaid amount.
  - **Decrease the payment period** by increasing the amount of remaining installments.

> Upon request, the **period of payments is adjusted on the first day of the month after the request**.
> The actuarial report used is the most recent one laid before Parliament prior to the request (or the one immediately before if laid in the same month).

---

#### **2.10 Default and Arrears**

- Failure to pay an installment **before or on the due date** constitutes **default**.
- A notice of default is sent **as soon as feasible** after the default occurs.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If the contributor is on **leave without pay**, or
  - Has ceased to be a member and is entitled to an annual allowance or deferred annuity (not yet payable),
    → Notice is sent upon their **return to work** or **start of allowance/annuity**.

> **Within 30 days of receiving the notice**, the contributor must either:
> - Pay the **arrears plus interest in a lump sum**, or
> - Opt to pay the arrears in **monthly installments** over the period from the first default to the date of notice.

---

#### **2.11 Interest on Arrears**

- **Lump-sum payments**:
  - Interest is compounded annually from the **date of default** to the **date of payment**.
  - Rate = Projected rate of return of the RCMP Pension Fund from the most recent actuarial report before the notice date.

- **Monthly installment payments**:
  - Interest is compounded annually from the **date of default** to the **date of receipt**.
  - Rate = Same as above.

---

#### **2.12 Payment Schedule for Arrears (if not settled)**

If the contributor fails to act within the 30-day window:

- Arrears are paid in **monthly installments** beginning on the **first day of the month after the notice of default**.
- Payments continue until the **earlier of**:
  - The end of the original chosen
