**Detailed Summary of the Gypsum Board Products Anti-dumping Duty Remission Order, 2017**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the **Gypsum Board Products Anti-dumping Duty Remission Order, 2017**, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**. It is a statutory instrument designed to provide a **remission (reduction or waiver)** of anti-dumping duties that certain importers have paid or may be required to pay on **gypsum board products**.

The Order is grounded in the **Special Import Measures Act (SIMA)**, specifically under **section 115a**, which allows for the remission of anti-dumping duties in cases where the dumping margin is deemed excessive or where the market conditions justify relief.

**Legal References:**
- *S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)* – Authority to issue remission orders under SIMA.
- *S.C. 1997, c. 36* – The Special Import Measures Act.

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms used in the Order are defined as follows:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Special Import Measures Act* (SIMA). |
| **Agency** | Refers to the *Canada Border Services Agency* (CBSA), responsible for enforcing customs and import regulations. |
| **Gypsum board products** | Defined as the subject goods identified in **paragraph 30 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) finding** issued on **January 4, 2017**, in **Inquiry Number NQ-2016-002**. This includes various types of drywall or plasterboard used in construction. |
| **Import value** | The value calculated for "B" in the formula specified in paragraph 2(1)(b) of the Act, **as if it were the export price** under sections 24 and 25 of the Act. This is the value used to determine the dumping margin. |
| **Reference value** | The value calculated for "A" in the same formula (paragraph 2(1)(b)), representing the **normal value** of the product (i.e., the price at which the product is sold in the domestic market of the exporting country). |

> These values are critical in calculating the **remission amount**.

### **3. Remission Formula**

A remission is granted for each gypsum board product equal to the **amount by which the anti-dumping duties exceed** the greater of:

1. **Zero (0)**  
2. An amount calculated using the following formula:

> **Remission Amount = [Reference Value × (1 – 32.17%)] – Import Value**

Where:
- **Reference Value** = The normal value per thousand square feet, calculated at the time of the final determination (January 4, 2017), **reduced by 32.17%**.
- **Import Value** = The value per thousand square feet of the imported product, calculated based on:
  - **If section 25(1)(b) of the Act applies** (i.e., if the product is subject to a specific valuation method), then:
    - Under **section 25 of the Act**, **without any deductions** for duties under paragraphs (1)(c) or (1)(d) — except for duties imposed under the *Customs Tariff*.
  - **Otherwise**, under **section 24 of the Act** (the general valuation method).

> ⚠️ **Critical Adjustment**:  
> If the **import value (B)** is **less than** the **reference value (A)**, then the remission amount is **reduced by the difference** between the reference value and the import value.  
> This ensures that remission does not exceed the actual dumping margin.

---

### **4. Scope of the Investigation**

The remission applies to the results of an investigation initiated on **June 8, 2016**, under **subsection 31(1) of the Special Import Measures Act**. This investigation concluded with a finding by the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)** on **January 4, 2017**, that certain gypsum board products were being **dumped in a manner that caused or threatened injury to the Canadian industry**.

This finding established the basis for anti-dumping duties and also forms the foundation for the remission calculation.

---

### **5. Annual Indexing of Reference Value**

To account for inflation and changes in market prices, the **reference value** for each gypsum board product is **indexed annually**, starting on **January 1, 2018**.

- The indexing is based on the **Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI)** for gypsum product manufacturing.
- The index covers the **12-month period ending on September 30** of the immediately preceding calendar year.
- This ensures that the reference value remains relevant and reflects real-world cost changes over time.

> Example: The reference value for 2018 would be adjusted based on the 12-month IPPI from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2018.

### **6. Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for remission, the importer must meet the following conditions:

#### **(a) Timely Claim**
- A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **within two years** of the date when the gypsum board products are accounted for under **section 32 of the Customs Act**.

> This creates a strict deadline for claiming remission, emphasizing timely compliance.

#### **(b) Submission of Evidence**
- Upon request by the **CBSA**, the importer must file with the Agency:
  - All necessary **evidence or information** required to verify eligibility for remission.
  - This includes documentation supporting the import value, the normal value, and the calculation of the dumping margin.

#### **(c) Agreement to Audit**
- The importer **agrees to be subject to audits** by the CBSA at any time — including **after remission has been granted**.
- The audit purpose is to verify:
  - Whether the information provided under (a) or (b) is **accurate and complete**.
  - Whether the **facts relied upon** to determine eligibility remain unchanged in **all material respects**.

#### **(d) Audit Compliance**
- At the time of any audit, the CBSA must be able to conclude that:
  - The information supplied is **accurate and complete**.
  - The facts remain **unchanged in all material respects**.

> This provision ensures **transparency, accountability, and compliance** with the remission process.

### **8. Purpose and Rationale**

- Maintains **fairness and consistency** in the application of anti-dumping measures by allowing a calculated, transparent, and indexed adjustment.
- Reinforces the **principles of international trade fairness** by acknowledging market dynamics and inflation.
- Balances protection of domestic industries with the need for importers to remain competitive and viable.
