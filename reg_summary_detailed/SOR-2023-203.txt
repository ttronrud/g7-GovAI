**Detailed Summary of the Online Undertakings Registration Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The *Online Undertakings Registration Regulations* are a regulatory framework established under **section 10(10)** of the *Broadcasting Act* (S.C. 2023, c. 8), specifically pursuant to **subsection 10(1)c**, which empowers the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** to make regulations governing online broadcasting undertakings.

These regulations were first proposed under **subsection 10(3)a** of the *Broadcasting Act* and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **May 20, 2023**, giving interested parties—including broadcasters, industry stakeholders, and the public—a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the CRTC. Following this public consultation, the CRTC has now formally adopted and enacted the regulations.

---

### **Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Government of Canada. This date is typically the day of publication in the *Canada Gazette*, Part I, or a subsequent date set by the CRTC upon registration.

---

### **Definition of Key Term**

- **"Operator"**:  
  A person who carries on an **online undertaking** to which the *Broadcasting Act* applies.  
  This includes entities providing digital content through platforms such as streaming services, video-on-demand (VOD), live-streaming, or other forms of online broadcasting that fall under the scope of the Act.

---

### **Mandatory Registration Requirements**

All operators must register their online undertaking within **30 days** of beginning operations. The registration return must include the following information:

1. **Name of the online undertaking**  
   – The official name under which the service operates (e.g., a streaming platform or website).

2. **Operator’s basic contact details**  
   – Full name  
   – Mailing address  
   – Phone number  
   – Email address  

3. **Alternate contact person details** (if different from above)  
   – Name  
   – Title  
   – Mailing address  
   – Phone number  
   – Email address  
   *(This ensures the Commission can reach a designated individual for communication or compliance purposes.)*

4. **Place of incorporation or formation**  
   – Where the operator is legally registered or formed (e.g., in Ontario, British Columbia, or another province).  
   – If applicable, the **location of the operator’s head office**.

5. **Broadcasting services offered**  
   – A clear description of the types of content or services provided, such as:  
     - Live or on-demand video programming  
     - Audio content (e.g., podcasts, radio streams)  
     - Interactive or digital content platforms  
     - Any other service that falls under the definition of broadcasting as defined in the *Broadcasting Act*.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The Commission may determine that a registration return is **incomplete or incorrect** and may issue a request for additional or corrected information.

---

### **Response to Commission Requests**

- If the Commission identifies any deficiencies or inaccuracies in a registration return, it may **request additional information** to correct or complete the return.
- The operator must respond to such requests **as soon as feasible**, meaning promptly and in a timely manner.

---

### **Notification of Changes**

- Operators must **notify the Commission of any changes** to previously submitted information within **30 days** of the change occurring.
- Examples of required updates include:
  - A change in the operator’s name or address
  - A change in the contact person
  - A change in the services offered
  - A change in the head office location

> This ensures the Commission maintains up-to-date and accurate records of all online broadcasting activities.

---

### **Deregistration Process**

- When an operator **ceases to carry on** an online undertaking, they must submit a **formal request for deregistration** within **30 days** of ceasing operations.
- If the operator fails to respond or does not reappear, the Commission may **deregister the undertaking automatically**.
- Automatic deregistration occurs **only after** the Commission has made **reasonable attempts to contact** the operator using the contact information on file and is unable to verify that the operator continues to operate.

> This mechanism ensures that inactive or defunct online undertakings do not remain registered indefinitely.

---

### **Submission Format and Method**

- All information submitted under these regulations must be submitted **electronically**.
- The **format** (e.g., form, template, software platform) is specified by the CRTC.
- Paper submissions are not permitted.

> This promotes efficiency, transparency, and data security in the regulatory process.

---

### **Provision for Pre-Existing Online Undertakings**

- For operators who began carrying on an online undertaking **before the regulations came into force**, a special provision applies:
  - They must register their undertaking within **60 days** of the regulations coming into force.
  - The registration return must contain all the same information required of new operators (as outlined in Section 2).

> This ensures that existing digital platforms are brought into compliance with the new regulatory regime without creating a gap in oversight.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Regulations**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   – To provide clear visibility into who is operating online broadcasting services and what content they offer.

2. **Regulatory Oversight**  
   – To enable the CRTC to monitor and regulate online broadcasting services consistent with the *Broadcasting Act*, especially as digital platforms grow in influence and reach.

3. **Consumer Protection**  
   – To ensure that users are aware of who is providing content and can access reliable information about the operators.

4. **Compliance and Enforcement**  
   – To establish a clear, enforceable process for registration, updates, and deregistration, reducing ambiguity and facilitating enforcement actions if needed.

---

### **Key Implications for Industry**

- **Streaming platforms, OTT services (over-the-top), live-streaming sites, and digital content providers** must now comply with these rules.
- Operators must maintain accurate, up-to-date records and respond promptly to Commission requests.
- Failure to register or to report changes may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the CRTC.
- The regulations signal a broader trend of the CRTC expanding its regulatory reach into the digital and online space.

### **Conclusion**

The *Online Undertakings Registration Regulations* represent a significant step in modernizing Canada’s broadcasting regulatory framework to address the rise of digital platforms. By requiring mandatory registration, timely reporting, and clear accountability, the CRTC aims to ensure that all online broadcasting services operate transparently, fairly, and in compliance with national broadcasting standards.

These regulations are both **proactive and practical**, balancing the need for regulatory oversight with the realities of fast-evolving digital media.
