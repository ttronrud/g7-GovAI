**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order*  
**Citation:** S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 36; Effective Date: December 4, 1985  
**Issuing Authority:** The Attorney General of Canada  
**Legal Basis:** Subsection 238(1) of the *Criminal Code of Canada* (specifically, the definition of "approved instrument" under that provision)

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation serves to **approve specific breath analysis instruments** as being **suitable and reliable for use in measuring the concentration of alcohol in a person’s blood**, in accordance with **Section 258 of the Criminal Code of Canada**.

Section 258 of the Criminal Code governs the **admissibility of breath analysis results** in criminal proceedings related to alcohol impairment, particularly in the context of driving under the influence (DUI) or other offenses involving impaired driving. For such results to be admissible in court, the instrument used to conduct the test must be **approved by the Government of Canada** as meeting established standards of accuracy, reliability, and validity.

This Order replaces an earlier *Approved Instruments Order, C.R.C., c. 428*, which had been in force prior to 1985. The new Order is issued under the authority granted by the definition approved in subsection 238(1) of the *Criminal Code*, which allows the Attorney General to designate instruments that meet the required standards.

### **Key Provisions and Content**

1. **Revocation of Previous Order**  
   The prior Approved Instruments Order (C.R.C., c. 428) is **revoked** and replaced by this new Order. This indicates a formal update or revision of the list of approved instruments, likely to reflect technological advancements, changes in standards, or improvements in instrument reliability.

2. **Effective Date**  
   The new Order becomes effective on **December 4, 1985**. This means that all breath analysis instruments listed in this Order are recognized as valid and admissible in court for alcohol concentration testing from that date onward.

3. **Name of the Order**  
   The regulation is officially titled the *Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order* and may be cited accordingly.

4. **List of Approved Instruments**  
   The following breath analysis instruments are approved for use under Section 258 of the Criminal Code:

   - **Intoxilyzer® 5000 C**  
   - **BAC Datamaster C**  
   - **Alco-Sensor IV-RBT IV**  
   - **Alco-Sensor IV/RBT IV-K**  
   - **Alcotest 7110 MKIII Dual C**  
   - **Intoxilyzer® 8000 C**  
   - **DataMaster DMT-C**  
   - **Intox EC/IR II**  
   - **Intoxilyzer® 9000**

   > *Note:* The entries for "Repealed, SOR/2012-237, s. 1" and "Repealed, SOR/2013-107, s. 1" indicate that certain instruments previously listed in earlier versions of this Order were **removed or replaced** by subsequent amendments. These repeals suggest that the list has evolved over time, and the current list reflects instruments that are still valid and in compliance with updated standards.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Admissibility in Court**: Any breath test conducted using one of the approved instruments listed above may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings involving alcohol impairment, provided the test was administered properly and the instrument was functioning correctly.

- **Standardization and Reliability**: The approval process ensures that only instruments meeting national standards for accuracy, calibration, and consistency are permitted. This helps maintain the integrity of legal proceedings and protects against unreliable or inaccurate results.

- **Jurisdictional Scope**: This Order applies across Canada, as it is issued by the federal government under the *Criminal Code*, which governs offenses related to impaired driving and alcohol use.

- **Ongoing Review**: The inclusion of specific model numbers (e.g., Intoxilyzer® 5000 C vs. 9000) suggests that the Government periodically reviews and updates the list based on technological progress and performance evaluations.

### **Subsequent Amendments and Repeals**

- **SOR/2012-237, s. 1** and **SOR/2013-107, s. 1** are references to **subsequent regulatory amendments** that **repealed certain instruments** from the original list. This indicates that the list of approved instruments is **not static** and is subject to periodic review and update to reflect changes in technology, performance, or legal standards.

- The fact that several entries are marked as "Repealed" implies that these instruments were either:
  - Found to be unreliable or inaccurate,
  - No longer in production or use,
  - Or were replaced by newer models with better performance.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a formal, legally binding list of breath analysis instruments approved for use in Canadian courts to determine alcohol concentration in blood. It ensures that only instruments meeting federal standards are used in legal proceedings related to impaired driving and alcohol offenses. By revoking the previous Order and replacing it with a more current list, the Government maintains the reliability and fairness of breath testing procedures in the criminal justice system.

The Order is a critical component of Canada’s approach to enforcing laws against impaired driving and reflects a commitment to using scientifically valid and consistently accurate tools in legal investigations.

**Note:** While this Order was issued in 1985, it has been **superseded or amended** over time through subsequent regulatory changes (e.g., SOR/2012-237 and SOR/2013-107). As such, the current list of approved instruments may differ from what is listed here. For up-to-date information, legal practitioners and law enforcement agencies should consult the most recent version of the *Approved Breath Analysis Instruments Order* as published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* or through official government databases.
