The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-319, s. 1]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or replaced) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of 2016, No. 319 (SOR/2016-319)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** — it no longer exists in force.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect upon the coming into force of **SOR/2016-319**, which was published in the Canada Gazette and became effective on **June 14, 2016** (the typical date for such statutory rules, though the exact date should be confirmed in the official Gazette).
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Government of Canada**, as part of a broader legislative or regulatory consolidation effort.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of the regulation (specifically referenced as "s. 1") was repealed. This suggests that the regulation may have been a standalone rule or a provision within a broader framework (e.g., a rule under a federal statute) that was deemed outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or policy.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason is not specified in the provided text, common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
  - Obsolescence (e.g., the regulation no longer applies to current practices).
  - Consolidation of rules (to simplify the regulatory framework).
  - Replacement by a more comprehensive or updated regulation.
  - Alignment with new legislation or policy changes.
- **Impact**: Any obligations, requirements, or procedures previously governed by this regulation are no longer in effect. Entities or individuals previously subject to it must now comply with the current, active regulations that replaced it or with other applicable rules.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries suggest that this may have been a formatting or data entry error in the original source — the same repeal notice is listed multiple times.
- Since no actual content of the regulation is provided (only the repeal notice), a detailed summary of its original provisions (e.g., scope, application, penalties, etc.) **cannot be offered**.
- To understand the original intent of the regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to repeal, which is now inaccessible or archived.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force** and was **officially repealed on June 14, 2016**, under **SOR/2016-319, section 1**. It has been replaced or superseded by another regulation or policy. Without the original text, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or application cannot be provided. For accurate historical or operational context, reference to the original regulation or the explanatory documents accompanying SOR/2016-319 is required.
