**Detailed Summary of the Newfoundland Railway Reimbursement Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Newfoundland Railway Reimbursement Regulations* are a set of government regulations enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **Treasury Board**, under the authority of **Transport Vote 91b of Appropriation Act No. 3, 1980–81**. These regulations establish a framework for **reimbursement of a portion of the costs** incurred by the **Canadian National Railway Company (CNR)** and **CN Marine Inc. (CN Marine)** for benefits provided to employees who were adversely affected by permanent changes in railway operations in **Newfoundland** due to operational rationalization.

The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Newfoundland Railway Reimbursement Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to:

- Provide financial support to CNR and CN Marine for the **benefits they provided** to employees whose jobs were eliminated as a result of permanent operational changes (e.g., layoffs, restructuring).
- Ensure that **a portion of the cost** of these benefits is reimbursed by the federal government, based on specific agreements and policies in place prior to or during the restructuring period.
- Promote fairness and accountability in the administration of employee benefits during major organizational changes in the Canadian railway sector.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms to clarify scope and application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CN Marine** | Refers to CN Marine Inc., a subsidiary of CNR involved in maritime operations. |
| **CNR** | The Canadian National Railway Company, the parent company responsible for rail operations. |
| **Job Security Agreement** | The agreement signed on April 26, 1979, in Montreal, Quebec, between CNR and various non-operating, shopcraft, or other unions. It includes provisions for job security and transition during technological and operational changes. |
| **Material Change Agreement** | An agreement signed on April 26, 1979, in Montreal, Quebec, between CNR and the United Transportation Union (UTU), containing provisions for "material changes" in operations (e.g., layoffs, reorganization). |
| **Special Agreement** | A unique agreement signed on January 30, 1981, in St. John’s, Newfoundland, involving multiple unions and labor groups. It specifically addresses the impact of rationalization on Newfoundland employees and includes enhanced protections and benefits. |
| **Vote** | Refers to **Department of Transport Vote 105 of Appropriation Act No. 2, 1984–85**, which authorizes the government to fund reimbursement under these regulations. |

### **Eligibility and Reimbursement Provisions**

The Minister of Transport has the authority to reimburse CNR or CN Marine for **specific costs** incurred between **April 1, 1985, and March 31, 1993**, for benefits provided to employees whose positions were **eliminated on or before March 31, 1986**.

#### **Reimbursement Rates by Benefit Type**

1. **80% Reimbursement** applies to costs for benefits provided under:
   - The **Job Security Agreement**;
   - The **Material Change Agreement**;
   - The **policies and authorities of CNR in force before January 23, 1981**;
   - Or benefits that **would have been provided** under any of the above agreements **if the Special Agreement had not been in force**.

2. **100% Reimbursement** applies to costs for benefits that are:
   - **Additional** to those covered under paragraph (a) above;
   - Provided under the **Special Agreement**; or
   - Provided under the **policies and authorities of CNR in force before January 23, 1981** (if not already covered).

> This means that the **Special Agreement offers stronger protections**, and the government fully reimburses the costs associated with benefits under it — even if they go beyond what was provided under earlier agreements.

### **Conditions for Reimbursement**

To qualify for reimbursement under **Section 3**, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Record-Keeping Requirement**:  
   - CNR or CN Marine (whichever is the employer) must maintain **complete and accurate records** of all costs related to the benefits provided to affected employees.

2. **Access to Records**:  
   - The employer must allow the **Minister of Transport or any authorized person** to inspect these records upon request.  
   - The purpose of inspection is to **determine the amount of reimbursement** that may be paid under the Vote and these Regulations.

> This ensures **transparency, accountability, and auditability** in the reimbursement process.

---

### **Scope and Time Period**

- **Timeframe**: Costs must have been incurred between **April 1, 1985, and March 31, 1993**.
- **Eligible Employees**: Must have had their positions **eliminated on or before March 31, 1986**.
- **Geographic Focus**: The changes and benefits are specifically tied to **Newfoundland**, where the rationalization of railway operations had a significant impact on workers.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

The regulations are authorized under:
- **Transport Vote 91b** of the *Appropriation Act No. 3, 1980–81* (original funding authorization).
- **Transport Vote 105** of the *Appropriation Act No. 2, 1984–85* (specific funding for reimbursement under these regulations).

This reflects a federal government commitment to supporting workers during major industrial transitions, especially in regions like Newfoundland where such changes had significant socio-economic consequences.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Worker Protection**:  
   The regulations recognize the adverse impact of rationalization on employees and provide a mechanism for compensating the costs of transition benefits, such as severance, retraining, or job placement.

2. **Fairness in Benefit Provision**:  
   The 80% and 100% reimbursement structure acknowledges that the **Special Agreement** (signed in 1981) represented a more comprehensive and protective arrangement than earlier agreements, thus justifying full reimbursement for its benefits.

3. **Accountability and Oversight**:  
   The requirement for record-keeping and inspection ensures that the government can verify claims and prevent misuse of funds.

4. **Historical Context**:  
   These regulations were developed in response to significant restructuring in the Canadian railway industry during the 1980s, particularly in Newfoundland, where operational changes led to widespread job losses. The government sought to balance cost containment with worker support.

### **Conclusion**

The *Newfoundland Railway Reimbursement Regulations* represent a targeted federal policy intervention to support employees affected by permanent changes in railway operations in Newfoundland. By providing **partial or full reimbursement** of costs for transition benefits — depending on the type of agreement or policy — the regulations aim to:

- Mitigate the negative economic impact on workers;
- Promote equitable treatment under different labor agreements;
- Ensure fiscal responsibility through transparent record-keeping and oversight.

These regulations remain a notable example of how federal governments can respond to industrial restructuring with a combination of **financial support, legal clarity, and accountability mechanisms**.
