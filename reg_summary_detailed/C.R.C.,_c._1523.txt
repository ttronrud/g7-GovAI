The regulation you provided—**repealed by SOR/2003-116, sections 6, 9, and 10**, and further revoked by **SOR/61-86**—was a set of detailed rules governing **dredging leases for mineral recovery in rivers within the Northwest Territories of Canada**. Although the regulation is now **officially repealed**, a comprehensive summary of its content and intent is still valuable for historical, legal, or regulatory reference.

The regulation begins with key definitions that establish the scope and meaning of core terms:

- **Mineral**:  
  Refers to any natural substance (e.g., gold, silver) that can be recovered from the **submerged bed of a river** via **dredging**.  
  ❌ **Exclusions**: Peat, bitumen, oil shales, clay, sand, and gravel are **not** considered minerals under this regulation.

- **Minister**:  
  The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** (now part of the broader Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada).

- **Recorder**:  
  A person appointed by the Minister to determine the **width of rivers** for lease purposes, particularly when assessing the boundaries of dredging applications.  
  ➤ The **recorder’s decision on river width is final**.

- **River**:  
  A stream of water with a **bed width of at least 150 feet** throughout the section sought for leasing.

- **River Bed**:  
  Defined as the **bed and bars** of the river, extending down to the **foot of natural banks**.
