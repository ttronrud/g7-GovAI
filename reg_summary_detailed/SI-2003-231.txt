**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, constitutes a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities within the Canadian federal public service under the authority granted by paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Subject of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer involves the *Voluntary Sector Affairs Directorate* — a specific component or division within the Department of Canadian Heritage. This Directorate is responsible for policies, programs, and operations related to the voluntary sector, which includes non-profit organizations, community groups, charities, and other non-governmental entities operating in Canada.

2. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation explicitly transfers *control and supervision* of this Directorate from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the Department of Human Resources Development (HRD). This means that the new department will assume authority over the day-to-day management, strategic direction, staffing, budgeting, and operational oversight of the Voluntary Sector Affairs Directorate.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. All administrative, policy, and operational functions related to the Directorate will be managed by the Department of Human Resources Development from that date onward.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under *paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision allows the federal government, through the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation), to reassign public service units between departments in order to improve efficiency, align with policy priorities, or better serve public needs.

5. **Purpose and Implications:**  
   - The move reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities, likely to better integrate voluntary sector policy with broader human resources, employment, and social development initiatives.  
   - The Department of Human Resources Development, historically focused on workforce development, employment programs, and public service management, may now incorporate the voluntary sector into its broader mandate for supporting community-based organizations and workforce engagement.  
   - The transfer does not affect the functions or programs of the Directorate itself, only the department responsible for overseeing it. The substantive work (e.g., policy development, funding support, advocacy for non-profits) continues, but under new administrative leadership.

6. **No Change to Functions or Staff:**  
   While the controlling department changes, the actual functions, staff, and programs of the Voluntary Sector Affairs Directorate remain unchanged in scope and delivery. The transfer is administrative and structural, not a reorganization of services or a reduction in support.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. It shifts the oversight of the Voluntary Sector Affairs Directorate from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the Department of Human Resources Development, effective December 12, 2003. The move is grounded in statutory authority and aimed at aligning public service responsibilities with broader government priorities related to human resources, employment, and community development. The transfer ensures continuity of services while placing the Directorate within a department better equipped to support the voluntary sector through workforce and employment-related lenses.
