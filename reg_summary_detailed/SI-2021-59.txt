**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Unauthorized Reimbursements Made Under the Public Service Health Care Plan Remission Order"**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**, as amended by **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**. It was promulgated by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Treasury Board** and the **President of the Treasury Board**.

The purpose of this Order is to address **unreasonable and unjust reimbursement practices** related to the **Public Service Health Care Plan (Plan)**. Specifically, it provides for a **remission (i.e., cancellation or refund)** of certain unauthorized reimbursements that were made to specific individuals who were enrolled in the Plan under circumstances that rendered their enrollment invalid or unjust.

### **Key Definitions and Key Components**

#### **1. What is the "Plan"?**
- The **Public Service Health Care Plan (Plan)** is a government-sponsored health care benefit program designed to provide medical expense coverage to certain employees and their dependants of the federal public service.
- The Plan operates under a set of directives that define what constitutes an "eligible expense" and how reimbursements are calculated.

#### **2. What is "Remission"?**
- **Remission** means the **cancellation or refund** of amounts that were previously reimbursed to a person under the Plan.
- The remission amount is calculated as follows:
  > **Reimbursement received for eligible expenses**  
  > − **Amounts paid by the person as contributions** under the Plan during the relevant period  
  > = **Net remission amount to be granted**

Thus, the remission is the **net amount of unauthorized or unjust reimbursement** that the individual has received, after accounting for their own contributions.

### **Who is Eligible for Remission?**

A person is eligible for remission **only if** they meet **both** of the following conditions:

#### **Condition A: Enrollment in Error**
- The person was **enrolled in the Plan in error** — meaning they were not eligible to join the Plan at the time of enrollment.

#### **Condition B: Employment or Survivorship Link to Specific Entities**
The person must have had a connection to one of the following two organizations:
1. **Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation (FFMC)**  
   OR  
2. **Canadian Wheat Board (CWB)**

And, under the **Public Service Superannuation Act**, the person must meet **one of the following two scenarios**:

##### **Scenario 1: Immediate Annuity or Annual Allowance**
- The person is currently receiving:
  - An **immediate annuity**, or
  - An **annual allowance**,  
  **under the Public Service Superannuation Act**, **either because**:
  - They were employed by FFMC or CWB and are now receiving the benefit, or
  - They were receiving such a benefit **immediately before their death**.

> *Note:* This applies to individuals who were in receipt of these benefits due to their employment with FFMC or CWB, even if they were not eligible for the Health Care Plan.

##### **Scenario 2: Survivor’s Benefit**
- The person would have been eligible to be a **dependent** of a former employee of FFMC or CWB **if** that former employee had been eligible for membership in the Plan.
- The person is currently receiving a **survivor’s benefit** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> *Note:* This scenario applies to dependants of deceased employees who were eligible for the Plan — but only if the dependant would have qualified as a dependant had the employee been eligible.

### **Relevant Period for Calculation**

The period during which the remission applies is defined as:

> The period that begins on the **day the person was enrolled in error** in the Plan  
> and ends on the **earlier of**:
> - The day this Order is made (i.e., the date of enactment), or  
> - The day the person died.

This ensures that the remission applies only to the time during which the individual was enrolled in error and received reimbursements.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The Order addresses a **fundamental injustice** in the administration of the Public Service Health Care Plan:

- Individuals were **enrolled in error** — they were not eligible to join the Plan.
- As a result, they received **reimbursements for eligible health care expenses**.
- However, because their enrollment was invalid, these reimbursements were **unauthorized and unjust**.
- The remission ensures that these individuals are not left with a financial burden due to administrative errors.

The government recognizes that:
- These individuals were not entitled to the Plan benefits.
- Their financial situation may have been negatively impacted by the unauthorized reimbursements.
- A fair and equitable remedy is to **refund the net amount** of unauthorized reimbursements, after deducting contributions they actually paid.

---

### **Key Principles Underlying the Order**

1. **Unreasonableness and Unjustness**: The core justification for the Order is that the collection of certain reimbursements from these individuals is deemed **unreasonable and unjust**, particularly given their lack of eligibility.

2. **Equity and Fairness**: The Order corrects a historical administrative error by providing a remedy that is both fair and proportionate.

3. **Limited Scope**: The Order applies **only to individuals** who:
   - Were enrolled in error,
   - Had a direct link to FFMC or CWB (employment or dependant status),
   - Were receiving or would have received a superannuation benefit under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

4. **No Broad Application**: The Order does **not** apply to all public servants or to general health care plan participants. It is narrowly tailored to a specific class of individuals affected by an error in enrollment.

---

### **Practical Implications**

- **Refund Process**: The individual will receive a refund (remission) of the net amount of unauthorized reimbursements (reimbursements minus contributions).
- **No Further Contributions**: The individual will not be required to pay additional contributions to the Plan for the period covered.
- **Administrative Review**: The remission may be subject to administrative review or appeal, depending on the procedures established under the Financial Administration Act or the Plan’s internal rules.
- **Impact on Records**: The enrollment error will be corrected in the Plan’s records, and the individual will be removed from the Plan as a member.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **targeted and equitable remedy** to correct unjust and unreasonable reimbursements made to individuals who were enrolled in the Public Service Health Care Plan in error. It specifically applies to those with a connection to the **Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation** or the **Canadian Wheat Board**, who either:
- Are receiving an immediate annuity or annual allowance under the Public Service Superannuation Act, or
- Are receiving a survivor’s benefit as a dependant of a former employee of those entities.

By remitting the net amount of unauthorized reimbursements, the government ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability in the administration of public health care benefits. The Order reflects a commitment to correcting administrative mistakes that disproportionately affect vulnerable or historically marginalized groups.

**Note**: This Order is a **corrective measure**, not a new benefit. It does not expand coverage or eligibility under the Public Service Health Care Plan. It serves to **rectify past errors** and restore financial equity.
