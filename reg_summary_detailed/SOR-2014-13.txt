**Detailed Summary of the Corporations Returns Regulations (SOR/2014-13)**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The *Corporations Returns Regulations* are a set of administrative rules adopted under the authority of the **Corporations Returns Act (CRA)**, specifically **subsection 23(2)** and **paragraphs 23(1)(b), (c), and (f)** of the Act.

- On **August 25, 2012**, a draft version of these regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, giving interested parties a **reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the Minister of Industry.
- The 90-day public comment period expired, and as required by law, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, formally **enacted the regulations** on **February 12, 2014** (as evidenced by the registration date in SOR/2014-13).
- The regulations come into force on the day they are registered.

---

### **2. Definitions and Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Definition of "Act"**
- The term **"Act"** refers to the *Corporations Returns Act* (R.S., c. C-43; S.C. 1998, c. 26, s. 63).

---

### **3. Determination of Gross Revenue (Subparagraph 3(1)(a)(i))**

- For a corporation reporting its financial information in Canada, **gross revenue** for a reporting period is defined as:
  > The sum of all amounts **received or receivable** in that period from its business activities in Canada.
- **Exclusion**: Amounts received or receivable **as or on account of capital** (e.g., dividends, interest, or proceeds from the sale of assets not related to operations) are **not included** in gross revenue.
- **Methodology**: The calculation must reflect the **method normally used by the corporation to compute its profits** — i.e., it should align with the corporation’s standard accounting practices.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that gross revenue reflects only operational income generated from business activities, not capital inflows.

---

### **4. Determination of Assets (Subparagraph 3(1)(a)(ii))**

The value of a corporation’s **assets** as of the last day of a reporting period is determined differently depending on the corporation’s residency:

#### **(i) For a corporation resident in Canada:**
- Assets are determined by summing the values of all assets included in the corporation’s **balance sheet prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)** as of the reporting period’s end.

#### **(ii) For any other corporation (non-resident):**
- Assets are determined by summing the values of those assets that:
  1. Were included in the balance sheet prepared under GAAP as of the last day of the reporting period; **and**
  2. Were **situated in Canada** on the last day of the reporting period; **and**
  3. Were **used primarily in the business carried on by the corporation in Canada** during the reporting period.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that only assets physically located in Canada and actively used in Canadian business operations are counted, preventing double-counting or inclusion of foreign or idle assets.

---

### **5. Prescribed Greater Amounts (Thresholds)**

These thresholds are used in determining when certain reporting or exemption rules apply.

| Provision | Prescribed Greater Amount |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Subparagraph 3(1)(a)(i)** – Gross Revenue | **$200 million** |
| **Subparagraph 3(1)(a)(ii)** – Assets (for non-residents) | **$600 million** |
| **Paragraph 3(1)(b)** – Threshold for exemption from reporting | **$1 million** |

> **Interpretation**: These amounts act as **thresholds** for triggering specific reporting obligations or exemptions. For example, if a corporation’s gross revenue or asset value exceeds these thresholds, it may be subject to more stringent reporting requirements or specific disclosure rules.

---

### **6. Exemptions from Section 5 of the Act**

A corporation is **exempt from the requirements of Section 5** (which likely involves certain reporting obligations such as disclosure of related parties or financial information) if it meets **either of the following conditions**:

1. **Filing a Quarterly Survey of Financial Statements** under the *Statistics Act* — meaning it has submitted financial data to Statistics Canada on a quarterly basis.
2. **Filing a T2 Corporation Income Tax Return** under the *Income Tax Act*, including **Schedule 9 (Related and Associated Corporations)**, using the **General Index of Financial Information (GIFI) codes**.

> **Purpose**: Reduces administrative burden on corporations that already provide comprehensive financial disclosures to other government bodies (e.g., tax authorities or statistical agencies), ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

---

### **7. Form and Content of Required Returns**

#### **(a) Return under subsection 4(1) of the Act**
- Must be in the form specified in **Schedule 1**.
- Must include all information required in that form.

> **Purpose**: Standardizes the format of the primary corporate return, ensuring clarity, consistency, and ease of processing.

#### **(b) Return under subsection 5(1) or (2) of the Act**
- Must be in the form specified in **Schedule 2**.
- Must include all required information in that form.

> **Purpose**: Provides a separate, more detailed return for specific reporting scenarios (e.g., related party disclosures, asset breakdowns), with a structured format to ensure completeness.

---

### **8. Fee for Inspection of Return Information (Section 16)**

A fee applies when a person applies to inspect information contained in a corporation’s return under **Section 16** of the Act.

The fee structure is tiered based on the number of corporations involved:

| Number of Corporations | Fee |
|------------------------|-----|
| 10 or fewer | $1 per corporation |
| 11 to 20 | $10 + $0.50 for each corporation over 10 |
| More than 20 | $15 + $0.10 for each corporation over 20 |

> **Purpose**: Encourages responsible access to return data while preventing abuse of inspection rights by imposing a cost proportional to the volume of data accessed.

---

### **9. Repeal Clause**

- The regulations contain a **repeal clause** indicating that any prior versions or conflicting regulations are superseded by this version.
- This ensures legal clarity and avoids ambiguity in the current regulatory framework.

---

### **10. Effective Date and Access to Forms**

- The regulations **come into force on the day of registration** (February 12, 2014).
- The **forms** (Schedule 1 and Schedule 2) are published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, under **SOR/2014-13**:
  - **Schedule 1** (Primary Return): [Page 95](http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2014/2014-02-12/pdf/g2-14804.pdf#page=95)
  - **Schedule 2** (Secondary Return): [Page 115](http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2014/2014-02-12/pdf/g2-14804.pdf#page=115)

> **Purpose**: Provides transparency and accessibility for corporations, regulators, and the public.
