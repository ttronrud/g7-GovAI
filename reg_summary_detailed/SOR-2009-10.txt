**Detailed Summary of the Allocation Method Order (2009) – Softwood Lumber Products**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, known as the *Allocation Method Order (2009) – Softwood Lumber Products*, was issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** on **December 22, 2008**, under **paragraph 6.3(3)(a)a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**. It establishes a formal, transparent method for allocating the monthly export quotas of **current softwood lumber products** from **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan** to the United States during the year 2009.

The purpose of this Order is to ensure fair and equitable distribution of export capacity based on historical production and export performance, while also providing flexibility through performance-based and volume-based allocation formulas. It operates within the framework of the **Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006**, which imposes export charges and regulates the export of softwood lumber products to manage market competition and protect domestic producers.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA) |
| **Current softwood lumber products** | Products listed in **item 5104, Group 5** of the Export Control List (e.g., sawn lumber, plywood, veneer). |
| **Former softwood lumber products** | Products listed in **item 5105, Group 5** of the Export Control List as it existed between **November 1, 2005 – October 11, 2006** (specifically relevant for Quebec). |
| **Exported** | As defined in **section 6.4 of the EIPA** — refers to shipments under export permits. |
| **Primary producer** | A person who produces current softwood lumber from softwood sawlogs. In Quebec, includes those who produced former softwood lumber. |
| **Primary producer’s products** | Current softwood lumber produced directly by a primary producer, not remanufactured in Canada. In Quebec, includes former softwood lumber. |
| **Remanufacturer** | A person who remanufactures current softwood lumber products (as defined under subsection 13(1) of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006). In Quebec, includes those who remanufactured former products. |
| **Remanufacturer’s products** | Current softwood lumber that were remanufactured by a remanufacturer and not further processed in Canada. |
| **Manitoba quantity / Ontario quantity / Quebec quantity / Saskatchewan quantity** | The monthly export quota allowed under subsection 6.3(2) of the EIPA for each province. |
| **Reference period** | - **Ontario & Manitoba & Saskatchewan**: November 1, 2007 – October 31, 2008<br> - **Quebec**: November 1, 2005 – October 31, 2008 |

> Note: The reference period for Quebec is earlier due to the special status of its former softwood lumber products and transitional arrangements.

## **Core Principles and Allocation Methodology**

The Order establishes a **two-tiered allocation system** for each province, combining **historical export performance** and **historical production volume** to determine fair share of export quotas.

---

### **1. Ontario Allocation Method**

The allocation of the **Ontario quantity** is determined using **two formulas**, with the higher percentage being used:

#### Formula A (Performance-Based – Export Volume)
> Percentage share = (Volume exported from Ontario / Total volume exported from Ontario by all producers) × 100%

#### Formula B (Legacy-Based – 2008 Share)
> Percentage share = The primary producer’s or remanufacturer’s share from the **2008 allocation year**

#### Allocation Decision:
- If **Formula A > Formula B** → Allocation is based on Formula A.
  - Allocation = (Ontario quantity × Formula A share) / (Sum of all Formula A shares)
- If **Formula B > Formula A** → Allocation is based on Formula B.
  - Allocation = (Ontario quantity × Formula B share)

> This ensures that producers with stronger recent export performance receive a larger share, while those with stable or declining exports maintain a baseline allocation.

---

### **2. Quebec Allocation Method**

Quebec has a **dual-track allocation system** depending on the producer’s export history:

#### A. For Primary Producers:
- **Option 1 (Based on Export Volume)**  
  If the producer exported products from Quebec during the reference period, they can choose between:
  - Allocation based on **historic export volume** (formula in **Section 7**)
  - Allocation based on **historic production volume** (formula in **Section 8**)

- **Option 2 (Based on Production Volume Only)**  
  If **no exports** occurred from Quebec during the reference period, and the producer produced Quebec softwood lumber between **Jan 1, 2005 – Dec 31, 2007**, they **may only** receive an allocation based on **production volume** (Section 8).

> **Cap on allocation**: No more than **40%** of the primary producer’s average monthly production volume (2005–2007) can be allocated.

> **Data source**: Volume of Quebec softwood lumber produced is based on records provided by the **Government of Quebec** with the producer’s consent.

#### B. For Remanufacturers:
- If a remanufacturer exported products from Quebec during the reference period, they **must** receive an allocation based on **historic export volume** (Section 11).
- Formula:
  > Allocation = (Quebec quantity × Export volume / Total export volume by all producers)  
  (No cap or production-based option available)

---

### **3. Reserve Pool and Residual Allocation**

To ensure that no export volume is lost due to allocation imbalances, the Order establishes a **reserve pool** for Quebec.

#### Reserve Pool Calculation:
> Reserve Pool = Quebec quantity − (Total exports from primary producers) − (Total exports from remanufacturers)

> This pool is the unallocated portion of the Quebec quantity.

#### Residual Non-Allocated Quantity:
> Residual = Reserve Pool − (Total volume allocated to primary producers under Section 8)

> This residual amount is distributed **in order of application receipt**, with each applicant receiving the amount they requested until the pool is exhausted.

> This ensures **fairness and predictability** in the distribution of leftover capacity.

### **4. Manitoba Allocation Method**

Similar to Ontario, Manitoba uses two formulas to determine the percentage share:

#### Formula A (Performance-Based – Export Volume)
> Percentage = (Volume exported from Manitoba / Total volume exported from Manitoba by all producers)

#### Formula B (Legacy-Based – 2008 Share)

#### Allocation Decision:
- If **Formula A > Formula B** → Allocation = (Manitoba quantity × Formula A share) / (Sum of all Formula A shares)
- If **Formula B > Formula A** → Allocation = (Manitoba quantity × Formula B share)

> This ensures that producers with higher export activity in the reference period get a larger share, while maintaining a floor based on prior year performance.

---

### **5. Saskatchewan Allocation Method**

Saskatchewan uses a **simple performance-based formula**:

#### Allocation Formula:
> Allocation = (Saskatchewan quantity × Volume exported from Saskatchewan during reference period) / (Total potential volume that could have been exported from Saskatchewan during reference period)

> The total potential volume is the **maximum possible** volume that could have been exported based on production capacity.

#### Residual Allocation:
- Any remaining Saskatchewan quantity (after all applicants are allocated based on export history) is distributed **in order of receipt of applications**.
- Each applicant receives the amount they requested until the quota is fully allocated.

> This method prioritizes **actual export performance** and ensures **no over-allocation**.

## **Key Provisions and Rationale**

| Feature | Rationale |
|--------|----------|
| **Two-tiered allocation (export vs. production)** | Balances market performance with long-term production capacity, especially in Quebec where legacy products were phased out. |
| **Reference period differences** | Quebec’s earlier reference period reflects its unique transitional status under the 2005–2006 softwood lumber policy shift. |
| **Reserve pool** | Acts as a buffer to prevent over-allocation and ensures equitable access to remaining export capacity. |
| **Transfers with Minister’s consent** | Allows for reallocation of unused export quotas between producers, with clear rules: the transferred volume is **deemed exported** by the original producer, not the transferee. |
| **No over-allocation cap** | Producers cannot exceed their historical average (in Quebec), promoting sustainability. |

## **Application and Enforcement**

- **Eligibility**: Only **primary producers** and **remanufacturers** who meet the definition and have records of production or export activity are eligible.
- **Application process**: Producers must submit applications for export allocations, and allocations are processed in **order of receipt** for residual volumes.
- **Data requirements**: Producers must provide accurate records of production and export volumes. For Quebec, data must be provided by the Government of Quebec with consent.
- **Effective date**: The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (typically within days of issuance).
