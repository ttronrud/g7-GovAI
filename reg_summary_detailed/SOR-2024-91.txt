**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Extremist Settler Violence) Regulations**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context**

The **Special Economic Measures (Extremist Settler Violence) Regulations** are a set of Canadian economic sanctions enacted under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**. These regulations target individuals and entities linked to **Israeli extremist settlers** who are engaged in or supporting acts of violence against Palestinian civilians in the **occupied Palestinian territories**.

The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) determines that such activities constitute a **grave breach of international peace and security**, posing a **serious international crisis**. As such, Canada imposes targeted economic restrictions to pressure those responsible for or enabling settler violence.

This measure reflects Canada’s foreign policy stance on human rights, international law, and the protection of civilians in conflict zones, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

### **2. Legal Basis**

The regulations are authorized under specific provisions of the *Special Economic Measures Act*:

- **Paragraph 4(1)(a)a**: Powers to designate individuals or entities involved in undermining peace and security.
- **Subsection 4(1.1)b**: Allows designation of persons involved in facilitating violence.
- **Subsection 4(2)c**: Provides for prohibitions on dealing with designated persons.
- **Subsection 4(3)**: Enables the imposition of sanctions on associated persons and entities.

These provisions are supported by earlier legislative frameworks:
- S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(1): Expansion of SEMA powers.
- S.C. 2017, c. 21, s. 17(2): General authority for economic sanctions.
- S.C. 2023, c. 26, ss. 254(2) to (4): Clarification of scope and application of sanctions.
- S.C. 1992, c. 17: Original SEMA framework.

### **3. Definition of a "Listed Person"**

A person is considered a "listed person" if the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is satisfied that there are **reasonable grounds to believe** they:

#### (a) Have engaged in activities that:
- Undermine the peace and security of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories;
- Directly or indirectly **facilitate, support, provide funding for, or contribute to** the use — or threatened or attempted use — of **violence by Israeli extremist settlers** against Palestinian civilians or their property.

#### (b) Are an **associate** of someone described in (a).

#### (c) Are a **family member** of someone described in (a) or (b).

#### (d) Own, hold, or control (directly or indirectly) an entity that is described in (a) to (c).

### **7. Reporting Obligations (Section 7)**

All persons in Canada and Canadians outside Canada, **including the entities listed in Section 6**, must:

- **Disclose without delay** to either:
  - The **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, or
  - The **Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**

the existence of property in their possession or control that they **reasonably believe** is owned or controlled by a listed person.

Additionally, they must report:
- Any transaction or **proposed transaction** involving such property.

> This reporting requirement enhances transparency and enables timely enforcement.

---

### **8. Immunity from Legal Action (Section 7)**

No civil or criminal proceedings can be brought against a person who makes a **good-faith disclosure** under Section 7.

> This protects individuals and institutions from liability for reporting suspected violations, encouraging compliance.

---

### **9. Review and Removal Process (Section 8)**

A listed person may apply in writing to the Minister of Foreign Affairs to have their name **removed from the schedule**.

- The Minister must assess whether there are **reasonable grounds** to recommend removal to the Governor in Council.
- If there has been a **material change in circumstances** since the last application, the person may submit a **new application**.

> This provides a mechanism for accountability and potential review, though removal is not automatic.

---

### **10. Name Dispute Process (Section 9)**

If someone whose name is **similar or identical** to a listed person claims they are not that individual, they may apply to the Minister for a **certificate confirming they are not the listed person**.

- The Minister must respond within **30 days**:
  - If it is established that the applicant is not the listed person → issue the certificate.
  - If not → provide notice of the determination.

> This prevents misuse of names and protects individuals from being wrongly targeted.

---

### **11. Applicability and Effective Date**

- **Applicability**: The regulations apply **immediately upon registration**, even before publication in the *Canada Gazette* (per paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act).
- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the day they are **registered**.
