**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of Carmine Shiner (Notropis percobromus) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is the primary Canadian federal law designed to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery. The legislation is codified in *S.C. 2002, c. 29*.

- The **Carmine Shiner** (*Notropis percobromus*) is a freshwater fish species classified as **threatened** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to SARA. This designation means the species is at risk of becoming extinct in the wild and requires protection and recovery efforts.

- A **recovery strategy** for the Carmine Shiner was developed and formally included in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track the status and management of at-risk species. This strategy identifies the specific environmental conditions necessary for the survival and recovery of the species.

**2. Critical Habitat Designation**

- The **critical habitat** of the Carmine Shiner refers to the specific areas that are essential for the species’ survival and recovery. These areas are defined by the recovery strategy and include the physical and biological features required for the fish to live, grow, reproduce, and maintain viable populations.

- This Order formally **designates and recognizes** the critical habitat for the Carmine Shiner based on the recovery strategy. The exact geographic boundaries and features of the critical habitat are specified in the **annexed Order**, which is attached to this regulation.

---

**3. Legal Basis for the Order**

The regulation is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Section 58(4)** empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate critical habitat for a listed species.
- **Section 58(5)** requires that such designation be based on the recovery strategy and must be consistent with the species’ known needs.

Additionally, the Order is grounded in **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, which applies to the critical habitat of listed species. This means that once designated, the critical habitat is legally protected under the Act, and any actions that could adversely affect it must be assessed and approved.

**4. Key Exclusion Clause**

- The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision is significant because:

  - Section 58(2)b of SARA generally excludes areas that are **not in a "designated area"** or are **not subject to a specific management plan** or **are not within a jurisdiction that has legal responsibility** for the protection of the species.

  - By confirming that the critical habitat is **not located in a place excluded under subsection 58(2)b**, the Order ensures that the designated areas are fully within the scope of federal jurisdiction and are subject to protection under SARA.

---

**5. Jurisdiction and Enforcement**

- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** is the responsible federal minister for issuing this Order, as the Carmine Shiner is a species found in freshwater ecosystems, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO).

- The designation of critical habitat triggers legal obligations under SARA, including:
  - **Prohibiting or restricting activities** that could destroy or significantly degrade the habitat.
  - **Requiring environmental assessments** for any proposed projects that may impact the critical habitat.
  - **Coordinating with provincial and territorial governments** to ensure consistent protection and management.

---

**6. Effective Date and Registration**

- This Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government. Registration typically occurs in the official Gazette (e.g., the Canada Gazette), and the effective date is generally the date of publication.

- The Order is not retroactive; it only applies to future activities and decisions that may impact the designated critical habitat.

---

**7. Purpose and Significance**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to:
  - **Formally recognize and protect** the essential environmental conditions required by the Carmine Shiner for its survival.
  - Provide a **legal basis for recovery planning** and conservation efforts.
  - Ensure that **proposed development, land use, or environmental projects** are evaluated for their potential impact on the species’ habitat.

- This designation supports the broader goals of SARA, including the prevention of extinction, the promotion of species recovery, and the maintenance of biodiversity in Canada’s aquatic ecosystems.

---

**Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the **Carmine Shiner (*Notropis percobromus*)** under the *Species at Risk Act*, based on the species’ recovery strategy and in accordance with legal requirements. It ensures that the specific areas essential for the survival of this threatened fish are legally protected from harmful activities. The Order is significant because it reflects both scientific understanding of the species’ needs and the government’s commitment to biodiversity conservation. It also confirms that the designated habitat is not excluded under SARA’s procedural provisions, thereby strengthening its legal enforceability.
