**Detailed Summary of the *Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam Marine Protected Areas Regulations* (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam Marine Protected Areas Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pursuant to **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. These regulations establish and define two specific marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Beaufort Sea, located within the Arctic region of Canada. The designation is rooted in the **Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA)**, a landmark treaty between the Government of Canada and the Inuvialuit people, recognizing their rights and interests in their traditional territories.

These regulations are designed to **protect marine ecosystems**, **respect Indigenous rights**, and **balance environmental conservation with essential human activities** such as fishing, navigation, and scientific research.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Agreement**:  
   Refers to the *Inuvialuit Final Agreement*, which was approved, given effect, and declared valid under the *Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act*. This agreement recognizes the Inuvialuit’s rights to self-governance, land, and resources, including access to traditional fishing grounds.

2. **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**:  
   Designated areas of the sea that are legally protected under these regulations. They include both the water column and the seabed, extending to a depth of five meters below the low-water line.

## **Designated Marine Protected Areas**

Two distinct zones are formally designated as the **Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam Marine Protected Areas**:

1. **Zone 1 – Darnley Bay and Amundsen Gulf**  
   - Located in the Beaufort Sea.  
   - Defined by the boundaries described in **Plan No. FB40812**, certified on **February 10, 2015**, and depicted in **Plan No. CLSR 104411**.  
   - These plans are officially deposited in the *Canada Lands Surveys Records*.

2. **Zone 2 – Kendall Inlet, Amundsen Gulf**  
   - Also located in the Beaufort Sea.  
   - Same boundary description as Zone 1, using the same plans (FB40812 and CLSR 104411).  
   - The exact geographic boundaries are derived from the same survey documentation.

> A full copy of Plan No. FB40812 is included in **Schedule 1** of the regulations.

## **Scope of Protection**

Each Marine Protected Area includes:
- The **seabed**
- The **subsoil to a depth of five meters**
- The **entire water column**, including **sea ice**

This comprehensive definition ensures that protection extends from the ocean floor up through the water column, including seasonal sea ice, which is ecologically significant for marine life.

---

## **Prohibited Activities**

It is **prohibited** to carry out any activity that:
- Disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes any **living marine organism**  
- Or any **part of its habitat**  
- Or is **likely to do so**

This prohibition is intended to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem integrity within the MPAs.

---

## **Permitted Activities (Despite Section 3 of the Oceans Act)**

Section 3 of the Oceans Act typically restricts certain activities in marine areas. However, these regulations **explicitly allow** specific activities in the MPAs **if certain conditions are met**:

### 1. **Fishing Activities**
- Fishing **in accordance with the Inuvialuit Final Agreement**  
- Fishing under **subsection 22(1) of the Northwest Territories Fishery Regulations**  
- Fishing for **subsistence use** under **subsection 22.1(1)** of the same regulations  
- Fishing under a **domestic fishing licence** issued under **section 23** of the Northwest Territories Fishery Regulations  
- **Sport fishing** under **subsection 27(1)** of the Northwest Territories Fishery Regulations  

> *Note*: These fishing activities are allowed **only if no fishing gear listed in Schedule 2** is used. This restriction protects sensitive habitats from damage caused by industrial or non-traditional fishing gear.

### 2. **Navigation**
- Permitted if conducted in accordance with:
  - The *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*  
  - The *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act*  
- Ensures safe and environmentally responsible maritime movement.

### 3. **Dredging**
- Allowed **only if**:
  - Dredging is required to enable **navigation for supplying goods to the community of Paulatuk, Northwest Territories**  
  - A **recommendation has been made under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement**  
  - The dredging has been **authorized by a competent government authority**

> This provision recognizes the **critical need for supply access** to remote Inuvialuit communities while ensuring that such activities are justified and regulated.

### 4. **Public Safety, National Defence, National Security, Law Enforcement, or Emergency Response**
- Any activity for these purposes is permitted, as it serves essential societal functions.

### 5. **Scientific Research, Educational, and Commercial Marine Tourism Activities**
- Permitted **only if**:
  - The activity is part of an **approved activity plan**
  - The plan has been **reviewed and approved by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**

> These activities are not automatically allowed — they must go through a formal review process to ensure environmental protection and compatibility with existing uses.

## **Activity Plan Requirements (for Scientific, Educational, and Tourism Activities)**

Any individual or organization proposing to conduct a scientific research, educational, or commercial marine tourism activity **must submit a detailed activity plan** to the Minister. The plan must include the following elements:

1. **Contact Information**  
   - Name, address, phone, fax, and email of the applicant (and responsible individual if an institution)

2. **Vessel Details**  
   - Name, state of registration, registration number, radio call sign  
   - Owner, master, and operator details

3. **Timeline**  
   - Proposed first entry and final exit dates  
   - Alternative dates (in case of delays)

4. **Geographic Location**  
   - Geographic coordinates of the activity site  
   - A map showing the location within the MPA boundaries

5. **Substances to be Deposited**  
   - List of any substances (other than those authorized under the *Canada Shipping Act*)  
   - Quantity and concentration

6. **Purpose and Description**  
   - Detailed description of the proposed activity and its purpose

7. **Expected Outcomes**  
   - Description of anticipated study, report, or output

---

## **Minister’s Approval Criteria**

The Minister **must approve** an activity plan **only if**:

### For Scientific Research or Monitoring:
- The activity is **not likely to destroy** marine organism habitats  
- It will **not interfere with fishing** under the Agreement  
- It will serve one or more of the following purposes:
  - Increase knowledge of biodiversity, habitat, or ecosystem function  
  - Assist in managing the MPA  
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures

### For Educational or Commercial Marine Tourism:
- Will **not result in damage, destruction, or removal** of habitat  
- Will **increase public awareness** of the MPAs  
- Will **not interfere with fishing** under the Agreement

---

## **Exclusions from Approval**

The Minister **must not approve** an activity plan if:

1. Any substance proposed for deposition is a **"deleterious substance"** (as defined in subsection 34(1) of the *Fisheries Act*) — **unless** the deposit is specifically authorized under subsection 36(4) of that Act.

2. The **cumulative environmental effects** of the proposed activity — **combined with past and current activities** — are likely to:
   - Adversely affect biological, chemical, or oceanographic processes  
   - Harm biodiversity, habitat, or ecosystem function in the MPA

> This cumulative impact assessment ensures that even small activities are evaluated in the broader context of ongoing human use.

---

## **Timeline for Ministerial Decisions**

- The Minister must make a decision on an activity plan within:
  - **60 days** of receiving the original plan  
  - **60 days** after receiving an amended plan

> This establishes a clear and reasonable timeframe for review, promoting transparency and predictability.

---

## **Reporting Requirements (Post-Activity)**

If an activity plan is approved, the applicant must:

1. Provide the Minister with:
   - A **copy of any study, report, or work** resulting from the activity  
   - The **data obtained** during the activity  
   - Both must be submitted **within 90 days** of completion

2. **If the study is not completed within 3 years** of the end of the activity:
   - The applicant must submit the **data collected** within 90 days of the 3-year deadline

> This ensures long-term environmental monitoring and knowledge sharing, supporting adaptive management and scientific integrity.
