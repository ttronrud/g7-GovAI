**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Order under the *Territorial Lands Act* (Canada), made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific lands from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of commercial development) in order to **facilitate the settlement of land claims by the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area**. This action supports the implementation of the land claims agreement between the Inuit of Nunavut and the Government of Canada, ensuring that land is reserved for Inuit use, self-governance, and community development.

---

**Legal Authority:**  
The order is issued under **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to withdraw lands from disposal for specific purposes, including the settlement of Indigenous land claims.

---

**Scope of Withdrawal:**  
The following lands are withdrawn from disposal:

- All **mineral rights** (solid, liquid, or gaseous), including:
  - Mines and minerals
  - Construction materials (such as sand, gravel, or stone) that may be disposed of under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations*

> **Important Note:**  
> This withdrawal **excludes timber rights**, which remain subject to the *Forest Management Act (Northwest Territories)* and can still be disposed of under that legislation.

---

**Duration of Withdrawal:**  
The withdrawal is effective for a period ending on **May 31, 1995**, **or** on the date when the legislation ratifying the land claims agreement between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and Her Majesty in Right of Canada comes into force — **whichever occurs earlier**.

> This provision ensures that the withdrawal remains in place until either a fixed date (May 31, 1995) or until the formal legal ratification of the land claims agreement takes effect, whichever comes first. This allows flexibility in the legislative timeline of the land claims settlement process.

---

**Exclusions (Protected Interests):**  
Despite the withdrawal of the lands from general disposal, the following **existing rights, interests, and entitlements** are **not affected** and remain intact, including any renewals, extensions, replacements, or transfers:

1. **Located or recorded mineral claims or prospecting permits** in good standing under the *Canada Mining Regulations*  
   → These permits are preserved and continue to be valid.

2. **Right to obtain a surface lease** on located or recorded mineral claims, under the *Territorial Lands Regulations*  
   → Surface leasing rights remain available to qualified parties.

3. **Rights in good standing** created under:
   - Section 8 of the *Territorial Lands Act*
   - *Territorial Lands Regulations*  
   → These rights are protected and not extinguished.

4. **Permits, special renewal permits, and leases** in good standing under:
   - *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*  
   → These remain valid and enforceable.

5. **Permits in good standing** under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations*  
   → Existing quarrying rights are preserved.

6. **Existing rights and interests** granted under:
   - *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*  
   → These rights are maintained.

7. **Existing rights issued** under:
   - *Territorial Coal Regulations*
   - *Territorial Dredging Regulations*  
   → These are protected and not affected by the withdrawal.

8. **Interests in lands described in “Exhibit 2” to the Acquisition Agreement dated May 5, 1988**  
   → This agreement involves Her Majesty in Right of Canada, the Northern Canada Power Commission, the Government of the Northwest Territories, and the Northwest Territories Power Corporation. The specific interests in those lands are preserved.

**Specific Geographic Reference:**  
The regulation also explicitly references a **specific parcel of land** located at **Fry Inlet on Contwoyto Lake** in the Northwest Territories. These parcels are identified as:

- **01/76E** and **02/76E**  
- As shown on the **National Topographic Series Map 76E**, labeled:  
  *"Lands Identified for Final Withdrawal According to the Agreement of July 31, 1991 Between Tungavik Federation of Nunavut and Canada"*

> This map is held at the **Office of the Regional Manager, Lands Resources Division, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**, and serves as official documentation of the withdrawal.

---

**Key Implications and Context:**

- This regulation is a **critical step in the land claims process** for Inuit in the Nunavut Settlement Area. It ensures that lands essential to Inuit self-determination, cultural heritage, and economic development are not opened up to commercial exploitation during the settlement period.

- The withdrawal is **not a permanent ban** on all land use — it only removes the land from disposal (i.e., from being sold or leased to private or corporate entities), while preserving existing rights and legal instruments.

- The **temporary nature** of the withdrawal (until May 31, 1995 or ratification of the land claims agreement) allows for legal and political transition, ensuring that the final land claims settlement can be implemented without interference from commercial development.

- The **exclusion of certain rights** (e.g., mineral claims, surface leases, and specific permits) ensures that legitimate, ongoing operations and investments are not disrupted.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a **strategic and legally grounded measure** to support the implementation of Inuit land claims in the Nunavut Settlement Area. By withdrawing specific mineral and construction material lands from disposal, the government ensures that land is reserved for Inuit communities, while maintaining the integrity of existing rights and interests. It is a foundational component of the broader land claims agreement between the Inuit and the federal government, reflecting a commitment to Indigenous rights, self-governance, and equitable land use.

**Note:**  
This regulation predates the official creation of Nunavut (which occurred in 1999). It reflects the transitional period during which land claims were being settled in the Northwest Territories, with the ultimate goal of establishing Nunavut as a distinct territory with Inuit self-government.
