### **Detailed Summary of the Thompson Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Thompson Airport Zoning Regulations**, published under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act*, establish specific spatial and environmental controls around Thompson Airport in Manitoba, Canada. These regulations were developed to ensure aviation safety by limiting obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases. Below is a comprehensive, structured summary of the regulation, broken down into key components for clarity and understanding.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations are made under **Section 5.4** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports.
- **Proposal Publication**: A proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in two issues of *Canada Gazette, Part I* (August 26 and September 2, 1989), and in two issues of *The Thompson Citizen* (October 4 and 6, 1989). This provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment and representation** to interested parties.
- **Final Adoption**: Based on the public consultation and recommendations, the regulations were officially enacted by the Governor in Council on the date of publication.

> **Regulation Citation**: *R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.)*  
> **Title**: *Thompson Airport Zoning Regulations*

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Thompson Airport, located in the vicinity of Thompson, Manitoba. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a reference for measuring distances and elevations. Defined in Part I of the Schedule. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for takeoff/landing approaches). Designed to ensure unobstructed visibility for pilots during approach. Described in Part II. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the Minister of Transport, responsible for administering and enforcing the regulations. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a fixed elevation above the ARP, designed to prevent obstructions in the broader area around the airport. Described in Part III. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area, including runways, used for aircraft movement in specific directions. Defined in Part IV. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane that connects the approach surfaces and strips to the outer surface, ensuring a smooth transition in elevation. Described in Part V. |

---

## **3. Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **214.5 meters above sea level**.
- All measurements and surface elevations are referenced to this point, ensuring consistency and accuracy in spatial planning.

---

## **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) that meet the following criteria:

1. **Within the outer limits** of the land described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.
2. **Directly under any portion of the approach surfaces** that extends beyond the outer limits.

> This ensures that both the immediate vicinity and the areas directly beneath the approach zones are subject to strict height controls.

---

## **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Obstructions)**

No person may **erect, construct, or add to** any building, structure, or object on regulated land if the **highest point** of that object exceeds:

- The **approach surfaces**,
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surfaces**.

### **Exception – Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) exceeds the height of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister may require** the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision ensures that even natural features do not pose a hazard to aircraft operations.

---

## **6. Prohibition on Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier of regulated land may **use the land for the disposal of waste** that:
  - Is **edible** by birds, or
  - Is **attractive to birds**.

> This rule is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation safety risk. The regulation aims to reduce the likelihood of birds gathering near the airport and being struck by aircraft during flight.

---

## **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces and Features**

### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- Located **perpendicularly 91.45 meters northwesterly** from a point on the centerline of **runway 05–23**.
- That point is **655.52 meters southwesterly** from the **threshold of runway 23**.
- Serves as the origin point for all spatial measurements.

---

### **B. Approach Surfaces (Runway Ends)**

Four approach surfaces are defined, corresponding to the four runway ends:

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Runway 05** | Inclined plane: 1:50 slope (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal) rises to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end, 2,400 m from the centerline. The horizontal line is 300 m above the end elevation. |
| **Runway 23** | Same as runway 05 (symmetrical). 1:50 slope, 15,000 m distance, 2,400 m from centerline, 300 m above end elevation. |
| **Runway 14** | 1:20 slope (1 m vertical per 20 m horizontal), rises to a horizontal line 2,500 m from end, 280 m from centerline. The horizontal line is 125 m above end elevation. |
| **Runway 32** | Same as runway 14. 1:20 slope, 2,500 m distance, 280 m from centerline, 125 m above end elevation. |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach, especially when visibility is limited or during low-visibility conditions.

---

### **C. Outer Surface**

- A **common plane** at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (214.5 m = 259.5 m above sea level)**.
- **Exception**: Where this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that in low-lying areas, the surface does not fall below ground level, preventing unrealistic or unsafe height restrictions.

> The outer surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object across a broader area around the airport.

---

### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**

Two main strips are defined:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **05–23** | 300 meters wide (150 m on each side of centerline) | 1,888 meters long |
| **14–32** | 60 meters wide (30 m on each side of centerline) | 822 meters long |

> These are the active areas where aircraft take off and land. The strips are central to the regulation's design, as they are directly exposed to flight paths.

---

### **E. Transitional Surfaces**

These connect the approach surfaces and strips to the outer surface:

| Runway | Slope | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **05–23** | 1:7 (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) | Rises at right angles to the strip centerline and extends outward from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces until it intersects the outer surface or another transitional surface. |
| **14–32** | 1:5 (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal) | Same structure, but with a steeper slope (1:5), reflecting the shorter strip and different operational requirements. |

> Transitional surfaces prevent abrupt changes in elevation and ensure a continuous, safe zone from the runway edge to the outer boundary.

---

## **8. Boundary of Regulated Area (Outer Limits)**

The boundary of the land subject to the regulations is defined in a precise, geometric manner:

> **Starting Point**: On the **northeasterly limit of Block F, Plan 4856, Neepawa Land Titles**, where it intersects a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the Airport Reference Point.

Then the boundary follows this path:

1. **Southeasterly** along the northeasterly limit of Block F to its **southeast corner**.
2. **Southwesterly** along the southeasterly limit of Block F to its **southwesterly corner**.
3. **Southwesterly** in a straight line to the **most northerly corner of Mystery Lake Road** (as shown on Plan 768).
4. **Southwesterly** along the **northwesterly limit of Mystery Lake Road** to its intersection with the **northeasterly limit of Plan 5164**.
5. **Northwesterly** along the northeasterly limit of Plan 5164 to the **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the ARP.
6. **
