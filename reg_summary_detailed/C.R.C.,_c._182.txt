**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Egg Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **Overview**
The *Ontario Egg Marketing Levies Order* is a regulatory instrument established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (the "Act"). It sets out specific financial obligations—known as "levies"—that egg producers and egg grading station operators must meet in relation to the marketing of eggs produced in Ontario. These levies are designed to support the orderly marketing of eggs, ensure fair distribution, and help fund marketing and promotion activities through the Ontario Egg Producers’ Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board").

This Order may be cited as the *Ontario Egg Marketing Levies Order*.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario. This is the enabling legislation that provides the legal framework for the regulation of farm product marketing, including eggs. |
| **Allotment** | The maximum number of dozens of eggs a producer is allowed to market—whether intraprovincial, interprovincial, or exported—based on the *Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Quota Regulations* and orders issued by the Commodity Board under the *Ontario Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan*. This represents a production quota tied to market supply and demand. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Ontario Egg Producers’ Marketing Board*, a body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of eggs in Ontario. It administers the marketing plan, collects levies, and ensures compliance with regulations. |
| **Eggs** | Eggs produced by domestic hens in Ontario. This excludes eggs from other provinces or countries. |
| **Plan** | The *Ontario Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan*, which is established and amended periodically under the Act. The Plan outlines the marketing strategy, quotas, and other operational guidelines for the egg industry in Ontario. Any regulations made under the Act to implement the Plan are also part of this framework. |
| **Producer** | Any individual or entity engaged in the production of eggs within the Province of Ontario. This includes farms, co-ops, or other producers involved in egg farming. |

### **Key Provisions and Obligations**

#### **1. Base Levy on All Eggs Sold**
- **Rate**: $0.05 per dozen of eggs sold.
- **Applicability**: Every producer must pay this levy **in addition to** any service charges specified in the *Plan*.
- **Purpose**: This levy applies to all eggs marketed by the producer, regardless of whether they exceed their allotment. It serves as a base funding mechanism for marketing and promotion activities.

#### **2. Excess Allotment Levy**
- **Rate**: $0.35 per dozen of eggs sold **in excess of the producer’s allotment**.
- **Applicability**: Only applies when a producer sells more eggs than their allocated "allotment."
- **Purpose**: This levy helps manage market supply and ensures that producers who exceed their quota contribute a higher share to marketing costs. It discourages overproduction and supports market stability.

> **Example**:  
> A producer has an allotment of 10,000 dozens and sells 12,000 dozens.  
> - Base levy: 12,000 × $0.05 = $600  
> - Excess levy: (12,000 – 10,000) × $0.35 = 2,000 × $0.35 = $700  
> - Total levy = $1,300

#### **3. Obligation of Egg Grading Station Operators**
- **Deduction Requirement**: Any operator of an egg grading station who purchases eggs from a producer **must deduct** the levies due under Section 3 (i.e., the base and excess levies) from the payment made to the producer.
- **Payment to Commodity Board**: The grading station operator must **pay the full amount of levies** to the Commodity Board **within 10 days** of the end of the week in which the eggs were purchased.
- **Payment Address**: All levies must be paid to the Commodity Board at its office located at **5799 Yonge Street, Willowdale, Ontario**.

> **Purpose**: This ensures that levies are collected efficiently and transparently through the distribution chain, reducing the burden on producers to collect and remit payments directly.

#### **4. Producer’s Final Payment Obligation**
- **When Levies Are Not Deducted**: If a producer sells eggs through a grading station where the levies were **not deducted** from the payment (e.g., if the station failed to deduct or remit them), the producer is responsible for paying the unpaid levies.
- **Deadline for Payment**: The producer must pay all such unpaid levies **not later than the 15th day of the month next following** the month in which the eggs were sold.
- **Payment Address**: Same as above — **5799 Yonge Street, Willowdale, Ontario**.

> **Purpose**: This provision ensures that producers remain accountable for all levies, even in cases where intermediaries (like grading stations) fail to properly collect or remit them.

### **Key Objectives and Rationale**

1. **Market Stability**: By limiting the amount of eggs that can be marketed (via allotments), the system prevents oversupply and price crashes.
2. **Revenue Generation**: The levies generate funds for the Commodity Board to finance marketing, promotion, and research initiatives that benefit the entire Ontario egg industry.
3. **Equity and Fairness**: The base levy applies uniformly, while the excess levy ensures that those who produce beyond their allocated quota contribute more to the system.
4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Clear rules for both producers and grading station operators ensure that all parties understand their responsibilities and timelines for payment.

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- The Commodity Board is responsible for monitoring compliance with the levy requirements.
- Failure to pay levies on time may result in penalties or enforcement actions, although specific penalties are not detailed in this Order.
- Producers and grading station operators are expected to maintain accurate records of egg sales and levy calculations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Egg Marketing Levies Order* establishes a structured, transparent, and equitable system for collecting marketing levies from egg producers in Ontario. It ensures that all producers—both within their quota and those exceeding it—contribute to the sustainability and promotion of the Ontario egg industry. By clearly defining the rates, responsibilities, and payment timelines for producers and grading station operators, the Order supports a stable, efficient, and market-responsive egg marketing system aligned with broader agricultural policy goals.
