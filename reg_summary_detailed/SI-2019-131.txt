**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**

**Regulatory Text:**
> *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, transfers from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Industry with respect to the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario.*  
> *S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207*  
> *R.S., c. P-34*

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The transfer of powers, duties, and functions is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (commonly referred to as the "PSRTDA").
- This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign certain responsibilities between federal ministers, particularly in the context of public service restructuring and administrative efficiency.
- The Act provides a statutory framework for transferring duties without requiring new legislation, as long as the transfer is within the scope of federal departmental responsibilities and is consistent with the public interest.

---

### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
- The **Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedEINO)** is the specific program or initiative being transferred.
- FedEINO is a federal government program established to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and support infrastructure development in Northern Ontario.
- It was originally administered by the **Minister of Industry**, which traditionally oversees economic development initiatives, particularly those related to manufacturing, natural resources, and regional development.

---

### **3. Recipient of the Transfer**
- The powers, duties, and functions related to FedEINO are being transferred to the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages**.
- This reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities, where economic development responsibilities in specific regions (such as Northern Ontario) are being placed under a minister who has broader oversight of economic development policy, including regional economic strategies.
- The inclusion of "Official Languages" in the minister’s title underscores the potential integration of language-related policies (e.g., bilingualism, accessibility) into regional economic development initiatives, particularly in regions with linguistic diversity like Northern Ontario.

---

### **4. Nature of the Transfer**
- The transfer includes **all powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of Industry related to FedEINO.
- This means that the new minister now has full authority to:
  - Develop and implement policies under FedEINO.
  - Approve funding allocations.
  - Coordinate with provincial and municipal governments.
  - Monitor program performance and outcomes.
  - Make decisions regarding project selection, partnerships, and regional economic planning.
- The transfer is not limited to administrative oversight—it encompasses substantive decision-making authority in the program's operation.

---

### **5. Legislative Citation and Context**
- The regulation is found in **Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22 (S.C. 2003, c. 22), Section 207**.
- It is cited in the *Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter P-34* (the current version of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act).
- This transfer was part of a broader federal government effort in the early 2000s to reorganize departments and improve efficiency, particularly in regional development and economic policy.

---

### **6. Rationale and Implications**
- **Strategic Realignment**: By moving FedEINO to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, the government signals a shift toward a more integrated approach to regional economic development, where economic growth is viewed in conjunction with broader social and linguistic policies.
- **Improved Regional Focus**: Northern Ontario has historically faced economic challenges, and placing FedEINO under a minister with a dedicated regional development portfolio may enhance responsiveness and accountability.
- **Policy Integration**: The inclusion of official languages may support the development of inclusive, accessible economic programs that serve both English and French-speaking communities in the region.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: The transfer streamlines governance by reducing duplication and aligning responsibilities with current policy priorities.

---

### **7. Significance**
- This regulation marks a significant change in the federal government’s structure for managing regional economic development.
- It reflects the evolving role of economic development ministries in Canada, where regional initiatives are increasingly managed under a broader economic development mandate rather than being confined to traditional industry or trade portfolios.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally transfers the management of the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages. The transfer is grounded in the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act and is designed to enhance the effectiveness, integration, and responsiveness of economic development policies in Northern Ontario. It represents a key example of how federal government restructuring can align ministerial responsibilities with strategic policy goals.
