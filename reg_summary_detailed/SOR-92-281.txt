  - **Section 476** – Regulation of debt obligations and capital adequacy
  - **Section 703** – Related provisions on financial oversight and reporting
- The regulation came into force on **June 1, 1992**.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

##### **(a) "Prescribed Subsidiary"**
- A **prescribed subsidiary** is a subsidiary of a property and casualty company (P&C) or a marine company that:
  - Is **not** a financial institution.
  - Is **not engaged in insuring property and casualty risks** (in the case of a P&C company), or
  - Is **not engaged in insuring marine risks** (in the case of a marine company).
- **Exclusions**:
  - Financial institutions that do not engage in insurance of property/casualty or marine risks are **not** considered prescribed subsidiaries.
- This definition helps determine which subsidiaries are subject to the debt obligation and capital adequacy rules under section 476.

##### **(b) "Debt Obligation"**
- The term "debt obligation" is defined **as per subsection 2(1) of the Insurance Companies Act**.
- This typically includes:
  - Bonds, loans, notes, mortgages, and other forms of debt issued by the company or its subsidiaries.
- The definition ensures consistency with the Act’s financial reporting standards.

##### **(c) "Aggregate of Total Debt Obligations"**
- This is a key financial metric used to assess a company’s leverage and risk exposure.
- It is calculated as:
  > **Aggregate Debt Obligations =**  
  > (Total debt obligations of the parent company)  
  > + (Total debt obligations of its prescribed subsidiaries **not held by the parent company**)  
  > **Minus** (Total stated capital of the parent company)
- This formula ensures that:
  - Only **outstanding debt** not backed by the company’s own capital is considered.
  - The company’s own capital (stated capital) is subtracted to avoid double-counting.

##### **(d) "Total Assets"**
- Refers to the **total assets** of the parent company as reported on its **balance sheet** as of a given date.
- These assets are determined **in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications** set out by the **Superintendent of Insurance** under **subsection 331(4)** of the Act.
- **Exclusion**: Assets of subsidiaries that are **not prescribed subsidiaries** are **excluded** from the total.
- This ensures that only the assets directly attributable to the parent company (after removing non-prescribed subsidiaries) are considered in capital adequacy calculations.

##### **(e) "Prescribed Percentage of Total Assets"**
- The regulation establishes a **capital adequacy threshold**:
  - The **aggregate of total debt obligations** of a P&C or marine company **must not exceed 2%** of its total assets.
- This means:
  > **Debt Obligations / Total Assets ≤ 2%**
- This cap is designed to:
  - Limit excessive leverage.
  - Ensure financial stability and solvency.
  - Protect policyholders and maintain public confidence in the insurance sector.

#### **3. Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure financial stability** of property and casualty (P&C) and marine insurance companies.
- **Limit debt exposure** by setting a strict 2% ratio between total debt obligations and total assets.
- **Improve transparency and accountability** by clearly defining what constitutes debt obligations and total assets.
- **Protect policyholders** by preventing companies from taking on excessive debt that could threaten their ability to meet claims.

---

#### **4. Scope and Application**

- Applies to:
  - **Property and casualty companies**
  - **Marine companies**
- Applies to:
  - The parent company
  - Its **prescribed subsidiaries** (specifically, those that are not financial institutions engaged in insurance)
- Does **not** apply to:
  - Subsidiaries that are financial institutions not involved in insuring property/casualty or marine risks.

---

#### **5. Repeal Status**

- The regulation was **repealed** on **January 1, 2009**, by **SOR/2009-296, section 5**.
- This means:
  - It is **no longer in force**.
  - It has been replaced by updated regulatory frameworks, likely under current insurance oversight policies.
- The repeal reflects ongoing modernization of the insurance regulatory regime in Canada, with more comprehensive and dynamic capital adequacy standards now in place.

---

#### **6. Significance and Historical Context**

- This regulation was part of a broader effort in the 1990s to strengthen the financial integrity of insurance companies.
- The 2% debt-to-assets ratio was a relatively conservative measure to prevent insolvency during periods of high claim frequency or economic downturns.
- While outdated, it represented a foundational step in the development of **solvency and risk-based capital rules** in Canadian insurance regulation.

### **Conclusion**

This 1992 regulation established a clear, enforceable framework to limit the debt exposure of property and casualty and marine insurance companies by setting a **2% maximum ratio of total debt obligations to total assets**. It defined key terms such as "prescribed subsidiary" and "debt obligation" with precision, ensuring that only relevant financial obligations were included in the calculation. However, due to the **repeal in 2009**, the regulation is **no longer applicable**. It serves as an important historical document reflecting the evolution of insurance regulation in Canada toward more robust, risk-based, and dynamic capital requirements.

> **Note for Regulatory Professionals**: When reviewing historical or archival documents, this regulation should be interpreted in context with current laws and regulations, particularly the **Insurance Companies Act (as amended)** and the **Solvency and Risk-Based Capital (SBC) framework** now in effect.
