**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Gattinger’s Agalinis (Agalinis gattingeri) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Framework**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, and is specifically designed to protect and conserve the critical habitat of the **Gattinger’s Agalinis (Agalinis gattingeri)**, a plant species listed as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA.

SARA establishes a legal framework to prevent the destruction or degradation of critical habitat for species at risk, ensuring their survival and recovery. The Act mandates that the Minister of the Environment identify and designate critical habitat based on scientific recovery strategies.

**2. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

The critical habitat for the Gattinger’s Agalinis was formally identified in the species’ **recovery strategy**, which has been **published and included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**—a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track species at risk and their conservation measures.

This inclusion ensures transparency, accountability, and public access to information about the species’ needs and the areas essential for its survival.

**3. Compliance with SARA’s Provisions**

The regulation explicitly addresses two key legal requirements under SARA:

- **Subsection 58(2)b**: This provision prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are **"in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b"**, which generally includes areas that are **protected under other federal or provincial legislation** (such as national parks, reserves, or areas with specific land-use designations).  
  Importantly, the Order confirms that **no portion of the designated critical habitat falls within such a protected area**. This ensures that the designation does not conflict with existing land-use protections.

- **Subsection 58(9)**: This requires the Minister of the Environment to **consult with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** when the proposed critical habitat designation would affect land under the jurisdiction of the MFO.  
  The Order confirms that the Minister of the Environment has conducted such consultations with the MFO. This demonstrates due process and interdepartmental coordination to ensure that any federal land use or management decisions are considered and respected.

**4. Legal Authority and Purpose of the Order**

The Order is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA:

- **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister to designate critical habitat for a species at risk, based on the recovery strategy.
- **Section 58(5)** requires that the designation be made in a way that is consistent with the species’ recovery and that it does not conflict with other laws or regulations.

By issuing this Order, the Minister of the Environment formally **designates specific geographic areas** as the **critical habitat** for the Gattinger’s Agalinis. These areas are essential for the species’ survival and recovery, as they provide the necessary environmental conditions (e.g., soil type, moisture, light exposure, and minimal disturbance) for the plant to grow, reproduce, and persist.

---

**5. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which is the official publication for federal laws and regulations.
- Once registered, the designation becomes legally binding and enforceable under SARA.
- Any federal or provincial activity that would result in the **destruction, degradation, or unauthorized alteration** of the designated critical habitat may be subject to legal review or restrictions under SARA.

**6. Significance of the Order**

This Order represents a key step in the **recovery of the Gattinger’s Agalinis**, a rare and vulnerable plant species native to a small region in southern Ontario (specifically in the area around the Ottawa-Gatineau region). The species is adapted to specific ecological conditions and is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance.

By formally identifying and protecting its critical habitat, the Order:

- Provides a legal basis for conservation planning;
- Supports scientific and ecological monitoring;
- Encourages land-use planning that avoids or minimizes impacts on the species’ habitat;
- Strengthens the government’s commitment to biodiversity conservation under SARA.

**7. Key Takeaways**

| Element | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Species** | Gattinger’s Agalinis (Agalinis gattingeri) |
| **Status** | Endangered under SARA (Part 2, Schedule 1) |
| **Legal Basis** | SARA, specifically sections 58(4) and (5), and 58(9) |
| **Critical Habitat** | Identified in the recovery strategy and included in the Species at Risk Public Registry |
| **Compliance** | No overlap with protected areas (58(2)b); consultation with MFO completed |
| **Effective Date** | Upon registration in the Canada Gazette |

**Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding and scientifically grounded step in the conservation of the Gattinger’s Agalinis. It reflects the federal government’s commitment to protecting biodiversity through the implementation of SARA. By clearly defining and protecting the species’ critical habitat, the Order supports long-term recovery efforts and ensures that future development or land-use decisions take into account the ecological needs of this endangered plant species.
