#### **Effective Date**  
July 15, 2013

#### **Governing Authority**  
The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**. This means that the decision was made at the highest level of the federal government, reflecting a formal and politically endorsed transfer of responsibilities.

#### **Legal Basis**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*).  
- This Act provides the legal framework for reorganizing federal departments and agencies, including the transfer of administrative control, supervision, and responsibilities between federal ministers.  
- The specific paragraph (2(a)(a)) allows for the transfer of control and supervision of a federal agency from one minister to another, typically to align with broader policy objectives or administrative efficiency.

#### **Key Provision**  
The regulation formally **transfers control and supervision** of the **Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CNEDA)** from the **Minister of Health** to the **Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency**.

- **Prior to July 15, 2013**: The CNEDA was under the administrative oversight of the Minister of Health.  
- **Effective July 15, 2013**: The agency is placed under the direct responsibility of a newly designated minister — the Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency — who is responsible for its day-to-day management, policy direction, and operational oversight.

#### **Presiding Officer Appointment**  
The regulation also includes a directive that:  
> *"The Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency shall preside over the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency."*

- This means that the designated minister is not only the responsible minister for policy and funding but also the **formal head or chair** of the agency.  
- As the presiding officer, the minister has the authority to lead meetings, set strategic priorities, approve major decisions, and represent the agency in intergovernmental and public forums.

#### **Legal and Statutory References**  
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This is a section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, Chapter 22 (the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act). Section 207 likely outlines the procedures and powers related to the transfer of duties between departments.  
- **R.S., c. P-34**: This refers to the *Regulations of the Public Service*, Chapter P-34, which may contain administrative rules governing ministerial responsibilities and agency governance. These regulations support the implementation of the transfer by defining procedural and operational standards.
