**Detailed Summary of the CUFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **CUFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** are established under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)), which grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) the authority to make regulations governing the rules of origin for goods under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA).

This regulatory power is exercised to implement the specific rules that determine whether a product qualifies as originating from Canada or Ukraine, thereby allowing it to benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the agreement.

### **2. Applicable Provisions of the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)**

The following provisions of the CUFTA have been formally incorporated into Canadian law and carry the force of law within Canada:

- **Articles 3.1 to 3.14**  
  These articles establish the **rules of origin** that define how products are determined to be "originating" for the purposes of tariff preferences. Key elements include:
  - The requirement that goods must be **produced or manufactured in Canada or Ukraine** to qualify.
  - Criteria for **partial origin**, such as the use of non-originating inputs.
  - Rules for **value-added thresholds** and **processing requirements**.
  - Specific provisions for **agricultural products**, **manufactured goods**, and **services**.
  - Rules for **exclusions and exceptions**, including certain types of products or inputs that do not count toward origin.

- **Annexes 3-A and 3-C**  
  These annexes provide **detailed, product-specific rules of origin**:
  - **Annex 3-A**: Contains detailed rules for **specific product categories** (e.g., machinery, vehicles, textiles, food products), specifying the percentage of value or the level of processing required for a product to be considered originating.
  - **Annex 3-C**: Provides **rules for certain goods derived from non-originating materials**, such as those involving complex manufacturing or assembly processes (e.g., vehicles, electronic components), including rules on **material content**, **value addition**, and **processing location**.

These annexes serve as the **operational framework** for determining origin under CUFTA and are binding in Canadian customs and trade law.

### **3. Repeal of Prior Regulations**

The **prior CUFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** (SOR/2017-141) are **repealed** by these new regulations. This indicates a significant update or revision to the origin rules, likely reflecting changes in trade dynamics, product categories, or alignment with updated provisions of the CUFTA agreement.

The repeal ensures that the current, more up-to-date rules are in force and that there is no overlap or ambiguity from outdated or superseded regulations.

---

### **4. Effective Date and Implementation**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 9 of the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, 2023** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, they will instead come into force on the **date of registration**.

This phased implementation ensures that the rules are introduced in a coordinated manner with the broader legislative framework of the CUFTA Implementation Act, allowing for proper customs, trade, and industry preparation.

### **5. Current Status (as of July 1, 2024)**

As of **July 1, 2024**, these regulations are **in force** in Canada. This date marks the official implementation of the updated rules of origin under CUFTA, enabling Canadian customs authorities and businesses to apply the new criteria when determining whether goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement.

---

### **Key Implications for Stakeholders**

- **Importers and exporters** involved in trade between Canada and Ukraine must now apply the updated rules of origin (as defined in Articles 3.1–3.14 and Annexes 3-A and 3-C) to determine whether their goods qualify for tariff reductions or exemptions.
- **Customs officers** will use these regulations to assess the origin of goods entering Canada from Ukraine or vice versa.
- Businesses may need to revise documentation, such as certificates of origin, to comply with the new rules, especially regarding value content, processing, and material sourcing.
- The repeal of prior regulations ensures clarity and consistency in the application of origin rules, reducing potential disputes or misclassifications.

### **Conclusion**

The **CUFTA Rules of Origin Regulations** represent a formal, legally binding implementation of the rules of origin under the Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement. By incorporating Articles 3.1 to 3.14 and Annexes 3-A and 3-C into Canadian law, the regulations provide a clear, enforceable framework for determining the origin of goods traded between Canada and Ukraine. The repeal of outdated rules and the alignment with the 2023 Implementation Act ensure that Canada’s trade practices are current, transparent, and compliant with international obligations under CUFTA. These regulations are effective as of July 1, 2024, and are essential for the proper functioning of preferential trade mechanisms between the two countries.
