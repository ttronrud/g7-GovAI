## **5. Special Transitional Periods (Effective Date Clauses)**

These provisions address **investments that were pending or close to certification during the transition period** when the regulations came into force (March 12, 2009, and February 6, 2009).

> **Regulations come into force on the day they are registered.**

However, for certain investments, a **60-day transitional period** applies if:

- The **certified date** of an investment under **paragraph 2(a)** falls between **March 12, 2009**, and the day the regulations come into force;
- The **certified date** of an investment under **paragraph 2(b)** falls between **February 6, 2009**, and the day of registration;
- The **implementation date** of an investment under **paragraph 2(c)** falls between **March 12, 2009**, and the day of registration.

> In such cases, the prescribed period is extended to **60 days** instead of the standard 45 days.

Similarly, if a notice is not sent under section 25.2(1), and the investment falls within those dates, the period is also extended to **60 days**.

This transitional provision ensures that investments that were already in process or near certification at the time of the regulation’s release are not unfairly disadvantaged by a sudden change in timelines.
