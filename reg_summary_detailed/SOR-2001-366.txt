**Detailed Summary of the Ancillary Activities (Insurance Companies, Canadian Societies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

The *Ancillary Activities (Insurance Companies, Canadian Societies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* were made under **section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)** by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. These regulations were enacted under the authority of the ICA and came into force on **October 24, 2001**, following the enactment of **section 495 of the ICA** through **section 426 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (Statutes of Canada, 2001, c. 9)**.

This regulatory instrument defines which activities are considered **"prescribed"** (i.e., permissible or allowed) when an insurance company, a Canadian society, or an insurance holding company acquires control of, or increases a substantial investment in, another entity. The purpose is to ensure that such activities remain **reasonably ancillary** to the core insurance business, thereby maintaining financial stability, consumer protection, and regulatory oversight.

### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### **1. Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations apply in relation to the following types of entities:

- **Life Companies**
- **Property and Casualty Companies (P&C) and Marine Companies**
- **Canadian Societies** (e.g., mutual or non-profit societies engaged in insurance-related activities)
- **Insurance Holding Companies**

Each type of entity is subject to different but similar criteria regarding what constitutes a permissible "ancillary activity."

### **Prescribed Ancillary Activities (Common to All Entities)**

For each of the above entities, the following activities are **prescribed** under relevant sections of the ICA (specifically paragraphs 495(2)(f), 495(4)(f), 554(2)(f), and 971(2)(f)):

1. **Provision of Safety and Risk Prevention Services and Risk Management / Claims Adjustment Services**  
   - Includes services aimed at reducing risk exposure, such as safety education, fire prevention programs, or training for clients to reduce claims frequency or severity.  
   - Also includes services related to **risk management planning** and **claims adjustment** (e.g., handling claims efficiently, minimizing losses).

2. **Operation of Rehabilitation and Training and Development Centres**  
   - Facilities or programs designed to rehabilitate individuals (e.g., after injury or disability) or provide training in risk mitigation, safety, or insurance-related skills.  
   - These services support both client well-being and broader risk reduction.

3. **Provision of Computer Systems to Independent Insurance Brokers and Agents**  
   - Supplying software, data systems, or technology platforms to brokers and agents to assist them in underwriting, policy administration, or customer service.  
   - This enhances efficiency and supports the broader insurance distribution network.

4. **Provision of Support to Independent Insurance Brokers and Agents**  
   - Includes administrative, operational, or technical support (e.g., marketing, training, underwriting tools, compliance assistance) to independent brokers and agents.  
   - Helps ensure that agents can effectively serve clients without relying solely on the insurer’s internal infrastructure.

5. **Operation of Repair and Appraisal Centres**  
   - Physical or operational centers where damaged property is repaired or appraised (e.g., after a fire, collision, or natural disaster).  
   - These centers are directly linked to claims settlement and property damage insurance.

6. **Any Other Activities That Are Reasonably Ancillary to the Business of Insurance**  
   - A catch-all clause allowing for additional activities that are **reasonably related** to the insurer’s core insurance operations.  
   - The determination of "reasonably ancillary" must be assessed based on relevance, efficiency, and alignment with the insurer’s primary business.

### **Prescribed Term or Condition: Reasonable Ancillarity**

A critical condition across all provisions is that **all prescribed activities must be reasonably ancillary to the business of insurance carried on by the relevant company**.

- For **life companies**, the activity must be reasonably ancillary to their life insurance operations (e.g., health, pension, or endowment products).
- For **P&C or marine companies**, the activity must be reasonably ancillary to their property, casualty, or marine insurance operations (e.g., auto, home, or maritime insurance).
- For **Canadian societies**, the activity must be reasonably ancillary to their insurance business (e.g., a mutual insurance society offering life or property coverage).
- For **insurance holding companies**, the activity must be reasonably ancillary to the business of insurance carried on by a **company controlled by the holding company** (i.e., a subsidiary or affiliate).

> This requirement ensures that ancillary activities do not become diversified or unrelated ventures that could pose systemic or financial risks.

### **Application by Entity Type**

| Entity Type | Relevant ICA Section | Key Requirement |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Life Company** | 495(2)(f) | Ancillary activities must be reasonably related to life insurance operations. |
| **P&C or Marine Company** | 495(4)(f) | Ancillary activities must be reasonably related to property/casualty or marine insurance operations. |
| **Canadian Society** | 554(2)(f) | Activities must be reasonably ancillary to the society’s insurance business. |
| **Insurance Holding Company** | 971(2)(f) | Activities must be reasonably ancillary to the business of a company **controlled** by the holding company. |

> Note: The holding company provision emphasizes **control and subsidiary alignment**, meaning the ancillary activity must serve the business of a subsidiary, not the holding company itself.

### **Regulatory Objective**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **To define permissible activities** that an insurer or affiliated entity can engage in when acquiring or increasing its investment in another entity.
2. **To prevent excessive diversification** or non-core operations that could undermine financial stability or consumer protection.
3. **To promote efficiency and support** in the insurance ecosystem—particularly through services to brokers and claims-related support.
4. **To maintain regulatory clarity** by clearly outlining which activities are acceptable and under what conditions.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations came into force on **October 24, 2001**, coinciding with the implementation of **section 495 of the Insurance Companies Act**, which introduced the framework for regulating ancillary activities in insurance companies and related entities.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Regulatory Clarity**: Provides clear, structured guidance on what constitutes acceptable ancillary activities, reducing ambiguity for insurers and regulators.
- **Support for Brokers**: Encourages insurers to support independent brokers through technology and services, which strengthens the distribution network.
- **Risk Management Focus**: Emphasizes services that reduce claims and prevent losses—aligning with broader insurance industry goals of risk mitigation.
- **Prevents Misuse**: The "reasonably ancillary" standard acts as a safeguard against companies engaging in unrelated or speculative ventures.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ancillary Activities (Insurance Companies, Canadian Societies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* establish a transparent and risk-sensitive framework for permissible activities when insurance entities expand their influence through investment or control. By limiting such activities to those that are **directly related to the core insurance business**, the regulations ensure that growth and diversification remain within safe, well-defined boundaries. This supports financial integrity, protects consumers, and promotes a stable and efficient insurance sector in Canada.
