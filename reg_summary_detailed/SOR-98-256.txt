**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation is a **provincial designation order** issued under the **Divorce Act (Canada)**, specifically to clarify which jurisdiction’s child support guidelines will be recognized and applied in the determination of child support obligations when the parties involved reside in or are connected to the **Province of New Brunswick**.

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

The regulation arises from a provision in the **Divorce Act**, which allows for the use of **"applicable guidelines"** in determining child support payments. Under **subsection 2(1)** of the Divorce Act, the term *“applicable guidelines”* refers to a set of rules or standards established by a province or territory that govern the calculation of child support.

New Brunswick had developed its own **comprehensive and detailed child support guidelines** — specifically, the *Child Support Guidelines Regulation — Family Services Act, N.B. Reg. 98-27* — which were designed to provide a fair, consistent, and transparent method for calculating child support based on factors such as income, number of children, and custody arrangements.

The purpose of this regulation is to **formally designate New Brunswick as the jurisdiction whose guidelines are recognized and used** under the federal Divorce Act for child support matters involving residents of the province.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under:
- **Subsection 2(5)(c) of the Divorce Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice) to designate a province or territory as having "applicable guidelines" for child support.
- The reference to **S.C. 1997, c. 1, s. 11** and **R.S., c. 3 (2nd Supp.)** indicates the legislative basis and citation of the relevant statutory provisions in the Canadian legal system.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### a. **Designation of New Brunswick**
> *"The Province of New Brunswick is hereby designated for the purposes of the definition ‘applicable guidelines’ in subsection 2(1) of the Divorce Act."*

This means that when determining child support in a divorce or separation proceeding, **if one or both parties reside in New Brunswick**, the **New Brunswick Child Support Guidelines** will be used as the "applicable guidelines" under the federal Divorce Act.

#### b. **Identification of the Applicable Guidelines**
> *"For the purposes of subsection 2(5) of the Divorce Act, the laws that constitute the comprehensive guidelines for the Province of New Brunswick are sections 1 to 3 of the Child Support Guidelines Regulation — Family Services Act, N.B. Reg. 98-27."*

This clearly identifies the **specific legal provisions** that form the basis of the guidelines:
- **Section 1**: General principles and definitions (e.g., income, child support, and the factors to be considered).
- **Section 2**: The formula for calculating child support payments based on the parent’s income and the number of children.
- **Section 3**: Special rules for certain circumstances (e.g., shared custody, extraordinary expenses, or changes in circumstances).

These sections provide a structured, rule-based approach to child support that is consistent with the federal framework but tailored to the economic and social context of New Brunswick.

#### c. **Effective Date**
> *"This Order comes into force on May 1, 1998."*

This establishes the date from which the designation becomes legally effective. All child support determinations involving New Brunswick residents after May 1, 1998, must use the New Brunswick guidelines as defined in the regulation.

### **4. Significance and Impact**

- **Federal-Province Coordination**: This regulation ensures that **child support calculations are consistent and predictable** across jurisdictions by aligning federal law with provincial policy.
- **Clarity for Courts and Practitioners**: It removes ambiguity about which guidelines apply in New Brunswick cases, allowing courts, legal professionals, and families to rely on a clear, standardized framework.
- **Support for Families**: By using a comprehensive and locally relevant set of guidelines, the regulation promotes fairness and equity in child support decisions, especially in cases involving income disparities or complex family situations.

---

### **5. Legal Context**

- The **Divorce Act** governs child support in Canada and requires that provinces provide "applicable guidelines" to ensure uniformity in child support calculations.
- This Order is part of a broader system of **provincial child support regulations**, where each province (or territory) may develop its own guidelines, and the federal government formally recognizes them through such designations.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the **Province of New Brunswick** as the jurisdiction whose **Child Support Guidelines Regulation (N.B. Reg. 98-27, Sections 1–3)** will be recognized as the "applicable guidelines" under **subsection 2(1)** of the Divorce Act. It came into effect on **May 1, 1998**, and ensures that child support calculations in New Brunswick cases are based on a clear, consistent, and comprehensive provincial framework. This enhances fairness, transparency, and legal predictability in child support matters involving New Brunswick residents.
