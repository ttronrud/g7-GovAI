### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **remit (i.e., waive or cancel) the application fee** associated with obtaining a **Certificate of Citizenship** in specific circumstances. This is intended to encourage civic participation, particularly among young citizens and mature adults, by removing financial barriers when they are invited to take part in ceremonies that promote citizenship.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Remission of Fee**  
   The fee payable under **Section 32 of the Citizenship Regulations** (which governs the application process for a certificate of citizenship) is **fully waived** for the following categories of applicants:

   - **Minors** (citizens under the age of 18 years), or  
   - **Citizens who have attained the age of 18 years**,  
   **provided** that they have been **invited by a club or an organization** to participate in a **ceremony promoting citizenship**.

2. **Eligibility Conditions**  
   To qualify for the remission:
   - The applicant must be a **citizen of Canada**.
   - The applicant must have been **formally invited** by a **club or organization**.
   - The invitation must be for participation in a **ceremony specifically designed to promote citizenship** (e.g., civic education events, national celebrations, community service events, or other public events aimed at strengthening civic identity).

3. **Scope of Application**  
   The remission applies to applications for a **certificate of citizenship** under **Section 10 of the Citizenship Regulations**. This certificate is typically issued to recognize a citizen's participation in a public or civic event, not as a replacement for naturalization or other citizenship processes.

4. **No Requirement for Fee Payment**  
   The regulation explicitly waives the fee that would otherwise be required under Section 32 of the Citizenship Regulations. This means applicants in eligible circumstances do not need to pay the fee when applying for the certificate.

### **Legal Authority**

The regulation is enacted under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to make orders related to fees and charges in the public interest, particularly when such actions serve broader public policy goals like civic engagement and national unity.

The revocation of the prior Order in Council (P.C. 1980-6/304) indicates a change in policy or administrative approach, likely to simplify or expand access to citizenship-related recognition ceremonies.

### **Public Interest Justification**

The government asserts that this measure is in the **public interest** because:
- It supports civic education and community involvement.
- It encourages participation by young people and adults in national ceremonies that promote Canadian values.
- It reduces financial barriers to civic recognition, especially for individuals who may not have the financial means to pay fees for participation in public events.

### **Important Notes**

- **Not Published in Canada Gazette Part II**: This is notable because most statutory instruments are published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II* to ensure public access. The absence of publication may indicate that this is a **non-binding administrative directive** or that it was intended to be implemented internally or through other means, though it still has legal force as a statutory order.
- **No Specific Criteria for "Ceremony"**: The regulation does not define what constitutes a "ceremony for the promotion of citizenship," which may leave discretion to the organizing body or Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) to interpret and apply the provision appropriately.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a **financial incentive** to promote civic engagement by waiving the application fee for certificates of citizenship when individuals participate in citizenship-related events organized by clubs or community groups. It is a targeted policy designed to strengthen national identity and encourage youth and adult participation in public life, while respecting the administrative and financial frameworks of the Citizenship Regulations.

It reflects a broader governmental effort to foster a sense of belonging and civic responsibility among Canadians through accessible, inclusive, and symbolic recognition of citizenship.
