**Detailed Summary of the Non-Signatory Yukon First Nations Remission Order**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the **Non-Signatory Yukon First Nations Remission Order**, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders granting remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes in the public interest, particularly when such action serves to address historical or equitable concerns.

The Order is rooted in the principle of **equity and fairness** toward Indigenous communities, specifically targeting **Yukon First Nations** who may have faced economic or logistical barriers in accessing or delivering goods and services within reserves during a specific time period.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this remission order is to **provide tax relief** to **eligible claimants** (members of designated Yukon First Nations) who:

- Acquired **tangible personal property** outside a reserve during the eligible period,
- Did **not deliver** that property to a reserve during the same period,
- And had the tax on that purchase **not otherwise refunded or credited**.

This remission addresses a gap in tax compliance due to **historical logistical challenges**, such as lack of transportation infrastructure, limited access to markets, or cultural/operational reasons preventing delivery of goods to reserves.

---

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **only granted** if all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Personal Use and Consumption**  
   The property was acquired **by an eligible claimant** for their **personal use and consumption**, not for resale or commercial purposes.

2. **Failure to Deliver to a Reserve**  
   The property was **not delivered to a reserve** by the supplier or the supplier’s agent during the eligible period.

3. **No Prior Rebate or Credit**  
   The tax paid on the supply **has not already been rebated, credited, or remitted** under the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act*. This ensures that remission is not applied retroactively or multiple times.

4. **Timely Submission of Claim**  
   A written claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.

---

### **Required Documentation for Claim Submission**

To qualify for remission, the claimant must submit the following documents:

1. **Copy of Certificate of Indian Status**  
   Issued by the **Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND)** — verifies the claimant’s status as an Indian and membership in the relevant band.

2. **Copy of Invoice**  
   Must include:
   - Name and address of the supplier
   - Date of supply
   - Name of the eligible claimant
   - Value of consideration (price paid)
   - A **sufficiently detailed description** of the tangible personal property (e.g., type, model, quantity, etc.)

3. **Proof of Tax Payment**  
   Evidence that the GST on the supply was actually paid (e.g., receipt, payment record, tax invoice showing GST amount).

4. **Statement from Supplier**  
   A written statement confirming that:
   - Upon request, the supplier or their agent **would normally have delivered** the property to a reserve,
   - But **did not deliver it** during the eligible period (February 15, 1998 – March 31, 2002).

> This supplier statement is critical in establishing that the failure to deliver was not due to the claimant’s fault or lack of effort.

### **Exclusions and Limitations**

- The Order **does not apply** to:
  - Goods delivered to a reserve during the eligible period.
  - Goods acquired for commercial or resale purposes.
  - Claims that have already been processed for rebate or remission under other provisions.

- The Order is **limited to tangible personal property** — not services or intangible assets.

- It applies **only to bands listed in the schedule** attached to the Order. Not all First Nations in Yukon are eligible.

- The **two-year deadline** for claim submission is strict and cannot be extended without formal amendment.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General made this Order **in the public interest**, recognizing that:

- Many Yukon First Nations faced **economic disadvantages** in accessing goods and services due to geographic isolation.
- The failure to deliver goods to reserves may have been due to **systemic barriers**, not intentional tax evasion.
- Granting remission promotes **economic equity**, supports Indigenous self-determination, and fosters reconciliation by acknowledging historical inequities in access to markets and services.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for:
  - Receiving and evaluating claims.
  - Verifying documentation.
  - Deciding whether to grant remission based on the criteria.
- Claims are processed in accordance with existing tax administration procedures.
- The Order does not alter the underlying tax laws but provides a **specific, targeted relief mechanism** for a defined group and time period.

---

### **Conclusion**

This **Non-Signatory Yukon First Nations Remission Order** is a targeted, equitable intervention designed to:

✅ Recognize and correct past economic disadvantages faced by Yukon First Nations,  
✅ Provide tax relief to individuals who acquired goods for personal use but could not deliver them to reserves due to practical or logistical constraints,  
✅ Uphold the principle of fairness under the *Financial Administration Act*, and  
✅ Support broader reconciliation efforts by addressing historical inequities in access to goods and services.

It represents a significant step in **Indigenous economic inclusion** and demonstrates the federal government’s willingness to apply tax policy with sensitivity to cultural and community realities.
