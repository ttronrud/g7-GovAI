**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Forces Materiel Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
The regulation is issued under **section 101 of the Customs Tariff** (*R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)*), by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**. This grants the government the authority to remit (i.e., cancel or waive) customs duties that have been paid or are payable in respect of certain Canadian Forces materiel.

---

**2. Title of the Order**  
The Order is officially known as the **Canadian Forces Materiel Remission Order** and may be cited by that name.

---

**3. Definition of "Materiel"**  
The term *materiel* is broadly defined to include **all property of Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by the **Minister of National Defence**, that is provided for the use of the **Canadian Forces**. This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Vessels, vehicles, aircraft  
- Animals  
- Arms and ammunition  
- Clothing  
- Stores, provisions, and equipment  
Any of the above that are **necessary or used** for the purposes of:  
- Canada’s role in the **North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)**  
- Canada’s role as a member of the **United Nations (UN)**  

This definition ensures that military equipment and supplies directly related to Canada’s international defense commitments are covered.

---

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
The Order grants a **full remission of customs duties** to the **Department of National Defence (DND)** for certain materiel imported as a result of the following events:  

- **Closure of Canadian Forces Bases** in:  
  - **Lahr, Germany**  
  - **Baden-Soellingen, Germany**  
- **Closure of the Canadian Forces Station Bermuda** in Bermuda  
- **Recall of the Canadian Contingent of the United Nations Force in Cyprus** from the Republic of Cyprus  

These closures and recalls were significant operational changes that led to the return or disposal of equipment previously used or stored at these locations.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions under **section 3** of the Order. The Department of National Defence must certify, in a form approved by the Minister of National Revenue, that the following criteria are met:

1. **Ownership and Purpose**  
   The materiel must be:  
   - The **property of Her Majesty in right of Canada**, as represented by the Minister of National Defence  
   - Being imported **for the purpose of the closure or recall** mentioned above  

2. **Time Period of Importation**  
   The materiel must have been **imported and accounted for during the period from April 1, 1992, to December 31, 1995**.  
   This timeframe reflects the period during which the closures and recalls occurred, and during which the associated materiel was either being returned or replaced.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue no later than December 31, 1997**.  
   This deadline ensures that claims are processed within a defined timeframe, allowing for administrative closure of the program.

---

**6. Key Objectives of the Order**  
- To **alleviate financial burdens** on the Department of National Defence resulting from the closure of overseas military bases and the recall of UN contingents.  
- To recognize that the importation of materiel during these events was **not for commercial purposes**, but for **military operational realignment**.  
- To ensure **accountability and transparency** through a formal certification process and time-bound claim requirements.

---

**7. Regulatory Significance**  
This Order is a **special exception** to the general customs duty regime under the Customs Tariff. It reflects the principle that **military operations and international commitments** may require flexibility in customs compliance, especially when base closures or troop withdrawals result in the return or reassignment of equipment.

---

**8. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The remission **does not apply** to materiel imported outside the specified time frame (1992–1995).  
- It **does not cover** general commercial imports or civilian equipment.  
- The certification requirement ensures that only **legitimate, documented cases** of materiel return or reallocation qualify.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Canadian Forces Materiel Remission Order* is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally governed regulation designed to relieve the Department of National Defence of customs duties related to the return or reallocation of military equipment due to the closure of overseas bases and the recall of a UN contingent. It balances fiscal responsibility with the operational realities of military deployments and international commitments, while ensuring accountability through clear eligibility criteria and a defined claim process.

This Order serves as a key example of how Canadian customs law can be adapted to support national defense and international obligations.
