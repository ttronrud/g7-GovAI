**Detailed Summary of the Prince Edward Island Hog Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Prince Edward Island Hog Order* and may be cited as such. This Order serves as a statutory instrument that implements specific provisions of the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Act) in relation to the marketing of hogs.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"** refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Loi). This is the primary legislation under which the Commodity Board operates and which provides the legal framework for regulating hog marketing.

- **"Commodity Board"** refers to the *Prince Edward Island Hog Commodity Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Act and is responsible for overseeing the marketing of hogs in Prince Edward Island.

- **"Hog"** is defined as any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced within Prince Edward Island. This definition ensures that only locally raised pigs are subject to the regulation.

- **"Plan"** refers to any marketing plan for hogs established and amended over time in accordance with the Act. The Plan outlines the rules, procedures, and mechanisms for marketing hogs, including pricing, distribution, and market access.

**3. Scope of Authority: Interprovincial and Export Trade**  
The Commodity Board is granted authority to regulate the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside of Canada). This extends its regulatory reach beyond local markets, enabling it to manage price stability, ensure fair market practices, and protect producers in broader markets.

Importantly, for these interprovincial and export functions, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** that it currently holds in relation to the **local marketing of hogs within Prince Edward Island**. This means that the powers previously used for local marketing—such as setting prices, collecting fees, and managing producer equity—can be applied in a broader context.

---

**4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**  
A central provision of the Order is the Board’s power to:

- **Make orders** that fix **levies or charges** on persons involved in the marketing of hogs.
- **Impose and collect** these levies or charges from individuals or entities engaged in the marketing of hogs, as defined in section 3 of the Act.

This power allows the Board to generate revenue to support its operations and achieve economic stability in the hog industry.

---

**5. Classification of Marketers**  
The Board may classify marketing entities into **different groups** (e.g., based on size, type of operation, or market segment). Each group may then be assigned a **different levy or charge**. This enables a more equitable and flexible system where fees are tailored to the specific circumstances of different market participants.

For example:
- A small processor might pay a lower levy than a large exporter.
- A new entrant might be placed in a lower-tier group with reduced obligations.

This classification ensures that the burden of levies is distributed fairly and proportionally.

---

**6. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The revenues collected from levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial buffers during market downturns),
- **Payment of expenses** (operational costs of the Board and marketing activities),
- **Covering losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., due to market collapse or poor prices),
- **Equalizing or adjusting** the financial outcomes among hog producers.

This last point is particularly significant: the Board can use the collected funds to **equalize income** among producers during periods of fluctuating market prices. For instance, if prices fall and some producers suffer losses, the Board can use reserves or adjustments to compensate them, ensuring a more stable and equitable return on investment across the industry.

---

**7. Revocation Note**  
The Order includes a note stating that a previous provision (specifically, the section previously cited as being revoked by *SOR/80-90*) has been **revoked**. This indicates a revision in the regulatory framework, likely to remove outdated or redundant provisions and to align current authority with updated economic or administrative needs.

---

**8. Purpose and Intent**  
The overarching purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide a structured and equitable system for the marketing of hogs in both domestic and international markets,
- Protect producers from market volatility,
- Ensure financial sustainability of the hog industry through fair levies and revenue management,
- Promote stability and fairness in the distribution of income among hog producers.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Prince Edward Island Hog Order* empowers the Hog Commodity Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs in a manner consistent with local marketing practices. By allowing the Board to classify marketers, impose tiered levies, and use collected funds for reserves, expense coverage, loss mitigation, and income equalization, the Order supports a resilient, fair, and sustainable hog industry in Prince Edward Island. It reflects a market-based approach to agricultural marketing that balances producer interests with broader economic stability.
