### **Detailed Summary of the International and Interprovincial Power Line Damage Prevention Regulations – Obligations of Holders of Permits and Certificates**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are issued under the **Canadian Energy Regulator Act (CERA)** by the **Canadian Energy Regulator (CER)**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources. The authority is derived from:

- **Paragraphs 96(c) to (f)** of the CERA: These grant the CER the power to make regulations to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of energy infrastructure.
- **Paragraph 275(3)(b)** of the CERA: This allows the CER to establish rules governing the obligations of holders of authorizations for international or interprovincial power lines.

The regulations came into force on the day of registration and were formally approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on **November 25, 2019**, under **S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 10**.

---

#### **3. Mandatory Membership in a One-Call Centre**

- If a holder operates within a geographical area that has a **one-call centre**, the holder **must be a member** of that centre.
- A **one-call centre** is an organization that:
  - Receives locate requests from individuals or contractors planning construction or ground disturbance activities.
  - Notifies its members (including power line holders) of any proposed activity that could affect underground infrastructure.
- This ensures early communication and coordination to prevent accidental damage to power lines.

---

#### **4. Obligations Upon Receiving a Locate Request**

When a person submits a request to locate a holder’s international or interprovincial power line (e.g., for excavation, construction, or vehicle movement), the holder must:

1. **Provide Safety Practices (within 3 working days)**  
   - Deliver written information outlining safety procedures for working near the power line.

2. **Mark the Underground Location**  
   - Clearly mark the location of the underground portion of the power line using **distinct, visible markings**.
   - Markings must be clearly distinguishable from other site markers (e.g., for other utilities or construction).

3. **Provide Clear Explanations of Markings**  
   - Supply information explaining the **significance and meaning** of the markings to the requesting party.

> *Note:* The 3-working-day deadline may be extended with mutual agreement between the holder and the requesting party.

---

#### **5. Inspection Requirements**

To ensure the safety and integrity of the power line, holders are required to:

- Conduct inspections **as required by their authorization conditions** or when they determine such inspections are necessary.
- Inspect any **exposed underground portion** of the power line **before backfilling** to verify no damage has occurred.
- Make **field observations** during inspections to assess compliance with the *Authorizations Regulations* and other damage prevention measures.

These inspections are critical to maintaining the physical and operational integrity of the power line.

---

#### **6. Annual Reporting Requirement (Effective from 2021)**

Starting **January 31, 2021**, and annually thereafter, holders must submit a comprehensive report to the CER for the previous calendar year. The report must include:

1. **Details of any contravention** of the *International and Interprovincial Power Line Damage Prevention Regulations – Authorizations*.
2. **Details of any damage** to the power line, including:
   - The cause and nature of the damage
   - Any impacts on the reliability of the line
3. **Concerns about safety, security, or reliability** arising from:
   - Construction activities
   - Ground disturbances
   - Operation of vehicles or mobile equipment across the line
4. **Actions taken or planned** in response to:
   - Contraventions
   - Damage incidents

This reporting requirement enhances transparency and accountability, enabling the regulator to monitor compliance and identify systemic risks.

---

#### **7. Recordkeeping Obligations**

Holders must maintain a **permanent record** of all construction activities and ground disturbances affecting their international or interprovincial power lines, for the **entire life of the line**.

Each record must include:

- A copy of the **written authorization** issued by the holder.
- For every inspection:
  - Name of the person who conducted the inspection
  - Date and time of inspection
  - All findings and observations (including field observations)
- Details of any:
  - Abandonment
  - Removal
  - Alteration of the facility or activity

> **Exception**: If the authorization has an expiry date, the holder need only retain the authorization copy for **12 months after expiry**, not the full life of the line.

---

#### **8. Damage Prevention Program Requirements**

Holders are required to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive **damage prevention program** that includes the following components:

##### **A. Public Awareness Program**
The program must inform the public about:
- The location of the power line
- Locations where **vehicle or mobile equipment operation** could compromise safety or security
- Safety measures to reduce risks at high-risk locations
- How to work safely near the power line
- How to report:
  - Unexpected incidents that threaten life or property
  - Any contact with the power line (especially if damage is suspected)
- Information on **one-call centres** (if available)
- The **obligation to obtain authorization** before:
  - Constructing across, on, along, or under the line
  - Engaging in ground-disturbing activities
  - Operating vehicles or mobile equipment (except on highways or public roads)
- How to submit a request for authorization
- The obligation to make a locate request and how to do so

##### **B. Timely Response to Locate Requests**
A clear process must be established to respond to locate requests within a reasonable timeframe, ensuring prompt action and coordination.
