## **Core Provisions**

### **Section 1: Remission on Income from Employment on Reserves or Indian Settlements**

This provision grants **tax remission** to an **Indian taxpayer** for income derived from employment where the employer resides on a reserve or Indian settlement.

#### **How it works:**
- For a given taxation year, if the taxpayer's income had **not included** a certain amount (called the "product"), the tax liability would be **lower**.
- The "product" is calculated as:
  
  > **(Income from office or employment)** ×  
  > **(Proportion of income payable to the taxpayer by the employer)**

  Where:
  - The **proportion** is the ratio of:
    - The amount payable to the taxpayer by the employer (on reserve or in an Indian settlement)
    - Divided by
    - The total amount required to be included in income for that office or employment

- **Remission is granted** for the **difference** between:
  - The tax that would have been payable **with** the income included
  - The tax that would have been payable **without** the income included

> In simpler terms: If the income from a job with a reserve-based employer is treated as taxable income, the tax paid is reduced by the amount that would have been due *if that income had not been included*.

#### **Application Period:**
- Applies to the **taxation years 1992, 1993, and 1994**
- For **1994**, a specific amendment applies:  
  > "Where the office or employment was held continuously since before 1994"  
  This ensures that long-term employment relationships are recognized and protected.

### **Section 2: Remission on Unemployment Insurance Benefits**

This provision applies to **unemployment insurance benefits** received by Indians.

#### **How it works:**
- For a taxation year, if the taxpayer’s income calculation **included** benefits under **paragraph 56(1)(a)(iv)** of the *Income Tax Act* (which are typically unemployment benefits), and:
  - A portion of the income used to determine those benefits was **exempt from tax** under **subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act**, or
  - A remission of tax was already granted for that income,
- Then a **remission of tax** is granted on the **portion of the benefit** that corresponds to that exempt or remitted income.

#### **Calculation of Remission:**
- The remission amount is:
  
  > **(Total amount of unemployment benefits)** ×  
  > **(Proportion of income from employment during a qualifying period that was exempt or remitted)**  
  Divided by  
  > **(Total income from employment during that qualifying period)**

- This means: If a portion of the income used to calculate the unemployment benefit was tax-exempt or already remitted, the tax on the benefit is reduced proportionally.

#### **Application Period:**
- Applies to **taxation years 1985 to 1991**

---

### **Section 3: General Conditions for Remission**

- Remission under **either Section 1 or 2** is **not automatic**.
- A taxpayer must **submit a written application** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
- The application must **establish the applicant’s right** to remission based on the facts and conditions outlined in the Order.

> This ensures accountability and prevents misuse of the remission provision.

---

### **Section 4: Exclusion of Certain Cases (Section 5)**

- The Order **does not apply** to situations where:
  - The income or benefit is not attributable to employment on a reserve or Indian settlement
  - The taxpayer is not an Indian
  - The employment or benefit does not meet the defined criteria (e.g., continuous employment since before 1994)

> Section 5 acts as a **limiting clause**, ensuring the remission only applies where it is justified and equitable.

---

## **Key Objectives and Rationale**

1. **Equity and Fairness**:  
   Indigenous peoples often work in environments where wages and benefits are lower due to historical and systemic disadvantages. This Order acknowledges that income from employment on reserves or in Indian settlements may be **proportionally less** than what would be expected in the broader economy, and thus, tax treatment should reflect this.

2. **Recognition of Self-Governance and Community-Based Economies**:  
   Reserves and Indian settlements operate under distinct governance structures. This remission recognizes the **unique economic realities** of Indigenous communities and supports greater financial autonomy.

3. **Tax Relief for Unemployment Benefits**:  
   Many Indigenous individuals receive unemployment benefits based on income from employment. If part of that income was already exempt or remitted, taxing the full benefit would be inequitable.

4. **Historical Justice and Redress**:  
   The Order reflects a broader policy of **reparative taxation** and addressing past inequities in how Indigenous people’s incomes are treated under federal tax laws.

## **Important Notes**

- **Scope**: Applies only to **Indians** as defined in the *Indian Act*.
- **Not a General Tax Exemption**: This is not a blanket exemption. It is a **remission of tax** based on specific income streams and calculations.
- **Time-Limited**: Applies only to specific years (1985–1994), with different rules for different years.
- **Requires Application**: Taxpayers must actively apply and prove eligibility.
- **Interpretation**: The "product" calculation is mathematically precise and designed to reflect the **proportion of income actually received** by the taxpayer from a reserve-based employer.

---

## **Conclusion**

The **Indian Income Tax Remission Order** is a targeted and principled piece of legislation designed to:

✅ Reduce tax burdens on Indigenous individuals who earn income from employers on reserves or in Indian settlements  
✅ Provide tax relief on unemployment benefits where income used to calculate the benefit was already exempt or remitted  
✅ Promote fairness and equity in the Canadian tax system by recognizing the unique socio-economic conditions of Indigenous peoples  

It reflects a shift toward **culturally sensitive and community-based tax policy**, acknowledging that Indigenous economic participation must be evaluated within the context of historical, geographic, and social realities.
