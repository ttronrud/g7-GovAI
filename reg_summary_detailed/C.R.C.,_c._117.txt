**Detailed Summary of the Sydney Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is officially titled the **Sydney Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations establish spatial and height restrictions around **Sydney Airport**, located at **Reserve Mines, County of Cape Breton, Province of Nova Scotia**, to ensure aviation safety, particularly concerning aircraft approach and take-off operations.

---

### **2. Key Definitions and Terminology**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several critical terms:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Sydney Airport** at Reserve Mines, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 171 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the end of each runway strip (i.e., the end of the runway in a given direction), at a slope of **1 foot vertically to 50 feet horizontally**. This surface ensures a clear zone for aircraft during final approach, extending **10,000 feet horizontally** from the end of the runway and rising to a horizontal line **200 feet above the end of the strip**.

- **Horizontal Surface**: An imaginary flat plane at a **constant elevation of 150 feet above the airport reference point (171 feet above sea level)**. This surface acts as a boundary beyond which structures or objects cannot exceed in height, providing a uniform limit for the surrounding area.

- **Strip**: A rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface designated for take-off and landing in a specific direction. Each strip includes the runway and its side areas. The strips are defined in **Part V of the Schedule**:
  - **Runway 01–19**: 1,200 feet wide (600 feet on each side), 6,599.8 feet long.
  - **Runway 07–25**: 1,200 feet wide (600 feet on each side), 7,669.9 feet long.
  - **Runway 14–32**: 1,000 feet wide (500 feet on each side), 6,600.5 feet long.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces. The slope is **1 foot vertically to 7 feet horizontally**. It connects the approach surface to the horizontal surface or to the transitional surface of an adjacent runway strip, ensuring smooth transitions in airspace and height limits.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:
- All **land, land under water, and waters** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.
- The **outer limits** of this area are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which includes a detailed **legal description** of the boundary using coordinate-based bearings and distances.

**Exclusions**: The regulations do **not apply** to land that has been formally incorporated into the airport’s operational or administrative boundaries.

All bearings and distances referenced in the boundary description are based on the **Nova Scotia Grid Coordinate System**, ensuring geographic accuracy.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on any land subject to these regulations,
- **If the highest point of such object exceeds** any of the following surfaces **at the location of its highest point**:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **horizontal surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

This means that all structures (including towers, trees, signs, or buildings) must remain **below or at the elevation** of these imaginary surfaces to prevent interference with aircraft during approach, take-off, or flight paths.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land **exceeds** the height of any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision allows for flexibility in managing natural features while maintaining aviation safety standards.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Restrictions**

- No owner or occupier of regulated land may **use that land for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**.

This rule is designed to **prevent bird attraction**, which can lead to bird strikes—a major aviation hazard.

---

### **7. Specific Geographic Coordinates and Boundary Description**

The boundary of the regulated area is defined in a detailed legal description, beginning at a specific point on **Highway No. 4** near the intersection with land granted to James J. Buchanan.

The full boundary description proceeds through a series of directional bearings and distances, including:
- Bearings measured from key reference points (e.g., Nova Scotia Grid Monuments 2195 and 2196),
- Distances of 4,000 feet and 10,000 feet,
- Specific directional lines (e.g., N. 74°17′ E., S. 45°14′ E., etc.),
- Intersections with roads such as **Centreville Road**, **Old Cow Bay Road**, and **New Cow Bay Road**.

Key points include:
- A specific point located **600 feet southeasterly** and **500 feet southwesterly** from runways 07–25 and 14–32, with precise coordinates (N. 16,779,209.68 ft, E. 1,368,235.16 ft), and referenced to two grid monuments.

This detailed boundary ensures precise enforcement of the zoning and height limits.

### **8. Reference to Plans and Maps**

All described surfaces (approach, horizontal, transitional) and land boundaries are **graphically illustrated** on:
- **Department of Transport Plan No. MT-0749 (A, B, C, D)**, dated **November 19, 1971**.

This plan serves as the **primary visual and legal reference** for:
- Determining the location of each surface,
- Verifying the boundaries of the regulated zone,
- Assisting in enforcement and compliance reviews.

---

### **9. Purpose and Objectives**

The overarching goals of these regulations are:
- To **ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear zones around runways and approach paths.
- To **prevent obstructions** (both man-made and natural) from interfering with aircraft during critical flight phases.
- To **protect the environment** by discouraging waste disposal that attracts birds.
- To provide **clear, enforceable, and measurable limits** for land use and development near the airport.

---

### **10. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions requiring removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions.
- The regulations are legally binding and subject to enforcement through the provincial transportation authority.
