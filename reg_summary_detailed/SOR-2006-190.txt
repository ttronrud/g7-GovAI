**Detailed Summary of the Exemption Order for Certain Licences, Authorizations and Documents (White Sturgeon)**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This **Exemption Order** is issued under the authority of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **Section 76**, which allows for temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when it is necessary to support the conservation, management, or recovery of a species at risk. The order is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**.

The regulation is based on the recognition that certain existing fishing and fishery-related activities—particularly those involving Aboriginal communities and recreational fishing—may be essential for cultural, social, or economic reasons, and that applying full protections under SARA could negatively impact these activities or hinder their continuation. Therefore, a temporary exemption is granted to allow such activities to proceed without being subject to the prohibitions or restrictions that would otherwise apply under SARA.

### **Applicable Provisions of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**

Sections **32, 33, 36, 58, 60, and 61** of SARA normally apply to activities involving wildlife species at risk. These sections typically:

- Prohibit or restrict the taking, possession, or transport of species at risk;
- Prohibit the destruction or alteration of habitat;
- Restrict the use of certain tools or methods to catch or harm fish;
- Limit recreational or commercial fishing activities.

This exemption order **excludes** these specific provisions from applying to certain licences, authorizations, and regulatory documents related to **white sturgeon**, which has been added to the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk* in Schedule 1 to SARA.

### **Scope of the Exemption**

The exemption applies for a **period of one year** from the date white sturgeon is officially added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk. The exemption is **population-specific**, meaning it applies only to certain populations of white sturgeon located in key river systems in British Columbia.

#### **1. Upper Fraser River Population of White Sturgeon**
- **Communal Fishing Licences**:  
  Exemption applies to **communal licences issued under Section 4 of the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations**. These licences allow Indigenous communities to fish salmon for food, social, and ceremonial purposes.  
  → This exemption ensures that these traditional practices continue without being restricted under SARA.

- **Recreational Fishing Regulations**:  
  Exemption applies to the **British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations, 1996** and the **Fishery (General) Regulations**, to the extent that they authorize **recreational angling activities**.  
  → Recreational fishing for white sturgeon is not subject to the prohibitions under SARA during the one-year period.

#### **2. Nechako River Population of White Sturgeon**
- Same as above:
  - Communal fishing licences (for food, social, and ceremonial purposes) are exempt.
  - Recreational angling under the Sport Fishing Regulations and Fishery (General) Regulations is exempt.

#### **3. Upper Columbia River Population of White Sturgeon**
- **Recreational Fishing**:  
  Exemption applies to recreational angling under the **British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations, 1996** and the **Fishery (General) Regulations**.

- **Authorizations to Destroy Fish (non-fishing methods)**:  
  Exemption applies to authorizations issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under **Section 32 of the Fisheries Act**, which permits the destruction of fish by means other than fishing (e.g., netting, poisoning, electrofishing).  
  → This allows for controlled, non-fishing methods of fish removal (e.g., for research or habitat management) without being considered a violation of SARA.

- **Authorizations to Disrupt or Destroy Fish Habitat**:  
  Exemption applies to authorizations issued under **subsection 35(2) of the Fisheries Act**, which permits the disruption, destruction, or harmful alteration of fish habitat.  
  → This includes activities such as construction, dredging, or land development that might otherwise be restricted under SARA.

#### **4. Kootenay River Population of White Sturgeon**
- Exemption applies to **recreational angling activities** authorized under the **British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations, 1996** and the **Fishery (General) Regulations**.

### **Key Objectives of the Exemption**

1. **Support Cultural and Traditional Practices**:  
   Protects the right of Indigenous communities to fish salmon for food, social, and ceremonial purposes—activities that are deeply rooted in cultural identity and intergenerational knowledge.

2. **Maintain Essential Fisheries Management Activities**:  
   Allows for continued use of non-fishing methods to manage fish populations or assess habitat, which may be critical for scientific monitoring or ecosystem health.

3. **Provide a Transition Period**:  
   Offers a one-year grace period during which stakeholders (including Indigenous communities, fishers, and regulators) can adapt to new conservation measures without immediate disruption.

4. **Balance Conservation and Human Use**:  
   Recognizes that strict enforcement of SARA could have unintended negative consequences on local communities and traditional practices, while still acknowledging the need to protect white sturgeon as a species at risk.

### **Duration and Effectiveness**

- The exemption is **temporary**, lasting **one year** from the date the white sturgeon is added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.
- The order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- After one year, the exemption will expire unless renewed by further legislative action or regulatory review.

---

### **Important Limitations and Conditions**

- The exemption **does not apply to all activities** involving white sturgeon. Only specific licences, authorizations, and regulations are exempted.
- The exemption **does not override other environmental or legal protections**—it only removes the specific prohibitions under SARA sections 32, 33, 36, 58, 60, and 61.
- The exemption is **population-specific**—not all white sturgeon populations are covered equally.
- The exemption does **not** apply to commercial fishing, aquaculture, or activities that fall outside the listed regulations.

### **Conclusion**

This Exemption Order represents a **pragmatic and balanced approach** to species conservation. It acknowledges the ecological importance of white sturgeon as a species at risk while recognizing the cultural, social, and economic significance of existing fishing practices and management activities. By providing a one-year exemption from key prohibitions in SARA, the government enables a transition period during which conservation strategies can be refined and implemented without undermining the rights and practices of Indigenous communities or the viability of recreational fishing.

It underscores the principle of **co-management**, where conservation goals are pursued in partnership with traditional users and stakeholders, ensuring both biodiversity protection and community well-being.
