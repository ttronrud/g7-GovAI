**Detailed Summary of the Disclosure on Account Opening by Telephone Request (Retail Associations) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background**

These regulations were made under the authority of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (the "Act") by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. They are specifically designed to ensure that customers of **retail cooperative credit associations** receive **clear, timely, and standardized oral disclosures** when opening a deposit account over the telephone.

The regulations are rooted in specific sections of the Act:
- **Section 385.09a** – Provides the legal basis for disclosure requirements.
- **Subsection 385.1(6)a** – Authorizes the use of oral disclosure as a method of providing key account information.
- **Sections 385.28a and 463b** – Reinforce disclosure obligations and procedural standards for account opening.

These regulations came into force upon registration and are codified under:
- S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 313 and s. 339  
- S.C. 1991, c. 48

### **Key Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **protect consumers** by ensuring that individuals who open deposit accounts over the phone receive **essential financial information in an understandable and transparent manner**, while also providing **a clear path for accountability and customer rights**.

The regulations apply specifically to **retail cooperative credit associations** — cooperatives that offer retail deposit accounts (such as savings accounts, chequing accounts, and interest-bearing accounts) to individual consumers.

### **Mandatory Oral Disclosures (Under Subsection 385.1(3) of the Act)**

When a customer opens a deposit account over the telephone, the retail association must provide the following information **orally** — in a clear and comprehensible way:

#### 1. **Partial Disclosure Over Phone**
- The customer must be informed that **only part of the full information** about deposit account charges and terms is being provided over the phone.
- The **complete written disclosure** will be sent to the customer within **seven business days** after the account is opened.

> *Rationale:* Ensures that customers are not overwhelmed by detailed financial terms during a phone call and are given time to receive a comprehensive written document.

#### 2. **Right to Close Account Without Charge**
- The customer has the right to **close the account within 14 business days** of opening.
- If the account is closed within this period, the customer is **entitled to a full refund** of any **charges related to account operation**, **excluding interest charges**.

> *Example:* If a customer pays a monthly service fee or transaction fee, they can get a refund if they close the account within 14 days — but not for interest earned.

> *Rationale:* Empowers customers with flexibility and protects them from being locked into long-term fees.

#### 3. **Interest Rate Information (Fixed-Rate Accounts)**
- For **fixed-rate interest-bearing accounts**:
  - The **current interest rate** must be disclosed.
  - The **method of calculating interest** (e.g., simple interest, compound interest, frequency of compounding) must be explained.

> *Example:* “Your account earns 2.5% per year, compounded monthly.”

#### 4. **Interest Rate Information (Variable-Rate Accounts)**
- For **variable-rate interest-bearing accounts**:
  - The **current interest rate** must be disclosed.
  - The **method of calculating interest** must be explained.
  - The customer must be informed **how they can obtain future interest rate updates** (e.g., via mail, website, or phone call).

> *Rationale:* Ensures transparency about potential rate fluctuations and allows customers to stay informed about future changes.

#### 5. **Currency-Specific Disclosure**
- For accounts in a **currency other than Canadian dollars**:
  - The customer must be clearly informed that **deposits in that currency are NOT insured** by the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**.

> *Rationale:* Prevents misleading assumptions about deposit protection and ensures customers understand risk exposure.

#### 6. **Charges for Accounts Without a Fixed Monthly Service Package**
- For accounts that do **not charge a fixed monthly fee**:
  - The customer must be informed of the following charges:
    - Monthly statement of account
    - Passbook updates
    - Cash withdrawals
    - Cheque withdrawals
    - Debit payment purchases
    - Preauthorized debits
    - Bill payments
    - Transfers between accounts
    - If cheques are offered at account opening: **cheque orders**

> *Rationale:* Ensures customers know exactly what fees they will incur for standard account services.

#### 7. **Charges for Accounts With a Fixed Monthly Service Package**
- For accounts that **do have a fixed monthly service charge**:
  - The customer must be informed of:
    - The **principal features** of the service package, including:
      - The **monthly charge**
      - The **number and types of permitted transactions per billing cycle**
    - The **charges for additional transactions** (as specified in paragraph (f))

> *Example:* “Your package includes 10 free transactions per month. Any transaction beyond that will incur a $1.00 fee.”

> *Note:* Retail associations may **group similar transactions** under a **generic term** (e.g., “all electronic transfers”) if they charge the same amount for each type.

> *Rationale:* Simplifies communication and avoids excessive detail while maintaining transparency.

### **Procedural Rule for Mail-Based Disclosure (Under Subsection 385.1(4))**

If a retail association sends the **agreement and information** (required under subsection 385.1(1)) to a customer by **mail**, then:

- The customer is **deemed to have received** the information on the **fifth day after the postmark date** on the envelope.

> *Rationale:* Establishes a clear and consistent timeline for when the customer is considered to have received the written disclosure, even if the mail takes longer to arrive.

This helps ensure **legal compliance** and provides a defined point in time for the customer to review the full terms of the account.

### **Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** with the federal government.
