**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Canada Business Ontario to the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario)

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act"), which allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign functions, departments, or agencies within the federal public service.

**Effective Date:**  
June 6, 2013

**Transfer Details:**  
- The **control and supervision** of the portion of the federal public administration within the **Department of Industry** known as **Canada Business Ontario (CBO)** is being transferred.  
- This transfer is not a dissolution or restructuring of CBO itself, but rather a shift in **who has oversight and administrative authority** over CBO’s operations.  
- The receiving entity is the **Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario)**.

**Background Context:**  
- **Canada Business Ontario (CBO)** was established in 1999 as a federal agency within the Department of Industry to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ontario by providing business development services, training, financing, and market access programs.  
- **FedDev Ontario** is a federal agency established in 1995 to promote economic development in southern Ontario by supporting innovation, entrepreneurship, and regional growth. It operates through a mix of government funding and private-sector partnerships.

**Purpose of the Transfer:**  
The transfer aims to:
- Improve coordination between economic development initiatives at the federal and regional levels.
- Align business support services with regional economic development priorities in southern Ontario.
- Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of SME support by placing CBO under an agency with broader regional development responsibilities and existing infrastructure.

**Legal Basis and Citation:**  
- The regulation is cited as **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**, which is a section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22* (the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act).  
- It is also referenced under the *Regulations of the Canada Revenue Agency and other federal departments*, specifically in the *Regulations of the Public Service*, Chapter P-34 (R.S., c. P-34), which governs the structure and operations of federal public service agencies.

**Key Implications:**
1. **Administrative Oversight Change:** FedDev Ontario now assumes responsibility for managing CBO’s operations, staffing, budget, and program delivery.
2. **Continuity of Services:** Business services for SMEs in Ontario are expected to remain uninterrupted; the transfer is intended to improve service delivery rather than disrupt it.
3. **Policy Integration:** CBO’s programs will now be more integrated into FedDev Ontario’s broader regional economic development strategy, potentially leading to better alignment with provincial and local economic priorities.
4. **Funding and Accountability:** Financial accountability and reporting will now fall under FedDev Ontario’s mandate, which may affect how performance is monitored and evaluated.

**Note on the Law:**  
The Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act allows for such transfers without requiring a new legislative act, as long as the change is justified and approved by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. This streamlines administrative changes in the federal public service.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a strategic reorganization of federal economic development responsibilities in southern Ontario. By transferring the control and supervision of Canada Business Ontario to FedDev Ontario, the government aims to strengthen regional economic development efforts, improve service delivery to SMEs, and promote more coordinated federal support for Ontario’s business ecosystem. The change reflects a broader trend of integrating federal business support functions with regional economic development agencies to enhance responsiveness and effectiveness.

*Note: While the regulation is dated 2003, the transfer of control to FedDev Ontario took effect in 2013, indicating that the legal framework was in place and activated years later as part of a policy initiative.*
