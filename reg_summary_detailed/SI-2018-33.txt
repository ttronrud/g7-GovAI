**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, transfers from the **Department of Health** to the **Department of Indigenous Services Canada** the control and supervision of that portion of the federal public administration in the Department of Health known as the **First Nations and Inuit Health Internal Services Unit (FN-IHISU)**, effective **April 1, 2018**.

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the Government of Canada to reorganize public service structures by transferring responsibilities, functions, or units between departments, provided that such transfers are made in accordance with established legislative and administrative procedures.

The specific statutory reference is:
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** (Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22, Section 207)
- **R.S., c. P-34** (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter P-34 – Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)

**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

1. **Unit Transferred:**  
   The **First Nations and Inuit Health Internal Services Unit (FN-IHISU)** — a unit within the Department of Health responsible for providing health-related administrative, operational, and programmatic support to First Nations and Inuit communities.

2. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer involves the **control and supervision** of the unit. This means that:
   - The unit’s management, staffing, budgetary oversight, and day-to-day operations are now under the authority of the Department of Indigenous Services Canada (DISC).
   - The unit will no longer report to the Department of Health in terms of administrative leadership or policy direction.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2018**. This date marks the formal transition of responsibilities and administrative authority from the Department of Health to the Department of Indigenous Services Canada.

4. **Purpose and Rationale:**  
   The realignment reflects a broader government strategy to:
   - Improve the delivery of health services to Indigenous peoples by placing health-related administrative functions under a department with direct responsibility for Indigenous affairs.
   - Enhance coordination between health delivery and Indigenous self-determination, cultural relevance, and community-based approaches.
   - Strengthen accountability and responsiveness to the unique health needs of First Nations and Inuit populations.

5. **Implications:**
   - The **Department of Indigenous Services Canada** assumes full responsibility for the unit’s strategic direction, human resources, and operational planning.
   - The **Department of Health** retains its role in health policy and clinical services, but the administrative oversight of First Nations and Inuit health internal services is now centralized under DISC.
   - This transfer supports the government’s commitment to advancing Indigenous health equity and integrating health services within a broader framework of Indigenous rights and self-governance.

6. **Legal and Procedural Context:**  
   The transfer was made through formal executive action (Governor General in Council), based on the Prime Minister’s recommendation, and is consistent with the legislative framework provided in the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This ensures that such reorganizations are transparent, accountable, and aligned with public service governance standards.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization aimed at improving the effectiveness and cultural appropriateness of health services for First Nations and Inuit peoples. By transferring the internal services unit to the Department of Indigenous Services Canada, the federal government reinforces a more integrated, respectful, and community-centered approach to Indigenous health care delivery. The change underscores a shift from siloed health administration to a more holistic, rights-based model of service provision.

**Note:**  
While the unit’s operational functions (e.g., funding, program delivery) may remain largely unchanged, the shift in administrative control ensures that health services are now aligned with the broader mandate of the Department of Indigenous Services Canada to advance the well-being, health, and self-determination of Indigenous peoples.
