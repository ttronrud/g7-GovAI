**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Remission Order in Respect of Fees Paid by Certain Foreign Nationals for the Processing of Applications for Temporary Resident Permits, Work Permits and Restorations of Temporary Resident Status*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11), which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Treasury Board) to make fee remission orders when it is in the public interest.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of this remission order is to **relieve certain foreign nationals from paying fees** associated with the processing of specific immigration applications — namely, applications for:
- Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs),
- Work Permits, and
- Restorations of Temporary Resident Status —  
**under specific, narrowly defined circumstances**.

The remission applies only to individuals who were previously denied applications due to concerns about the nature of their distance learning coursework, and who subsequently faced further denials related to those same applications, all within a defined time period.

### **Who Is Eligible for Fee Remission?**

A foreign national is eligible for a full remission of the fees paid under the following sections of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR):

1. **Subsection 298(1)** – for an application for a **Temporary Resident Permit (TRP)** issued under subsection 24(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* (IRPA);
2. **Subsection 299(1)** – for a **work permit** referred to in paragraph 208(b) of the IRPR;
3. **Subsection 306(1)** – for the **restoration of temporary resident status** under section 182 of the IRPA.

**Eligibility Conditions (All Must Be Met):**

The individual must satisfy **all three conditions** below:

---

#### **Condition 1: Prior Refusal of a Work Permit Based on Distance Learning Misrepresentation**

- The foreign national applied for a **work permit under subparagraph 205(c)(ii)** of the IRPR.
- This application was **refused between September 1, 2014, and March 15, 2016**.
- The refusal was based on the determination that **"most of their coursework was completed via distance learning"**, **without considering the full scope of their program of study**, including any **transfer credits** or other academic components that may have been valid or relevant.

> **Key Point:** This condition identifies a procedural error — the refusal was made without a comprehensive review of the applicant’s full academic record. The regulation recognizes that such a refusal may have been unjust or flawed, especially if the applicant had completed substantial or valid coursework through distance education.

---

#### **Condition 2: Refusal of a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) During a Specific Period**

- The foreign national applied for a **Temporary Resident Permit (TRP)**.
- This application was **refused during the period that began on the day the work permit application under Condition 1 was refused** and **ended on September 27, 2016**.

> **Key Point:** The TRP denial is directly linked to the earlier work permit refusal. The denial must occur **after** the initial work permit refusal and **before or on September 27, 2016**. This establishes a temporal connection between the two denials.

---

#### **Condition 3: Joint Application for Work Permit or Status Restoration**

- If the foreign national applied for:
  - A **work permit under paragraph (1)(b)** (i.e., a work permit under section 208(b) of the IRPR), or
  - A **restoration of temporary resident status under paragraph (1)(c)** (i.e., under section 182 of the IRPA),
- Then that application must have been **made at the same time as the TRP application** (i.e., in conjunction with it).
- And that application must have been **refused on or before September 27, 2016**.

> **Key Point:** This condition ensures that the applicant did not pursue a separate, independent application for a work permit or status restoration after the TRP denial. It emphasizes that the denial chain is part of a single, coordinated application process.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**

- The remission applies to **fees paid** for the processing of the above-mentioned applications.
- The fees are those specifically referenced in:
  - Subsection 298(1) – TRP application,
  - Subsection 299(1) – work permit application,
  - Subsection 306(1) – restoration of temporary resident status.
- The remission is **not retroactive beyond the specified time frame** (i.e., the period from September 1, 2014, to September 27, 2016).
- It is **not a waiver of the application denials** — the applications were still refused, but the **fees associated with them are forgiven**.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor in Council determines that it is in the **public interest** to provide this remission because:

- The initial work permit refusal was based on a **misapplication of criteria**, failing to consider the full academic context.
- The subsequent denials of the TRP and/or status restoration were **directly linked** to the flawed initial decision.
- The applicants were likely **disadvantaged** by these denials, especially given the time and financial burden of processing such applications.
- The remission serves as a form of **corrective justice**, acknowledging procedural errors and providing relief to individuals who were unfairly impacted.

---

### **Key Implications and Considerations**

1. **Limited in Scope**:  
   This remission applies only to a specific group of applicants who meet all three conditions. It does not extend to other work permit denials, general immigration processing fees, or applications outside the defined timeframe.

2. **No Automatic Reinstatement**:  
   The remission does not result in the reinstatement of the denied applications. It only **remits the processing fees** — the applications remain denied.

3. **Time-Sensitive**:  
   The eligibility window is strictly bounded by:
   - Work permit refusal: September 1, 2014 – March 15, 2016
   - TRP or status restoration denial: From the day of the work permit refusal until September 27, 2016

4. **Procedural Fairness Focus**:  
   The regulation reflects a policy of **procedural fairness** and **error correction**, recognizing that immigration decisions must be made with a full understanding of an applicant’s educational background.

5. **Administrative Efficiency**:  
   By remitting fees, the government reduces administrative and financial burdens on applicants who were denied due to errors in assessment.

### **Conclusion**

This remission order is a targeted, corrective measure designed to **acknowledge and remedy procedural flaws** in past immigration decisions — specifically, the failure to consider transfer credits and full academic records when assessing distance learning coursework. It provides **fee relief** to a defined group of foreign nationals who were denied work permits and related status applications due to such errors, and whose denials occurred within a specific timeframe.

It underscores the importance of fair and comprehensive evaluation in immigration processing and demonstrates the government’s willingness to correct past administrative mistakes when they are identified as unjust or flawed.

**Note:** This regulation is a non-binding administrative order under the Financial Administration Act and is not a change to the substantive immigration rules. It only affects the **financial obligation** of the applicant, not the legal status or outcome of the applications.
