**Detailed Summary of the Prescribed Entities and Classes of Mortgages and Hypothecs Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Prescribed Entities and Classes of Mortgages and Hypothecs Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **subsection 10(3)a of the Interest Act**. This regulatory instrument serves to define specific types of entities and classes of secured interests (mortgages and hypothecs) that are subject to particular interest rate limitations under the Interest Act.

The regulation is formally referenced as:  
- **S.C. 2008, c. 28, s. 155** (Statutory Citation)  
- **R.S., c. I-15** (Revised Statutes, Chapter I-15)

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to implement **paragraph 10(2)(b)** of the *Interest Act*, which establishes a framework for limiting the interest rates that can be charged on certain types of loans or credit arrangements involving specific entities and secured interests. By prescribing which entities and types of mortgages or hypothecs are subject to these interest rate caps, the regulation ensures that interest rates remain fair and reasonable, particularly in commercial and business lending contexts.

**Prescribed Entities**  
Under paragraph 10(2)(b) of the Interest Act, the following types of entities are explicitly designated as "prescribed" and thus fall within the scope of interest rate restrictions:

1. **Partnerships**  
   - All partnerships, regardless of form or structure, are included.  
   - This includes general partnerships, limited partnerships, and any other partnership arrangements recognized under provincial or federal law.

2. **Trusts settled for business or commercial purposes**  
   - Trusts established primarily for the purpose of conducting business (e.g., holding assets to generate income, managing commercial operations) are considered prescribed.  
   - Trusts created for personal, family, or non-commercial purposes are not included.

3. **Unlimited Liability Corporations (ULCs)**  
   - Defined under the *Business Corporations Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. B-9*.  
   - ULCs are corporations that do not have limited liability; owners (shareholders) are personally liable for all corporate debts.  
   - These entities are included because of their high risk profile and potential for significant financial exposure.

4. **Unlimited Liability Companies (ULCs)**  
   - Defined under the *Business Corporations Act, S.B.C. 2002, c. 57* (a provincial statute in certain jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan).  
   - These are similar to ULCs in structure and liability, with no separation between the company and its owners.

5. **Unlimited Companies**  
   - Defined under the *Companies Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 81* (a jurisdiction-specific statute, typically applicable in Newfoundland and Labrador).  
   - These are companies where shareholders have unlimited liability, and thus are subject to the same interest rate restrictions as other prescribed entities.

> **Note**: The inclusion of these entities reflects a policy intent to protect borrowers who may be exposed to greater financial risk due to unlimited liability, thereby ensuring that interest rates charged on loans to such entities do not exceed the legally defined caps.

**Prescribed Class of Mortgages and Hypothecs**  
The regulation defines a specific class of secured interests (mortgages and hypothecs) that are subject to the interest rate limitations:

- **Mortgages and hypothecs issued on or after January 1, 2012**  
  - This means that any mortgage or hypothec created, registered, or executed on or after this date — whether for personal, commercial, or business purposes — that is secured by property (real or personal) and involves one of the prescribed entities above, is governed by the interest rate restrictions in the Interest Act.

> **Important**: Mortgages or hypothecs issued *before* January 1, 2012, are *not* included in this prescribed class and are therefore not subject to the new interest rate rules under this regulation.

---

**Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **January 1, 2012**.  
This date marks the beginning of the application of the interest rate caps for loans involving prescribed entities and mortgages/hypothecs issued on or after that date.

**Key Implications and Policy Rationale**  
- **Consumer and Borrower Protection**: The regulation aims to prevent predatory lending practices by capping interest rates on loans to high-risk entities (e.g., those with unlimited liability), where borrowers may have less ability to absorb financial shocks.
- **Clarity and Predictability**: By clearly defining which entities and types of loans are subject to interest rate limits, the regulation provides legal certainty for lenders, borrowers, and regulators.
- **Jurisdictional Specificity**: The regulation references specific provincial statutes (e.g., Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador), indicating that it is tailored to apply in those jurisdictions where such entities exist under those laws.
- **Alignment with Interest Act Provisions**: This regulation operationalizes the abstract language of paragraph 10(2)(b) by providing concrete examples and definitions, enabling enforcement and compliance.

**Conclusion**  
The *Prescribed Entities and Classes of Mortgages and Hypothecs Regulations* are a critical component of the Interest Act’s framework for protecting borrowers from excessive interest charges. By identifying partnerships, commercial trusts, and unlimited liability entities as "prescribed," and by limiting interest rate applications to mortgages and hypothecs issued on or after January 1, 2012, the regulation ensures that financial transactions involving high-risk borrowers are subject to transparent, fair, and legally enforceable interest rate caps. These rules remain in effect as of the date of this summary and continue to serve as a key tool in financial regulation and consumer protection in Canada.
