**Detailed Summary of the Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 94)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations were issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Sections 5.4 and 5.5**. 

- On **March 17 and 24, 1990**, a proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I**, providing formal notice to the public.
- Simultaneously, the proposal was published in two issues of **The Times-Transcript** (local newspaper) and **L’Acadie Nouvelle** (French-language newspaper), ensuring broad public access and opportunity for stakeholder input.
- This process allowed interested parties—including residents, developers, aviation stakeholders, and environmental groups—a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the **Minister of Transport**.

Based on this public consultation and the recommendation of the Minister, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** formally **revoked the previous Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 94)** and **issued the current set of regulations** as a replacement.

These new regulations are now officially known as the **Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations**.

### **Key Definitions in the Regulations**

The regulations define several key technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Moncton Airport located in the Parish of Moncton, County of Westmorland, Province of New Brunswick. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a datum for measuring distances and elevations. It is located 655 meters north along the centerline of runway 02–20 from its southern end, then 183 meters east at right angles. Its coordinates are **N 758,513.10 m and E 440,478.38 m** in the New Brunswick Double Stereographic Grid. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for approaches). The slope is defined by a vertical rise of 1 meter per 50 meters horizontally, except for runways 02 and 20, which have a steeper slope of 1:30 (1 meter per 30 meters). Each surface rises to a horizontal line 15,000 meters away from the end of the strip (for runways 06, 24, 11, 29), or intersects with the outer surface (for runways 02 and 20). The top of the surface is 300 meters above the strip’s end elevation (for most), or at the intersection with the outer surface (for 02/20). |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the airport reference point**. However, if this elevation would be less than 9 meters above ground level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent excessive height restrictions in low-lying areas. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area of the airport, including the runway and its immediate sides. The strips are defined by their length and width: |
| - Runway 06–24 | 300 m wide (150 m on each side), 1,995.0 m long |
| - Runway 11–29 | 300 m wide (150 m on each side), 2,559.0 m long |
| - Runway 02–20 | 90 m wide (45 m on each side), 1,239.0 m long |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1:7** (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. It extends upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent runway. |

### **Geographic Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to all lands:

1. **Within the outer limits** of the lands described in **Part VI of the schedule** (i.e., within a circular boundary).
2. **Directly under any portion of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limits.

> The **boundary of the outer limits** is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This creates a large, protected zone around the airport, extending 4 kilometers in all directions from the ARP, where development is strictly regulated.

---

### **Prohibited Development and Construction**

No person may:

1. **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures) such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds:
   - The **approach surface**,
   - The **outer surface**, or
   - The **transitional surface**.

> This restriction ensures that no obstruction (such as towers, trees, or buildings) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

2. **Permit land use or development** that would interfere with:
   - Aircraft **radio signals**, **communications**, or **navigation systems**,
   - Any **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, control towers, lighting).

> This is critical for maintaining safe and reliable air traffic operations.

3. **Allow disposal of waste** that is:
   - **Edible** or
   - **Attractive to birds**

> This provision prevents the creation of bird hazards, which can lead to bird strikes—a major aviation safety risk.

---

### **Management of Natural Growth**

If any **natural object** (e.g., trees, shrubs, or vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the height of:
- The approach surface,
- The outer surface, or
- The transitional surface,

Then the **Minister of Transport** may issue a directive requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This ensures that natural features do not become obstacles to aircraft operations.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To **protect critical aeronautical infrastructure** from interference by buildings, structures, or environmental hazards.
- To **preserve clear airspace and visual corridors** around the airport.
- To **prevent bird-related hazards** by restricting the placement of food or waste that attracts birds.
- To provide **clear, measurable boundaries** using defined geometric surfaces (approach, transitional, outer) and a central reference point (ARP).

---

### **Regulatory Basis and Enforcement**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**, who has the authority to:
  - Issue directives for removal of excessive natural growth,
  - Require compliance with height and land-use restrictions.
- Violations may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Minister or relevant authorities.

### **Maps and Reference Documents**

All surfaces and boundaries are referenced to **Moncton Airport Zoning Plans**, dated **March 12, 1988**, with plan numbers ranging from **S-2021-0 to S-2021-12**, including:
- S-2021-3, S-2021-4, S-2021-9, S-2021-10 (for strips and ARP),
- S-2021-0, S-2021-2 to S-2021-5 and S-2021-8 to S-2021-11 (for approach and outer surfaces).

These plans serve as official technical documentation for the regulation’s spatial implementation.

### **Conclusion**

The **Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use and development in the vicinity of Moncton Airport. By defining precise elevation limits, geometric boundaries, and prohibited activities, the regulations prioritize **aviation safety**, **operational efficiency**, and **environmental protection**. The inclusion of public notice and consultation mechanisms reflects a transparent and democratic regulatory process.

These regulations remain a key component of Canada’s national aviation safety infrastructure, ensuring that Moncton Airport operates safely and efficiently within its surrounding environment.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Moncton Airport Zoning Regulations (1990) establish strict height and land-use restrictions around Moncton Airport to ensure aviation safety by preventing obstructions to aircraft, protecting aeronautical communications, and minimizing bird hazards, all based on defined geometric surfaces anchored to a central reference point.
