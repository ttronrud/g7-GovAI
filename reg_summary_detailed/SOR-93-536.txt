**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Amendment to Schedule I.1 of the Financial Administration Act — Replacement of "Secretary of State of Canada" with "Minister of Communications" for Specific Federal Institutions

**Effective Date:**  
1992 (original enactment), effective under the authority of the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Authority:**  
The amendment is made pursuant to **subsection 3(1.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA). This provision allows for the modification of administrative schedules in the Act, particularly those relating to the designation of responsible officials or departments for financial and administrative purposes.

**Scope of the Amendment:**  
The regulation amends **Schedule I.1** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which typically outlines the designated officials or departments responsible for receiving and managing financial transactions or administrative duties on behalf of various federal institutions.

Specifically, the amendment:
- **Strikes out** the reference to the **Secretary of State of Canada** in **Column II** of Schedule I.1.
- **Substitutes** that reference with a reference to the **Minister of Communications**.
- This change applies **only** to the following three institutions listed in **Column I**:
  1. The **National Archives of Canada**
  2. The **National Film Board of Canada**
  3. The **National Library of Canada**

**Purpose and Implication:**  
This amendment reflects a shift in government organizational structure and responsibility. The Secretary of State of Canada, historically a key figure in federal administration, was no longer the designated official responsible for financial or administrative oversight of these institutions. Instead, the **Minister of Communications** was assigned that responsibility.

This change likely occurred as part of broader government reorganizations during the 1990s, particularly in the restructuring of federal departments. The National Film Board and the National Library, both cultural institutions, were under the jurisdiction of the Department of Communications at the time. By assigning financial accountability to the Minister of Communications, the government ensured that these institutions' financial management and administrative functions were aligned with the department responsible for their operational oversight.

**Legal Citation and Publication:**  
- **Statutory Citation:** S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 70(2)  
  (This refers to the enactment of the *Financial Administration Act* as amended in 1992, section 70(2).)  
- **Gazette Publication:** SI/93-104, 1993 Canada Gazette, Part II, page 3196  
  (This is the official notice of the amendment published in the Canada Gazette, the official journal of the Government of Canada, confirming the change to the public record.)  

**Repeal Status:**  
- **Repealed by SI/2015-112**  
  The regulation was formally repealed on **April 1, 2015**, under the *Statutory Instrument 2015-112*.  
  This indicates that the amendment is no longer in force and that the original designation (e.g., Secretary of State of Canada) or a new designation has since been implemented through subsequent legislative or administrative changes.

**Contextual Background:**  
- The *Financial Administration Act* governs how federal government funds are administered, including the assignment of financial responsibilities to specific officials or departments.
- The shift from the Secretary of State to the Minister of Communications reflects a reorganization of federal departments during the 1990s, where the responsibilities of cultural and communications institutions were consolidated under the Department of Communications.
- The repeal in 2015 suggests that further reorganizations have occurred, likely due to the merging or restructuring of departments (e.g., the Department of Communications was later dissolved or rebranded, and responsibilities were redistributed under new departments such as the Department of Canadian Heritage or the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada).

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a temporary administrative adjustment in the financial governance structure of three key Canadian cultural institutions. It formally transferred financial accountability from the Secretary of State to the Minister of Communications in 1992, reflecting departmental realignment. However, the provision was ultimately repealed in 2015, indicating that current financial oversight responsibilities have since been reassigned under a different governmental structure.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- The amendment updated financial accountability designations in the *Financial Administration Act*.  
- It reflects a shift in departmental responsibility during the 1990s.  
- The change is now obsolete due to subsequent departmental reorganizations.  
- It serves as an example of how government administrative structures evolve over time through statutory amendments and later repeals.
