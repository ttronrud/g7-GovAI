**Detailed Summary of the Conversion from Analog to Digital Television Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

The *Conversion from Analog to Digital Television Regulations* were enacted by the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** under the authority of **subsection 10(1)** of the *Broadcasting Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 11). These regulations were developed following a formal proposal published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 18, 2010**, which provided licensees and the public with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments and representations.

The CRTC finalized and adopted the regulations on **March 4, 2011**, and they came into force on **April 1, 2011**.

This regulatory framework is part of Canada’s broader national transition from **analog to digital television broadcasting**, aimed at improving broadcast efficiency, enabling higher-quality video and audio, and freeing up spectrum for other uses (such as mobile broadband).

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **every licensee** who meets **any one of the following criteria**:

1. Operates in a market with a population of **300,000 or more**.
2. Operates in a market that includes the **national capital (Ottawa)** or a **provincial capital**.
3. Operates in a market served by **more than one television station**.
4. Broadcasts programming on **channels 52 to 69** in any market.

These thresholds ensure that the regulations target major markets and stations with significant audiences or technical complexity, where public awareness and preparedness are most critical during the transition.

### **Public Service Announcements (PSAs): Key Requirements**

All applicable licensees are required to broadcast **public service announcements (PSAs)** to inform viewers about the analog-to-digital transition. The obligations are phased and structured as follows:

#### **1. Start Date and Frequency**
- **Beginning May 1, 2011**, licensees must broadcast PSAs **at least six times per broadcast day**.
- This increases to **eight times per broadcast day** on:
  - **August 1, 2011**, or
  - **One month before** the licensee ceases analog broadcasting or changes channel (whichever occurs earlier).

> *Note: The obligation ends when the licensee completes the conversion and shuts off their analog transmitter.*

#### **2. Timing Requirements**
- At least **25% of the required PSAs** must be aired between **7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.**, a time when viewers are most likely to be watching television.

#### **3. Content and Format Requirements**
Each PSA must:
- Be **at least 30 consecutive seconds long**.
- Include the **information specified in the schedule** (as outlined in the regulation).
- Be **closed captioned** and include **audio description of on-screen information** (to ensure accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers).

#### **4. Use of Crawl (Exception)**
- A licensee may use a **text crawl** (a scrolling message displayed during programming) to fulfill **up to 25%** of their PSA obligations.
- **Crawls are prohibited** during programming that contains:
  - Audio description of on-screen information.
  - Described video content.

> This ensures that viewers with disabilities receive clear, accessible information during the transition.

### **Website Posting Obligations**

In addition to broadcasting PSAs, licensees must **post and maintain** the following information on their official websites:

1. **Information regarding the conversion process** (as per the schedule).
2. **Step-by-step instructions** for over-the-air viewers to continue receiving the station’s programming after the transition.
3. The **channel number** on which the station will broadcast after conversion.
4. The **date and time** when the station will cease analog broadcasting (as soon as known).
5. The **date and time** when the station will begin (or began) broadcasting on the new digital channel (as soon as known).
6. If applicable, a description of **discrete geographic areas** where viewers may experience **loss of service** due to signal changes.

> These posts must be **updated promptly** as new information becomes available.

### **Content of Public Service Announcements**

Each PSA must contain the following **mandatory elements**:

1. A statement that the **Canadian television system is transitioning from analog to digital broadcasting**.
2. (If applicable) A statement that **some viewers may lose service** after the transition.
3. A statement that **only viewers receiving the signal directly over the air** are affected by the change.
4. A statement that **over-the-air viewers must take action** to continue receiving the signal and a **link to where further information can be found**.

### **Purpose and Impact**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **inform the public** about the analog-to-digital transition in a clear, accessible, and timely manner.
- To **protect over-the-air viewers**, especially those in rural or underserved areas, from unexpected loss of service.
- To **promote public understanding** of the technical changes and steps needed to continue receiving television signals.
- To ensure **accessibility** through closed captioning and audio description, supporting inclusivity for people with disabilities.
- To provide **transparency and accountability** by requiring both broadcast and online disclosures.

### **Exemptions**

- The regulations do **not apply** to licensees whose conditions of license provide for different requirements.
- The obligation to broadcast PSAs and post information **ceases** when the licensee fully converts to digital broadcasting and shuts down their analog transmitter.

### **Conclusion**

The *Conversion from Analog to Digital Television Regulations* represent a well-structured, public-interest approach to managing Canada’s transition from analog to digital television. By mandating timely, accessible, and comprehensive public communication, the CRTC ensured that viewers—especially those in vulnerable or remote areas—were adequately informed and empowered to adapt to the changes. The regulations balance technical requirements with public service values, emphasizing accessibility, clarity, and accountability throughout the transition process.

These rules were a critical component in Canada’s successful national shift to digital broadcasting, which was completed by **2011**, with all analog signals officially turned off by the end of that year.
