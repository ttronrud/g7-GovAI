**Detailed Summary of the Canada Communication Group Divestiture Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Canada Communication Group Divestiture Regulations** were enacted by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under two key provisions of federal legislation:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**: This grants the Treasury Board the authority to make regulations governing the treatment of public service employees during divestitures involving public assets.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**: This empowers the Treasury Board to issue regulations related to the management and transfer of public sector assets, including superannuation and employment arrangements.

These regulations specifically address the **transfer of the Canada Communication Group (CCG)** from the federal government to a private entity — St. Joseph Corporation — and establish transitional rules for employees affected by this divestiture.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **ensure continuity and fairness in the superannuation rights and employment status of public service employees** who transition from the federal public service to a new employer (St. Joseph Corporation) as part of the sale of the Canada Communication Group.

They define how:
- Employee status changes,
- Superannuation benefits are preserved or adjusted,
- Pensionable service is calculated,
- Death benefits and family allowances are applied,
- Options under the Public Service Superannuation Act are preserved or extended,
- And the legal "transfer date" is defined.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), which governs pension and superannuation rights for public servants. |
| **New Employer** | St. Joseph Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of St. Joseph Corporation, which will assume the operations of the Canada Communication Group after the transfer. |
| **Sales Agreement** | The formal agreement dated December 13, 1996, between Her Majesty in Right of Canada (represented by the Minister of Public Works and Government Services) and St. Joseph Corporation for the sale of the Canada Communication Group. |
| **Transfer Date** | The date on which an employee who has accepted an offer of employment from St. Joseph Corporation ceases to be employed in the public service and begins employment with the new employer. |

---

### **4. Scope and Application**

#### **Who Are the Regulations Applied To?**
- Employees who:
  - Were employed in the public service,
  - Accepted an offer of employment from St. Joseph Corporation under the sales agreement,
  - Cease to be employed in the public service on the **transfer date**,
  - And **become employed by the new employer (St. Joseph Corporation)**.

#### **Exclusions**
- The regulations **do not apply** to employees who:
  - **Subsequently re-employ** with the new employer after leaving.

> This means that once an employee returns to work with St. Joseph Corporation, they are no longer covered by these transitional rules.

---

### **5. Application of Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 of the Public Service Superannuation Act**

These sections govern:
- **Section 12**: Options to retire early or defer pension benefits.
- **Section 13**: Death benefits and survivor benefits.
- **Section 13.01**: Special provisions for certain categories of employees (e.g., those with dependents).

> These sections apply **only to a person on and after the date they cease to be employed by the new employer**.

This means that the rules governing pension options and survivor benefits **start from the moment the employee leaves the new employer**, not from when they left the public service.

---

### **6. Special Provisions for Exercise of Pension Options**

Despite the general rule that these regulations limit the application of certain pension options, **an exception exists**:

#### **Eligible Employees Can Exercise Options Earlier**

If an employee would have been eligible (but was not) to exercise a pension option under:
- **Section 12** (early retirement or pension deferral),
- **Paragraph 13(7)(a) or (b)** (death benefit or survivorship options),
- **Section 13.01** (special survivor benefits),

then **they may exercise that option**, even if the normal timeline would have otherwise prevented it.

#### **Deadline for Exercise**
- For **paragraphs 13(7)(a) and (b)**: Must be exercised **by June 20, 1998**.
- For **Section 12 and Section 13.01**: Must be exercised **by December 1, 1998**.

> This provides a **clear, fixed deadline** to ensure that employees do not lose their right to these benefits due to the timing of the transfer.

#### **Consequence of Exercising the Option**
- Once an employee exercises such an option, they are **deemed not to have become employed by the new employer** for the purposes of:
  - These regulations,
  - Sections 83 to 99 of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations* (which govern pension and superannuation administration),
- And they **cannot** later claim the same option under subsection (1) when they leave the new employer.

> This prevents double claims and ensures that the option is exercised only once.

---

### **7. Death Benefits and Survivor Allowances**

#### **Death Benefit (Section 12(8))**
- If a public servant dies while employed by the **new employer (St. Joseph Corporation)**, their **surviving spouse and children** are entitled to a **return of contributions** (i.e., a refund of pension contributions made during the period of employment).

#### **Survivor Allowance (Section 13(3))**
- Surviving spouse and children are entitled to an allowance under **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the Act (which provide for a monthly allowance for dependents).
- This allowance is **subject to the limitations** set out in **subsections 12(4) and (5)** of the Act (e.g., age limits, duration of entitlement).

#### **Child Allowance (Section 26(2))**
- A child who:
  - Is born to, adopted by, or becomes a stepchild of the employee,
  - During the period **from the transfer date to the date the employee ceases employment with the new employer**,
- Is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the Public Service Superannuation Act**.

> This ensures that children born or adopted during the transition period are not excluded from benefits.

---

### **8. One-Year Period for Employment Termination (Section 10(5))**

- Under **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the PSSA, there is a one-year period during which an employee can re-engage in certain employment activities or return to work.
- For employees affected by these regulations, this one-year period **begins on the date they cease to be employed by the new employer**, not when they left the public service.

> This aligns the timeline of the one-year window with the employee’s new employment status.

---

### **9. Pensionable Service and Age Determination**

#### **Pensionable Service**
- The period of service with the **new employer**, beginning on the **transfer date** and ending on the date the employee ceases to be employed by the new employer, is **included in pensionable service** for purposes of **Sections 12 and 13** of the Act.

> This ensures that time spent working with St. Joseph Corporation counts toward pension eligibility.

#### **Age at Cessation**
- The **age of the employee** when they cease to be employed in the public service is defined as their **age on the day they cease to be employed by the new employer**.

> This is critical for determining pension eligibility, retirement age, and survivor benefits.

---

### **10. Group Classification**

- All contributors covered by these regulations are considered **Group 1 contributors** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> Group 1 contributors typically include federal public servants and are subject to the standard superannuation rules, including the right to pension, survivor benefits, and early retirement options.

---

### **11. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on March 7, 1997**.

> This ensures that the transitional rules are in place before the actual transfer of employees and assets occurs.
