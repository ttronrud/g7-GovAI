**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Respecting Fees for the Review of Arrangements Involving Transportation Undertakings Providing Air Services**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **section 53.84a of the Canada Transportation Act (CTA)**. The regulations establish specific **fees for parties involved in proposed air service arrangements** that are subject to review by the Canadian government due to their potential impact on the public interest.

The regulations are part of a broader framework designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and fair competition in the Canadian air transportation sector—particularly when large or significant arrangements involving major airlines (level I air carriers) are proposed.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Primary Statute**: *Canada Transportation Act (CTA)*  
- **Relevant Sections**:
  - **Section 53.71**: Requires notification to the Minister when a proposed arrangement involving a level I air carrier is being made.
  - **Section 53.73**: Establishes the review process for arrangements that raise "significant considerations with respect to the public interest."
  - **Section 53.84a**: Provides the authority to create fee structures for such reviews.

These regulations implement the fee structure required by the CTA to cover administrative and oversight costs associated with reviewing potentially impactful air service arrangements.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Canada Transportation Act*, which governs transportation policies and regulations in Canada, including air services.

2. **"Level I Air Carrier"**  
   Defined consistently with **subsection 3(1) of the Transportation Information Regulations**.  
   - A level I air carrier is a large, significant air transport operator that meets specific criteria (e.g., annual revenue, route network, passenger volume) set by Transport Canada.  
   - These carriers are considered to have a substantial impact on national air transportation markets and are subject to more rigorous regulatory scrutiny.

### **Fees for Proposed Arrangements**

There are **two distinct fee categories**, depending on whether the arrangement is subject to a formal review process under section 53.73 of the CTA.

#### **1. Initial Notification Fee (Under Section 53.71(1))**

This fee is payable **when a notice is given to the Minister** about a proposed arrangement involving at least one level I air carrier.

| Number of Parties | Fee Amount |
|------------------|-----------|
| 2 parties         | $28,000   |
| 3 or more parties | $36,000   |

> 💡 This fee covers the administrative cost of receiving and processing the initial notification of the proposed arrangement.

#### **2. Review Process Fee (Under Section 53.73)**

This fee applies **only if the Minister determines that the proposed arrangement raises significant considerations with respect to the public interest**.  
This triggers a formal review under section 53.73 of the CTA.

| Number of Parties | Fee Amount |
|------------------|-----------|
| 2 parties         | $252,000   |
| 3 or more parties | $304,000   |

> 💡 This higher fee reflects the increased administrative, analytical, and public interest evaluation costs associated with a full review.

---

### **Payment Requirements**

- **All fees must be paid in full** via **certified cheque**.
- **Payment recipient**: The **Receiver General for Canada** (the official government body responsible for collecting and managing public funds).

#### **Timing of Payment**

| Fee Type | Payment Deadline |
|--------|------------------|
| Initial notification fee (section 2) | **At the time** a notice is given under subsection 53.71(1) of the CTA. |
| Review process fee (section 3) | **Within five days** of the day on which the Minister notifies the parties under subsection 53.71(6) that the arrangement raises significant public interest considerations. |

> ⚠️ Failure to pay the required fees within the specified timeframes may result in the Minister refusing to proceed with the review or rejecting the proposed arrangement.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **section 53.84 of the Canada Transportation Act** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> 📅 As noted in the footnote: *Regulations in force April 3, 2019 (SI/2019-16)*.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The fee structure serves several important regulatory and economic purposes:

1. **Cost Recovery**: Ensures that the government recovers administrative costs associated with reviewing potentially impactful air service arrangements.
2. **Incentive for Transparency**: Encourages parties to properly notify the Minister and to participate in the review process, knowing that fees are required.
3. **Deterrence of Abuse**: Prevents frivolous or non-serious proposals from being submitted without proper cost implications.
4. **Public Interest Protection**: Funds the detailed analysis required to assess whether proposed arrangements (e.g., mergers, joint ventures, route-sharing) may reduce competition, limit consumer choice, or harm market efficiency.

---

### **Examples of Applicable Arrangements**

- A merger between two major airlines (e.g., Air Canada and another level I carrier).
- A joint venture between an airline and a ground handling company involving a level I carrier.
- A route-sharing agreement between multiple carriers where one is a level I air carrier.
- A proposed acquisition or takeover of a major airport or air service operation.

If any of these arrangements involve a level I air carrier and are subject to review, the applicable fees must be paid.

---

### **Important Notes**

- The fees are **not waived** and are mandatory for all parties involved in the proposed arrangement.
- The fees are **not refundable**.
- The fees apply only to arrangements involving **at least one level I air carrier**.
- Smaller carriers (level II or below) are not subject to these fees under this regulation.

---

### **Conclusion**

These regulations provide a clear, structured, and transparent fee system to support the regulatory review of significant air service arrangements involving major carriers. By setting distinct fees based on the number of parties and the level of review required, the government ensures that the process is both accountable and financially sustainable. The fees serve as a critical tool in maintaining market competition and protecting public interest in Canada’s air transportation sector.
