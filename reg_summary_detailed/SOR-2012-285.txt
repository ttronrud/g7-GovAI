## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Prohibition of Certain Toxic Substances Regulations, 2012**

### 📚 **1. Legal Basis and Background**
The regulation was made under **section 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), following a formal process that includes:
- **Public consultation**: The Minister of the Environment published a proposed regulation in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on July 23, 2011, allowing individuals and organizations to submit comments or file objections.
- **Advisory input**: The National Advisory Committee provided advice under section 6c of CEPA 1999.
- **Governor in Council approval**: After reviewing whether the regulation duplicates or conflicts with other environmental laws, the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Ministers of Environment and Health) approved the final version.

> **Key Legal Principle**: The regulation prohibits the manufacture, use, sale, or import of certain toxic substances unless specific exceptions apply — ensuring environmental and human health protection without unnecessary economic disruption.
