### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg and Chick Licensing Regulations (1987)**

---

#### **Background and Purpose**

These regulations were established under the **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act** and the **Canadian Broiler Hatching Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation** to regulate the **interprovincial and export marketing of broiler hatching eggs and chicks** produced for chicken production.

The primary objective is to ensure **fair, orderly, and sustainable marketing** of broiler hatching eggs and chicks across Canada by implementing a **system of licensing** for individuals involved in their trade. This system aims to:

- Prevent market manipulation,
- Ensure compliance with provincial and federal marketing plans,
- Promote equitable access to markets,
- Protect producers and consumers from unfair pricing or over-supply.

The regulations were approved by the **National Farm Products Marketing Council** on August 13, 1987, and came into effect on **October 1, 1987**.

> **Note:** These regulations were **repealed in 2013 and 2016** (SOR/2013-254, s.1; SOR/2016-291, s.1), meaning they are **no longer in force**. They are provided here for historical and regulatory context.
