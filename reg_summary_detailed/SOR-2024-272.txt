## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Offshore Renewable Energy Regulations**

### 🔍 **1. Purpose and Scope**
These regulations establish a comprehensive regulatory framework governing **offshore renewable energy projects** in Canada — specifically those that:
- Exploit wind power to generate electricity; and  
- Include associated **offshore power lines**.

The primary objective is to ensure that all work and operations related to these projects are conducted in a **safe, secure, and environmentally responsible manner**, while also addressing risks related to climate change, human safety, environmental protection, and emergency preparedness.

> **Applicability**: The regulations apply to any offshore renewable energy project or associated power line, including those involving wind farms, subsea cables, and related infrastructure.
