### **Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Transfer to the Department of Health**  
Effective June 30, 2012, the **Department of Health** assumes control and supervision over the following units within the **Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**:

| Unit | Function Summary |
|------|------------------|

| **Integrated Security Services Division** | Provides security services, risk assessment, access control, and threat mitigation across PHAC operations. |

#### **(b) Transfer to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)**  
Effective June 30, 2012, the **Public Health Agency of Canada** assumes control and supervision over the following units within the **Department of Health**:

| Unit | Function Summary |
|------|------------------|
| **Audit and Accountability Bureau** | Conducts internal audits, evaluates financial and operational compliance, and ensures accountability in the use of public funds. |
| **Departmental Performance Measurement and Evaluation Directorate** | Develops and implements performance indicators, monitors outcomes, and evaluates the effectiveness of health programs and services across the Department of Health. |

> **Purpose of Transfer:**  
> This transfer strengthens PHAC’s ability to independently assess the performance and accountability of public health programs and services. By bringing these performance and audit functions under PHAC’s direct oversight, the regulation enhances transparency, improves public trust, and ensures that public health outcomes are rigorously evaluated in a manner consistent with evidence-based decision-making.

---

### **Strategic Rationale and Objectives**

1. **Enhanced Public Health Focus:**  
   The reorganization ensures that PHAC operates with greater autonomy and focus on public health outcomes, rather than being constrained by administrative or financial management functions tied to the Department of Health.

2. **Improved Accountability and Oversight:**  
   By placing performance measurement and audit functions within PHAC, the government ensures that public health initiatives are evaluated using consistent, independent, and transparent metrics.

3. **Operational Efficiency:**  
   Centralizing administrative functions (e.g., HR, IT, facilities) under the Department of Health allows for better standardization, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of services across the federal public service.

4. **Alignment with Public Health Priorities:**  
   The transfer supports Canada’s broader public health strategy by empowering PHAC to act more decisively in responding to health emergencies, promoting health equity, and protecting public safety.

---

### **Implementation and Transition**

- The transfer is effective **June 30, 2012**.
- All personnel, responsibilities, and administrative functions are transferred as of that date.
- The Department of Health and PHAC are required to establish clear transition protocols, including staff assignments, reporting lines, and service continuity plans.
- Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the transfer are expected to ensure that the reorganization achieves its intended outcomes.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which permits the Governor in Council to reorganize public service units to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability.
- The legislation reflects a broader trend in Canadian public administration to **decentralize certain operational functions** to specialized agencies (like PHAC) while retaining oversight and governance functions in central departments (like Health).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a strategic realignment of federal public health governance. By transferring administrative and operational control of key support functions to the Department of Health and placing performance and accountability functions within PHAC, the government enhances both the operational efficiency of public health delivery and the independence and credibility of public health oversight. It is a foundational step in strengthening Canada’s capacity to respond to public health challenges in a coordinated, transparent, and accountable manner.
