The provided text consists of five repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SOR/2016-289, s. 12]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 12 of the Statutory Rules Order 2016 (SOR/2016-289)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force and has been officially removed from the legal framework.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-289**, which is a Statutory Rules Order issued in 2016. This order typically contains amendments or repeals of existing regulations under the authority of a parent statute.
- **Section Number**: The specific section repealed is **section 12** of the regulation referenced in the original text.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on the date specified in SOR/2016-289, which is generally published in the Canada Gazette or through official government notices. While the exact date is not included in the provided text, such orders are typically effective upon publication or as specified in the order itself.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or provisions previously contained in that section of the regulation are no longer applicable. Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals who previously relied on that section must now refer to the current version of the regulation (if any) or to other applicable laws.

### Contextual Notes:
- The repetition of the same entry five times likely reflects a formatting or data entry error. In official regulatory databases, such redundancy is not standard and may indicate a technical issue in the source document.
- SOR/2016-289 is a known order in Canada that may relate to a specific federal statute (e.g., in the area of immigration, health, or environmental regulation), but without the full name of the original regulation, the exact subject matter of the repealed section cannot be determined.
- Since the regulation is repealed, it is not currently enforceable or referenced in current legal practice.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text — specifically section 12 — has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2016-289**. It is no longer part of the current legal framework and should not be cited or applied. The repeal signifies a change in policy or legal structure, and users of the regulation must consult current, active legislation for applicable provisions.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without the name of the original regulation or the parent statute, a more precise summary of the content of section 12 cannot be provided. Additional context from the full text of SOR/2016-289 or the original regulation would be required to understand the substance of the repealed provision.
