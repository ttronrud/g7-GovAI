**Detailed Summary of the Maritime Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (S.C. 2000, c. 20, s. 20; R.S., c. L-2)**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

The *Maritime Occupational Health and Safety Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour** and the **Minister of Transport**, under **section 157a of the Canada Labour Code (CLC)**. These regulations establish comprehensive health and safety standards specifically for maritime workers in Canada.

These regulations are part of the broader framework of occupational health and safety legislation and are designed to protect employees working on vessels, including those involved in loading/unloading operations, and those employed on vessels registered in Canada or uncommissioned vessels under the Crown.

---

### **2. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

- **Employees** working on:
  - Vessels registered in Canada;
  - Uncommissioned vessels of Her Majesty in right of Canada;
  - Vessels engaged in loading or unloading operations.

Additionally, the regulations extend to **non-employees** who perform work for an employer whose activities are primarily aimed at enabling them to acquire knowledge or experience — such as trainees or apprentices — **as if they were employees**, meaning all provisions must be interpreted and applied accordingly.

> This ensures that even individuals not formally employed but involved in maritime training or operations are protected under the same health and safety standards.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define critical terms used throughout:

### **4. Interpretation of Standards**

- Any reference to a **standard incorporated by reference** (e.g., CSA, ANSI, ISO) uses the word **“should”** to indicate an **obligation**, not just a recommendation.
- In case of **inconsistency** between a referenced standard and another provision of these regulations, **the other provision prevails**.
- All referenced standards are to be interpreted as **amended from time to time**.

---

### **5. General Health and Safety Obligations**

Every employer must:

1. **Ensure work is carried out safely** — in a manner that does not endanger the health or safety of any person engaged in or near the work.
2. **Implement appropriate procedures and techniques** to prevent or reduce the risk of employment injury.
3. **Provide safe crew accommodation** — meeting health and safety standards related to noise, vibration, chemicals, and overall living conditions.

> The goal is to ensure an **acceptable occupational and on-board living environment** for all crew members.

---

### **6. Role of the Qualified Person**

Every employer or owner must ensure that:

- A **qualified person** is in charge of every work area.
- The person **inspects every work area, structure, and piece of machinery or equipment** to verify safe working conditions.

> This inspection ensures ongoing compliance and early detection of hazards.

---

### **7. Reassembled Equipment and Structures**

- **No structure or machinery** may be reassembled (in whole or part) after being dismantled **until it has been examined and found safe by a qualified person**.

> This prevents unsafe reuse of equipment due to damage or improper assembly.

---

### **8. Temporary Structures (Scaffolds, Stages, Ladders, etc.)**

#### **General Rules**
- **Temporary structures must not be used** if a permanent one is feasible.
- Employees **must be trained and authorized** before using temporary structures.
- Tools and materials on temporary structures must be **secured to prevent accidental falls**.
- A **qualified person must visually inspect** the structure before each work period.
- If the structure is affected by tidal movement, a **visual inspection must occur at the end of each tide cycle**.
- If a defect is found, **the structure must not be used until the issue is fixed**.

#### **Design and Safety Requirements**
- Must meet standards from:
  - ANSI/ASSE A10.8-2001 (Scaffolding Safety);
  - ANSI/ALI A14.7-2006 (Mobile Ladder Stands);
  - CSA Z271-98 (Suspended Elevating Platforms).

> These standards ensure structural integrity, stability, and fall protection.

#### **Erection and Removal**
- Must be carried out **by or under the supervision of a qualified person**.

#### **Stability on Uneven Surfaces**
- If erected on uneven ground, must have **base plates** to maintain stability.

  - A **platform at least 500 mm wide**, securely fastened;
  - A **flat, horizontal working surface**.

#### **Stages (Working Platforms Supported from Above)**
- Must have a **flat, horizontal surface** capable of supporting any likely load.
- Must include a **means to hold the stage away from the working area** (to prevent movement or contact with hazards).

#### **Supporting Structure Safety Factor**
- The supporting structure and ropes/tackle must have a **safety factor of at least six**.
