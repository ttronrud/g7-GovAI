- Adjustments to full monthly pensions or supplements are made **quarterly** under subsections 7(2) or 12(2) of the Act.

- The resulting product is adjusted to the **nearest cent**, using the following rules:

> **Rounding Rules for Fractions of a Dollar**:
- If the **third digit** after the decimal point is **less than 5**, drop all digits beyond the second.
- If the **third digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **second digit by 1**, then drop all digits beyond the second.

#### **5.2 Ratios and Decimal Precision**
- Ratios used in calculations (e.g., CPI-based adjustments) must be expressed as **decimal fractions**.
- If a ratio is less than 1:
  - It is expressed to **four digits** after the decimal point.
  - If the **fourth digit is less than 5**, drop it.
  - If the **fourth digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **third digit by 1**, then drop the fourth.

#### **5.3 Consumer Price Index (CPI) Average**
- The average CPI for Canada is calculated by:
  - Summing the monthly CPI values published by Statistics Canada over a period.
  - Dividing the total by the number of months.
- The resulting quotient is rounded to **two decimal places**:
  - If the **second digit is less than 5**, drop it.
