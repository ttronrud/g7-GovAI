**Detailed Summary of the Designation of Countries (Standards Council of Canada) Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Standards Council of Canada Act* (SCC Act), specifically pursuant to **subsection 4(4)** of that Act. The Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**. This means that the federal government, through the Minister, proposes the designation of certain countries, and the Governor General formally approves it as an official government instrument.

The Order is issued to fulfill the requirement under **paragraph 4(2)(d)** of the SCC Act, which allows the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to designate countries for the purpose of applying certain standards and regulatory frameworks in international trade and cooperation.

---

**2. Effective Date**  
The Order becomes effective on the date when **Section 224 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act** comes into force.  
- The NAFTA Implementation Act (S.C. 1993, c. 44) was enacted in 1993.  
- Section 224(2) specifies that the provision related to the designation of countries (which is the subject of this Order) becomes effective upon the entry into force of the Act.  
- Therefore, the Order is not effective immediately upon publication, but only after the formal implementation of the NAFTA legislation.

**3. Title of the Order**  
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Designation of Countries (Standards Council of Canada) Order"**  
It may be cited as such in legal and administrative contexts.

---

**4. Purpose of the Designation**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **identify specific countries** that are considered eligible or relevant for the purposes of **paragraph 4(2)(d)** of the SCC Act. This paragraph likely relates to the SCC’s authority to engage in international standardization activities, to recognize standards from other countries, or to establish harmonized standards in trade and commerce—particularly in the context of international agreements and economic cooperation.

By designating these countries, the SCC can streamline processes such as:
- Mutual recognition of standards,
- Facilitation of trade,
- Harmonization of technical regulations,
- Promoting international collaboration in standardization.

**5. List of Designated Countries**  
The following categories of countries are formally designated under this Order:

1. **Any country that is a member economy of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)**  
   - APEC includes 21 member economies across Asia and the Pacific (e.g., Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, the United States, etc.).  
   - The designation includes all APEC "member economies," not just member states—this is important because APEC includes both sovereign states and economies such as Hong Kong, Macau, and the U.S. territories, which are not sovereign states but participate in APEC.

2. **Any country that is a member state of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)**  
   - EFTA consists of four member states: Austria, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.  
   - These countries are not members of the European Union but maintain free trade arrangements with the EU and participate in certain international standards and trade agreements.

3. **Any country that is a member state of the European Union (EU)**  
   - All 27 EU member states (as of 2024) are included.  
   - This designation recognizes the EU’s central role in setting and harmonizing technical standards across Europe.

4. **Any country that is a party to the Agreement, as defined in section 2 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) Implementation Act**  
   - This refers to the **CUSMA Agreement**, which replaced NAFTA.  
   - "Party to the Agreement" includes the **United States, Canada, and Mexico**, and potentially other countries that may be parties to specific CUSMA-related agreements or protocols.  
   - The term "Agreement" is defined in **section 2 of the CUSMA Implementation Act**, which specifies the parties to the agreement.  
   - This designation ensures that Canada’s standards cooperation extends to the core trade partners under CUSMA.

5. **Any country that is a member state of the Organization of American States (OAS), including Cuba**  
   - The OAS includes 35 member states in the Americas.  
   - Notably, **Cuba is explicitly included** in this category, even though it is not a member of the EU or NAFTA.  
   - This inclusion reflects Canada’s commitment to regional cooperation and standardization in the Western Hemisphere, including with countries that may have different political or economic systems.

6. **Any country that is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)**  
   - As of 2024, there are 184 WTO member states.  
   - This broad designation ensures that Canada’s standardization activities are aligned with global trade norms and practices.  
   - It provides a foundation for international standardization cooperation with all WTO members, facilitating trade, regulatory alignment, and technical transparency.

---

**6. Significance and Implications**  
- This Order strengthens Canada’s ability to **collaborate internationally** on standards, which is essential for trade, innovation, and competitiveness.  
- It enables the Standards Council of Canada to **recognize and adopt standards** from designated countries, reducing duplication and regulatory barriers.  
- The inclusion of **Cuba and EFTA members** shows Canada’s commitment to regional inclusivity and multilateral cooperation, even with countries that may have different economic or political frameworks.  
- The inclusion of **all WTO members** ensures that Canada’s standards are globally relevant and aligned with international trade practices.

---

**7. Legal and Practical Impact**  
- The designation does not automatically grant equivalence or approval of standards but establishes a **framework for cooperation**.  
- The SCC may use this list to determine which countries are eligible for participation in standard-setting processes, mutual recognition arrangements, or technical assessments.  
- It supports Canada’s role in international standardization bodies (e.g., ISO, IEC, CEN, CENELEC) by ensuring that standards from designated countries are considered in Canadian policy and regulation.

**Conclusion**  
This Order is a foundational administrative instrument that defines the scope of international standardization cooperation under the Standards Council of Canada Act. By designating countries participating in major regional and global economic and trade organizations—including APEC, the EU, EFTA, the OAS, and the WTO—it enables Canada to engage more effectively with international partners in setting and applying technical standards. This promotes trade efficiency, regulatory harmonization, and economic integration, particularly in the context of Canada’s commitments under NAFTA/CUSMA and broader global trade agreements.
