**Detailed Summary of the *Ship Construction Subsidy Regulations***

---

### **Overview**
The *Ship Construction Subsidy Regulations* establish the framework for the provision of capital subsidies to support the construction of eligible commercial and fishing vessels in Canada. These regulations were designed to promote domestic shipbuilding, ensure Canadian ownership and operation of vessels, and provide financial incentives to shipbuilders and shipowners under specific conditions. The regulations are administered by the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** and operate within the broader context of Canadian maritime policy and fiscal policy.

## **Key Definitions**

| **Eligible Ship** | A vessel declared by the Minister under subsection 4(3) as eligible for subsidy under these regulations. |
| **Fishing Vessel** | A vessel equipped for and used in catching or trapping fish for sale. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce. |
| **Proceeds of Disposition** | As defined in paragraph 13(21)(d) of the *Income Tax Act* — the amount received from the sale or disposal of a vessel. |

## **Eligibility Criteria for Subsidy**

1. **Construction Timeline**  
   - Subsidies may be paid **only** for vessels whose construction **did not begin before January 1, 1966**, and **was not subject to a shipbuilding contract entered into before January 1, 1966**.  
   - This effectively excludes older vessels and those built under pre-1966 agreements.

2. **Purpose and Ownership Requirements**  
   - The vessel must be intended for use in a **commercial enterprise** and must be constructed in Canada.  
   - Eligibility applies in two scenarios:
     - A shipbuilder builds the vessel for a shipowner.
     - A shipowner builds the vessel for their own use.

3. **Declaration of Eligibility**  
   - Before any subsidy can be granted, the Minister must:
     - Declare the vessel an *eligible ship* under subsection 4(3);  
     - Determine the *maximum approved cost* of the vessel.  
   - The Minister may only declare a vessel eligible if it is intended for commercial use and built in Canada.

---

## **Application Process**

- An application for a subsidy must be submitted in the **prescribed form** and must be made **within 60 days** of the earlier of:
  - The date the construction contract is signed, or  
  - The date construction of the hull begins.  
- The Minister may **extend** the deadline if circumstances justify it (e.g., unforeseen delays or financial issues).

## **Subsidy Amounts (by Completion Date)**

The subsidy rate decreases over time, reflecting a phased reduction in support as the program matures. The rates apply only to **non-fishing vessels**:

| Completion Period | Subsidy Rate |
|------------------|-------------|
| Jan 1, 1966 – May 31, 1969 | 25% |
| Jun 1, 1969 – Aug 31, 1969 | 24.5% |
| Sep 1, 1969 – Nov 30, 1969 | 24% |
| Dec 1, 1969 – Feb 28, 1970 | 23.5% |
| Mar 1, 1970 – May 31, 1970 | 23% |
| Jun 1, 1970 – Aug 31, 1970 | 22.5% |
| Sep 1, 1970 – Nov 30, 1970 | 22% |
| Dec 1, 1970 – Feb 28, 1971 | 21.5% |
| Mar 1, 1971 – May 31, 1971 | 21% |
| Jun 1, 1971 – Aug 31, 1971 | 20.5% |
| Sep 1, 1971 – Nov 30, 1971 | 20% |
| Dec 1, 1971 – Feb 29, 1972 | 19.5% |
| Mar 1, 1972 – May 31, 1972 | 19% |
| Jun 1, 1972 – Aug 31, 1972 | 18.5% |
| Sep 1, 1972 – Nov 30, 1972 | 18% |
| Dec 1, 1972 – Feb 28, 1973 | 17.5% |
| After Feb 28, 1973 | 17% |

> **Note**: These rates are based on the **approved cost** of the vessel.

## **Fishing Vessels – Special Provisions**

- Fishing vessels are eligible for a **higher subsidy rate of 35%** of the approved cost — significantly greater than non-fishing vessels — to support a vital sector of the Canadian economy.

---

## **Adjustments for Delays**

- If a vessel is completed **later than expected** due to causes beyond the control of the shipowner or shipbuilder, the Minister may, at their discretion:
  - **Re-assign the completion date** to an earlier date (e.g., a date that reflects a reasonable completion timeline);
  - Recalculate the subsidy based on the new (earlier) completion date.

> This provision protects shipbuilders and owners from penalties due to unforeseen events (e.g., supply chain issues, natural disasters).

---

## **Reduction of Approved Cost in Replacement Scenarios**

If proceeds from the disposition (sale or disposal) of a vessel are used to fund a replacement vessel, the **approved cost of the replacement** is reduced by the amount used, **provided**:

- The replacement is an eligible ship for which a subsidy is to be paid.
- The replacement is funded directly from the proceeds of disposition.

Additionally:
- If the Minister pays out part of a deposit (under subsection 13(19) of the Income Tax Act), the approved cost of the replacement is reduced by an amount that maintains the **same proportion** as the deposit to the proceeds of disposition.

> **Exclusions**:
> - Dispositions made via hire purchase agreements **prior to May 12, 1961** are excluded.
> - Dispositions of vessels that were **not eligible** for a subsidy, or where the subsidy was not claimed or paid, may be excluded if the disposal occurred between May 12, 1961 and August 8, 1962.
> - If proceeds were used in a manner satisfactory to the Canadian Transport Commission (under prior legislation), the reduction does not apply.

## **Payment and Cost Determination**

- Before making a payment, the Minister must:
  - For **lump-sum payments**, determine the cost of the eligible ship to calculate the subsidy.
  - For **progress payments**, determine the balance of the subsidy.
- The final cost determined must not exceed the **maximum approved cost** set by the Minister under paragraph 4(2)(b).

---

## **Agreement Requirements (Mandatory Provisions)**

Every subsidy agreement must include the following:

1. **Payment Structure**  
   - Subsidy paid either as a **lump sum** or as **progress payments not exceeding 80% of the total subsidy before completion**, with the remaining balance paid after completion.

2. **Accounting and Audit Requirements**  
   - Shipowner and shipbuilder must maintain **accurate and complete records** of expenditures.  
   - The Minister may **audit accounts and inspect records** at any time before the **second anniversary** of the final subsidy payment
