The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulatory instrument, specifically:

- **SOR/2014-13, s. 8** (Section 8 of the Statutory Instrument of 2014, No. 13)
- **SOR/86-430, s. 1** and **s. 3** (Section 1 and Section 3 of the Statutory Instrument of 1986, No. 430)

However, **no actual regulation or text** is included in the provided content — only repeated citations indicating that certain sections have been repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation in question has been **fully repealed**. The repeated references to "Repealed, SOR/2014-13, s. 8" and "Repealed, SOR/86-430, s. 1" and "s. 3" indicate that these specific provisions were formally removed from force by subsequent legislation.

- **SOR/2014-13, s. 8** was enacted as a repeal provision in the Statutory Instrument of 2014, No. 13. This section explicitly revoked earlier provisions (likely from SOR/86-430 or other prior instruments).
- **SOR/86-430, s. 1 and s. 3** were also repealed by the same or other subsequent amendments, with SOR/2014-13 being the instrument that formally removed them.

**Legal Context:**  
Statutory Instruments (SIs) like SOR/86-430 and SOR/2014-13 are used in Canadian regulatory law (particularly in provinces like Ontario) to amend or repeal existing rules. The repeal of these sections means that:

- Any legal obligations, definitions, duties, or procedures previously established under those sections no longer apply.
- The regulatory framework has been updated or replaced by newer legislation or regulations.
- Legal or administrative actions based on the repealed sections are no longer valid or enforceable.

**Implications:**
- Entities or individuals relying on the repealed provisions (e.g., in licensing, compliance, or enforcement) must now refer to current, active regulations.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization, consolidation, or streamlining effort.

**Conclusion:**  
There is **no active regulation** present in the provided text. The content is a list of **repeal notices**, indicating that the referenced sections of prior regulations (specifically from SOR/86-430 and SOR/2014-13) have been formally and permanently removed from the legal framework. As such, **the regulation is not in effect** and should not be used as a basis for legal or operational decisions.
