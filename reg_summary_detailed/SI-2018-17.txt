**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically subsections 27(1.1) and 27(1.2), which empower the Governor in Council (the federal government) to refer species to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) for further evaluation when new information suggests that a species’ status may require reconsideration. The decision is made on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, reflecting the Act’s framework for scientific assessment and adaptive management of at-risk species.

**Subject of the Regulation**  
The regulation concerns the **Yukon Draba (*Draba yukonensis*)**, a rare and small herbaceous plant belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is native to a very limited geographic range in southwestern Yukon, Canada.

**Background and Historical Assessment (2011 COSEWIC Assessment)**  
At the time of COSEWIC’s initial assessment in 2011, the Yukon Draba was known to occur in only **one meadow complex** in southwestern Yukon. This single location represented the entire known global distribution of the species. Key threats identified in that assessment included:

- **Industrial activities** (e.g., mining, infrastructure development)  
- **Proximity to human habitation** and associated land use  
- **Invasive plant species** outcompeting the native plant  
- **Human trampling** of sensitive meadow habitats  
- **Forest encroachment**, which reduces open meadow areas essential for the plant’s survival  

Due to its **extremely restricted range**, **limited natural dispersal capability**, and **extreme population fluctuations**, COSEWIC concluded in 2011 that the Yukon Draba should be designated as **Endangered** under SARA.

**Reason for Referral Back to COSEWIC**  
Despite the 2011 assessment and the initial designation, the Minister of the Environment has determined that a **reassessment is warranted**. This referral is based on **new information** that has emerged since the original evaluation, including:

- Updated data on the **actual geographic range** of the species within Canada  
- New findings regarding **population dynamics**, such as changes in population size, distribution, or stability over time  
- Potential discovery of additional populations or habitat patches previously unknown  
- Changes in habitat conditions or threats that may have evolved since 2011  

This new information suggests that the previous assessment may not fully capture the current status of the species, necessitating a more comprehensive and up-to-date scientific evaluation.

**Action Taken by the Governor in Council**  
1. **Referral to COSEWIC**: The Governor in Council formally refers the status assessment of the Yukon Draba back to COSEWIC for **further scientific review and reassessment**. This ensures that the current biological and ecological understanding of the species is reflected in any future designation.  

2. **Public Registry Notification**: The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include in the **public registry under Section 120 of SARA** a formal statement (attached as an annex to this regulation) that explains the reasons for the referral. This statement will be publicly accessible, promoting transparency and accountability in the species-at-risk assessment process.

**Significance and Implications**  
- This action underscores the importance of **adaptive management** in species conservation under SARA. It reflects a commitment to using the most current scientific data when determining the status of a species.  
- The referral allows COSEWIC to conduct a thorough, evidence-based review, potentially leading to a revised designation (e.g., from Endangered to Threatened, or vice versa, or a more precise status).  
- It also highlights the vulnerability of the Yukon Draba and the need for ongoing monitoring and habitat protection, particularly in light of growing industrial and land-use pressures in Yukon.  
- Public access to the rationale ensures stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, scientists, and the general public, are informed about the status and conservation needs of this rare species.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a critical step in the conservation of the Yukon Draba by initiating a formal, science-based reassessment of its status. It recognizes that ecological conditions and species dynamics can change over time, and that ongoing monitoring and review are essential for effective species protection under Canadian environmental law. The outcome of the COSEWIC reassessment will inform future conservation actions, including potential listing under SARA and the development of recovery strategies.
