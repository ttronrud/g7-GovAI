**Detailed Summary of the Charter Flights Airport Facilities Reservation Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Charter Flights Airport Facilities Reservation Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**. These regulations provide a formal framework for managing the reservation of **airport apron and terminal facilities** for **passenger charter flights** in Canada.

These regulations are designed to ensure that airport infrastructure (such as runways, taxiways, gates, terminals, and ground handling services) is efficiently and safely allocated to accommodate charter operations, particularly when such operations are not part of a scheduled, regular service.

The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Charter Flights Airport Facilities Reservation Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

| **Air Carrier** | Any entity that operates a commercial air service. This includes airlines or other companies providing scheduled or charter passenger flights. |
| **Airport Manager** | The individual responsible for managing an airport, or their authorized representative. Responsible for receiving applications and making reservations. |
| **Applicant** | An air carrier that submits a formal request to reserve airport facilities for a passenger charter flight. |
| **Regular Charter Flight** | A passenger charter flight operated on a recurring program basis with: <br> - Schedules published **six months in advance** for international flights and **three months in advance** for domestic flights; <br> - Formal reservations made through established airport scheduling procedures. |

---

### **Scope and Exclusions**

- **Applicability**:  
  These regulations apply to **passenger charter flights** that are **not regular charter flights** and are not operating during times specified in the current **Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)** issued by the Department of Transport, Civil Aeronautics Branch.

- **Exclusion Clause**:  
  If a flight is scheduled during times explicitly restricted or temporarily closed due to NOTAMs (e.g., construction, weather, or operational issues), the regulations **do not apply**.

---

### **Reservations for Non-Regular Charter Flights**

#### **Eligibility and Aircraft Threshold**
- The regulations apply to **passenger charter flights** where the aircraft has a **maximum certified take-off weight of 35,000 pounds or more**.
- This threshold ensures that only larger, significant flights requiring substantial ground support are subject to formal reservation requirements.

> *Note: Smaller aircraft (under 35,000 lbs) are exempt from this reservation requirement.*

---

### **Application Process for Reservations**

#### **Timing of Application**
An air carrier must submit a reservation application **at least 30 days before** the proposed flight date.  
However, if a **flight permit** is issued under the *Air Carrier Regulations* within less than 30 days of the flight date, the application must be submitted **as soon as possible after receiving the permit**.

#### **Form and Content of Application**
The application must be submitted in **writing** and must include the following information:

1. **Applicant Details**:  
   - Name and address of the air carrier.

2. **Contact Information**:  
   - Name and address of a responsible officer or agent in Canada to whom notices may be sent.

3. **Flight Identification**:  
   - Identification number or name of the proposed flight.

4. **Passenger Load**:  
   - Estimated number of passengers on the flight.

5. **Aircraft Type**:  
   - Specific type of aircraft to be used (e.g., Boeing 737, Airbus A320).

6. **Flight Route**:  
   - Origin, destination, and any intermediate stops.

7. **Flight Times**:  
   - Proposed arrival and departure times at each airport listed in the flight schedule.

---

### **Airport Manager Responsibilities**

Upon receiving an application, the airport manager must:

1. **Evaluate the Request**:  
   - Assess whether the airport can accommodate the flight based on:
     - Existing prearranged aircraft and passenger activities;
     - Available apron and terminal facilities;
     - Ground handling services.

2. **Make Reservation or Reject Application**:
   - **Accept** the reservation if the airport can accommodate the flight at the requested time.
   - **Reject** the application if the airport cannot accommodate the flight.

3. **Notify Applicant Promptly**:  
   - Provide written notification **within two working days** of receiving the application.

---

### **Handling of Rejected Applications**

If an application is rejected, the airport manager must:

- **Immediately propose one or more alternate times** for the flight.
- The applicant must **respond promptly** to this proposal.
- The goal is to **secure a reservation as soon as possible** after rejection.

> This process ensures flexibility and minimizes disruption to both the air carrier and airport operations.

---

### **Compliance with Scheduled Times**

- Once a reservation is granted, the air carrier **must schedule the arrival and departure of the aircraft exactly as specified in the reservation**.
- Deviating from the scheduled time without prior coordination is not permitted.

---

### **Changes to Scheduled Flights**

If an air carrier determines that it **cannot meet the time specified in the reservation**, it must:

1. **Immediately notify** the airport manager who issued the reservation.
2. If the flight is to be **rescheduled to a different time** at another airport listed in the schedule, the air carrier must **apply for a new reservation**.

> This ensures that changes are formally documented and do not lead to facility conflicts or operational delays.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Operational Efficiency**:  
   To prevent congestion and scheduling conflicts at major Canadian airports by ensuring that apron and terminal facilities are properly allocated.

2. **Safety and Reliability**:  
   To ensure that all flights, especially large charter operations, have sufficient ground handling and terminal access, reducing the risk of delays or safety hazards.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**:  
   To establish clear procedures for applications, rejections, and rescheduling, with timely communication between air carriers and airport managers.

4. **Fairness and Predictability**:  
   To provide a standardized, predictable process for all air carriers seeking to operate passenger charter flights at designated airports.

---

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- **Regular Charter Flights**:  
  These flights are exempt from the reservation requirement because they operate on a scheduled, programmatic basis and are already integrated into airport operations.

- **NOTAM-Exempt Times**:  
  Flights operating during times restricted by NOTAMs are not subject to these regulations.

- **Smaller Aircraft**:  
  Aircraft with a maximum take-off weight under 35,000 lbs are not required to apply for reservations.

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement of these regulations is likely delegated to:

- The **Minister of Transport**
- The **Department of Transport, Civil Aeronautics Branch**
- Airport managers, who have the authority to reject applications or propose alternatives

Non-compliance could result in operational delays, denial of landing rights, or penalties under broader aviation laws.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Charter Flights Airport Facilities Reservation Regulations* establish a clear, structured, and time-bound process for air carriers to reserve essential airport facilities—aprons and terminals—for **non-regular passenger charter flights** involving large aircraft (35,000 lbs or more). The rules emphasize **timely communication**, **flexibility in scheduling**, and **coordination between air carriers and airport managers** to ensure safe, efficient, and reliable operations at key Canadian airports.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s aviation infrastructure management system, balancing the needs of commercial air service providers
