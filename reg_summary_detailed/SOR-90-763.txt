**Detailed Summary of the Registered Charities Information Return Fee Order (SI/88-189, 1988 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 4365)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Registered Charities Information Return Fee Order* (SI/88-189), issued on **October 29, 1990**, by the **Minister of National Revenue**, establishes a fee structure for requests for copies of public information returns filed by registered charities with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). This Order was made under **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Minister to prescribe fees for services provided by the Government, including access to official records.

The regulation is designed to balance the public’s right to access information about registered charities with the administrative and financial costs associated with providing such documents.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Return**: Refers to a *public information return* or any part thereof filed by a registered charity with the Minister of National Revenue under **subsection 149.1(14) of the Income Tax Act**. These returns contain information about the charity’s financial activities, governance, and operations.

---

### **Core Fee Structure**

#### **1. Standard Fee**
- A person who requests a copy of a return must pay **$0.30 per page** for each copy provided.
- This fee applies to all copies requested, regardless of the type or content of the return.

#### **2. Free Copies Provision**
- For a given fiscal year, a person is entitled to **up to 20 free copies** of returns.
- The first 20 requests (in a fiscal year) are **exempt from fees**.
- This provision is intended to promote public access to charitable information while limiting the cost burden on individuals seeking information.

#### **3. Special Provision Regarding Timing**
- A critical exception applies to requests made **after March 1990 but before the coming into force of this Order (October 29, 1990)**.
- Copies requested during this period (i.e., between March 1990 and October 29, 1990) are **counted toward the 20 free copies** available for the fiscal year ending in **1991**.
- This ensures consistency and avoids double-counting or gaps in access rights due to timing of the new regulation’s implementation.

### **Interpretation of "Requesting" and "Deemed Request"**

- If a copy of a return is requested:
  - **In the name of**,  
  - **On behalf of**, or  
  - **For the benefit of** another person,  
  - **Or for the purpose of making it available to** another person,  
  then the **person making the request is deemed to be the other person** for the purposes of the free copy entitlement.

> **Example**: If a donor requests a copy of a charity’s return on behalf of a beneficiary, the donor is treated as the beneficiary for the purposes of the 20-free-copy limit. Thus, the request counts against the beneficiary’s 20-copy allowance.

This rule ensures that the free copy limit is applied fairly and consistently, regardless of who formally makes the request.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies only to **public information returns** filed by registered charities under **section 149.1(14)** of the Income Tax Act.
- Does **not apply** to other types of documents or information held by the CRA.
- Applies to **all individuals or entities** who request copies of these returns.

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

1. **Public Access to Information**: Encourages transparency and public accountability by allowing individuals to access information about registered charities.
2. **Administrative Cost Management**: Helps the CRA manage the cost of processing and providing copies of documents, especially when requests are frequent or large in volume.
3. **Fairness and Equity**: The 20-free-copy limit ensures that individuals with legitimate interest (e.g., donors, beneficiaries, or researchers) can access information without undue financial burden.
4. **Clarity in Transition**: The special provision for requests made between March 1990 and the Order’s effective date ensures that individuals who requested information during that window are not disadvantaged by the new fee structure.

### **Conclusion**
