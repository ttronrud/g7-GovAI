**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29). These subsections empower the Minister to refer assessments of species at risk back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for additional review, clarification, or updated consideration when uncertainties or gaps in data exist.

**Key Actions Taken in the Regulation**

1. **Referral of Caribou Population Assessments to COSEWIC**  
   The Minister refers the following three **COSEWIC assessments** back to the Committee for further evaluation and input:
   - The assessment of the **Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) Northern Mountain population**
   - The assessment of the **Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) Central Mountain population**
   - The assessment of the **Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) Southern Mountain population**

   This referral is not a rejection of the prior assessments but a formal request for **additional information or revised consideration** due to identified uncertainties and gaps in the data.

2. **Approval of Public Registry Statement**  
   The Minister approves the inclusion in the **public registry under Section 120 of SARA** of a **statement attached as an annex** to this regulation. This statement outlines the **reasons for the referral** to COSEWIC, ensuring transparency and public access to the rationale behind the decision.

**Background and Context**

- **Current Listings under SARA**  
  Two mountain caribou populations in western Canada are currently listed in **Schedule 1** of the *Species at Risk Act*:
  - **Woodland Caribou (Southern Mountain population)** – listed as **Threatened** since 2003
  - **Woodland Caribou (Northern Mountain population)** – listed as a **Species of Special Concern** since 2005

  These listings reflect the conservation status of these populations and trigger legal obligations for protection and recovery planning.

- **COSEWIC’s 2011 Designatable Unit (DU) Reorganization**  
  In 2011, COSEWIC introduced a significant update to how caribou populations are assessed by defining **twelve new Designatable Units (DUs)**. DUs are the smallest units of a species that can be considered separately for conservation purposes, based on genetic, ecological, and geographic distinctions.

  Specifically, the two western mountain caribou populations were **split into three new DUs**:
  - Northern Mountain DU
  - Central Mountain DU
  - Southern Mountain DU

  This reorganization refined the spatial and biological boundaries of these populations, improving the accuracy of population assessments and management planning.

- **COSEWIC’s 2014 Status Report**  
  In 2014, COSEWIC published its assessment of the status of these three mountain caribou populations under the new DU structure in the report titled:  
  *"COSEWIC Assessment and Status Report on the Caribou Rangifer tarandus, Northern Mountain Population, Central Mountain Population and Southern Mountain Population in Canada – 2014"*.

  This report formed the basis for the current listings and management decisions.

**Reasons for Referral Back to COSEWIC**

The Minister has determined that the **2014 assessments should be revised or further evaluated** due to several key concerns:

1. **Uncertainties in Delineation of Designatable Units (DUs)**  
   The boundaries of the three new DUs (Northern, Central, and Southern Mountain) remain **controversial or poorly defined**, particularly in terms of genetic, ecological, and landscape connectivity. This lack of clarity undermines confidence in population size estimates and status determinations.

2. **Insufficient Genetic Data**  
   There is a lack of comprehensive genetic information to support the current DU boundaries. Without robust genetic evidence, it is difficult to confirm whether the populations are distinct or interbreeding, which affects their classification and conservation needs.

3. **Lack of Integration of Indigenous Knowledge**  
   The development of the DUs did not fully incorporate **Indigenous knowledge**, including traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which is vital for understanding caribou movements, habitat use, and cultural significance. This omission raises concerns about the completeness and cultural relevance of the scientific assessment.

4. **Recent Changes in Population Trends**  
   There have been **recent shifts in population sizes** within some of the affected herds, which were not fully accounted for in the 2014 report. These changes may indicate a need for updated data and more dynamic assessment methods.

**Department’s Commitment and Next Steps**

- The **Department of the Environment** has committed to **collaborating closely with COSEWIC** to address the identified issues.
- The referral is not a rejection of the 2014 findings but a **call for improved scientific rigor, inclusivity, and data completeness**.
- COSEWIC will be expected to:
  - Re-evaluate the DU boundaries using updated genetic and ecological data
  - Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and traditional ecological perspectives
  - Assess current population trends and their implications
  - Provide a revised or updated status report that reflects the most current and accurate understanding of these populations

---

**Significance and Implications**

- This regulation underscores the **importance of scientific accuracy, cultural inclusivity, and adaptive management** in species conservation.
- It reflects a shift toward more **nuanced, data-driven, and community-informed conservation approaches**.
- The referral may lead to **revisions in the SARA listings** of these caribou populations if the updated assessments indicate a change in their status (e.g., from "Species of Special Concern" to "Threatened" or vice versa).
- It also highlights the **ongoing challenges in managing large, migratory, and ecologically complex species** like caribou, especially in the face of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and land-use pressures.

---

**Conclusion**

This regulation formally acknowledges the **limitations and uncertainties** in the prior assessments of the three mountain caribou populations in western Canada. By referring these assessments back to COSEWIC, the government is taking a proactive and transparent step to ensure that conservation decisions are based on **the most up-to-date, scientifically sound, and culturally informed data**. The process emphasizes collaboration, scientific integrity, and the importance of integrating Indigenous knowledge into biodiversity conservation policy.
