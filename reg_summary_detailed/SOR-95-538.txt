2. **Certificates of Identity**;

### **Fee Structure and Payment Requirements**

#### **Fee Amount**
- The standard fee for issuing a travel document to a person **of at least 16 years of age** is **$25**.
- This fee must be **paid at the time the application is submitted**.

#### **Applicability**
- The $25 fee applies to all eligible travel documents issued to individuals aged 16 or older.
- The fee does **not apply** to individuals under 16 years of age (as of the regulations’ current scope, though specific provisions for minors may exist elsewhere).

### **Application and Fee Payment Timeline**

The regulations specify how the $25 fee applies in different scenarios, particularly regarding applications made **before or after the coming into force** of the regulations.

#### **Applications Made Before the Regulations Came into Force**
An application for a travel document that was:
- Made **in person** at a passport issuing office **before** the regulations came into force, **or**
- Sent by **mail or courier** before the regulations came into force, **or**
- Submitted **within five days after the regulations came into force**, **if accompanied by the $25 fee**

> In these cases, the **existing fee provisions** (as they existed immediately before the regulations came into force) **continue to apply**.

Additionally, the transitional clause demonstrates sensitivity to administrative continuity and avoids disruption for individuals who applied for travel documents during a period of regulatory change.
