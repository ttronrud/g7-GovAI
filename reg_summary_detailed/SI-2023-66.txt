The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessment

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29). This subsection empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the advice of the Minister of the Environment) to acknowledge the scientific assessment of a species’ status when it has been conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessment:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally recognizes and accepts the assessment completed by COSEWIC regarding the status of specific species listed in the annexed schedule. COSEWIC is the independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada, including whether they are at risk of extinction.

2. **Trigger for Legal Action:**  
   This acknowledgment is a critical procedural step under SARA. Once the government formally recognizes COSEWIC’s assessment, it triggers the next phase of the legal process under the Act. Specifically, the assessment becomes the official basis for determining whether a species is "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" — which directly influences whether the species is subject to protection measures, recovery strategies, or other regulatory actions.

3. **Species in the Annexed Schedule:**  
   The regulation refers to a schedule (not included in the excerpt) that lists the species for which COSEWIC has completed its assessment. These species are evaluated based on criteria such as population size, distribution, threats, and ecological requirements. The list may include both vertebrate and invertebrate species, including mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and plants.

4. **Government Response to Scientific Advice:**  
   The regulation demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to science-based decision-making in environmental policy. By acknowledging COSEWIC’s findings, the government affirms that the scientific evaluation will inform the legal classification and subsequent conservation actions under SARA.

5. **Legal Consequences of Acknowledgment:**  
   After this acknowledgment, the species listed in the schedule may be designated as:
   - Endangered (highest risk of extinction),
   - Threatened (at risk of becoming endangered),
   - Or Special Concern (likely to become threatened or endangered in the near future).

   This designation activates obligations under SARA, such as the development of recovery strategies, monitoring programs, and, in some cases, prohibitions on activities that harm the species or its habitat.

6. **Implementation Pathway:**  
   Following this acknowledgment, the Minister of the Environment is required to:
   - Develop a recovery strategy for each species if it is designated as endangered or threatened,
   - Designate critical habitat,
   - Consider implementing protective measures or regulatory actions,
   - Monitor the species’ status over time.

**Context and Significance:**

- This regulation is part of a broader framework under SARA to ensure that species at risk receive timely and effective protection.
- It reflects the interplay between scientific assessment and legislative action, emphasizing transparency and accountability in environmental governance.
- The process helps prevent species loss by identifying threats early and initiating conservation efforts before populations decline further.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation serves as a formal government recognition of COSEWIC’s scientific evaluation of specific wildlife species. It marks a pivotal step in the SARA process, legally establishing the conservation status of those species and triggering mandatory actions for their protection and recovery. It underscores Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation through science-driven policy.

**Note:**  
The full text of the regulation (S.C. 2002, c. 29) includes the detailed list of species in the annexed schedule. Without access to that schedule, the specific species affected cannot be identified in this summary. However, the procedural and legal significance of the regulation remains consistent across all such orders.
