The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> [Repealed, SOR/2013-161, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2013-161, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2013-161, s. 5]

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation — identified by the citation **SOR/2013-161, section 5** — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by the **Statutory Instrument of 2013, No. 161**.

- **SOR** stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Regulations" in Canada, which are formal documents used to implement or amend laws passed by Parliament.
- **SOR/2013-161** is the official number and year of the regulatory instrument that repealed the section.
- **Section 5** of that regulation was the specific provision that was repealed.

### Interpretation:

The regulation originally referenced in section 5 of SOR/2013-161 is no longer in force. This means:
- The legal requirements, rules, or provisions previously contained in that section are no longer valid or enforceable.
- Any actions, decisions, or compliance measures based on that section are now outdated and must be updated or replaced with current legislation.
- The repeal was likely made to streamline regulations, correct errors, align with new policy, or consolidate or modernize the regulatory framework.

### Context:

SOR/2013-161 is a regulatory amendment or repeal instrument, commonly used in Canadian federal legislation to update or remove outdated or redundant rules. The fact that it is cited three times suggests either:
- A typographical or formatting error in the original document,
- A repetition in a legal database or index,
- Or that the section was referenced in multiple related provisions.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in **section 5 of SOR/2013-161** has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. As such, it should not be relied upon for legal or compliance purposes. Any prior interpretation or application of that section is invalid. For current regulatory requirements, one must refer to the updated or subsequent legislation that replaced or superseded it.

> **Note**: Without the full text of the original section or the specific regulation being repealed, the exact nature of the provision (e.g., related to employment, environmental standards, or taxation) cannot be determined. To obtain that detail, access to the original regulation or the full text of SOR/2013-161 is required.
