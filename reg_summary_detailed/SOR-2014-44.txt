### **Detailed Summary of the Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Ukraine) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

The **Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Ukraine) Regulations** were enacted by the Government of Canada under the authority of the **Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (FAFCFA)**. These regulations are part of Canada’s broader international policy to combat corruption and protect the integrity of foreign governments by freezing the assets of individuals who have misused public office or engaged in corrupt practices.

The key legislative provisions invoked are **subsections 4(1) to (3)** of the FAFCFA, which empower the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to:

- Identify and list politically exposed persons (PEPs) from a foreign country;
- Freeze their assets located in Canada or elsewhere;
- Prohibit transactions involving such persons’ property.

This action is justified based on several critical conditions:

- Ukraine has formally notified Canada in writing that certain individuals listed in the regulations have **misappropriated state property** or **acquired property improperly** through their official positions or personal/business relationships.
- The Governor in Council has determined that each listed individual is a **politically exposed foreign person (PEP)** in relation to Ukraine — meaning they hold or have held high-level government positions or are closely associated with such figures.
- There is an **internal political instability or uncertain political situation in Ukraine**, increasing the risk of corruption, misuse of power, or potential harm to international relations.
- The freezing of assets is deemed to be **in the interest of international relations**, particularly in supporting Ukraine’s democratic institutions and deterring corrupt behavior.

#### **2. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **prevent financial transactions involving the property of corrupt foreign officials** from Ukraine, thereby:

- Protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity;
- Preventing the laundering or misuse of public funds;
- Supporting international efforts to combat corruption;
- Reinforcing Canada’s commitment to global anti-corruption standards.

#### **3. Key Provisions (Section 2)**

Section 2 establishes specific prohibitions on dealings with the listed politically exposed persons (PEPs):

> A person in Canada or a Canadian living outside Canada must **not**:
>
> 1. **Deal directly or indirectly** in any property (regardless of location) belonging to any of the listed PEPs;
> 2. **Enter into or facilitate** any financial transaction related to such a dealing;
> 3. **Provide financial services or related services** (e.g., banking, investment advice, insurance, transfer services) in respect of the property of any listed PEP.

These restrictions apply **universally** — whether the property is located in Canada or abroad — and apply to both individuals and entities (such as banks or financial institutions).

---

#### **4. Regulatory Effect and Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** (i.e., officially recorded in the federal register).
- For the purpose of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, these regulations **apply immediately upon enactment**, even before being published in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures that the measures are effective without delay, which is crucial in urgent situations involving corruption and political instability.
