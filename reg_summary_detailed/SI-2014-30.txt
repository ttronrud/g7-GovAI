The regulation in question, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, establishes two key provisions regarding the recognition of service in the Canadian honours system:

1. **Authorization to Accept and Wear the Arctic Star**:  
   The regulation authorizes Canadian citizens to accept and wear the Arctic Star as a commemorative honour. This recognition is specifically awarded to individuals who rendered honourable service during the Second World War. The Arctic Star was originally established as a campaign medal to acknowledge the contributions of Canadian military personnel who served in Arctic regions during the war, particularly in the North Atlantic and Arctic theatres. By authorizing its acceptance and wear, the regulation formalizes the right of eligible individuals and their families to display the medal as a symbol of their service and sacrifice during that pivotal period of history.

2. **Order of Precedence Update**:  
   The regulation directs that the Arctic Star be placed **immediately after the Air Crew Europe Star** in the official order of precedence within the Canadian Honours System. This reordering is significant because it reflects the evolving recognition of various military campaigns and contributions. The Air Crew Europe Star, which honours aircrew who served in Europe during the Second World War, is already a recognized and respected award. Placing the Arctic Star just after it ensures that service in the Arctic theatre—though geographically distinct—is given appropriate recognition in the formal hierarchy of Canadian honours, thereby acknowledging the unique and vital role of Arctic operations during the war.

**Context and Significance**:  
This regulation is part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to ensure that all forms of service during the Second World War are appropriately honoured. It reflects a commitment to historical accuracy and inclusivity in the recognition of military contributions. By placing the Arctic Star in a defined position within the honours system, the government affirms the importance of Arctic operations, which were critical to Allied strategies in northern regions, including supply lines, anti-submarine warfare, and reconnaissance.

In summary, this regulation not only enables Canadians to formally wear the Arctic Star as a mark of honour for their wartime service but also integrates it into the official structure of Canadian honours, ensuring its visibility and respect within the national recognition framework.
