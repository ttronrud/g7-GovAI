**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Indians and Webequie Band on the Webequie Indian Settlement Remission Order* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *Indians and Webequie Band on the Webequie Indian Settlement Remission Order*, was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, under **subsection 23(2) of the Financial Administration Act**. The purpose is to provide **tax remission** (i.e., a reduction or cancellation of tax liability) for certain income taxes and goods and services taxes (GST) paid or payable by **Indians** and the **Webequie Band** in relation to the **Webequie Indian Settlement**.

The order recognizes that the Webequie Indian Settlement — although not officially classified as a reserve — functions similarly to one in certain respects, and thus, taxpayers should not be penalized with higher tax burdens simply because the settlement is not legally designated as a reserve under the *Indian Act*.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Band** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — refers to a group of Indians living on a reserve or in a settlement with a recognized status. |
| **Indian** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — a person who is recognized as an Indian under Canadian law. |
| **Reserve** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — a designated area of land set aside for the use and benefit of an Indian band. |
| **Webequie Indian Settlement** | A specific geographic area located on **Winisk Lake**, in the **District of Kenora, Patricia Portion, Ontario**, approximately **27,195 hectares** in size, including the **Webequie Airport lands**. It is explicitly **not a reserve**, despite its status as a community of Indigenous people. |

> The settlement is defined by precise geographic coordinates: **52°59′N latitude and 88°11′W longitude**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
To correct a perceived inequity: **Indigenous individuals and the Webequie Band** are subject to higher tax liabilities under federal tax laws because the Webequie Indian Settlement is **not legally recognized as a reserve**. However, in practice, it functions like a reserve in terms of community structure, governance, and economic activity.

This regulation provides **tax remission** to offset the additional taxes that would have been payable **if the settlement had been treated as a reserve** throughout the relevant taxation year.

## **Main Provisions**

---

### **Section 1: Income Tax Remission (for Individuals and Bands)**

> *Remission is granted to an Indian taxpayer for the 1992 taxation year and each year thereafter, of the amount by which the taxes, interest, and penalties paid or payable under the Income Tax Act exceed what would have been payable if the Webequie Indian Settlement had been a reserve for the entire year.*

#### Key Elements:
- Applies to **all Indians** who are residents of the Webequie Indian Settlement.
- Covers **income tax**, **interest**, and **penalties**.
- The remission is calculated as:
  > **Actual tax paid** – **Tax that would have been payable if the settlement were a reserve**
- The difference (if positive) is refunded or remitted.
- Applies starting from the **1992 taxation year** and continues annually thereafter.

#### Rationale:
Under Canadian tax law, individuals living on reserves are entitled to certain tax exemptions or preferential treatment (e.g., exemption from income tax on certain types of income or reduced rates). Since Webequie is not a reserve, these benefits are not automatically granted, leading to overpayment of taxes. This order compensates for that disparity.

### **Section 2: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Remission (for Individuals and the Band)**

> *Remission is granted to an Indian individual who receives a taxable supply made on or after the date this Order comes into force, of the amount by which the GST paid or payable exceeds the GST that would have been payable if the Webequie Indian Settlement were a reserve.*

#### Applies to:
- **Individual Indians** receiving a taxable supply (e.g., goods or services) after the Order comes into effect.
- The **Webequie Band** as a recipient of taxable supplies made on or after **January 1, 1992**.

#### Key Elements:
- The remission is equal to the **excess GST** that would have been payable **if the settlement were a reserve**.
- The calculation is:
  > **GST actually paid** – **GST that would have been payable if the settlement were a reserve**
- If the difference is positive, the excess is refunded.

#### Rationale:
GST is generally applied to most goods and services in Canada. However, individuals living on reserves are often exempt from GST on certain supplies. Because Webequie is not a reserve, residents face higher GST burdens. This provision aims to correct that imbalance.

---

### **Section 3: Conditions for Remission**

> *Remission under Sections 6 and 7 (Income Tax and GST) is granted only if a written application is submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within four years of the date the tax was paid.*

#### Requirements:
- A **written application** must be filed with the Minister of National Revenue.
- Must be submitted **within four years** of the date the tax was paid or incurred.
- Failure to apply within this timeframe **results in the loss of the right to remission**.

> This creates a time-bound administrative process, ensuring accountability and timely resolution.

---

### **Section 4: Interpretation and Application**

- **"Tax"** in the income tax context refers to taxes under **Parts I, I.1, and I.2 of the Income Tax Act**.
- **"Tax"** in the GST context refers to the **Goods and Services Tax imposed under Division II of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**.
- All other terms used in the order are interpreted according to their meaning in the relevant legislation (Income Tax Act or Excise Tax Act), unless otherwise defined.

## **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Equity and Justice**:
   - The regulation reflects a policy of **equity** in tax treatment for Indigenous communities.
   - It acknowledges that the **Webequie Indian Settlement**, despite not being a reserve, operates with many of the same functions, needs, and socio-economic conditions as a reserve.

2. **Recognition of Status**:
   - The government recognizes that **non-reserve Indigenous settlements** should not be treated as if they are outside the scope of Indigenous rights or benefits.

3. **Corrective Measure**:
   - It serves as a **corrective measure** to prevent financial harm to individuals and bands due to administrative classification errors.

4. **Administrative Burden**:
   - The requirement for a **written application within four years** introduces a procedural safeguard to prevent abuse and ensure that claims are processed efficiently.

5. **Historical Context**:
   - This Order was issued in **1991**, reflecting a broader trend in Canadian policy during the 1990s to improve the recognition and rights of Indigenous peoples, including financial and legal recognition.

## **Who Is Eligible?**

| Group | Eligibility |
|------|-------------|
| **Individual Indians** | Must reside in or be connected to the Webequie Indian Settlement and have paid or incurred income tax or GST during the relevant years. Must apply within 4 years of tax payment. |
| **Webequie Band** | As a collective entity, the band is eligible for remission on GST paid or payable for taxable supplies received on or after January 1, 1992. Must apply within 4 years of tax payment. |

> Note: The individual must be an **Indian** as defined in the *Indian Act*.

---

## **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Taxes paid before the Order came into force.
  - Taxes related to non-Indigenous individuals or entities.
- The remission is **only for the excess** over what would have been payable if the settlement were a reserve — not a full refund.
- The **four-year deadline** for applications is strict and non-negotiable.

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation is a significant example of **federal recognition of Indigenous status and community rights**, even in the absence of formal reserve designation. By providing **tax remission** based on the principle that the Webequie Indian Settlement functions like a reserve, the government acknowledges the **economic and social realities** faced by Indigenous communities.

It serves both as a **corrective action** to prevent undue financial burden and as a **symbolic gesture** of reconciliation and equity in tax policy.
