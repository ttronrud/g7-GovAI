Certainly. Below is a **detailed and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

---

## **Outward Processing Remission Order (Textiles and Apparel)**  
**Issued under Section 115a of the Customs Tariff**  
**S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 142(e) and 145(2)(j)**  
**S.C. 1997, c. 36**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation establishes a **customs duty remission program** for **apparel and textiles** produced in Canada that are **exported to certain countries or territories** and later **imported back into Canada**—a process known as **outward processing**. The key objective is to **support Canadian textile and apparel industries** by reducing or eliminating customs duties on imported apparel that contains Canadian-origin textiles, provided specific conditions are met.

The remission applies only when:
- The apparel is shipped **directly from Canada** to a designated country or territory,
- It **does not undergo further processing** outside that country or territory,
- And it is **re-imported directly into Canada**.

This encourages Canadian manufacturers to export intermediate or finished apparel products to international markets without incurring full customs duties upon re-entry.

### **Eligibility for Duty Remission**

A remission of customs duties is granted **only if** the following conditions are satisfied:

#### 1. **Canadian-Origin Textiles in Apparel**
- The apparel must contain **textiles produced in Canada**.
- These textiles must be **exported from Canada** to a listed country or territory **on or after the date the Order comes into force**.

#### 2. **Presence of Imported Materials (if any)**
If the Canadian textiles contain **imported materials**, remission is granted **only if**:
- The imported materials have undergone a **sufficient transformation** such that:
  - Their **tariff classification has changed**, or
  - They are considered **"bleached"** for tariff classification purposes (i.e., materially altered in form or function).
- The **value of the imported materials**, calculated under sections 48–53 of the Customs Act, is **less than 50%** of the **value of the Canadian textiles** incorporated into the apparel.

> 🔍 *This ensures that the Canadian content is substantial and that the imported components do not dominate the value of the final product.*

#### 3. **Amount of Remission**
The remission amount is the **lesser of two values**:
- The **value of the Canadian textiles** used in the apparel (FOB value), or  
- The **customs duties paid or payable** on the imported apparel.

> 💡 This caps the remission at the actual duty cost, preventing overcompensation.
