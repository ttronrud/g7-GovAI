---

### **Overview**

This regulation, made under **paragraph 657(1)(f)** and **subsection 660.9(1)** of the *Canada Shipping Act*, establishes the **procedures, equipment, and resource requirements** that **response organizations** and **oil handling facilities** must meet in order to effectively respond to oil pollution incidents. It was originally enacted on **August 15, 1995**, and is now **repealed** by **SOR/2019-252, s. 15** (as of 2019). This summary provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the content, structure, and intent of the regulation prior to its repeal.

## **Key Definitions**

The regulation introduces several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Shipping Act*, which provides the legal framework for preventing and responding to oil pollution. |
| **Area of Environmental Sensitivities** | A region containing endangered species, threatened ecosystems, or areas of high cultural or socio-economic value (e.g., wetlands, national parks, Indigenous lands). |
| **Designated Port** | A specific port identified in **Schedule I to the Response Organizations Standards** (TP 12401) where a response organization provides services. |
| **Geographical Area** | The region defined by a response organization as the area in which it offers oil spill response services. |
| **Oil** | As defined in subsection 660.2(1) of the Act — includes crude oil, refined products, and other hydrocarbons. |
| **Operating Environment** | One of three environments: **sheltered waters**, **unsheltered waters**, or **shoreline**. |
| **Sheltered Waters** | Waters where oil recovery operations can be conducted effectively without interference from weather (e.g., bays, harbors). |
| **Unsheltered Waters** | Open seas or waters where environmental conditions (e.g., wind, waves) significantly disrupt recovery operations. |
| **Shoreline** | The area from extreme low tide to the back shore, potentially affected by storm surges. |
| **Treat** | To restore an affected environment to its pre-incident condition using the least environmentally damaging methods. |
| **Response Organizations Standards (ROS)** | The foundational document: *Transport Canada TP 12401*, published August 1995, outlining minimum capabilities, procedures, and training standards. This regulation implements and enforces those standards. |

## **Core Requirements for Response Organizations**

### 1. **Demonstration of Capability**
A response organization must demonstrate, in its **response plan**, that it can meet the **procedures, equipment, and resources** required under **section 4** of the regulation — specifically tailored to its **geographical area**.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that only organizations with proven capacity are certified to respond to oil spills.

---

### 2. **Mandatory Elements of the Response Plan**

The response plan must include the following detailed information:

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Organization Details** | Name and address of the organization and its geographical area. |
| **Tiered Response Capacity** | Total quantity of oil for which the organization is certified, based on the tiered system in **section 2 of the ROS** (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2). |
| **Personnel List** | Names of all individuals available for spill response. |
| **Notification Contacts** | Names of individuals to be notified immediately upon a spill. |
| **Training Records** | Description of training provided to personnel (basic oil spill response and other relevant training). |
| **Volunteer Training** | Details of training offered to volunteers who may be mobilized at short notice. |
| **Oil Spill Exercise Programme** | A structured program to evaluate the effectiveness of procedures, equipment, and response strategies. Exercises must be coordinated with ships, oil handling facilities, or the **Canadian Coast Guard (CCG)**. |
| **Equipment Lists** | - Types and quantities of equipment available at each **designated port** for **Tier 1 response**. <br> - Equipment for **simultaneous response** across all operating environments (sheltered, unsheltered, shoreline). <br> - Equipment for **scaring birds** away from oil-affected areas and support for **wildlife rehabilitation**. |
| **Environmental Sensitivity Measures** | Specific actions to protect and treat areas of environmental sensitivity (e.g., endangered species habitats). |
| **Treatment & Recovery Procedures** | Detailed steps for treating oil-affected areas and restoring them to pre-spill conditions. |
| **Notification Procedures** | How and when the named individuals will be notified of a spill. |
| **Health & Safety Measures** | Protocols to protect personnel, volunteers, and others involved, in compliance with **federal and provincial health and safety laws**. |
| **Plan Update Procedures** | How and when the plan will be reviewed and updated (e.g., annually or after major changes). |

> *Note:* The plan must **incorporate any contingency plans** issued by the **Canadian Coast Guard** for the geographical area.

### 3. **Response Procedures for a Spill of Specified Quantity**

For a spill of a certain size, the response must meet the following requirements:

- **Timeframe Compliance**: The response must occur within the time limits set in **section 3 of the ROS**.
- **Shoreline Treatment Capacity**: The organization must treat **at least the minimum number of meters of shoreline per day** as specified in **section 4 of the ROS**.
- **On-Water Recovery Duration**: The maximum number of days required to complete on-water recovery must not exceed the limit in **section 5 of the ROS**.
- **Coordination Requirement**: The operation must be managed in coordination with:
  - The **Canadian Coast Guard (CCG)**
  - Federal, provincial, and other environmental protection agencies.
- **Simultaneous Response Strategy**: Appropriate strategies must be in place to respond effectively in **all affected operating environments** (sheltered, unsheltered, shoreline).
- **Operational Capability in Unsheltered Waters**: Equipment must be operable in **Beaufort Force 4 conditions** (moderate winds and waves) when responding in unsheltered waters.
- **Allocation of Response Capability**: The response capability in **primary and enhanced response areas** must be proportioned according to the **percentage of tiered capability** outlined in **Schedule II of the ROS**.
- **Equipment Provision**: All required equipment and resources must be made available to those managing the response.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that response efforts are timely, effective, and environmentally sound across all conditions.

---

### 4. **Equipment and Resource Requirements**

Required equipment includes:

- Equipment appropriate for the specific type of oil spill and environmental conditions.
- **Primary and secondary temporary storage capacities**, as defined in **section 6 of the ROS**.

> *Example:* Storage tanks to contain spilled oil temporarily until it can be processed or cleaned up.
