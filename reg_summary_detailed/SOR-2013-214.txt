**Detailed Summary of the CEFTA Verification of Origin of Exported Goods Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The *CEFTA Verification of Origin of Exported Goods Regulations* are a set of rules introduced under the authority of the **Customs Act** (specifically **paragraphs 167.1(b)a and (d)a**) and are directly linked to a public announcement known as **Customs Notice 09-014**, issued on **June 29, 2009**.

#### Key Legislative Foundations:
- **Customs Notice 09-014**: This notice provided the framework for implementing rules related to verifying the origin of goods exported from Canada to **EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries** under the **Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)**.
- The regulations giving effect to this notice came into force on **July 1, 2009**, as specified in the notice itself.
- The regulations are also **consequential** upon an amendment to the *Customs Act* — specifically, **section 97.201c**, which was enacted by **section 28 of the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2009, c. 6)**.
- This amendment to the *Customs Act* came into force on **July 1, 2009**, establishing the legal basis for verifying the origin of goods under CEFTA.

Thus, the regulations are a direct implementation of both:
- The public policy of ensuring **accurate origin declarations** for goods exported to EFTA states under preferential tariff treatment, and
- The legal changes introduced by the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a **clear, consistent, and transparent process** for verifying the **origin of goods** exported from Canada to EFTA countries, ensuring compliance with the **origin requirements** of the CEFTA.

This verification is essential because:
- Preferential tariff treatment (lower or zero tariffs) under CEFTA is granted only to goods that meet strict **origin criteria** (e.g., substantial transformation in a designated country).
- Without proper verification, there is a risk of fraud or misrepresentation, which could undermine trade benefits and compromise the integrity of the agreement.

### **3. Definitions in the Regulations**

The following key terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency in application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 28, s. 31(1); R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)) |
| **Customs administration** | The competent authority within an EFTA state responsible for administering its customs laws and regulations. |
| **Goods** | Goods for which preferential tariff treatment under CEFTA is claimed. |
| **Verification letter** | A formal letter sent to an exporter or producer requesting information about the origin of goods. |
| **Verification questionnaire** | A standardized form or questionnaire that collects information about the origin of goods. |
| **Verification visit** | An official entry into the premises of an exporter or producer to physically inspect goods and verify their origin. |

---

### **4. Methods of Origin Verification**

Under these regulations, a verification of origin may be conducted through **one or more of the following methods**:

1. **Verification Visit**  
   - An inspector from Canadian customs may enter the **premises of the exporter or producer** to physically examine goods and verify their origin.
   - This is the most direct method of verification and is governed by strict procedural rules.

2. **Review of a Verification Questionnaire**  
   - A completed questionnaire submitted by the exporter or producer can be reviewed to assess whether the origin claim is supported by evidence.

3. **Review of a Written Response to a Verification Letter**  
   - If the exporter or producer responds in writing to a verification letter, that response can be used as part of the verification process.

4. **Other Information Received**  
   - Any additional information provided by the exporter or producer (e.g., invoices, shipping records, production logs) may be considered, provided it supports the origin claim.

> **Note**: These alternative methods are acceptable **in addition to** a verification visit, not instead of it.

---

### **5. Scope of Verification Visits**

- The **premises or place** that may be entered during a verification visit is limited to:
  - The **exporter** or
  - The **producer** of the goods.
- This ensures that inspections are focused on those responsible for the production or export of the goods.

---

### **6. Procedures for Conducting a Verification Visit**

#### a) **Written Notice Requirement**
- A customs officer **must send a written notice** to the exporter or producer before conducting a verification visit.
- This notice must clearly state:
  - The intention to conduct a visit,
  - The purpose (origin verification),
  - The date and time of the visit,
  - The location of the premises involved.

> This requirement ensures transparency, provides due process, and protects the rights of the exporter.

#### b) **Right of EFTA Customs Administration to Observe**
- If the **customs administration of the importing EFTA country** requests it, the exporter must **permit an observer** from that EFTA customs authority to be present during the visit.
- This promotes **mutual trust and transparency** between Canada and EFTA partners, and supports the integrity of the origin verification process.

---

### **7. Submission of Opinions and Supporting Documents**

- Any opinion or supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer must be submitted via a method that **produces confirmation of receipt** (e.g., email with read receipt, certified mail, electronic transmission with timestamp).
- This ensures that all communications and submissions are **traceable and verifiable**, reducing the risk of loss or non-receipt.

---

### **8. Effective Dates**

- **All provisions of the regulations, except Section 7**, are deemed to have **come into force on July 1, 2009** — the date the amendment to the *Customs Act* (section 97.201c) took effect.
- **Section 7**, which deals with the **registration and coming into force** of the regulations, comes into force on the **day the regulations are officially registered** in the Canada Gazette.

> This staggered effective date ensures that the regulatory framework is implemented in alignment with the legislative and administrative timeline.

---

### **9. Legal Basis and Enforcement**

These regulations are made under:
- **Section 97.201c** of the *Customs Act*,
- **Subsections 164(1)** and **164(1.1)** of the *Customs Act*,
- And **paragraphs 167.1(b)a and (d)a** of the *Customs Act*.

These provisions empower the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (through the Governor in Council) to issue regulations that support the implementation of CEFTA origin rules and ensure compliance with international trade obligations.

### **10. Significance and Impact**

The regulations serve several important functions:

- **Enforce Origin Rules**: Ensure that goods claiming preferential treatment under CEFTA actually meet the required origin criteria.
- **Enhance Transparency and Accountability**: Through written notices, observer rights, and documented submissions.
- **Strengthen International Trade Relations**: By providing a clear, fair, and cooperative framework between Canada and EFTA countries.
- **Support Fair Trade Practices**: Prevent fraud, protect Canadian interests, and maintain the credibility of the CEFTA agreement.

### **Conclusion**

By combining **on-site inspections**, **document review**, and **international cooperation**, the regulations ensure that preferential tariff treatment is granted only to goods that genuinely meet the origin requirements of the Canada–EFTA Free Trade Agreement.

They represent a critical step in maintaining the integrity of international trade agreements and protecting Canada’s trade interests in the global market.
