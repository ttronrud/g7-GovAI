**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulatory instrument is a formal transfer of powers, duties, and functions between Canadian federal ministers, grounded in the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. Below is a comprehensive and detailed summary of its content, context, legal basis, and implications.

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

- **Governing Legislation**:  
  The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision empowers the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) to transfer powers, duties, and functions of a minister from one department to another, as part of administrative restructuring.

- **Prior Transfer (June 25, 1993)**:  
  Prior to this regulation, on **June 25, 1993**, by **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1487**, the following changes were implemented:
  - All powers, duties, and functions of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** under any Act of Parliament were transferred to the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**.
  - The **Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)** and the **Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (DCCA)** were amalgamated under the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**.

  This reorganization consolidated responsibilities and streamlined governance, placing consumer and corporate affairs functions under the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio.

### **2. Purpose of the Current Regulation**

- It specifically transfers **all powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** under the **Hazardous Materials Information Review Act (HMIRA)** to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare**.

### **4. Context of the Hazardous Materials Information Review Act (HMIRA)**

- HMIRA is a federal law that governs the **collection, review, and dissemination of information** about hazardous materials, particularly in the context of safety, environmental protection, and public health.
- The Act typically involves:
  - Assessing the risks of hazardous substances.
  - Reviewing labeling, safety data sheets, and reporting requirements.
  - Ensuring that information is accessible to regulators, industry, and the public.
- The transfer of these functions to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** suggests a shift in policy focus—aligning hazardous materials oversight with **public health and safety**, rather than industrial or scientific development.

---

### **5. Implications of the Transfer**

- **Policy Realignment**:  
  The move reflects a strategic shift in how hazardous materials are managed. By placing HMIRA under the health portfolio, the government signals a prioritization of **public health and environmental safety** over industrial innovation or economic development.

- **Administrative Efficiency**:  
  The transfer ensures that decisions related to hazardous materials—such as exposure risks, emergency preparedness, and health impacts—are managed by a minister with direct responsibility for health outcomes and wellness.

- **Interdepartmental Coordination**:  
  This transfer may improve coordination between health, environment, and industry sectors, particularly in cases involving chemical exposure, workplace safety, or emergency response.

- **Continuity of Operations**:  
  While the ministerial responsibility changes, the **legal obligations and administrative responsibilities** under HMIRA remain intact. The Department of Health and Welfare will assume all duties, including enforcement, review processes, and stakeholder engagement.

---

### **6. Legal and Procedural Validity**

- The transfer is valid because:
  - It is authorized by **paragraph 2(a)** of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
  - It follows a prior administrative restructuring (P.C. 1993-1487).
  - It is issued by the **Governor in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, as required by the Act.
- The regulation is published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II**, on **page 3233**, which is the official publication for federal statutory instruments, ensuring transparency and legal enforceability.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It transfers the responsibility for overseeing hazardous materials information—under the *Hazardous Materials Information Review Act*—from the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare**. This shift aligns with broader public health priorities and ensures that hazardous materials policy is managed within a health and safety framework, enhancing accountability and responsiveness to public health risks.

The action is legally sound, procedurally compliant, and consistent with the intent of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act to enable efficient, effective, and responsive governance.

**Note**: The regulation does not alter the substantive provisions of HMIRA itself, only the ministerial responsibility for its implementation. The Act’s requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and reporting obligations remain unchanged.
