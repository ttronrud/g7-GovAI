The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: **Repealed**
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2017-84* (SOR/2017-84)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that instrument
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect upon the publication of SOR/2017-84, which was issued on **April 13, 2017** (in Canada, statutory instruments are typically published in the Canada Gazette).

### What This Means:

- The specific regulation previously referenced (which is not named in your query) was **officially removed from the legal framework** effective April 13, 2017.
- Section 1 of SOR/2017-84 contains the legal provision that **cancels or revokes** the prior regulation. This is a common practice in legislative updates when a rule is outdated, redundant, or superseded by a new policy or law.
- Since the regulation is **repealed**, it no longer applies, and any legal obligations or requirements it previously imposed are **no longer in force**.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or reform effort, possibly to streamline regulations, eliminate duplication, or align with updated policy objectives.

### Important Notes:
- The absence of a named regulation (e.g., "Regulation 12-34" or "The Ontario Parking By-law") in your query makes it impossible to provide a detailed summary of the **substance** of the repealed regulation (such as its purpose, scope, or provisions).
- Without the original regulation’s title or content, the summary is limited to the **legal status and procedural context** of the repeal.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, meaning it is no longer in effect. There is no active legal content or enforceable provisions associated with it. To understand the original purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to refer to the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal, which is not available in your query.

If you can provide the **title or number** of the original regulation (e.g., "The Ontario Parking Regulation," or "Regulation 123/2010"), I can offer a more detailed summary of its content and intent before repeal.
