### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in Nunavut (Qausuittuq National Park)**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Procedural Basis**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**.

This provision allows the federal government to withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial disposition) for designated purposes—such as establishing a national park.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **establish the proposed Qausuittuq National Park** in Nunavut by **withdrawing certain tracts of territorial land from disposal**. This ensures that these lands will be preserved for conservation, ecological protection, and cultural significance, particularly in the context of Inuit land rights and environmental stewardship.

---

#### **3. Scope of Withdrawal**
- The **specific tracts of territorial land** listed in the attached schedule are withdrawn from disposal.
- The withdrawal includes:
  - The **surface rights** (land ownership and use)
  - The **subsurface rights** (rights to minerals, hydrocarbons, and other underground resources)

- The withdrawal is effective for a period of **five years**, beginning on the day the Order is made.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This withdrawal does *not* prevent all forms of mineral or resource activities. Certain exceptions are explicitly stated.

#### **4. Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Where Section 2 Does Not Apply)**

Despite the general withdrawal, **Section 2 of the Territorial Lands Act** (which normally prevents disposal of land) **does not apply** to the following specific activities:

| Activity | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mineral claims located before the Order's date** | A prospecting permit holder who located a mineral claim prior to the Order's date is not barred from recording or maintaining that claim. |
| **Recording of existing mineral claims** | Any claim that was already recorded before the Order’s date remains valid and not subject to disposal. |
| **Leases for recorded claims** | A lease granted under the **Nunavut Mining Regulations** to a person holding a recorded mineral claim (even if the lease covers part of the withdrawn area) is exempt. |
| **Significant discovery licences** | If a significant discovery licence under the **Canada Petroleum Resources Act** is issued to someone who already held an exploration licence before the Order, and the licence covers the same area, it is exempt. |
| **Production licences** | Production licences issued to holders of prior exploration or significant discovery licences (issued before the Order) covering the same area are exempt. |
| **Surface leases** | Surface leases issued to holders of recorded claims (under Nunavut Mining Regulations) or interests under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act are exempt—**if required to allow exercise of rights** under the claim or interest. |
| **Renewals of interests** | Renewals of existing mineral or resource interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not affected. |

> ✅ These exceptions ensure that **existing, pre-existing rights and ongoing exploration or development activities are not disrupted** by the withdrawal.
