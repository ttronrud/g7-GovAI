**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee Security and Confidentiality Regulations**

**Regulatory Provisions:**
- **Enactment Authority:**  
  These regulations were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada, under subsection 21(1) of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act* (RCMP Act).  
  This legislative authority allows the federal government to establish rules governing the operations and responsibilities of certain bodies established under the RCMP Act, particularly those involving sensitive information.

- **Regulation Title:**  
  The regulations are officially titled the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee Security and Confidentiality Regulations*.  
  They are published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1986, Chapter 11, Section 11 (S.C. 1986, c. 11, s. 11), and are commonly referred to as the "External Review Committee Security and Confidentiality Regulations."

### **Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure the **security and confidentiality** of sensitive information that members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee (the "Committee") and individuals employed by the Committee may access in the course of their duties.

The Committee was established under the RCMP Act to provide an external, independent review of certain RCMP activities, particularly those involving complaints or investigations that may affect public trust. As such, it handles information that could be sensitive, potentially compromising individual privacy, operational integrity, or national security if disclosed improperly.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Obligation to Comply with Security and Confidentiality Requirements**
Every member of the Committee and every person employed by it who is required to receive or obtain information related to matters under the RCMP Act **must comply with all applicable security and confidentiality requirements**.

This means that:
- Individuals must follow the same standards of confidentiality as those who typically have access to such information (e.g., RCMP officers, investigators, or other government officials handling sensitive data).
- These standards may include restrictions on disclosure, limitations on copying or sharing, and requirements for secure handling and storage of information.

#### 2. **Oath or Affirmation of Secrecy**
All members and employees of the Committee are required to take either:
- The **Oath of Secrecy**, or  
- The **Affirmation of Secrecy**,  
as set out in the Schedule to the Regulations.

This sworn commitment is a legally binding obligation that reinforces the duty of confidentiality.

### **Content of the Oath/Affirmation of Secrecy**

The oath/affirmation states that:

> "I, [Name], solemnly swear/affirm that I will not, without due authority, disclose or make known to any person not legally entitled thereto any information acquired by me by reason of the duties performed by me on behalf of or under the direction of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee or by reason of any office or employment held by me pursuant to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act."

#### Key Elements of the Commitment:
- **Prohibition on Unauthorized Disclosure:** Individuals are strictly prohibited from disclosing any information they acquire in the course of their duties to persons who are not legally entitled to it.
- **Definition of "Information":** Includes any data obtained through their role in the Committee, whether directly related to investigations, complaints, internal reviews, or other official functions.
- **Basis of Access:** The obligation applies both to duties performed on behalf of the Committee and to any office or employment under the RCMP Act.
- **"Due Authority":** Disclosure is permitted only if authorized by law or by formal written instructions from a designated authority (e.g., the Committee Chair or designated official), ensuring that exceptions are strictly controlled.

### **Legal and Institutional Implications**

- **Enforcement:** Violation of the oath or affirmation may result in legal consequences, including criminal liability under Canadian law (e.g., breach of confidence, unauthorized disclosure of information, or breaches of privacy laws).
- **Accountability:** The requirement ensures that individuals within the Committee are held to high standards of professional and ethical conduct, protecting public trust in the review process.
- **Alignment with RCMP Act Principles:** The regulations reinforce the broader framework of the RCMP Act, which emphasizes transparency, accountability, and the protection of sensitive operational information.

### **Historical and Contextual Background**

These regulations were introduced in 1986, during a period of increasing public scrutiny over law enforcement practices. The establishment of external review mechanisms was part of a broader effort to enhance accountability and ensure that the RCMP operates within legal and ethical boundaries.

The External Review Committee was designed to act independently and transparently, yet with sufficient discretion to protect the integrity of investigations and the privacy of individuals involved. The security and confidentiality provisions ensure that while the Committee can operate independently, it does so without compromising the confidentiality of sensitive information.

### **Conclusion**

The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police External Review Committee Security and Confidentiality Regulations* establish a clear and enforceable framework for protecting sensitive information accessed by members and employees of the Committee. By requiring individuals to take an oath or affirmation of secrecy and to adhere to confidentiality standards equivalent to those of other personnel with access to such information, the regulations:

- Protect the integrity of RCMP operations and investigations,
- Safeguard individual privacy and rights,
- Maintain public confidence in the external review process,
- And uphold the legal and ethical responsibilities of those involved.

These provisions remain a foundational element of the Committee’s operational framework and are critical to ensuring that external reviews are both independent and secure.
