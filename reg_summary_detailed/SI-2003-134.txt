### **Detailed Summary of the Labrador Innu Settlements Remission Order, 2003**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

The **Labrador Innu Settlements Remission Order, 2003** is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make orders that provide tax remissions in the public interest, particularly where there is a historical or socio-political injustice related to land status and taxation.

The Order is designed to **correct unfair tax burdens** imposed on the **Innu people** and their communities—specifically the **Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation** and the **Mushuau Innu First Nation**—because their lands were not recognized as reserves under the Indian Act, despite being occupied and used by Indigenous communities.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms:

- **Band**: As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — a group of Indigenous people recognized as a band under the Act.
- **Indian**: As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — an individual who is recognized as an Indigenous person under the Act.
- **Innu**: A person described in **Section 3** of either the *Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation Band Order* or the *Mushuau Innu First Nation Band Order*.
- **Innu First Nations**: The two First Nations bodies described in Sections 2 of the respective Band Orders — Sheshatshiu and Mushuau.
- **Innu Settlement**: A specific settlement (land parcel) named and described in the Schedule to the Order.
- **Reserve**: As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Indian Act* — land set aside for Indigenous communities under the Act.

> **Important Note**: The Order applies **until** the relevant Innu Settlement is formally set apart as a reserve by an order of the Governor in Council.

#### **3. Scope of Tax Remission**

The Order grants **tax remission** (a refund or offset of taxes) to certain individuals and entities for specific periods and tax types, based on the principle that **if the Innu Settlement had been a reserve**, the tax liability would have been lower because reserve status provides tax exemptions or reduced rates.

##### **Section 7 – Income Tax Remission (for Individuals and First Nations)**

- **Applies to**:
  - An **Innu** (individual) or an **Innu First Nation** (community) with income derived from an Innu Settlement.
- **Tax Year**: 2002 or any fiscal period beginning during the calendar year 2002.
- **Remission Amount**: The difference between:
  - Taxes, interest, and penalties **actually paid or payable**, and
  - Taxes, interest, and penalties that **would have been payable** if the Innu Settlement had been a reserve throughout the year.
- **Conditions**:
  - For an **Innu**: Must have been recognized as an "Indian" during the year.
  - For an **Innu First Nation**: Must have been recognized as a "band" during the year.

> This ensures that individuals and communities who were not legally recognized as Indians or bands under the Indian Act are not penalized by tax laws that treat non-reserve land as taxable.

---

##### **Section 8 – Goods and Services Tax (GST) Remission (for Recipients of Supplies)**

- **Applies to**:
  - An **Innu First Nation** or an **Indian/band** receiving a taxable supply (e.g., goods or services) delivered to an Innu Settlement.
- **Time Period**:
  - For **Innu First Nations**: Supplies made **on or after January 1, 2002**, and **on or before November 20, 2002**.
  - For **Indians or bands**: Supplies made **on or after November 21, 2002** (for Indians) and **January 1, 2002** (for bands).
- **Remission Amount**: The difference between:
  - Tax paid or payable by the recipient, and
  - Tax that would have been payable **if the Innu Settlement had been a reserve** at the time of supply.
- **Condition**: The tax must not have already been rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted under the *Excise Tax Act* or *Financial Administration Act*.

> This addresses the financial burden on businesses or suppliers who provided goods/services to Innu communities, which were not entitled to reserve tax status.

---

##### **Section 11 – Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Remission (for Specific Settlements)**

- **Applies to**:
  - Taxable supplies made to the **Natuashish Settlement** (from **January 1, 2003 to December 10, 2003**).
  - Taxable supplies made to the **Sheshatshiu Settlement** (from **January 1, 2006 to November 22, 2006**).
- **Remission Amount**: The difference between:
  - Tax paid or payable by the recipient, and
  - Tax that would have been payable **if the settlement had been a reserve** at the time of supply.
- **Condition**:
  - Tax must not have been previously remitted or refunded.
  - A **written claim** must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue **within two years** of:
    - The date the tax was paid, **or**
    - The date the Order comes into force — whichever is later.

> These provisions are **time-limited** and apply only to specific settlements and timeframes, reflecting a phased approach to reconciliation.

#### **4. Land Description and Exclusions**

The Order specifies a detailed **geographic parcel of land** in the **Electoral District of Lake Melville, Newfoundland and Labrador**, which constitutes the **Natuashish Innu Settlement**.

##### **Main Parcel (Total Area: 688.941 hectares)**

- **Location**: Lake Melville, near the North West Point Portage and Route 520.
- **Description**:
  - Begins at a point marked **IR1** on the Ordinary High Water Mark of Lake Melville.
  - Follows a series of bearings and distances (totaling over 4,252 meters) to return to the starting point.
- **Excludes**:
  - Specific parcels of land that are **not part of the Innu Settlement** due to private ownership or infrastructure.

##### **Excluded Parcels (Total Area: ~2.0 hectares)**

The Order explicitly **excludes** three parcels of land that are either privately owned or not part of the Innu community:

1. **Highway Route 520 (1.561 hectares)**  
   - A road corridor running along the southern edge of the settlement.
   - Includes a complex curved section with multiple iron bars (IR21 to IR24).
   - Excluded because it is a public infrastructure route.

2. **Land owned by Mrs. Cecil Blake (1.561 hectares)**  
   - Located near the lake’s edge.
   - Described using bearings and distances from Iron Bar #149 to #510.
   - Private ownership excludes it from the Innu Settlement.

3. **Land owned by Judith Norman (0.439 hectares)**  
   - A small parcel near the lake.
   - Begins at Iron Bar #513 and follows a path to return to the same point.
   - Also privately owned.

> These exclusions ensure that only lands **recognized as part of the Innu community** are eligible for remission.

#### **5. Conditions for Remission**

All remissions are subject to **strict conditions** to prevent abuse and ensure compliance:

- **No prior remission**: The tax must not have already been rebated, credited, refunded, or remitted under:
  - *Part IX of the Excise Tax Act* (GST/PST)
  - *Financial Administration Act*
- **Written claim requirement**: For taxes already paid, a **formal written claim** must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within **two years** of:
  - The date of payment, **or**
  - The date the Order comes into force — whichever is later.

> This ensures accountability and provides a clear administrative pathway for claimants.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Public Interest**

The Order is rooted in **historical justice** and **Indigenous rights**:

- The Innu communities were **not formally recognized as bands or Indians** under the *Indian Act*, despite having lived on and managed their traditional lands.
- As a result, their lands were treated as **non-reserve, taxable land**, leading to **unfair tax liabilities**.
- This Order **corrects that inequity** by remitting the difference between actual tax payments and what would have been paid if the land had been recognized as a reserve.

It also reflects a broader **government commitment to reconciliation**, recognizing the **distinct status and rights** of Innu communities in Labrador.
