### **Detailed Summary of the Specialized Financing (Foreign Banks) Regulations**

The **Specialized Financing (Foreign Banks) Regulations**, made under **sections 522.23a and 978b of the Bank Act**, are a set of rules designed to regulate the activities of **foreign banks and entities associated with foreign banks** in Canada, particularly in relation to **specialized financing activities**. These regulations aim to ensure that foreign financial institutions do not engage in or maintain control over certain types of Canadian entities that could pose systemic or consumer protection risks.

They came into force on **October 24, 2001**, upon the enactment of **sections 132 and 183 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (SC 2001, c. 9)**, which amended sections 522.11, 522.23, and 978 of the Bank Act.

- **Ownership by foreign banks or entities associated with foreign banks** of shares or ownership interests in **specialized financing entities** under **paragraph 522.08(1)(b)** of the Bank Act.

The core objective is to **limit foreign bank involvement** in certain types of Canadian financial activities that are considered high-risk or potentially harmful to financial stability or consumer protection, especially those involving **leasing, temporary possession of property, or insurance brokering**.

## **3. Prohibited Activities and Entities**

### **Prohibition on Acquiring Control or Substantial Investment in Certain Canadian Entities**

A **foreign bank or entity associated with a foreign bank** shall **not**, through specialized financing activities, acquire or hold control of, or a substantial investment in, a Canadian entity that:

1. Is **primarily engaged in leasing motor vehicles in Canada** for the purpose of:
   - Extending credit to customers, or
   - Financing a customer’s acquisition of a motor vehicle.

2. Is **primarily engaged in providing temporary possession of personal property** (including motor vehicles) to customers in Canada **for a purpose other than financing** the customer’s acquisition of the property.

3. Acts as an **insurance broker or agent in Canada**.

> **Rationale**: These activities are seen as potentially risky due to their exposure to consumer credit, vehicle financing, and insurance fraud, and may create systemic vulnerabilities or conflicts of interest.

---

## **4. Maximum Holding Period: 13 Consecutive Years**

A foreign bank or entity associated with a foreign bank shall **not** hold control of, or a substantial investment in, a Canadian entity for **more than 13 consecutive years**.

> This restriction limits long-term exposure and ensures that foreign financial institutions do not become entrenched in specific sectors, reducing the risk of over-reliance or market distortion.

> **Important exceptions**:
- If a specialized financing entity acquired control of or held a substantial investment in an entity **before becoming that entity**, that prior period **does not count** toward the 13-year limit.
- A specialized financing entity **controlled by another specialized financing entity** (e.g., a subsidiary of a subsidiary) is **excluded** from the 13-year calculation.

---

## **5. Financial Thresholds: $250 Million Balance Sheet Value Limit**

There are **two key financial thresholds** of **$250 million in aggregate balance sheet value** that restrict foreign bank and associated entity investments in Canadian specialized financing entities.

---

### **(A) For a Foreign Bank**

A foreign bank shall **not** acquire or hold control of, or a substantial investment in, a Canadian entity if the **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the following entities exceeds **$250 million**:

- The foreign bank itself  
- Entities associated with the foreign bank  
- Specialized financing entities of the foreign bank  
- Specialized financing entities of entities associated with the foreign bank  

> This cap prevents foreign banks from accumulating excessive exposure through their network of affiliated entities.

---

### **(B) For an Entity Associated with a Foreign Bank**

An entity associated with a foreign bank shall **not** acquire or hold control of, or a substantial investment in, a Canadian entity if the **aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the following exceeds **$250 million**:

- The entity associated with the foreign bank  
- The foreign bank  
- Any other entities associated with the foreign bank  
- Specialized financing entities of the foreign bank  
- Specialized financing entities of the entity associated with the foreign bank  
- Specialized financing entities of any other entities associated with the foreign bank  

> This ensures that even indirect investments (through affiliated entities) are subject to the same financial limits.

## **6. Restrictions on Investment in Specialized Financing Entities**

### **(A) Foreign Bank Restrictions on Specialized Financing Entities**

A foreign bank shall **not** acquire or hold control of, or a substantial investment in, a specialized financing entity if:

  - The foreign bank  
  - An entity associated with the foreign bank  
  - Any other specialized financing entity of the foreign bank  
  - A specialized financing entity of an entity associated with the foreign bank

> **Exception**: A specialized financing entity **controlled by another specialized financing entity** (e.g., a subsidiary of a subsidiary) is **not counted** in the 13-year period.
