**Detailed Summary of the *Food and Drug Regulations* (as provided)**

### **Overview**

The *Food and Drug Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Regulations") are a set of administrative rules established under the *Food and Drugs Act* (the "Act") to ensure the safety, quality, composition, strength, potency, purity, and labeling of food, drugs, vitamins, and cosmetics in Canada. These regulations provide detailed standards and requirements for manufacturers, distributors, importers, and inspectors, with a strong emphasis on consumer protection, transparency, and compliance.

> **Note**: Some sections have been repealed or amended over time (e.g., references to the Director, manufacturer, or principal display panel). This summary reflects the current version of the regulations as presented, incorporating only active provisions and relevant definitions.

## **Labeling Requirements**

### **1. Language Requirements**
- **All required statements on drug labels** must be in **both English and French** if the drug is available for **sale without prescription in open self-selection areas**.
