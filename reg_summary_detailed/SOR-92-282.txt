**Detailed Summary of the Resident Canadian (Banks) Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 46)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Resident Canadian (Banks) Regulations*, made under the authority of the **Bank Act** and specifically pursuant to **paragraph (b) of the definition of "resident Canadian" in section 2** and **section 559 of the Bank Act**, establish a legal framework to determine which **Canadian citizens who are not ordinarily resident in Canada** are still considered **resident Canadians** for regulatory purposes — particularly in relation to banking operations and supervision.

These regulations were enacted on **June 1, 1992**, and are intended to ensure that certain Canadian citizens residing abroad are still treated as "resident Canadians" under the Bank Act, thereby maintaining regulatory oversight over Canadian-owned or controlled financial institutions and their operations.

The regulations are formally cited as the **Resident Canadian (Banks) Regulations**.

---

### **Key Objective**

To define specific classes of **Canadian citizens who are not ordinarily resident in Canada** but are nonetheless classified as **resident Canadians** under the Bank Act — primarily to ensure that Canadian banks and financial institutions maintain appropriate regulatory compliance, even when individuals involved in their governance or operations reside abroad.

---

### **Classes of Persons Classified as Resident Canadians**

The regulations identify **three distinct classes** of Canadian citizens who are considered resident Canadians despite not being ordinarily resident in Canada. Each class is defined with specific criteria:

---

#### **Class 1: Canadian Citizens Working Abroad for a Controlled Canadian Corporation**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident in Canada**, and
- Resides outside Canada **primarily** to act as a **full-time employee** of a **body corporate** (i.e., a corporation) that meets **one or more** of the following conditions:

1. **Ownership or Control by Resident Canadians**:
   - More than **50% of the voting shares** are **beneficially owned** by resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a) or (c)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" in section 2 of the Bank Act, **OR**
   - The corporation is **under the control or direction** of such resident Canadians.

2. **Board Composition**:
   - A **majority of the directors** of the corporation are resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a) or (c)** of the definition.

3. **Corporate Subsidiary Status**:
   - The corporation is a **subsidiary** of a body corporate that falls under either:
     - Subparagraph (i) or (ii) of the above (i.e., a corporation meeting the ownership or control criteria, or with a majority of directors being resident Canadians).

> ✅ **Key Point**: This class ensures that Canadian citizens working abroad for Canadian-owned or -controlled corporations — especially those with significant Canadian ownership or governance — are still considered resident Canadians for regulatory purposes.

---

#### **Class 2: Canadian Citizens Working for International Organizations in Which Canada Is a Member**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident in Canada**, and
- Is a **full-time employee** of an **international association or organization** of which **Canada is a member**.

> ✅ **Examples**: Employees of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), or other international bodies in which Canada participates.

> ✅ **Key Point**: This class recognizes the unique status of Canadian nationals working abroad in international institutions where Canada has a formal role. These individuals are considered resident Canadians due to their professional ties and Canada’s membership.

---

#### **Class 3: Canadian Citizens Who Were Once Ordinarily Resident in Canada**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Was **ordinarily resident in Canada on their sixtieth birthday**, and
- Has been residing **outside Canada for less than 10 consecutive years**.

> ✅ **Key Point**: This class provides a **"reversion" or "return" pathway** for individuals who were previously Canadian residents but have moved abroad. As long as they have not lived outside Canada for more than 10 years continuously, they are still considered resident Canadians.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This provision is a form of **"residency continuity"** — it protects individuals from being automatically classified as non-residents simply because they have moved abroad, especially if their Canadian roots and ties remain intact.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations are made under **section 559 of the Bank Act**.
- They are based on **paragraph (b)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" in **section 2 of the Bank Act**, which allows for exceptions to the general rule that only those who are ordinarily resident in Canada are considered resident Canadians.
- The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, has the authority to issue such regulations.

---

### **Regulatory Significance**

These regulations are critical for:
- Ensuring **regulatory consistency** in the oversight of Canadian banks and financial institutions.
- Maintaining **Canadian control** over financial entities and their key personnel, even when those individuals live abroad.
- Preventing **regulatory gaps** that could arise if Canadian citizens working abroad were excluded from the definition of "resident Canadian" due to their place of residence.

---

### **Practical Implications**

1. **Banking Supervision**: Banks may require that key personnel (e.g., directors, officers, employees) be classified as resident Canadians for purposes of licensing, reporting, and compliance with Canadian financial regulations.

2. **Governance and Ownership**: The presence of a majority of Canadian-resident directors or significant Canadian ownership in a foreign-based entity can trigger the classification of employees as resident Canadians.

3. **International Employment**: Canadian citizens working for international organizations (e.g., UN, IMF) are protected under this rule and are not treated as foreign residents for regulatory purposes.

4. **Long-Term Residency**: Canadians who moved abroad after age 60 are given a 10-year grace period to maintain their status as resident Canadians — important for personal and financial planning.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The regulations **only apply to Canadian citizens**.
- The person must be **not ordinarily resident** in Canada — meaning they do not live there as their primary place of residence.
- The criteria are **strictly defined** and do not apply to individuals who reside abroad for personal reasons unrelated to employment or international affiliations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Resident Canadian (Banks) Regulations* serve as a vital tool in the Canadian regulatory framework to **maintain jurisdictional control over financial institutions** and their key personnel. By identifying specific categories of Canadian citizens living abroad who are still considered resident Canadians, the regulations ensure that Canadian financial regulations continue to apply effectively, even in international contexts.

These provisions balance **regulatory oversight** with **real-world circumstances**, such as international employment and long-term relocation, while preserving Canada’s financial sovereignty.
