The regulation you referenced — listed three times as "[Repealed, SOR/2007-165]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR) published on **March 15, 2007**, under **SOR/2007-165**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
This regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed by the Government of Canada through Order in Council SOR/2007-165, which came into effect on March 15, 2007. As such, it does not apply currently and is not enforceable under Canadian law.

**Original Purpose (Inferred):**  
While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated citation suggests that it may have been a rule or directive related to a specific area of regulation — possibly in the fields of:

- Environmental protection  
- Workplace safety  
- Licensing or permit requirements  
- Consumer protection  
- Transportation or infrastructure  

The fact that it is cited multiple times in the same format implies that it may have been a standalone regulation or a component of a broader regulatory framework that was fully or partially replaced.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
Regulations are typically repealed when:

- They are outdated or no longer relevant  
- A more comprehensive or modern regulatory framework has been introduced  
- They conflict with new legislation or policy directions  
- They create administrative or legal complexity  

In this case, SOR/2007-165 likely included a formal notice of repeal, citing the need for regulatory modernization, alignment with current laws, or improved clarity in governance.

**Impact of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations previously imposed by this regulation are now void.  
- Entities or individuals who were subject to its requirements must transition to current, applicable regulations.  
- Legal challenges or compliance actions based on this regulation are no longer valid or actionable.  

**Where to Find the Repeal Information:**  
The repeal is officially recorded in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations*, specifically in **SOR/2007-165**, which can be accessed through the official government database such as:

- [Canada Gazette](https://www.canada.gazette.gc.ca)  
- [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)
