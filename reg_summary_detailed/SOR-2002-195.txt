### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **clarify and expand the application of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations (the "Convention")** in Canada, specifically in relation to **section 5 of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act**.

This clarification addresses a gap in how Canadian law treats **common-law partners** in relation to the privileges and immunities granted to spouses under international agreements — particularly the United Nations Convention. The regulation ensures that common-law partners receive **substantially equivalent treatment** to spouses under the Convention, thereby promoting fairness, consistency, and inclusivity in the application of international legal standards.

### **Key Definitions Introduced**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMOA). This is the foundational legislation governing the privileges and immunities of foreign missions and international organizations in Canada.

2. **"Common-law partner"**  
   Defined as a person who:
   - Is cohabiting with another individual in a conjugal (marital-like) relationship,
   - Has lived with that individual for a period of **at least one year**.

   This definition aligns with Canadian common-law principles and provides a clear, legally recognized standard for determining eligibility.

3. **"Convention"**  
   Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, which is set out in **Schedule III** of the FMOA. This treaty grants certain immunities and privileges to UN officials, staff, and affiliated entities to ensure effective functioning of the organization.

### **Main Provisions and Their Implications**

#### **1. Extension of Spousal Treatment to Common-Law Partners (Paragraphs 11(d) and 18(d) and (f), and Section 19 of the Convention)**

- The regulation **extends to common-law partners** the treatment previously granted only to spouses under:
  - **Paragraph 11(d)**: Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction for certain acts performed in the course of official duties.
  - **Paragraph 18(d) and (f)**: Immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts done in the course of official duties, and protection of property and personal status.
  - **Section 19**: Protection of personal and family status, including rights to property and residence.

> **Effect**: A common-law partner of a UN official (e.g., a UN employee or representative) is now entitled to the same legal protections and immunities as a spouse — including immunity from legal proceedings, protection of personal status, and immunity from criminal or civil jurisdiction in certain circumstances.

> **Legal Significance**: This aligns Canadian law with international norms and ensures that individuals in long-term, committed relationships are not disadvantaged in terms of legal rights and protections when their partner is a UN official.

#### **2. Extension of Privileges to Spouses and Common-Law Partners in Other International Agreements**

The regulation also applies the same principle to other specific international organizations operating in Canada, including:

- **Organization of American States (OAS)**  
- **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)**  
- **Agence de la Francophonie** and **Institut de l’énergie et de l’environnement de la Francophonie**

> **Effect**: Under these specific orders (e.g., the OAS Privileges and Immunities Order, ITU Order, and Francophonie Orders), the privileges and immunities granted under **paragraphs 11(d), 18(d), and (f)** and **section 19** of the Convention are now extended to:
> - The **spouses** of the designated individuals (e.g., OAS or ITU staff),
> - The **common-law partners** of those individuals.

> **Purpose**: Ensures consistency across international organizations — not just the UN — in extending protection to both spouses and common-law partners.

#### **3. Extension of Treatment to Minor Children**

- The regulation extends to **minor children** of a spouse or common-law partner of a person entitled to privileges under the Convention (particularly under **section 19**) the same treatment afforded to the minor children of such individuals.

> **Effect**: Children of a common-law partner or spouse of a UN or international organization official are protected in terms of:
> - Immunity from jurisdiction,
> - Protection of property and personal status,
> - Rights to reside and maintain family life in Canada.

> **Purpose**: Ensures that family units are fully protected when one member is an international official, recognizing that children are part of the family unit and deserve equivalent legal protection.

---

### **Legal Basis and Process**

- The regulation is made under **section 13b of the FMOA**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to issue regulations clarifying the application of international agreements like the UN Convention.
- The regulation is not creating new rights but rather **interpreting and applying existing international law** in a more inclusive manner.
- It is a **clarification and expansion**, not a broad overhaul of the law.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.

> This ensures immediate applicability upon official publication.

---

### **Key Outcomes and Significance**

1. **Legal Inclusivity**: Recognizes that common-law relationships are legitimate and deserving of equal legal protection under international agreements.
2. **Consistency with International Standards**: Aligns Canada with international norms that increasingly recognize common-law relationships in diplomatic and institutional contexts.
3. **Family Protection**: Provides greater stability and security for families of international officials, especially in matters of residence, property, and legal immunity.
4. **Practical Impact**: A common-law partner of a UN official or international organization employee can now:
   - Travel and reside in Canada without undue legal risk,
   - Be protected from civil or criminal prosecution in certain circumstances,
   - Have their children protected under the same family rights framework.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- The protection is **limited to specific privileges and immunities** under the Convention and related orders (e.g., immunity from jurisdiction, not general legal immunity).
- The rights are **not absolute** and are subject to the conditions and exceptions outlined in the Convention and Canadian law.
- The one-year cohabitation requirement ensures that only long-term, committed relationships are recognized — protecting against arbitrary or short-term partnerships.
- The regulation does **not extend to all international agreements** — only those explicitly referenced (UN, OAS, ITU, Francophonie).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a significant step toward **modernizing and humanizing** Canada’s approach to international privileges and immunities. By extending the protections previously reserved for spouses to common-law partners and their minor children, it reflects evolving societal norms and strengthens the legal rights of individuals in committed relationships. It ensures that Canada’s application of international law is both equitable and aligned with domestic and global standards of fairness and family protection.

It serves as a model for future clarifications in international law, particularly in recognizing non-traditional family structures in diplomatic and institutional contexts.
