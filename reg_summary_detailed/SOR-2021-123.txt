## **Detailed Summary of the Nicotine Concentration in Vaping Products Regulations**

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
These regulations were issued by:
- **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Health**.

They are enacted under several provisions of federal legislation, including:
- **Sections 7.8a, 17b, and 33c of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA)**  
- **Section 12, 22, and 44 of S.C. 2018, c. 9 (the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act)**
- **Section 2 of S.C. 1997, c. 13 (as amended by S.C. 2018, c. 9, s. 2)**
- **Section 37e of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**
- **Section 67 of S.C. 2016, c. 9 (the Food and Drugs Act)**
- **Section 21 of S.C. 2010, c. 21 (the Food and Drugs Act)**

This demonstrates a multi-jurisdictional and cross-agency legal foundation, combining public health, consumer safety, and product labeling standards.

### **2. Scope of Application**

#### **Applies to:**
- Every **vaping product** intended for **retail sale in Canada**, including its **packaging**.
- Every **vaping product** intended to be **furnished at a retail point of sale** (i.e., sold in a retail establishment where vaping products are typically sold), including its **packaging**.

> This ensures that all commercially available vaping products entering the Canadian market—whether directly sold or offered through retail outlets—are subject to these rules.

#### **Exemptions:**
- **Vaping products that are authorized under the Food and Drugs Act** (e.g., through a license or authorization) are **excluded** from these regulations.

> This exception recognizes that certain products may be approved for sale under the existing regulatory framework of the Food and Drugs Act, particularly those that have undergone rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations (e.g., medical or therapeutic devices).

### **3. Key Regulatory Provisions**

#### **A. Maximum Nicotine Concentration Limit**
- **No vaping product may contain nicotine at a concentration exceeding 20 mg/mL**.
- This limit applies **when tested using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 20714**, as amended from time to time.

> ISO 20714: *E-liquid — Determination of nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerol in liquids used in electronic nicotine delivery devices — Gas chromatographic method*

#### **B. How Nicotine Concentration is Calculated**
The nicotine concentration (in mg/mL) must be calculated using the following formula:

> **Nicotine concentration (mg/mL) = (Test result in mg/g) × (Density of vaping substance in g/mL)**

- The test result must be derived from the **ISO 20714 method**, which measures nicotine content via gas chromatography.
- The **density** of the vaping substance (in g/mL) is a critical factor in converting the result from mg/g to mg/mL.

> This ensures consistency and accuracy in determining nicotine levels, accounting for variations in product formulation (e.g., different densities due to propylene glycol/glycerol ratios).

#### **C. Interpretation of "E-liquid" in ISO 20714**
- The term **"e-liquid"** in ISO 20714 must be interpreted as **"vaping substance"** for the purposes of these regulations.

> This aligns terminology with the Act’s definition of "vaping product" and ensures legal consistency between the standard and the regulatory framework.

---

### **4. Labelling and Packaging Requirements**

#### **Prohibition on Misleading Nicotine Statements**
- A vaping product **must not be packaged or sold** in a package that displays a **nicotine concentration statement** (as defined in **Section 5 of the Vaping Products Labelling and Packaging Regulations**) indicating that the nicotine concentration **exceeds 20 mg/mL**.

> This prevents misleading consumers by banning packaging claims that suggest higher nicotine levels than are legally permitted.

> Example: A label stating “Nicotine: 25 mg/mL” is prohibited.

---

### **5. Transitional Provision (Grace Period)**

- Despite the above rules, **retailers may continue to sell** vaping products that are **packaged in a manner contrary to Section 5** (i.e., with misleading nicotine concentration statements) **until the 15th day after the regulations come into force**.

> This provides a **15-day grace period** for retailers to adjust their inventory and packaging, minimizing disruption during implementation.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the 15th day after their publication in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.

> This is a standard administrative mechanism to allow time for stakeholders (manufacturers, retailers, distributors) to comply and for public awareness.

> **Note**: These regulations were in force as of **July 8, 2021**, indicating that they were published and came into effect on that date (or shortly before).

## **Key Objectives and Public Health Rationale**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reduce youth access to high-nicotine vaping products** | By limiting nicotine concentration to 20 mg/mL, the regulation aims to reduce the risk of nicotine addiction, particularly among youth. |
| **Ensure transparency and consumer protection** | Prohibiting misleading labels helps prevent deception and ensures consumers are informed about actual nicotine content. |
| **Promote safer vaping products** | Aligns with broader public health goals of reducing harm from tobacco and vaping products. |
| **Support regulatory consistency** | Integrates with existing health and safety frameworks (Food and Drugs Act, CCPSA) to create a unified regulatory environment. |

## **Summary in One Paragraph**

The *Nicotine Concentration in Vaping Products Regulations* establish a strict maximum nicotine concentration of **20 mg/mL** in all vaping products intended for retail sale in Canada, measured using the internationally recognized **ISO 20714** standard. The concentration is calculated by multiplying the test result (in mg/g) by the product’s density (in g/mL), with “e-liquid” in the standard interpreted as “vaping substance.” These rules prohibit packaging that falsely indicates nicotine levels above 20 mg/mL. A 15-day grace period allows retailers to sell existing products with non-compliant packaging before the regulation fully takes effect. The regulations are grounded in the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act*, the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*, and the *Food and Drugs Act*, and apply to all vaping products except those authorized under the Food and Drugs Act. The goal is to protect public health—particularly youth—by reducing nicotine exposure and ensuring accurate consumer information.

## **Important Notes**
- These regulations are **not a ban on vaping**, but a **restriction on nicotine concentration**.
- They do **not apply to medical or therapeutic devices** that are authorized under the Food and Drugs Act.
- Compliance is required for **manufacturers, importers, and retailers**.
- Enforcement will likely involve inspections, product testing, and consumer complaints.

This regulation represents a significant step in Canada’s effort to regulate the vaping market in a science-based, transparent, and health-protective manner.
