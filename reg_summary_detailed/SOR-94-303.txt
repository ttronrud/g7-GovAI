**Detailed Summary of the Seized Property Disposition Regulations**  
*Statutory Citation: S.C. 1993, c. 37*  
*Title: Seized Property Disposition Regulations*  
*Made under the Seized Property Management Act (Act)*

---

### **1. Introduction and Authority**
These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Supply and Services** and the **Minister of Justice**, pursuant to:
- Subsection 5(2) of the Seized Property Management Act,
- Paragraph 13(2)(a) of the Act, and
- Section 19 of the Act.

The purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear procedures for the disposition (disposal or sale) of seized property** that has been forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

These regulations may be cited as the **Seized Property Disposition Regulations**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several key terms used throughout:
- **Act**: Refers to the *Seized Property Management Act*.
- **Contract for services**: A contractual agreement between the Minister and a third party (contractor) involving the use or management of property, whether that property has been forfeited or not.
- **Contractor**: Any individual or entity that enters into a contract for services with the Minister, as defined in section 18 of the Act.
- **Property**: Property referred to in subsections 4(1) to (3) of the Act that has been **forfeited to Her Majesty**.

> Note: The definition of "property" limits the scope to forfeited items, excluding property still in temporary possession or under investigation.

---

### **3. Methods of Disposition**
Seized property may be disposed of in **any manner**, including:
- Public tender (competitive bidding),
- Public auction,
- Other forms of sale or disposal (e.g., release or discharge).

All dispositions must be conducted on an **"as-is, where-is" basis**, meaning the property is sold without warranties regarding its condition, value, or fitness for use.

---

### **4. Public Tender Procedures**
When property is sold via public tender:
- All tenders must be **in writing** and submitted in **sealed envelopes** clearly marked “tender.”
- The sealed envelopes remain closed until the **designated closing date**.
- On the closing date, the envelopes are opened **in the presence of at least two witnesses** to ensure transparency and prevent fraud.
- If no bid is received, or if all bids fall below the **minimum bid threshold**, or if the Minister determines that no bid is acceptable, the sale may be **cancelled**.

> **Tie-breaking Rule**: If two or more tenders are submitted for the same amount, the **first received** shall be given precedence.

---

### **5. Acceptance and Completion of Sales**
- Upon accepting a bid or tender, the Minister must provide the bidder with a **written notice** specifying the **period within which the sale must be completed**.
- If the bidder fails to complete the transaction within that period, the Minister may:
  - **Cancel the sale**, and
  - Accept the **next-best acceptable bid or tender**.

> This ensures that sales are completed efficiently and that the government does not lose opportunities due to non-performance.

---

### **6. Security and Deposit Requirements**
- The Minister may require a **deposit** from any bidder or tenderer to guarantee the completion of the sale.
- If the bidder fails to complete the sale within the required time:
  - The **deposit is forfeited** to Her Majesty,
  - Deposited into the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**, and
  - Credited to the **Proceeds Account** (a fund used to account for proceeds from property disposals).

This mechanism protects the government from non-performance and ensures financial accountability.

---

### **7. Disposal of Real Property**
When real property (land or buildings) is involved:
- Disposition must comply with **additional federal laws and regulations**, including:
  - The *Federal Real Property Act*,
  - The *Federal Real Property Regulations*,
  - Any regulations made under that Act **on or after May 1, 1994**.

This ensures that real estate transactions follow appropriate legal, zoning, and administrative standards.

---

### **8. Disposal When Sale Is Not Feasible**
If the Minister determines that:
- The property is **unsuitable for sale**, or
- It has **insufficient value** to justify a sale,

The Minister may dispose of it in **any other manner**, such as:
- **Release or discharge** (i.e., returning the property to the original owner or entity),
- Or through other administrative means.

This provides flexibility when market conditions or the nature of the property make a sale impractical.

---

### **9. Net Proceeds Calculation**
- The **net proceeds** from the disposition of property must be calculated within **60 days** after the sale or disposal.
- Deductible amounts from gross proceeds include:
  1. Any amount payable under **paragraph 462.42(6)(b) of the Criminal Code** (e.g., costs related to criminal forfeiture),
  2. Any amount paid due to an order under **subsection 17(4) of the Narcotic Control Act**,
  3. **Expenses incurred** by the Minister in managing or disposing of the property, and
  4. **Advances made** by the Minister under paragraph 9(b) of the Act.

> These deductions ensure that the net proceeds reflect only the actual revenue available to the government after legitimate costs and obligations.

---

### **10. Indemnification for Contractors**
Under section 18 of the Act, the Minister may provide **indemnification** to contractors who have acted honestly and in good faith.

#### Conditions for Indemnification:
- The contractor must have **complied with section 14** (which likely governs reporting and compliance obligations),
- The Minister must be satisfied that:
  - The contractor acted **honestly and in good faith**, and
  - In the case of a criminal or administrative proceeding involving a monetary penalty, the contractor **believed on reasonable grounds** that their conduct was lawful.

#### What the Minister Pays:
- The amount required to settle a claim (subject to **Ministerial prior approval**),
- The contractor’s **reasonable costs, charges, and expenses** associated with the claim.

> **Important Limitation**:  
> **No indemnification applies** to any civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding **instituted by Her Majesty in right of Canada**.  
> This excludes claims brought by the federal government itself.

---

### **11. Reporting Obligations of Contractors**
Contractors must comply with strict reporting requirements when claims arise:
- **Upon becoming aware** of a possible or actual claim (related to actions or omissions under a contract for services), the contractor must:
  - Give a **written notice by registered mail** within **15 days**,
  - Include any relevant documents,
  - Send it to the Minister at the address specified in the contract.

- If the contractor proposes to **settle a claim**, they must:
  - Provide a **written notice by registered mail** at least **15 days before accepting settlement terms**,
  - Include relevant documentation,
  - Send it to the Minister at the contract address.

> These provisions ensure transparency, accountability, and early notification of potential liabilities.

---

### **12. Reporting Requirement for Changes in Property Location**
When the location of seized property changes:
- The Minister of Supply and Services must **file a report** with the appropriate court within **seven days** of the change.

#### Format of the Report:
- Must be filed with the **judge** from whom a **warrant under section 462.32 of the Criminal Code** was issued.
- The report includes:
  - The **date the warrant was issued**,
  - The **name of the peace officer or other person** who seized the property,
  - A **description of each item of seized property**,
  - The **current location** where the property is being detained.

> This ensures legal accountability and transparency in the chain of custody and movement of seized assets.
