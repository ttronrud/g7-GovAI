### **Key Components of the Order**

#### 1. **Shares to be Sold**
- **31,999 Class A shares**
- **10,000 Class B common shares**  
Total: 41,999 shares  
These shares were held by the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC) on behalf of the Government of Canada.

> *Note:* The Class A and Class B shares represent different types of ownership and voting rights. Class A shares typically carry more voting power, while Class B shares may have limited or no voting rights—this distinction is important for governance and control post-sale.

#### 2. **Buyer of the Shares**
- **The Boeing Company**, a U.S.-based multinational corporation and global leader in commercial and military aircraft manufacturing.

#### 3. **Legal Basis for the Sale**
The sale is authorized under two specific provisions of the *Financial Administration Act*:
- **Paragraph 101(1)(d):** Allows the government to dispose of assets or interests in undertakings held by government-owned corporations, including investments in private enterprises.
- **Paragraph 108(2)(b):** Authorizes the Treasury Board to approve the disposal of government-held shares in corporations, particularly when such dispositions are in the public interest or align with national economic objectives.

These provisions provide the legal foundation for the government to transfer ownership of de Havilland Canada shares without requiring full legislative approval, streamlining the process through executive authority.

#### 4. **Terms and Conditions of the Sale**
The sale is not conducted at arbitrary terms. Instead, the Order **substantially incorporates** the provisions of:
- **Section 3 of the Letter of Intent (LOI)** signed on **November 28, 1985**, between:
  - Her Majesty in right of Canada
  - The Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)
  - The Boeing Company

Additionally, the terms are **aligned with the decision of the Treasury Board**, which evaluated the economic, strategic, and industrial implications of the sale.

> *Implication:* The Treasury Board’s endorsement confirms that the sale was a prudent and justified decision, likely based on considerations such as:
> - Financial performance of de Havilland Canada
> - Strategic shift in Canada’s aerospace sector
> - Need to reduce government exposure to non-core assets
> - Potential for technology transfer or industry revitalization

  - Potential for knowledge transfer, joint development, or operational integration
  - A shift in national industrial policy toward privatization and market-based solutions

- **Public Interest Considerations:**  
  The decision reflects a balance between preserving national industrial capability and ensuring fiscal responsibility. The Treasury Board’s involvement ensures accountability and transparency.
