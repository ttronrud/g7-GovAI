### **4. Legal Capacity of the G8 Organization**

During the specified period (June 5 – July 3, 2002), the **G8 Organization** is granted **in Canada the legal capacity of a body corporate**. This means:

- The G8 is treated as a **legally distinct entity** with the rights and responsibilities of a corporation.
- It can:
  - Enter into contracts,
  - Own property,
  - Hold assets,
  - Be sued or sue others,
  - Conduct business operations in Canada,
  - Have its own legal representation.

This status allows the G8 to function efficiently and independently during its meetings, without being subject to Canadian laws that would otherwise apply to foreign bodies or temporary gatherings.

> **Basis**: Article II, Sections 2 to 5 of the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities.

### **5. Privileges and Immunities for Government Representatives**

Members of the G8 (i.e., the foreign ministers and finance ministers of the eight industrialized nations) are granted specific privileges and immunities in Canada, **to the extent necessary** for the performance of their duties related to the Meeting and preparatory meetings.

These include:

- **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., not subject to Canadian criminal or civil lawsuits) for acts performed in the course of their official duties.
- **Immunity from search and seizure** of personal effects or official documents.
- **Exemption from taxes** (e.g., income tax, customs duties) on personal and official property brought into Canada.
- **Freedom of movement** and **freedom from interference** with their official functions.
- **Protection of official communications** (e.g., confidentiality of meetings and correspondence).

> **Basis**: Sections 11, 12, and 14–16 of Article IV of the UN Convention.

These provisions ensure that ministers can carry out their diplomatic and financial negotiations without fear of legal repercussions or disruption.

### **6. Privileges and Immunities for Experts**

Experts (government or intergovernmental) invited to attend the G8 Meeting and preparatory meetings are also granted **limited privileges and immunities**, as set out in **Article VI of the UN Convention**.

These include:

- **Immunity from legal proceedings** related to their official duties during the mission.
- **Exemption from arrest or detention** during the period of their participation.
- **Protection of official communications** and documents.
- **Freedom from interference** with their work.

> Note: These privileges are **limited** to the extent required for the performance of their functions in Canada. They do not extend to personal activities or unrelated conduct.

This ensures that technical and policy experts can contribute to the G8 discussions without being subject to domestic legal or administrative barriers.

### **7. Legal Basis and Interpretation**

- The Order is **based directly on the UN Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**, which provides a standardized international framework for diplomatic immunity and legal capacity.
- The G8, while not a United Nations entity, is treated under this Order as a **similar intergovernmental organization**, and thus entitled to comparable privileges.
- The Order reflects the principle of **diplomatic immunity**, which is a cornerstone of international relations, ensuring that state officials and delegates can operate freely and without fear of prosecution or interference.

---

### **8. Entry into Force**

The Order comes into force **on the day it is registered** with the **Statutes of Canada** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the Government of Canada). This ensures that all relevant authorities, including law enforcement, courts, and government departments, are aware of and bound by the provisions during the specified period.

### **9. Significance and Context**

- This Order was issued in anticipation of the **2002 G8 Summit**, a major international diplomatic event focused on global economic issues, security, and environmental policy.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **hosting international summits** with full diplomatic respect and operational support.
- The Order demonstrates how Canada applies international legal frameworks (like the UN Convention) to facilitate high-level international cooperation.

### **10. Limitations and Boundaries**

- The privileges and immunities are **strictly limited** to the **functions related to the Meeting and preparatory meetings**.
- They do **not extend** to personal conduct, private activities, or behavior outside the scope of official duties.
- Canadian law still applies to individuals in general; immunity only protects official acts.
