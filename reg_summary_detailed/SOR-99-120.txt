It applies to all **member institutions** (federal and provincial) and governs how their **annual premium** is calculated based on:
- Deposit size
- Risk classification (premium categories)
- Compliance with regulatory and data reporting standards
- Historical performance and resolution planning

### 3. **Premium Calculation Framework**

#### 📌 **Base Premium Formula (Sections 4–30)**

For **full premium years**, the annual premium is the **greater of**:
- **$5,000**, or  
- The result of the formula:

> **(A × B × C)**  
> Where:
> - **A** = Total deposits (as defined in the Act)
> - **B** = A fixed percentage (initially 1/3 of 1%, or a smaller rate set by Governor in Council under 23(1)(b)(ii) or 21(4)(b))
> - **C** = The percentage rate from **Column 3 of Schedule 1** corresponding to the institution’s **premium category**

> 📝 **Example**: If a Category 1 institution has $10 million in deposits, and C = 0.33%, then:
> Premium = $10,000,000 × 0.0033 = $33,000 → but capped at $5,000 if lower.

> ✅ The **$5,000 floor** ensures even small institutions pay a minimum premium.

---

### 4. **Reclassification Rules (Sections 7, 8, 8.1, 12)**

CDIC classifies each member institution into one of **five premium categories (1 to 5)**, with **Category 1 = lowest risk**, **Category 5 = highest risk**.

#### ✅ **Premium Category 1 (Lowest Risk)**

An institution is classified in Category 1 if:
- It has been operating as a member institution for **less than two fiscal years** (each of at least 12 months), as of the end of the fiscal year before the filing year; **AND**
- It provides a **declaration by April 30** confirming it meets the required condition.

> 🚫 Exceptions:
> - Subsidiaries of other member institutions
> - Institutions with a subsidiary that has operated for ≥2 years (in which case, subsidiary is assessed separately)

> ✅ **Bridge institutions** (temporary or transitional institutions formed by amalgamation) are **automatically classified in Category 1**.

> 📌 **Amalgamation Rule**:
> - If formed by amalgamation, the new institution starts operating on the **day the longest-operating amalgamating institution began**.

---

#### ✅ **Premium Category 2–5 (Higher Risk)**

Classification depends on:
- **Total score** derived from quantitative and qualitative factors (Section 9–11)
- **Compliance with the Data Requirements By-law** (as of April 30 of the prior premium year)

##### 🔹 **Compliance with Data Requirements By-law (Key Risk Factor)**

| Level of Non-Compliance | Classification |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **Not compliant as of April 30 of the preceding year** | → Category 2 (if would be in Cat 1), 3 (if Cat 2), 4 (if Cat 3), 5 (if Cat 4 or 5) |
| **Not compliant in 2 preceding years** | → Category 3 (if Cat 1/2), Category 5 (if Cat 3, 4, or 5) |
| **Not compliant in 3 preceding years** | → **Category 5** (always) |

> This creates a **penalty system** for institutions with poor data reporting history.

##### 🔹 **Subsidiary Rules (Section 8.01)**

- If a subsidiary is of a **member institution classified under Section 7**, it is placed in the **same premium category** as the parent (unless it has operated for ≥2 years).
- If the subsidiary has operated for ≥2 years, it is classified based on its **own total score**.
- In all other cases, it follows the **parent’s classification**.

> This ensures that risk is properly passed down through ownership.

---

### 5. **Scoring Mechanism (Section 9–11)**

To determine total score (used for premium category assignment), the Corporation adds:

> **Quantitative scores** (from Sections 21–27)  
> + **Qualitative scores** (from Sections 28–30)

> ⚠️ For **Category III SMSBs**:  
> All quantitative scores are **multiplied by 1.33 (one and one-third)** to reflect higher risk.

> This adjusts the risk weight for smaller institutions that may have less capital or liquidity.

---

### 6. **Special Provisions for New or Transitional Institutions**

- **Institutions operating for 6–18 months** at classification:
  - May be **reviewed and reclassified** after **18 months** of membership (under subsection 8.1(4)).

- **Institutions with no subsidiaries**:
  - Must meet all conditions in Section 7 to qualify for Category 1.

---

### 7. **Resolution Plan Compliance (Effective After April 30, 2021)**

For institutions required to develop and maintain a **resolution plan** under **Section 39.01** of the CDIC Act:

> The base premium formula is adjusted by adding a **penalty fee** based on **non-compliance** with the resolution plan:

| Level of Non-Compliance | Additional Premium |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| Partially non-compliant (in prior year) | +0.0125% of (A × B) |
| Materially non-compliant (one year prior) | +0.025% |
| Materially non-compliant (two years prior) | +0.05% |
| Materially non-compliant (three years prior) | +0.10% |

> This reflects increasing penalties for **lack of preparedness** for financial distress.

> ✅ The penalty is **added to the base (A × B × C)**, not replaced.

> This provision aligns with **systemic risk management** and **financial resilience** goals.
