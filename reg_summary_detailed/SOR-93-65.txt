**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Order:**  
*Proposed Acquisition of Increased Interest in Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd. Exemption Order*

**Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The Order is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the National Transportation Agency. It is authorized under **subsection 253(6) of the National Transportation Act, 1987** (R.S., c. 28 (3rd Supp.)). This provision permits the exemption of certain transactions involving transportation companies from the regulatory requirements of **Part VII** of the Act, which generally governs mergers, acquisitions, and changes of control in the transportation sector to ensure competition and public interest.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
This Order grants a formal exemption from the requirements of **Part VII of the National Transportation Act, 1987**, specifically for a proposed acquisition involving an increase in ownership interest in **Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd.** (a major intercity bus operator in Canada).

**Nature of the Transaction:**  
The transaction involves a **minority public shareholder** of Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd. seeking to increase their ownership stake in the company. The proposed change is from **31% to 46%** of the company’s voting shares. This is not a full acquisition or a takeover by a private entity or a new controlling interest, but rather a strategic increase in minority ownership by existing public shareholders.

**Key Exempted Provision:**  
The exemption applies to the **application of Part VII** of the National Transportation Act, 1987. Part VII typically requires:
- Notification and review of proposed acquisitions or changes of control,
- Assessment of competitive effects,
- Evaluation of potential impacts on public service,
- Approval or conditions for the transaction based on competition and market dynamics.

By granting this exemption, the Government of Canada determines that the proposed increase in ownership does **not** raise significant competition concerns or pose a threat to public transportation services, and therefore does not require the full regulatory scrutiny mandated under Part VII.

**Background and Context:**  
The National Transportation Agency had previously issued a recommendation on **December 29, 1992**, suggesting that the proposed acquisition fall under Part VII. However, the Governor General in Council, upon reviewing the matter and considering the public interest, has determined that the transaction qualifies for exemption under subsection 253(6). This reflects a policy judgment that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, does not create a dominant market position, and does not substantially affect competition in the intercity bus market.

**Citation and Legal Status:**  
The Order is officially cited as:  
*Proposed Acquisition of Increased Interest in Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd. Exemption Order*  
It is published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1987, Third Supplement (R.S., c. 28 (3rd Supp.)).

**Implications:**  
- The transaction may proceed without the need for formal approval or public consultation required under Part VII.
- The exemption does not imply endorsement of the transaction’s financial or strategic merits, but rather confirms that it does not trigger the regulatory regime designed to protect market competition in transportation.
- The exemption is specific to the increase in voting shares from 31% to 46% by public minority shareholders and does not extend to other potential transactions or changes of control.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order effectively removes the regulatory barriers under Part VII of the National Transportation Act, 1987, for a minority shareholder-led increase in ownership in Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd. It reflects a balanced approach—allowing shareholder participation in corporate governance while ensuring that the transportation sector remains competitive and accessible. The decision underscores the importance of distinguishing between minority shareholding changes and significant control or market-altering transactions in transportation policy.
