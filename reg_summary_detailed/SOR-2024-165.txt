**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Designating the Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
This regulation, issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, designates the **Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area (MPA)** under **subsection 35.1(2)a of the Oceans Act**. The designation is made in accordance with the legal framework established by the *Oceans Act* (S.C. 1996, c. 31), specifically to protect significant marine areas in Canada’s Arctic.

The Order explicitly states that the designation **does not conflict with a land claims agreement** that has been given effect and ratified by an Act of Parliament. This ensures that Indigenous rights—particularly those of the Inuit—are respected and not undermined by the creation of the protected area.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
- **Statutory Authority**: The Minister exercises powers under **subsection 35.1(2)a of the Oceans Act**, which allows for the designation of marine protected areas to conserve unique marine features or habitats.
- **Reference to the Land Claims Agreement**: The regulation acknowledges that the Tuvaijuittuq MPA is established in a manner consistent with the **Inuit land claims agreement** between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, signed on **May 25, 1993**, and tabled in Parliament on May 26, 1993. Any amendments to this agreement are also included in the definition of "Agreement."

### **3. Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Agreement** | Refers to the 1993 Inuit land claims agreement and all amendments made under its terms. This agreement is central to recognizing Inuit rights and self-determination in Nunavut. |
| **Marine Protected Area (MPA)** | The designated area of the sea in the Arctic Ocean, specifically off northern Ellesmere Island, defined by official survey plans. |

### **4. Geographic Description of the Tuvaijuittuq MPA**

- **Location**: The waters off **northern Ellesmere Island** in the **Arctic Ocean**.
- **Boundary Definition**: 
  - Described in **Plan No. FB42596**, certified on **July 16, 2019**.
  - Depicted in **Plan No. CLSR 108395**, which is officially deposited in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records**.
- **Scope of Protection**:
  - Includes the **seabed**, the **subsoil to a depth of five meters**, and the **entire water column**, including **sea ice**.
  - The area extends **below the low-water line**, meaning it covers all marine components from the surface down to the seafloor.

---

### **5. Permitted Activities (Ongoing Activities)**

Under paragraph 35.1(2)(a) of the Oceans Act, the following activities are **recognized as ongoing** and thus **not prohibited** within the MPA:

- **National defence activities** conducted by the **Department of National Defence**.
- **Marine scientific research activities** (including those conducted by government, academic, or international institutions).

These activities are considered essential and are allowed under the legal framework of the Oceans Act.

---

### **6. Prohibited Activities**

All other activities are **strictly prohibited** unless explicitly permitted. Specifically, it is **banned** to:

- Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove:
  - **Unique geological or archaeological features**
  - **Living marine organisms**
  - **Any part of their natural habitat**

This prohibition applies to **any activity** that is **likely to cause such harm**, ensuring the ecological integrity and cultural significance of the area are preserved.

---

### **7. Exceptions to Prohibitions**

Despite the general prohibition, the following activities are **permitted** in the Tuvaijuittuq MPA:

- **Marine navigation** by:
  - Foreign nationals
  - Foreign ships
  - Foreign states or entities incorporated or formed under the laws of a country other than Canada
- **Laying, maintenance, and repair of cables and pipelines** by:
  - Foreign states

These exceptions are intended to allow for international maritime operations necessary for infrastructure and security, while still protecting the environment.

---

### **8. Exclusion of Inuit Wildlife Harvesting Rights**

A critical clarification is that:

> This Order **does not affect or apply** to the **wildlife harvesting rights** of the Inuit as provided for in the **1993 Land Claims Agreement**.

This means that:
- The Inuit retain their traditional rights to hunt, fish, and harvest wildlife in the region.
- These rights are **separate** from the protection provided by the MPA.
- The MPA does not restrict Inuit subsistence or cultural practices related to wildlife use.

This reflects a key principle of Indigenous rights and reconciliation: protecting the environment **without undermining** Indigenous livelihoods and cultural practices.

---

### **9. Repeal of Previous Order**

- The previous Order Designating the Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area (SOR/2019-282) is **repealed**.
- This ensures that the current designation is the **most up-to-date and legally valid version** of the MPA.

---

### **10. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., when officially published in the *Canada Gazette*).
- As of **July 22, 2024**, the Order is active and enforceable.

---

### **Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Environmental Protection** | The MPA safeguards unique geological and biological features, preventing degradation from human activity. |
| **Indigenous Rights Recognition** | The designation respects and upholds the Inuit land claims agreement, particularly by excluding restrictions on traditional harvesting. |
| **International Engagement** | Allows foreign vessels and states to operate under specific conditions, balancing global maritime interests with conservation. |
| **Scientific and Defence Exceptions** | Supports vital research and national security needs while maintaining environmental safeguards. |
| **Legal Consistency** | The Order is fully compliant with both federal environmental law and Indigenous rights law. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area** designation represents a significant step in Canada’s commitment to:

- Protecting the Arctic marine environment,
- Respecting Indigenous rights and knowledge,
- Promoting sustainable use of marine resources,
- And ensuring legal coherence between environmental protection and Indigenous self-governance.

By clearly defining boundaries, permitting essential activities, and explicitly excluding Inuit harvesting rights from the scope of the MPA, this regulation achieves a balanced approach to conservation and Indigenous sovereignty in one of Canada’s most ecologically and culturally significant regions.
