**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Bank Representative Offices Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 46)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Foreign Bank Representative Offices Regulations*, introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, were enacted under **sections 509 and 559 of the Bank Act**. These regulations replaced the earlier *Foreign Bank Representative Offices Regulations* made by Order in Council P.C. 1981-966 (Canada Gazette, Part II, p. 1202, April 9, 1981).

The new regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and established a modern, transparent, and accountable framework for the registration and operation of **foreign bank representative offices (RBOs)** in Canada. They were designed to ensure that such offices operate within strict boundaries, do not engage in prohibited financial activities, and are subject to ongoing reporting and oversight by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These regulations were later **repealed** by **SOR/99-271, section 2**, effective September 29, 1999. This means the regulations are no longer in force in Canada as of that date. However, this summary provides a detailed understanding of their content and purpose during their active period.

## **4. Employee Restrictions**

No employee of a representative office may:

## **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The regulations were designed to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Protect Canadian consumers and financial markets** by preventing foreign banks from engaging in prohibited financial activities through representative offices.
2. **Ensure transparency and accountability** through mandatory registration, reporting, and financial disclosures.
3. **Limit the scope of representative offices** to purely promotional and liaison functions, preventing them from becoming de facto banking operations.
4. **Maintain consistency with international banking standards** and Canada’s regulatory framework.
5. **Provide clear, enforceable rules** for both foreign banks and their representatives.

| **Annual fee** | Provides a financial incentive for compliance and administrative oversight. |
| **Repeal in 1999** | The regulations were eventually replaced by broader reforms, reflecting changes in Canada’s international banking policy and the evolution of financial services regulation. |
