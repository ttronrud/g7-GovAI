**Key Provisions of the Regulations**

1. **Fixed Number of Associate Judges**  
   - Under subsection 11.1(2) of the *Tax Court of Canada Act*, the total number of associate judges that may be appointed is **fixed at two**.  
   - This limitation establishes a cap on the total number of associate judges serving in the Tax Court of Canada, ensuring a stable and manageable judicial structure.  
   - The regulation interprets and operationalizes this cap, meaning that no more than two associate judges can be formally appointed under the provisions of subsection 11.1(1) of the Act.

2. **Workload Definition for Supernumerary Associate Judges**  
   - Subsection 11.1(6) of the Act allows for the appointment of *supernumerary associate judges*, who are not full-time or regularly assigned judges but may serve in a supportive or limited capacity.  
   - The regulations define the **minimum workload** of a supernumerary associate judge as **50% of the workload of a regular associate judge**.  
   - This benchmark ensures that supernumerary appointments are not intended to replace full associate judges but instead serve as a flexible, part-time or on-demand resource.  
   - The 50% threshold provides clarity on expectations regarding caseload, availability, and judicial duties, helping to prevent overburdening or underutilization of judicial resources.

3. **Effective Date**  
   - These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
   - This immediate effect ensures that the rules are implemented without delay, providing legal certainty for the Tax Court of Canada’s operations and judicial appointments.
