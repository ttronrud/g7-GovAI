### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield Zoning Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use, construction, and development within and around the Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield in Nova Scotia.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation establishes precise definitions to ensure clarity and enforceability:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to *Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield*, located in Shearwater, Nova Scotia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic and elevational reference point used for measuring all zoning boundaries. It is defined in Part I of the Schedule and is **deemed to be 148 feet above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular section of the runway area, **1,200 feet wide**, specifically designated for takeoff and landing in a particular direction (e.g., Runway 16R-34L). |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the end of a strip. The lower edge is a horizontal line perpendicular to the strip’s centerline at the strip end. Dimensions vary by runway: |
| - For strips ending at **02**, **11–29**, **16R-34L**, **16L-34R**: <br> - 600 feet on each side of the centerline at the strip ends; <br> - 2,000 feet on each side of the projected centerline at outer ends (200 feet above strip end elevation, measured 10,000 feet horizontally from strip ends). |
| - For **Runway 20**: <br> - 600 feet on each side at the strip end; <br> - 600 feet on each side at outer end (200 feet above strip end elevation, measured 8,000 feet horizontally from strip end). |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane centered on the ARP at **150 feet above its assigned elevation (148 feet ASL)**. This forms the primary boundary for zoning restrictions. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising from the outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface, extending upward and outward until it intersects the horizontal surface. The slope is **1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally** (1:7 gradient). |

> These surfaces are critical because **no building, structure, or object may exceed the elevation of any of these surfaces** at any point.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all lands** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport.
- Includes **public road allowances**.
- The exact boundaries of the regulated area are described in **Part II of the Schedule**, which is a detailed legal description of a polygonal boundary.
- The regulated zone is defined as:
  > *All parcels or tracts of land lying within the outermost boundary of the horizontal surface described in paragraph 5(a), excluding certain internal parcels.*

---

#### **4. Legal Boundary Description (Horizontal Surface)**

The horizontal surface is bounded by a complex, multi-segmented line that begins and ends at the **intersection of the Southwesterly production of the Southeasterly boundary of Circumferential Road and the high water marks of the Eastern Passage**.

The boundary proceeds through a series of directional segments using precise bearings and distances, including:

- Following the **Southeasterly boundary of Circumferential Road** and its Southwesterly production.
- Moving in directions such as:
  - N. 41°51′ W.
  - N. 48°09′ E.
  - N. 33°52′50″ W.
- Intersections with:
  - Lines parallel to runway centerlines (e.g., Runway 16R-34L, 16L-34R, Runway 02-20).
  - Roads: Portland Street, Cole Harbour Road, Bissett Road, Murray Road, Old Indian Road.
  - Property lines between private landowners (e.g., W. Settle, F. Conrod, M. De Young, D. MacDonald).
  - Natural features: brooks (Morris Lake to Cow Bay Pond), shorelines of Eastern Passage.
- Ends at the **Point of Beginning**, completing a closed loop.

This boundary defines the **maximum allowable elevation** for any structure on regulated land.

---

#### **5. Excluded Areas**

Certain parcels within the broader regulated zone are **excluded** from the zoning restrictions. These are defined by a separate boundary description (also in Part II of the Schedule):

- Begins at a **concrete monument** at the intersection of the **Northeasterly boundary of the CN Railway right-of-way** and the **Southerly limit of the City of Dartmouth**.
- Proceeds through a series of bearings and distances, including:
  - N. 39°30′ E
  - N. 41°48′ W
  - S. 39°24′ W
  - S. 50°36′ E
  - N. 50°36′ W
  - N. 39°24′ E
  - S. 50°36′ E
  - N. 40°18′ E
  - N. 41°48′ W
  - N. 76°42′ E
  - N. 52°53′ W
  - N. 74°41′ E
- Ends at the **West shore line of Morris Lake**, and then follows:
  - Shorelines of De Said Lake and Smelt Brook
  - Lines parallel to Runway 16L-34R
- Finally returns to intersect the **Southeasterly production of Runway 16R-34L** and ends at a concrete monument.

> These excluded parcels are **not subject to the height restrictions** of the horizontal or approach surfaces.

---

#### **6. Height Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

**No person may:**
- Erect, construct, or build any structure (including additions to existing ones),  
- Or place any object,  
**whose highest point exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:**

1. **The horizontal surface** (150 feet above ARP at 148 feet ASL).
2. **Approach surfaces** associated with runways (02, 11–29, 16R-34L, 16L-34R, 20), with specific dimensions and gradients.
3. **Transitional surfaces**, rising at a **1:7 slope** from the outer limits of the strips and their approach surfaces.

> This means that **all structures must remain below the elevation of the horizontal surface or approach surface** at their location.

---

#### **7. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is **safety and operational integrity** of the Canadian Forces Base Shearwater Airfield. By restricting the height of structures:

- **Minimizes visual and physical interference** with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- Prevents **obstruction of critical flight paths**, especially near runways and approach zones.
- Ensures **adequate clearance** for aircraft to operate safely under all conditions.
- Maintains **airfield visibility and navigation accuracy**.

The use of precise bearings, distances, and elevation references ensures that the boundaries are **scientifically accurate and enforceable**.

---

#### **8. Reference to Plan M-3050 (A & B)**

- The full spatial configuration of the horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces is illustrated on **Plan No. M-3050 (A & B)**, dated August 4, 1965.
- This plan is **on file with the Department of Transport in Ottawa** and serves as the official map for enforcement and interpretation.

> The plan is essential for determining the exact shape and location of the regulated zones and for resolving disputes over boundary compliance.

---

#### **9. Jurisdiction and Authority**

- The regulations are issued under the authority of the **Minister of National Defence (Minister)**.
- The Minister has the power to enforce the rules, issue permits, and penalize violations.

#### **10. Key Takeaways**

| Element | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| **Core Rule** | No structure may exceed the elevation of the horizontal surface, approach surfaces, or transitional surfaces. |
| **Elevation Basis** | All measurements are referenced to the ARP at **148 feet ASL**. |
| **Boundary Type** | Complex, multi-segmented legal description with bearings and distances. |
| **Exclusions** | Specific parcels within the zone are exempt due to land ownership or urban development. |
| **Enforcement Tool** | Plan M-3050 (A & B) provides visual and legal confirmation of boundaries. |
| **Safety Objective** | To ensure safe flight operations by preventing obstructions to aircraft paths. |
