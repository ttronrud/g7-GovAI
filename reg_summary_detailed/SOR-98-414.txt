The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain provisions in statutory regulations, specifically:

- **SOR/2013-19, s. 6** (Statutory Order 2013-19, section 6)
- **SOR/2008-255, s. 2** (Statutory Order 2008-255, section 2)

However, **no actual regulation content** is included — only annotations indicating that specific sections have been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or abolished).

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Text**
This is not a summary of a regulation, but rather a list of **repeal notices**. It appears to be a metadata or indexing record showing that certain legal provisions were removed from force by later amendments.

#### 2. **Repealed Provisions**
- **SOR/2013-19, s. 6**: This section was repealed by Statutory Order 2013-19, section 6. This order likely amended or replaced an earlier regulation, removing its legal effect.
- **SOR/2008-255, s. 2**: This section was also repealed, indicating that a provision from Statutory Order 2008-255 (section 2) was formally canceled.

#### 3. **Legal Implications of Repeal**
- Repeal means the provision is **no longer legally enforceable**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Correct errors in the original regulation.
  - Align with new legislation or policy.
  - Simplify or modernize the regulatory framework.
  - Reflect changes in law or administrative practice.

#### 4. **Contextual Notes**
- The repeated entries suggest this may be a **list of repealed sections** found in a regulatory database or legal document, possibly from a government or legislative repository.
- The absence of the actual text of the repealed regulation means **no substantive legal content, definitions, obligations, or penalties** can be summarized from this list alone.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
> **There is no active regulation being described here.** The content provided is a list of **repealed sections** of prior regulations. As such, it does not contain a detailed summary of any current or operational regulation. Instead, it indicates that the referenced sections were officially canceled and are no longer in force.

### Final Statement:
**This document does not summarize a regulation — it records the repeal of specific sections of prior regulations (SOR/2013-19, s. 6 and SOR/2008-255, s. 2). No substantive legal content, rules, or provisions are present in the provided text.**  

To obtain a detailed summary of a regulation, the actual text of the regulation (before repeal) would need to be consulted.
