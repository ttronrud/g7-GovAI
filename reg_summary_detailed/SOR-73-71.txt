**Detailed Summary of the Yukon Territory Pension Regulations (SOR/64-98, Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 98, No. 6, March 25, 1964)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board, revokes the previous *Yukon Territory Pension Regulations* (Order in Council P.C. 1964-330 dated February 28, 1964), and replaces them with new regulations that integrate employees of the Government of the Yukon Territory into the federal *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA). 

The new regulations establish a mechanism allowing certain Yukon Territory government employees to have their prior service counted toward pensionable service under the federal public service superannuation system, subject to specific conditions and financial obligations.

### **Legal Authority**

The regulation is enacted under two key legal provisions:

1. **Vote 64a of the Appropriation Act No. 5, 1963** – Provides the financial and legislative authority to implement the changes.
2. **Section 32 of the Public Service Superannuation Act** – Grants the government the power to make regulations regarding the inclusion of employees from provincial or territorial governments into the federal superannuation scheme.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **Section 2: Eligibility for Elective Pensionable Service**

> *Every person who, on the 1st day of April, 1964, was an employee of the Government of the Yukon Territory and who became or becomes a contributor under the Public Service Superannuation Act on or after that day may, in accordance with that Act and the Regulations made thereunder, elect to count as pensionable service for purposes of that Act, any period of service with the Government of the Yukon Territory that he may have had prior to that day.*

**Interpretation and Significance:**

- **Eligible Individuals**: Only those who were employed by the Yukon Government as of April 1, 1964, and who subsequently become or join the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA) as contributors on or after April 1, 1964, are eligible.
- **Elective Service**: Employees are given the **option** (not a requirement) to include prior service with the Yukon Government in their pensionable service record under the federal PSSA.
- **Purpose**: This provision enables continuity of pension rights for Yukon employees by recognizing their pre-1964 service as pensionable, thus ensuring they are not disadvantaged due to the transition from a territorial to a federal superannuation system.

> **Note**: The term "pensionable service" refers to the period of employment that contributes to an individual’s pension entitlement under the PSSA. This is critical because prior service in a territorial government was not automatically recognized under the federal scheme.

#### **Section 3: Financial Obligation for Elective Service**

> *A person referred to in section 2 who elects to count any period of elective service described in that section shall, in respect of the period that he elects to count, pay into the Superannuation Account an amount equal to twice the amount calculated in accordance with paragraph 6(1)(e) or (j) of the Public Service Superannuation Act, whichever is applicable.*

**Interpretation and Significance:**

- **Additional Contribution Requirement**: When an employee elects to count prior Yukon service, they must make a **supplementary contribution** to their Superannuation Account.
- **Amount of Contribution**: The contribution is **twice** the amount that would normally be calculated under specific PSSA formulas (paragraphs 6(1)(e) or (j)) — which typically relate to:
  - (e) The amount of pensionable earnings based on a specified percentage of salary.
  - (j) The amount based on the employee’s salary or earnings during the period of service.
- **Which Formula Applies**: The applicable formula is selected based on the employee’s circumstances — the one that yields the higher amount.
- **Purpose**: This provision serves as a **compensation mechanism** for the federal government to account for the value of the prior service that would otherwise not have been covered under the federal scheme. It ensures that the federal superannuation fund is not underfunded due to the inclusion of non-federal service.

### **Key Implications and Outcomes**

1. **Service Recognition**:
   - Employees of the Yukon Government who had service before April 1, 1964, can now have that service counted toward their pensionable service under the federal PSSA — a significant benefit for career continuity.

2. **Financial Burden**:
   - While the inclusion of prior service is beneficial, it comes at a cost. Employees must pay **double** the standard contribution amount for the elected service period.
   - This reflects a recognition that the federal government is "buying in" the value of that prior service, and the cost is borne by the employee in the form of a higher contribution.

3. **Voluntary Nature**:
   - The election is **voluntary**. Employees are not required to count prior service — they must choose whether to do so, balancing potential pension benefits against the increased contribution burden.

4. **Transition Mechanism**:
   - This regulation was a key part of a broader federal policy to harmonize pension systems across Canada, ensuring that employees in territories (like Yukon) were not left behind in the national superannuation framework.

### **Citation and Effective Date**

- **Title**: Yukon Territory Pension Regulations  
- **Citation**: SOR/64-98

### **Conclusion**

The Yukon Territory Pension Regulations of 1964 represent a pivotal step in integrating territorial public service employees into the federal public service pension system. By allowing eligible Yukon employees to count prior service under the Public Service Superannuation Act, the regulation promotes equity and continuity in pension entitlements. However, it does so with a financial condition — a double contribution — to reflect the value of the service being recognized.

This balance between **benefit and cost** underscores the practical challenges of merging different pension systems and highlights the government’s effort to ensure fairness and fiscal responsibility during the transition.
