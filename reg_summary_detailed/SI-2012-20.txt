**Detailed Summary of the Right of Permanent Residence Fees Remission Order (2012)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Right of Permanent Residence Fees Remission Order (2012)* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** and the **Treasury Board**, under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This order is intended to promote the public interest by remitting (i.e., waiving) the fees associated with acquiring permanent resident status in Canada for certain individuals who served in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, in support of the Canadian mission.

This remission applies specifically to **Canadian mission workers** and their **spouses or common-law partners**, who meet specific eligibility criteria tied to their service and recognition during a defined period.

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Authority**: Subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* grants the Governor General in Council the power to make regulations that remit fees under the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR) when it is in the public interest.
- **Regulatory Context**: The order is rooted in the broader framework of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*, particularly **subsection 303(1)**, which establishes the fee structure for obtaining permanent resident status.

1. Served in Kandahar Province in a professional capacity supporting Canadian operations;
2. Were recognized through a formal process involving the Joint Referral Committee;

### **Scope of Remission**

- The remission applies to:
  - The **eligible individual** (Canadian mission worker);
  - Their **spouse**;
  - Their **common-law partner**.

> Importantly, the remission is **only for the fee associated with the acquisition of permanent resident status** under IRPR s. 303(1). It does not cover other potential fees or costs related to immigration applications.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council issued this Order because it is in the **public interest** to:
- Recognize and reward the contributions of Afghan nationals who supported Canadian operations in a high-risk environment;
- Facilitate the integration of these individuals into Canadian society;
- Promote goodwill and diplomatic relations with Afghanistan;
- Ensure fair and transparent recognition of service through a structured, evidence-based process.

---

### **Key Historical Context**

- The policy was developed during a period of active Canadian military and civilian presence in Kandahar (2007–2011).
- The *Temporary Public Policy* (October 2009 and February 2012) established a pathway for Afghan staff to be considered for permanent residence, especially those who provided direct support.
- The 2012 Order formalizes the **fee remission** as a consequence of that policy, ensuring that individuals who were properly vetted and approved are not burdened by financial barriers.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Order **does not apply to all Afghan nationals** or to those who did not serve in Kandahar.
- It is **not retroactive** beyond the defined time frame (October 9, 2007 – July 31, 2011).
- It does **not guarantee permanent residence**—eligibility is conditional on meeting all criteria, including IRCC approval.
- It is **not available to individuals who were referred to IRCC** through the JRC process.

---

### **Implementation and Oversight**

- The **Department of Citizenship and Immigration (IRCC)** is responsible for:
  - Assessing applications;
  - Verifying eligibility;
  - Ensuring compliance with the Temporary Public Policy;
  - Requesting additional documentation when necessary.
- The **Joint Referral Committee (JRC)** played a key role in the initial screening and referral process, though the final decision rests with IRCC.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Right of Permanent Residence Fees Remission Order (2012)* is a targeted, policy-driven regulatory measure that:
- Acknowledges the vital role of Afghan nationals in supporting Canadian operations in Kandahar;
- Removes a financial barrier for eligible individuals seeking permanent residence;
- Ensures accountability and consistency in the evaluation process through defined eligibility criteria;
- Reflects Canada’s commitment to recognizing contributions made in service of national interests during times of conflict.

It serves as both a **practical tool** for immigration policy and a **symbolic gesture** of reconciliation and partnership with Afghanistan.

**Note**: This Order is no longer in force as of 2023, having been superseded by broader immigration policies and the implementation of the *Afghan Nationals and Asylum Seekers Policy*. However, it remains historically significant in the context of Canada’s approach to recognizing contributions of Afghan nationals during the post-2011 transition.
