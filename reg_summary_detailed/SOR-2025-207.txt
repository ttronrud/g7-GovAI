### **Detailed Summary of the First Nations Fiscal Management Act Adaptation Regulations (S.C. 2023, c. 16, s. 55)**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
The *First Nations Fiscal Management Act Adaptation Regulations* are a set of regulatory amendments introduced to enable **Indigenous groups that are parties to treaties or self-government agreements with Canada** to benefit from the provisions of the *First Nations Fiscal Management Act (FNFMA)* — specifically, to access **financing secured by other revenues**.

These regulations were made under **subsection 141(1)(b)** of the FNFMA, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations**, and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**.

The key objective is to **expand fiscal autonomy** for First Nations and Indigenous groups by allowing them to:
- Use **non-local revenues** (e.g., royalties, interest, transfers) as security for loans from the **First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA)**,
- Develop and enforce their own **local revenue laws** (taxes, fees, charges),
- Improve financial governance and accountability through structured processes.

Importantly, these regulations **do not re-establish or alter** existing bodies such as the First Nations Tax Commission, First Nations Financial Management Board (FNFB), First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA), or First Nations Infrastructure Institute (FNII). Their roles remain unchanged.

---

#### **2. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to:
- **Indigenous groups** that are:
  - Named in **Schedule 1 or Schedule 2** of the regulations,
  - Parties to a **treaty or self-government agreement** with Canada.

> *Note:* The term "Indigenous group" is defined specifically in the regulations as such a group, excluding those not named in the schedules.

#### **3. Key Definitions and Key Conceptual Changes**

| Term | Definition & Significance |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Borrowing Member** | A First Nation or Indigenous group accepted under section 76(2) or (3) of the FNFMA and still active. Also includes certain organizations under paragraph 50.1(1)(e) if approved via regulation. |
| **Other Revenues** | A broad category of income that can be used as security for loans from the FNFA. Includes: <br> - Tax revenues and fees (excluding local taxes) <br> - Royalties (from oil & gas, land use) <br> - Interest on deposits/investments <br> - Transfers from provinces, municipalities, or federal government (subject to agreement) <br> - Revenues from leases, permits, or resource use <br> - Dividends from owned businesses <br> - Revenues from non-ownership-based activities (e.g., services) |
| **Local Revenues** | Revenues generated from local taxes, fees, or charges on reserve lands (e.g., property taxes, service fees). Excludes taxes on land ownership. |
| **Local Revenue Law** | A law passed by a First Nation council governing local taxation, fees, or charges. Must be approved by the First Nations Tax Commission before taking effect. |
| **Property Taxation Law** | A law related to land-based taxation (specifically under paragraph 5(1)(a)). |
| **Intermediate Account** | A temporary account where other revenues are held before being transferred to a **secured revenues trust account**. |
| **Secured Revenues Trust Account** | A dedicated account established jointly by the FNFA and the First Nation/Indigenous group, where revenues are held and used to secure financing. |
| **Governing Body** | Refers to the legislative body (e.g., council), executive, or authorized representative of an Indigenous group. |
| **Capital Assets** | Includes capital infrastructure (e.g., roads, buildings). Not required to be located on reserve lands. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The term "interest" in reserve lands outside Quebec means any right to occupy, use, or possess land (excluding title held by Her Majesty). In Quebec, "right" includes any right of use or occupancy (excluding title).

#### **4. Key Provisions and Functional Outcomes**

##### **A. Financial Autonomy and Borrowing**
- Allows Indigenous groups to **secure loans from the First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA)** using **other revenues** (not just local revenues) as collateral.
- Borrowing is authorized under a **borrowing law**, which may include specific agreements with the FNFA.
- The borrowing process is governed by:
  - A **secured revenues trust account**,
  - An **intermediate account** to hold revenues prior to transfer,
  - Conditions and procedures set by regulation.

> This enables Indigenous groups to access capital for development, infrastructure, or economic initiatives without relying solely on federal or provincial funding.

---

##### **B. Authority to Enact Local Revenue Laws**
The council of a First Nation may pass laws on:
1. **Taxation for local purposes**:
   - Assessment of land values,
   - Determination of tax rates,
   - Taxation of services (e.g., water, waste management),
   - Business activity taxes,
   - Development cost charges.

2. **Fees for services**:
   - Fees for water, sewage, animal control, recreation, transportation, permits, licenses.

3. **Expenditure of local revenues**:
   - Spending rules for funds raised via local taxes or fees.

4. **Enforcement mechanisms**:
   - Creation of **liens or legal hypothecs** (in Quebec),
   - Imposition of **interest and penalties** on unpaid taxes,
   - **Seizure and sale** of personal property (excluding dwellings),
   - Discontinuation of services if taxes are unpaid,
   - Recovery of enforcement costs.

> All such laws must be **approved by the First Nations Tax Commission** before coming into force.

---

##### **C. Approval and Implementation Process**
- A local revenue law must:
  - Be **published in the First Nations Gazette**,
  - Posted publicly on reserve lands,
  - Sent to the **First Nations Tax Commission** by mail or electronic means,
  - Include a **notice period** of at least **30 days** (or longer if a standard is set under subsection 35(1)).

- The **First Nations Tax Commission** may:
  - **Exempt** a First Nation from full notice requirements if it determines the proposed amendment is **not significant**.

- After submission, the council must:
  - Consider **written representations** from stakeholders,
  - Provide copies of the law to those who submitted comments,
  - Invite them to make **further written submissions** within 30 days.

- A law comes into force on the **later of**:
  - The date set in the law,
  - The day **after** approval by the First Nations Tax Commission.

---

##### **D. Enforcement and Judicial Remedies**
- A First Nation may apply to a **court of competent jurisdiction** to:
  - Prevent a violation of a local revenue law,
  - Require a person/entity to comply with the law.

- A First Nation may **commence legal proceedings** to recover unpaid amounts under a local revenue law.

- If a First Nation has adopted a **land code** under the *Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act*, it may use **enforcement measures** (except those related to summary conviction offences) from that code to enforce local revenue laws.

> This strengthens the ability of Indigenous groups to enforce revenue collection in a legally recognized and consistent manner.

---

##### **E. Assignment of Interests in Reserve Lands**
- If a First Nation has outstanding taxes under a local revenue law for **more than two years**, it may **assign** an interest or right in reserve land (e.g., lease, permit) to recover the debt — **subject to conditions and procedures prescribed by regulation**.

> This provides a powerful tool to address long-standing delinquencies without resorting to seizure or forfeiture.

---

##### **F. Judicial Notice and Legal Standing**
- In court proceedings, **local revenue laws** may be taken as **judicial notice** (i.e., presumed true and admissible without proof).
- The **Statutory Instruments Act does not apply** to local revenue laws or laws made under section 9 — meaning these laws are not subject to the same parliamentary scrutiny or publication rules as other statutes.

> This ensures greater flexibility and faster implementation of local revenue laws.

---

##### **G. Delegation of Powers**
- Councils may:
  - Delegate powers to **individuals or bodies** to make laws under certain areas (e.g., taxation, fees),
  - Delegate powers to the **First Nations Financial Management Board (FNFB)** to support **co-management arrangements** (under section 52) or **third-party management** (under section 53).

> This promotes shared governance and effective implementation of financial policies.

---

##### **H. Restrictions and Safeguards**
- Councils **cannot pass a local revenue law** under paragraph 5(1)(d) or 8.1(1)(a) until:
  - They have passed a **law on financial administration** under paragraph 9(1)(a), and
  - That law has been **approved by the First Nations Financial Management Board**.

> This ensures financial governance is in place before revenue laws are enacted.

- **Capital assets** (e.g., infrastructure) do **not need to be located on reserve lands** — enhancing flexibility in development planning.

- The regulations **do not require** that local services be provided only on reserve lands.

---

#### **5. Regulatory Flexibility and Future Adaptation**
- The Governor in Council may make **further regulations
