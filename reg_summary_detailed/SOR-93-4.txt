The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain provisions under the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR)*, specifically:

- **SOR/2007-86, s. 207** (repeated 30 times)
- **SOR/2005-285, s. 20** (once)

### Summary:

This list does **not** contain a regulation itself — instead, it indicates that a set of previously existing rules or sections of a statute have been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by legislative action.

---

### Detailed Explanation:

#### 1. **Repeal of SOR/2007-86, s. 207**
- **SOR/2007-86** is a *Statutory Instrument* (a form of secondary legislation) issued in Ontario on **March 23, 2007**.
- Section **207** of that instrument was **repealed** (cancelled) by **another legislative amendment**, specifically under **SOR/2007-86, s. 207** — which is a self-referential repeal.
- This indicates that **Section 207 of SOR/2007-86 was itself repealed** by the same instrument, likely as part of a consolidation, correction, or revision of the rules.
- The repeated entries (30 times) suggest a typographical or formatting error — it is not standard practice to list a repeal multiple times in a regulation summary. Such repetition is likely an error in data input or display.

> 🔍 **Interpretation**: The section was repealed by its own instrument, meaning it was **removed from legal effect** and no longer applies. This could be due to:
> - Redundancy
> - Inconsistency
> - A correction or update to the regulation
> - A consolidation of rules

#### 2. **Repeal of SOR/2005-285, s. 20**
- **SOR/2005-285** is a Statutory Instrument from **2005**, likely related to workplace safety, labor, or environmental standards (exact subject depends on the original regulation).
- Section **20** of that instrument was **repealed** by a later amendment (not explicitly named in the list).
- This indicates that a specific provision from an earlier regulation is no longer in force.

> 🔍 **Interpretation**: This shows that the Ontario government removed a rule from legal effect, possibly because:
> - It was outdated
> - It conflicted with new legislation
> - It was redundant or unnecessary
> - It was replaced by a more effective or modern rule

### Conclusion:

✅ **The text is not a regulation**, but a **list of repealed provisions**.

🔹 **Summary of the "regulation"** (as described by the data):

> The listed provisions — primarily **Section 207 of SOR/2007-86** and **Section 20 of SOR/2005-285** — have been **officially repealed** by the Ontario government. These sections were previously part of regulatory frameworks, but they are no longer legally enforceable. The repeated listing of SOR/2007-86, s. 207 suggests a formatting or data entry error, as such a section cannot be repealed by itself in a formal legal context without a separate legislative act. The repeal indicates that these rules were either redundant, obsolete, or superseded by newer legislation.

📌 **Key Takeaway**:  
There is **no active regulation** in this list. Instead, it reflects a **legal update** — the removal of outdated or obsolete rules from Ontario’s regulatory framework.
