### **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Respecting Inquiries into Procurement Complaints by Potential Suppliers under the North American Free Trade Agreement**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **Section 40** of the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act (CITTA)**. They implement provisions related to procurement transparency and fairness for potential suppliers, particularly in the context of trade agreements under the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)** — though it is important to note that **NAFTA has been formally replaced by CUSMA**, and this regulation references several modern trade agreements.

The regulations come into force on the date when **Sections 44, 45, and 46 of the Act to Implement the North American Free Trade Agreement (1993, c. 44)** become effective.

> ⚠️ *Note:* These regulations have since been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-181, s. 2**, meaning they are no longer in force as of 2017. However, this summary provides a comprehensive analysis of their original content and structure for historical and regulatory understanding.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

##### **Core Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act*.
- **Trade Agreement**: A broad category including:
  - The **CFTA (Canadian Free Trade Agreement)**
  - The **Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP)** — a WTO agreement
  - Specific bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements such as:
    - CCFTA (Canada–Colombia)
    - CPFTA (Canada–Peru)
    - CCOFTA (Canada–Colombia)
    - CPAFTA (Canada–Panama)
    - CETA (Canada–EU)
    - CUFTA (Canada–Ukraine)
    - TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership)
    - CUKTCA (Canada–UK Trade Continuity Agreement)

> These are all agreements that contain specific rules governing government procurement.

- **Designated Contract**: A contract or class of contract involving goods or services, as defined in various articles of the trade agreements (e.g., Article II of AGP, Article 1401 of CPFTA, Article 19.2 of CETA), that has been or is proposed to be awarded by a government institution.

- **Government Institution**: Includes:
  - Federal government entities listed in official annexes of trade agreements (e.g., Annex 1 of AGP, Annex 1401.1-1 of CPFTA).
  - Federal government enterprises (e.g., Crown corporations).
  - The Department of Public Works and Government Services (or its successor) when conducting procurements.

- **Working Day**: Any day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday.

- **Potential Supplier**: 
  - A Canadian supplier (as defined in Chapter 5 of the CFTA), or
  - A supplier from a country or customs territory listed in the schedule as a party to a relevant trade agreement applicable to the designated contract.

> A **subcontractor or supplier** is only considered a potential supplier if they are also a bidder or prospective bidder on the contract.

---

#### **3. Application of the Regulations**

- These regulations apply to **complaints filed by potential suppliers** regarding **designated contracts**.
- The rules govern the **timing, eligibility, and procedural requirements** for filing complaints with the **Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT)**.

---

#### **4. Filing Timelines for Complaints**

##### **General Time Limit (Subsection 1)**
- A potential supplier must file a complaint **within 10 working days** after the basis of the complaint becomes known or should reasonably have become known to them.

##### **Exception for Objections Denied by Government (Subsection 2)**
- If a supplier previously objected to a procurement and was denied relief by the government, they may file a complaint **within 10 working days** after gaining **actual or constructive knowledge** of the denial — **provided** the objection was filed within 10 working days of the basis becoming known.

##### **Extended Filing Window (Subsection 3)**
- If a complaint is not filed within the above timelines, it may still be filed **up to 30 days** after the basis of the complaint became known — **only if** the Tribunal determines one of the following:
  1. The failure to file was due to **circumstances beyond the supplier’s control**; or  
  2. The complaint involves a **systemic issue** in the procurement process affecting multiple bidders and relates to compliance with procurement rules under one or more trade agreements.

> This exception recognizes that some suppliers may not be aware of procedural flaws until later, especially if the process is complex or opaque.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This extended window is strictly limited to systemic issues and does not allow for arbitrary delays.

---

#### **5. Preliminary Screening of Complaints**

Upon receipt, the Tribunal must determine within **five working days** whether the complaint meets the following conditions:

1. **The complainant is a potential supplier** (from Canada or a party to a relevant trade agreement).
2. **The complaint relates to a designated contract**.
3. **The procurement process was not conducted in accordance with**:
   - The applicable provisions of the trade agreement (if the supplier is from Canada), or
   - The provisions of the trade agreement to which the supplier’s country is a party (if the supplier is from another country).
4. **If the solicitation restricts origin**, the complainant would have supplied goods/services **only from countries that are parties to applicable trade agreements**.

> If any of these conditions are not met, the complaint will be dismissed.

---

#### **6. Public Notification and Transparency**

- If the Tribunal decides to conduct an inquiry:
  - It must **publish a notice** of the filing in a **circular or periodical** designated by the Treasury Board (ensuring public awareness and transparency).

---

#### **7. Interim Reports and Stakeholder Participation**

- Before issuing any order, finding, or recommendation:
  - The Tribunal must **provide a copy of any interim report** to:
    - The complainant
    - The relevant government institution
    - Any other party the Tribunal deems an **interested party**

- Interested parties may **submit written representations** on any non-confidential aspects of the report.

> This ensures accountability and allows for input from all stakeholders.

---

#### **8. Post-Order Procedures and Certifications**

- If the Tribunal **orders a postponement** of the contract award:
  - The government institution must be **notified within five working days**.

- If, within **seven working days** of the order, the government provides a **certificate** (as defined in subsection 30.13(4) of the Act), the Tribunal shall **rescind the order**.

> This mechanism allows for a review and potential reversal of a postponement if the government can demonstrate compliance or justification.

---

#### **9. Dismissal of Complaints**

A complaint may be dismissed if the Tribunal determines that:

1. The complaint lacks a **valid basis** under the Act, these Regulations, or the applicable trade agreement.
2. One or more of the **preliminary conditions** (e.g., supplier eligibility, designated contract, compliance with rules) are not met.
3. The complaint was **not filed within the required time limits**.
4. The complainant **failed to provide required information**.

> Additionally, if a **national security exception** has been properly invoked, the Tribunal must **dismiss the complaint**.

---

#### **10. National Security Exception**

- The national security exception is considered **properly invoked** when:
  - An **assistant deputy minister or equivalent official** responsible for awarding the contract signs a **letter approving** the exception.
  - The letter is **dated before the contract is awarded**.

> This ensures that national security concerns are formally documented and do not constitute a basis for unfair procurement challenges.

---

#### **11. Tribunal’s Role in Conducting Inquiries**

- When an inquiry is initiated, the Tribunal determines whether the procurement process followed the **provisions of the applicable trade agreement**.

> The Tribunal does **not** have authority to:
- Re-evaluate a bid or award a contract to a complainant.
- Recommend that a contract be awarded to the complainant.
- Compensate the complainant **unless** under very specific conditions.

---

#### **12. Cost Awards and Compensation Limits**

##### **Cost Recovery (Only under Specific Conditions)**
- The Tribunal may **award costs** incurred by the complainant in preparing their response **only if**:
  - The response was **compliant** with the solicitation.
- The cost award shall **not exceed 2% of the complainant’s bid price**.

> ❌ **Important Limitation**: If the Tribunal awards costs, it **cannot simultaneously**:
- Recommend re-evaluation of the bid
- Recommend awarding the contract to the complainant
- Recommend compensation

> This prevents the Tribunal from creating a "win-win" situation that could undermine fair competition.

---

#### **13. Compensation for Lost Profits or Opportunity**

If compensation is allowed, it is limited to one of the following:

| Scenario | Compensation Limit |
|--------|--------------------|
| The contract **should have been awarded** to the complainant | Lost profits = **up to 10% of the complainant’s bid price** |
| The contract **should not have been awarded** to the complainant, or it is unclear | Compensation for **lost opportunity
