The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal or revocation** of a regulation under the *Statutory Instruments of Canada (SOR)*, specifically:

- **SOR/2013-61, s. 6** – multiple instances of "Repealed, SOR/2013-61, s. 6"
- **SOR/92-18, s. 3**, **s. 5**, and **s. 9** – references to revocation or repeal under this earlier statutory instrument

However, **no actual regulation text or substantive content** is included in the input. The list only indicates that certain provisions were **repealed (removed or cancelled)** or **revoked (cancelled by a later act or instrument)**.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Content**  
The provided text is not a regulation itself, but a **list of repeals or revocations** of prior regulatory provisions. It does not contain the actual wording, scope, or purpose of the original regulation that was repealed.

**2. Key Regulatory References**  
- **SOR/2013-61, s. 6**: This refers to **Section 6** of the *Statutory Instrument of 2013, No. 61*. The repeated mention of "Repealed, SOR/2013-61, s. 6" indicates that this specific section was formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent legislative or administrative action.  
- **SOR/92-18, s. 3, s. 5, s. 9**: These refer to earlier statutory instruments from **1992**, specifically Statutory Instrument No. 18. The "Revoked" or "Repealed" status indicates that these sections were officially cancelled, likely due to being superseded, redundant, or inconsistent with newer legislation.

**3. Legal Implications of Repeal**  
- A **repealed provision** is no longer legally enforceable.  
- It means the regulation or rule it previously governed has been **removed from force**, and any actions or obligations based on it are no longer valid.  
- Repeal may occur due to:  
  - Legislative modernization  
  - Inconsistency with current laws  
  - Obsolescence  
  - Replacement by a new regulation  

**4. Contextual Background**  
- The **2013 repeal (SOR/2013-61, s. 6)** likely pertains to a regulation related to **health, safety, or environmental standards**, as such instruments often govern these areas. However, without the original text, the exact subject matter cannot be determined.  
- The **1992 instrument (SOR/92-18)** may have dealt with a different regulatory area—possibly related to **employment standards, workplace safety, or occupational health**—but again, without the original regulation, the precise subject is unknown.

**5. Conclusion**  
The provided text serves as a **record of legislative changes**, not a detailed summary of a regulation. It confirms that:

- Several provisions (specifically Section 6 of SOR/2013-61 and Sections 3, 5, and 9 of SOR/92-18) have been **formally removed** from the legal code.  
- These repeals suggest that the **original regulations were outdated, redundant, or replaced** by newer, more effective legislation.  
- There is **no active, enforceable regulation** currently in force corresponding to these repealed sections.

### Final Note:
To provide a meaningful and detailed summary of the *original regulation* that was repealed, the actual text of the regulation (e.g., its title, purpose, scope, key provisions) would be required. As currently presented, the content only reflects **the legal status of repeal**, not the substance of the regulation itself.

> ✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
> The provided text indicates that specific regulatory sections (Section 6 of SOR/2013-61 and Sections 3, 5, and 9 of SOR/92-18) have been formally repealed or revoked, meaning they are no longer in force and have been replaced or superseded by newer legislation.
