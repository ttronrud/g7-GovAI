## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Pension Plan Overpayments Remission Order**

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**
- **Governing Statute**: The Order is made under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**.
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of:
  - The **Treasury Board**
  - The **Minister of State (Seniors)**

> This Order specifically targets **disability pensions**, **post-retirement disability benefits**, **disabled contributor’s child’s benefits**, and **retirement pension overpayments** resulting from such mismanagement.

### **2. Scope of Remission: Who Is Eligible?**

#### **A. Eligibility for Disability Pension or Post-Retirement Disability Benefit Remission**
A person is eligible for remission if **all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Information Received Before July 1, 2022**  
   The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) received information indicating that a determination **should be made** as to whether the disability pension or post-retirement disability benefit had ceased to be payable **before January 1, 2021**.

2. **No Notification Before November 1, 2023**  
   The Minister **did not notify** the individual of any such determination (i.e., that the benefit had ceased) **before November 1, 2023**, despite having received the triggering information in 2022.

3. **Notification Sent Between November 1, 2023, and March 31, 2025**  
   During the period from **November 1, 2023, to March 31, 2025**, the Minister sent the individual a **formal letter** stating:
   - That the pension or benefit had ceased to be payable.
   - The **specific month** in which it ceased.

4. **No Fraud or Misrepresentation**  
   The individual must **not have committed fraud**, or knowingly made a **false or misleading statement** regarding their eligibility for the benefit.

> ⚠️ *Note: This creates a "delayed notification" scenario — where the government knew the benefit should have ended earlier but failed to inform the recipient until years later.*

### **3. Amount of Remission**

The amount to be remitted equals the **total of all disability pension or post-retirement disability benefit payments** made to the individual **after the month in which the benefit ceased**, as indicated in the letter or as determined by one of the following official decisions:

| Decision Type | Legal Basis |
|-------------|------------|
| A decision by the Minister under **Section 81 of the CPP** | Final determination that the benefit ceased |
| A decision by the **General Division of the Social Security Tribunal** on appeal under **Section 82 of the CPP** | Appeal of a Ministerial decision |
| A decision by the **Appeal Division of the Social Security Tribunal** under **Section 55 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act** | Appeal of a Tribunal decision |
| A decision by the **Federal Court of Appeal** under **paragraph 28(1)(g.1) of the Federal Courts Act** | Judicial review of a Tribunal decision |
| A decision by the **Supreme Court of Canada** on appeal of a prior decision | Highest-level judicial review |

> 💡 *This ensures that remission is only granted based on legally valid, final determinations confirming the end of the benefit.*

### **4. Disabled Contributor’s Child’s Benefit Remission**

If a **disabled contributor’s child’s benefit** was paid after the parent’s disability pension or post-retirement disability benefit had ceased (due to a determination under paragraph 2(1)(c)), then:

#### **Eligible Recipients Include:**
- Any person who received the child’s benefit **after the benefit ceased**, due to the determination.
- Any **person or agency** referred to in **Section 75 of the CPP** that received the benefit **after the cessation**, as a result of that determination, for a child for whom they had **decision-making responsibility** (e.g., a parent, guardian, or legal representative).

> Example: A guardian who received child’s benefit payments after the parent’s disability ended due to a delayed notification.

#### **Amount of Remission**
- Equals the **total amount of disabled contributor’s child’s benefit payments** made to the eligible person or agency **after the month the benefit ceased**.

> ✅ This extends the remission to dependents and caregivers who were financially impacted by the delayed cessation.

---

### **5. Retirement Pension Overpayment Remission**

In addition to the above, **remission is also granted** for **retirement pension overpayments** under the following condition:

- The person received a **retirement pension** that exceeded what they should have received **because the disability pension ceased** in a specific month (as determined under subsection 2(2)).
- The retirement pension **was still payable** to them starting from the month they reached **65 years of age**.

> 🔍 *This means that if someone received a retirement pension after their disability pension ended, and the retirement pension was calculated incorrectly (i.e., assuming the disability pension was still active), the overpayment is forgiven — provided the retirement pension began at age 65.*

> ⚠️ *Note: This overpayment remission applies only to retirement pensions that were not otherwise eligible or justified by other circumstances.*
