## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Eligible Financial Contract General Rules (CCAA)**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
- **Issuance Authority**:  
  The regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**.
- **Legal Basis**:  
  It is made under **subsection 18(1) of the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA)**, which empowers the government to prescribe rules governing eligible financial contracts during insolvency or restructuring proceedings.

> This regulation defines what constitutes an **"eligible financial contract"** under **subsection 2(1) of the CCAA**, which is critical for determining which financial obligations can be treated as eligible for treatment or settlement in a company’s insolvency or restructuring process.

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **(a) Derivatives Agreement**
A financial agreement whose obligations are derived from, referenced to, or based on one or more underlying reference items such as:
- Interest rates
- Indices (e.g., S&P 500)
- Currencies
- Commodities
- Securities or ownership interests
- Credit or guarantee obligations
- Debt securities
- Climatic variables
- Bandwidth
- Freight rates
- Emission rights
- Real property indices
- Inflation or other macroeconomic data

**Includes the following types of instruments**:
- Contracts for differences (CFDs)
- Swaps (including):
  - Total return swaps
  - Price return swaps
  - Default swaps
  - Basis swaps
- Futures agreements
- Caps, collars, floors, and spreads
- Options
- Spot or forward agreements

> These are considered "derivatives" even if settled by **payment** or **delivery**.

#### **(b) Financial Intermediary**
A person who, in the ordinary course of business:
- Acts as a **clearing agency**, or
- Maintains **securities accounts** or **futures accounts** for others (e.g., brokers, banks, trust companies)

> This definition is crucial because it limits the scope of margin loans to those involving financial intermediaries who manage accounts for clients.

---

### **3. Prescribed Types of Eligible Financial Contracts**

Under subsection 2(1) of the CCAA, the following financial agreements are **prescribed as eligible financial contracts**:

#### **(a) Derivatives Agreements**
- Must either:
  - Trade on a **futures or options exchange**, **board**, or **regulated market**, or  
  - Be part of **recurrent dealings** in derivatives markets (including over-the-counter (OTC) markets for securities or commodities)

> This ensures that only actively traded or market-standardized derivatives are eligible, reducing risk and complexity in restructuring.

#### **(b) Agreements to:**
- **Borrow or lend securities or commodities**, including:
  - Agreements where the borrower can repay with other securities, commodities, cash, or cash equivalents  
  *(e.g., short-term lending in securities markets)*
- **Clear or settle** securities, futures, options, or derivatives transactions  
  *(e.g., clearing houses facilitating settlement)*
- **Act as a depository** for securities  
  *(e.g., holding securities on behalf of clients)*

#### **(c) Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, or Buy-Sellback Agreements**
- With respect to **securities or commodities**  
  *(e.g., repo transactions where one party sells securities with an agreement to repurchase them later)*

#### **(d) Margin Loans**
- Only those **in respect of a securities account or futures account** maintained by a **financial intermediary**  
  *(e.g., a broker allowing a client to borrow against securities in their account)*

> Margin loans are excluded if they relate to personal or non-intermediary accounts.

#### **(e) Master Agreements**
- A **master agreement** is eligible **if it covers** any of the agreements listed in (a) to (e) above  
  *(e.g., ISDA master agreements governing derivatives or securities lending)*
- Also eligible **if it covers a master agreement** already referenced in (f)

> Master agreements provide a framework for multiple underlying contracts and are treated as eligible when they relate to the above-mentioned instruments.

#### **(f) Guarantees, Indemnities, or Reimbursement Obligations**
- A guarantee, indemnity, or reimbursement obligation **with respect to liabilities** under any of the agreements in (a) to (g) above  
  *(e.g., a third party guaranteeing a derivative obligation)*

> These are eligible if they support or cover obligations under the prescribed contracts.

#### **(g) Agreements Relating to Financial Collateral**
- Includes:
  - Any form of **security or security interest in collateral**
  - A **title transfer credit support agreement (TTC)**  
    *(a type of agreement where a party transfers title to collateral to support a financial obligation)*

> These are eligible **in respect of** any of the agreements listed in (a) to (h)

> This ensures that collateral arrangements tied to financial obligations are recognized as part of the eligible financial contract framework.

### **4. Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Eligibility Criteria** | Only specific, standardized, or actively traded financial instruments are considered eligible. This prevents inclusion of speculative or unregulated contracts. |
| **Market Regulation** | Emphasis on trading on **regulated markets** or in **recurrent OTC dealings** ensures transparency and reduces systemic risk. |
| **Intermediary Focus** | Margin loans and certain agreements are only eligible when held through **financial intermediaries** (e.g., brokers), not individuals or unregulated entities. |
| **Master Agreements & Support Instruments** | Even indirect obligations (like guarantees or collateral) are eligible if they relate to the core financial contracts. This broadens the scope of what can be treated in restructuring. |
| **Exclusions** | Contracts not meeting these criteria (e.g., private OTC deals, non-regulated swaps, personal loans) are **not eligible**. |
