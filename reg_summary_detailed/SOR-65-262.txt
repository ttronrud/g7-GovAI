Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

### **Detailed Summary of the Pensionable Service Order (SOR/62-196)**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Associate Minister of National Defence**.
- It is authorized under **Vote 545 of the Appropriation Act No. 5, 1961**, which provides the financial and legislative basis for the order.
- The order revokes an earlier directive: **Order in Council P.C. 1962-761**, dated 28 May 1962.
- It replaces that revoked order with a new, updated **Pensionable Service Order**, which is now formally cited as the **Pensionable Service Order**.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **extend pensionable service credits** to certain individuals who served in the Canadian Militia or Defence Services under earlier pension legislation (specifically, Parts I and IV of the Militia Pension Act or the Defence Services Pension Act).

These individuals may have made payments to the **Receiver General** that were intended to be deductions under those older pension schemes. This regulation establishes that such payments—under specific conditions—can be recognized as **pensionable service** under the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Act (CFSA)**, thereby qualifying them for superannuation benefits.

---

#### **3. Who Is Covered?**
A person is eligible for the recognition of pensionable service if they meet **both** of the following conditions:

> **(a)** They have **elected** to come under **Part V** of either:
> - The *Militia Pension Act*, or  
> - The *Defence Services Pension Act*.

> **(b)** While subject to **Parts I and IV** of either of those Acts, they made a **payment to the Receiver General** that purported to be a deduction under those parts for a period of service.

---

#### **4. Conditions for Deemed Pensionable Service**
The period of service in question will be **deemed pensionable** for the purposes of the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* **if one of the following two conditions is met**:

---

##### **Condition 1: Full Coverage**
- The payment made to the Receiver General (as a deduction under Parts I or IV of the Militia or Defence Services Pension Acts) is **sufficient to fully cover** the amount of contributions required by **Section 3** of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.

> In this case, the period of service is automatically recognized as pensionable service.

---

##### **Condition 2: Partial Coverage (with a Lump-Sum Adjustment)**
- If the payment is **not sufficient** to cover the full required contributions under Section 3, then:
  - The individual must **pay the difference** (i.e., the shortfall) in a **lump sum** to the Receiver General.
  - This lump sum must be paid **to the credit of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Account**.

> Upon payment of this difference, the period of service is also deemed to be pensionable service.

---

#### **5. Definition of Required Contributions**
- The amount of contributions required for a given period of service is calculated as:
  > **5% of the aggregate amount of pay** received during that period.

- The term **"aggregate amount of pay"** is defined in **paragraph (g) of Section 36 of the Defence Services Pension Continuation Act**.
  - This definition includes all forms of compensation received during service (e.g., base pay, allowances, bonuses, etc.) that are considered part of total compensation under the Act.

---

#### **6. Key Implications and Effects**
- This regulation **expands pension eligibility** for veterans or service members who previously served under older pension frameworks.
- It provides a **practical pathway** for individuals to have their pre-1962 service periods recognized as pensionable under the modern CFSA system.
- It ensures **consistency and fairness** by linking past service contributions to current superannuation benefits.
- The requirement for a **lump-sum payment** in cases of partial coverage ensures that the individual meets the financial threshold required to qualify under the modern superannuation system.

---

#### **7. Legal Citation and Publication**
- The order is officially published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, Volume 96, No. 11, June 13, 1962**.
- It may be cited as: **Pensionable Service Order (SOR/62-196)**.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a significant administrative and legislative step in **harmonizing pension rights** for individuals who served in the Canadian Armed Forces or Militia under earlier pension systems. By recognizing qualifying payments made under older Acts as pensionable service—either fully or with a supplemental lump sum—it ensures that service members receive appropriate retirement benefits under the current Canadian Forces Superannuation framework, while respecting the historical context of their service.

It reflects a policy of **continuity and equity**, allowing past service to be formally integrated into the modern pension system without requiring a complete reevaluation of service records.
