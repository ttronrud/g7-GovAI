Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the **Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations**, as published under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), with clear explanations of key provisions, objectives, and regulatory requirements.

## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Tetrachloroethylene (Use in Dry Cleaning and Reporting Requirements) Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**
These regulations were made under **section 93 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically pursuant to:
- **Subsection 93(1)**: Authority to make regulations after consultation and review.
- **Subsection 93(3)**: Opportunity for the **National Advisory Committee** to provide advice.
- **Subsection 93(4)**: Determination that the proposed regulations do not conflict with other federal environmental laws and provide **adequate protection** to human health and the environment.

The proposed regulations were first published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **August 18, 2001**, allowing stakeholders to submit comments or objections. After review, the Governor in Council approved the final version on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**.

---

## 🎯 **Primary Objective**
To **minimize environmental and human health risks** associated with the use of **tetrachloroethylene (PCE)** in dry cleaning by:
- Enforcing strict operational standards,
- Mandating waste management practices,
- Requiring detailed reporting and recordkeeping,
- Promoting safer technologies (e.g., closed-loop systems).

Tetrachloroethylene is a **persistent organic pollutant (POP)** and a known **carcinogen**; its release into air, water, or soil poses significant health and ecological risks.

## 📚 **Key Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Refrigerated condenser** | A closed system using mechanical refrigeration to cool PCE vapour into liquid form for reuse in dry-cleaning machines. |
| **Residue** | Solid, liquid, or sludge waste containing PCE, excluding wastewater. Produced at dry-cleaning facilities. |
| **Spotting agent** | Substances applied directly to stains to remove them from textiles, rugs, furs, etc. |
| **Waste management facility** | A facility authorized to handle, recycle, or dispose of PCE, wastewater, and residue. |
| **Wastewater** | Water containing PCE generated by dry-cleaning machines or during carbon adsorber regeneration. |

---

## ⚙️ **Scope and Applicability**
- **Applies to**: Use of tetrachloroethylene for **dry cleaning of textiles, apparel, rugs, furs, leathers, and similar items**.
- **Excludes**:
  - Use in **textile mills** (during manufacturing).
  - Use of **spotting agents containing PCE** for commercial or institutional dry-cleaning.
- **Does not apply to**: Self-service dry-cleaning machines (prohibited under paragraph 5(e)).

---

## 🚫 **Prohibited Activities**
1. **Use of spotting agents containing PCE** for commercial or institutional dry-cleaning.
2. **Use of PCE without proper containment**:
   - PCE, wastewater, and residue must be stored in **closed containers** at all times (except during operation or maintenance).
3. **Transfer of PCE** into dry-cleaning machines or tanks must occur via a **closed direct-coupled delivery system** to prevent atmospheric release.

---

## ✅ **Mandatory Equipment and Operational Requirements**
A dry-cleaning machine may only be used if it meets **all of the following conditions**:

| Requirement | Details |
|-----------|--------|
| **Single drum use** | The machine must use the **same drum** for washing, extraction, drying, and aeration. |
| **Integral refrigerated condenser** | Must recover PCE vapours from recirculated air and convert them back to liquid for reuse. |
| **No venting of vapours** | Must prevent PCE vapour from being vented into the atmosphere during any cycle. |
| **Integral PCE-water separator** | Must recover PCE from wastewater. |
| **Manufacturer’s consumption rating ≤ 10 kg or 6.2 L per 1000 kg of clothing cleaned** | OR the machine was installed or in use **before August 1, 2003**. |
| **Secondary containment system** | Must cover at least the entire surface under each machine, tank, or container and be capable of holding **110% of the largest container’s capacity**. |
| **Tetrachloroethylene-resistant drain plugs** | Must be readily available to seal floor drains in case of spill. |

> ⚠️ *Note: Paragraph 5(e) (prohibition on self-service machines) came into force on August 1, 2003.*

> ⚠️ *Sections 3, 5(a)–(c), (f), and Sections 8–16 came into force on January 1, 2004.*

## 🚚 **Waste Management Requirements**

### 1. **Wastewater Handling**
Owners/operators must ensure **wastewater is either**:
- **Transported to a licensed waste management facility no less than once every 12 months**, **OR**
- **Treated on-site** using a full on-site treatment system that includes:
  - A **second PCE-water separator** (to recover PCE from effluent),
  - An **initial activated carbon filter** (to remove PCE),
  - A **monitor-alarm system** that automatically shuts down the system when the filter becomes saturated,
  - A **second activated carbon filter** (to further purify effluent after saturation detection).

> ⚠️ When transporting wastewater, **all wastewater present in the facility at the time of transport must be moved**, including any not treated on-site.

---

### 2. **Residue Handling**
- All **residue** (solid/liquid waste containing PCE) must be **transported to a waste management facility at least once every 12 months**.
- All residue present in the facility at the time of transport must be removed.

---

## 📝 **Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements**

All persons involved in PCE use, import, recycling, or sale must maintain records and submit annual reports to the **Minister of the Environment** by **April 30 of the following calendar year**.

### 1. **Importers of PCE**
- Maintain records of:
  - Name, address, contact details
