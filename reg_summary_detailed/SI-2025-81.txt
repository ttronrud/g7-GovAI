#### **4. Key Transfer Provisions**

The powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of International Trade are **divided and reassigned** as follows:

##### **A. Transfer to the Minister of State (U.S. Trade)**
- **Scope**: Specifically related to **Canada-U.S. trade**.
- **Responsibilities Assigned**:
  - Negotiation and implementation of trade agreements between Canada and the United States.
  - Oversight of bilateral trade policies, including tariffs, market access, and regulatory alignment.
  - Coordination with U.S. counterparts on trade disputes, compliance, and economic cooperation.
  - Management of trade-related issues arising from the Canada-U.S. border, such as customs procedures, trade facilitation, and supply chain coordination.
- **Rationale**: This reassignment reflects the growing importance of Canada-U.S. trade relations, which account for a significant portion of Canada’s exports and imports. Centralizing this function under a dedicated Minister of State ensures focused, efficient, and timely management of cross-border trade matters.

##### **B. Transfer to the Minister of Foreign Affairs**
- **Scope**: All **other trade matters** (i.e., trade outside of Canada-U.S. relations).
- **Responsibilities Assigned**:
  - Trade policy development and coordination with other countries (e.g., China, EU, Mexico, Asia-Pacific nations).
  - Negotiation of international trade agreements, including free trade agreements (FTAs) and trade deals.
  - Representation of Canada in multilateral trade forums (e.g., WTO, G20, OECD).
  - Promotion of Canadian exports and trade interests abroad.
  - Oversight of trade policy in the context of global economic and geopolitical developments.
- **Rationale**: The Minister of Foreign Affairs is better positioned to manage international diplomacy and complex multilateral trade negotiations. This ensures that trade policy is aligned with broader foreign policy objectives and global strategic interests.

#### **5. Purpose and Strategic Rationale**
- **Improved Efficiency and Specialization**: By separating Canada-U.S. trade (a high-volume, high-frequency issue) from broader international trade, the government enhances administrative efficiency and decision-making speed.
- **Enhanced Diplomatic Coordination**: The Minister of Foreign Affairs can now lead trade diplomacy in a more strategic, global context, while the Minister of State (U.S. Trade) can focus on a critical bilateral relationship.
- **Alignment with Current Trade Realities**: The Canada-U.S. relationship is unique due to shared borders, economic interdependence, and frequent regulatory coordination. A dedicated ministerial role ensures responsiveness and expertise in this domain.

---

#### **6. Implications**
- **Inter-ministerial Coordination**: The transfer strengthens coordination between trade and foreign affairs, ensuring consistency in policy messaging.
- **Accountability**: Each minister is now accountable for specific trade portfolios, improving transparency and performance evaluation.
- **Potential for Streamlined Oversight**: The structure may reduce overlap and duplication in trade policy development.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **strategic reallocation of ministerial responsibilities** within the Canadian federal government. It reflects a modernization of trade governance by:
- Assigning **Canada-U.S. trade** to a specialized Minister of State, ensuring focused and responsive management.
- Placing **all other international trade matters** under the purview of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, aligning trade policy with broader diplomatic goals.

This restructuring supports Canada’s ability to respond effectively to evolving global trade dynamics while maintaining strong economic ties with its largest trading partner—the United States.
