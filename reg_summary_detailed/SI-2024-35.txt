**Regulation Summary: Designation of Specified Ministers under the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act**

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 5 of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act** (S.C. 2024, c. 13), which provides the legal authority for designating specific federal ministers to serve in a designated role related to the implementation and oversight of the Act.

**Key Provision:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, designates the following two Ministers as the **"specified Ministers"** for the purposes of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act:

1. The **Minister of Labour**  
2. The **Minister of Employment and Social Development**

These two Ministers are formally recognized as having responsibility for the administration, coordination, and implementation of the provisions of the Act.

**Legal Significance:**  
Section 5 of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act establishes a formal mechanism for assigning executive responsibility to specific government officials. By designating these two ministers as the "specified Ministers," the regulation ensures that:

- There is clear accountability for the implementation of policies and programs under the Act.
- The responsibilities related to sustainable job creation, green economic transition, workforce development, and labour market outcomes are assigned to key departments—Labour and Employment and Social Development.
- The federal government maintains a coordinated approach between employment policy and labour standards, which are central to the Act’s goals of promoting sustainable, equitable, and inclusive job growth.

**Context and Purpose of the Act:**  
The Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act aims to support a transition to a green, resilient, and inclusive economy by:

- Encouraging investment in clean energy and sustainable industries.
- Supporting workers in transitioning to new, sustainable occupations.
- Strengthening labour market outcomes through training, employment programs, and fair workplace practices.
- Promoting environmental sustainability while ensuring that economic growth does not come at the expense of workers' rights or social equity.

By assigning the specified Ministers to lead the Act’s implementation, the government ensures that both employment policy and labour standards are integrated into the national strategy for sustainable job creation.

**Governance and Authority:**  
- The Governor General in Council acts as the formal authority to issue such designations, reflecting the constitutional role of the Crown in executing government policy.
- The designation is made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, indicating political and ministerial consensus on the leadership structure.
- The ministers are members of the **King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal recognition of their status as senior federal officials with responsibility for key policy areas.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulation is part of **S.C. 2024, c. 13**, the enactment of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act. It comes into force upon the coming into force of the Act, which is typically upon royal assent and publication in the Canada Gazette.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a clear, legally binding framework for the leadership and oversight of the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act. By designating the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the specified Ministers, the federal government ensures that key policy areas—workforce development, labour standards, and employment equity—are effectively coordinated and implemented in support of Canada’s green economic transition.
