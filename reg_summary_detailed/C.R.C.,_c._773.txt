**Detailed Summary of the L-5 Hydroxytryptophan Remission Order**

**Title:**  
This Order is officially designated as the *L-5 Hydroxytryptophan Remission Order*.

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to provide a formal remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of customs duties that were previously paid or are still payable under the United States Customs Tariff for a specific product: *L-5 hydroxytryptophan*.

**Applicable Product:**  
L-5 hydroxytryptophan — a compound used in the synthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, sleep, and appetite. It is commonly used in the pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement industries.

**Date of Application:**  
The remission applies specifically to all imports of L-5 hydroxytryptophan that occurred on or after **October 1, 1975**. This means that any shipments of the product arriving in the United States from that date onward are covered by this remission.

**Nature of the Remission:**  
The regulation grants a full remission of customs duties. This means that:

- Any customs duties that were previously assessed and paid on L-5 hydroxytryptophan imports after October 1, 1975, are **no longer enforceable**.
- Importers are not required to pay those duties retroactively.
- The remission effectively results in a **reduction or elimination of the financial burden** associated with the importation of this product, which may have been intended to support medical or research use, or to encourage availability of a substance with therapeutic potential.

**Legal Citation and Enforcement:**  
The Order may be cited as the *L-5 Hydroxytryptophan Remission Order*, allowing it to be referenced in legal, administrative, and regulatory proceedings. It is enforceable under applicable customs and trade laws, and importers or customs authorities are expected to recognize and apply this remission in accordance with U.S. customs procedures.

**Implications:**  
- This remission likely reflects a policy decision to reduce barriers to the importation of L-5 hydroxytryptophan, possibly due to its medical significance or public health interest.
- It may have been implemented in response to scientific developments, medical needs, or international trade considerations.
- The remission could support research, treatment of conditions related to serotonin deficiency, or the development of new therapies.

**Limitations:**  
- The remission applies only to imports on or after October 1, 1975.
- It does not extend to earlier imports or to other forms of tryptophan or related compounds unless explicitly stated in a subsequent regulation.
- The remission does not affect other regulatory requirements (e.g., FDA approval, labeling, or safety standards) for the product.

**Conclusion:**  
The L-5 Hydroxytryptophan Remission Order is a targeted administrative action that removes the obligation to pay customs duties on L-5 hydroxytryptophan imported into the United States from October 1, 1975, onward. It serves as a mechanism to promote access to a medically relevant compound, likely for therapeutic or research purposes, by reducing the financial and procedural barriers associated with its importation.
