The regulation in question is a formal government announcement issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under the authority granted by paragraph 2(b) of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Amalgamation and Combination of Departments**:
   - The regulation mandates the **amalgamation and combination** of two federal departments:
     - **Communication Canada** (formerly known as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, and previously the Department of Communications)
     - **The Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)**

2. **New Administrative Structure**:
   - The combined entity will operate under the **Minister of Public Works and Government Services**.
   - Operational oversight will be provided by the **Deputy Minister of Public Works and Government Services**.

3. **Effective Date**:
   - The changes take effect on **April 1, 2004**. This date marks the official implementation of the restructuring.

4. **Legal Authority**:
   - The action is authorized specifically under **paragraph 2(b) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision enables the government to reorganize public service departments, including merging or transferring functions, to improve efficiency, accountability, and service delivery.

### Purpose and Implications:

- **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: The merger aims to streamline operations by eliminating duplication and reducing administrative overhead between the telecommunications oversight function (formerly Communication Canada) and the broader public works and government services responsibilities.
  
- **Integration of Functions**: By bringing Communication Canada under the DPWGS, the government seeks to align telecommunications policy and regulation with broader public infrastructure and government service delivery goals. This may include better coordination in areas such as infrastructure development, public service delivery, and policy implementation.

- **Centralized Oversight**: Placing communication responsibilities under the Deputy Minister of Public Works and Government Services ensures that telecommunications policy is integrated into the broader public service framework, potentially improving alignment with national infrastructure and economic development strategies.

- **Potential for Strategic Alignment**: The move may reflect a broader government strategy to consolidate key public service functions under a single, more cohesive department to enhance interdepartmental coordination and policy coherence.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a significant reorganization of the federal public service. It consolidates the functions of Communication Canada into the Department of Public Works and Government Services, effective April 1, 2004, under the leadership of the Minister and Deputy Minister of Public Works and Government Services. The change is legally grounded in the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act and is intended to improve administrative efficiency, policy integration, and service delivery across key public infrastructure and communications domains.
