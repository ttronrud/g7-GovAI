**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Certain Fees in Respect of Travel Document Services and Consular Services (COVID-19 Pandemic) Remission Order*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11), on the recommendation of the **Treasury Board**, the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration**, and the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**. It is issued in the public interest to address the financial burden placed on individuals during the early stages of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, particularly those requiring urgent travel documents.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Refugee Travel Document**:  
  A travel document issued under the **United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951)** and its **Protocol (1967)**. This includes documents issued to individuals recognized as refugees who require international travel.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose is to **remit (waive or cancel)** certain fees associated with travel document and consular services during specific periods in 2020, when the **COVID-19 pandemic** created urgent and unforeseen travel needs.

---

### **Scope of Remission (Fee Waivers)**

The remission applies to fees paid or payable under two main regulatory frameworks:

1. **Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations**  
   - Specifically for services listed in **items 9, 10, and 14** of the schedule to these regulations.
2. **Consular Services Fees Regulations**  
   - Specifically for services under **Section 4** of these regulations.

These services typically include:
- Emergency travel document issuance
- Passport processing
- Certificate of identity applications
- Refugee travel document issuance

## **Two Separate Remission Conditions**

---

### **Condition 1: Emergency Travel Document or Passport Applications (January 31, 2020 – July 31, 2020)**

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- The applicant (or someone acting on their behalf) must have made an application **between January 31, 2020, and July 31, 2020** for:
  - An **emergency travel document** or a **passport**.
- The applicant must have **confirmed** that the person for whom the application was made **needed to return to Canada urgently due to the COVID-19 pandemic**.

**Implication:**  
This provision targets individuals who faced urgent situations (e.g., health emergencies, family crises, or sudden need to return home) during the initial phase of the pandemic and required immediate access to travel documents. The waiver is based on **urgency and pandemic-related necessity**.

---

### **Condition 2: Certificate of Identity, Refugee Travel Document, or Passport Applications (March 18, 2020 – July 31, 2020)**

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- The application must have been made **in Canada**, between **March 18, 2020, and July 31, 2020**, for:
  - A **certificate of identity**
  - A **refugee travel document**
  - A **passport**
- The applicant (or representative) must have:
  - Confirmed that the person for whom the application was made **urgently needed to travel** due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**
  - Requested an **expedited service** (i.e., faster processing than standard)
- The fees in question **must not have already been remitted** under **Section 11** of the *Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations*.

**Implication:**  
This condition is more specific and targeted:
- It applies to **applications made in Canada**, not abroad.
- It emphasizes **urgency** and **expedited processing**.
- It excludes cases where a fee waiver was already granted under Section 11, preventing double benefits.

---

### **Exclusions and Limitations**

- The remission **does not apply** to fees already waived under **Section 11** of the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations.
- The waiver is **not automatic** — it requires **confirmation of pandemic-related urgency** by the applicant or their representative.
- The timeframe is strictly limited to **January 31 to July 31, 2020**, reflecting the early and critical phase of the pandemic when travel disruptions were most severe.

---

### **Administrative and Policy Rationale**

- **Public Interest Justification**: The government recognized that the spread of the pandemic created sudden, life-threatening situations requiring rapid access to travel documents, especially for vulnerable populations (e.g., refugees, individuals with medical needs, or those returning to family).
- **Equity and Access**: The regulation ensures that individuals who could not afford travel document fees due to emergency circumstances are not financially penalized.
- **Proportionality**: The scope is limited to specific services and timeframes to avoid overreach and ensure fiscal responsibility.

---

### **Key Dates and Timeframes**

| Period | Service Type |
|-------|--------------|
| Jan 31 – Jul 31, 2020 | Emergency travel document or passport applications |
| Mar 18 – Jul 31, 2020 | Certificate of identity, refugee travel document, or passport applications (with expedited request) |

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **temporary, pandemic-specific fee remission** for individuals who needed urgent access to travel documents during the early months of the COVID-19 crisis. It reflects a balance between **public financial responsibility** and **humanitarian necessity**, ensuring that vulnerable individuals could return to Canada or access essential services without being burdened by fees during a time of global emergency.

It is a **targeted, time-limited measure** designed to support public health and safety objectives during a period of exceptional disruption.
