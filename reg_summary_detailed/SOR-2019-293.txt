**Detailed Summary of the CPTPP Remission Order**

**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **Section 115a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision enables the government to grant remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of customs duties for specific goods under certain conditions, particularly in the context of international trade agreements like the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**.

The regulation is referenced in two statutory sources:  
- **S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)** – which provides the legal basis for granting remission under specific tariff provisions.  
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – the original enabling statute for customs tariff provisions.

**2. Purpose of the Remission Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant a remission of customs duties** for goods that are:  
- Classified under **tariff item No. 4011.90.90** in the **List of Tariff Provisions** (as set out in the schedule to the Customs Tariff).  
- Imported into Canada during a specific period:  
  **From December 30, 2018, to the date of coming into force of this Order**.  
- Subject to a claim for **CPTPP treatment** (i.e., the goods are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the CPTPP agreement).

This remission ensures that Canadian importers who meet the eligibility criteria are not required to pay customs duties on these goods, provided they meet all procedural and compliance requirements.

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
- **Applicable Goods**: Goods classified under **HS Code 4011.90.90**, which typically refers to **"other articles of the same kind as those of heading 4011, not elsewhere specified or included"**—specifically, certain types of **textile or apparel-related goods** (exact nature depends on the tariff schedule).  
- **Time Period**: The remission applies only to goods imported **on or after December 30, 2018**, and **before the Order comes into force**.  
- **Eligibility Condition**: The goods must have been imported under a claim for **CPTPP preferential treatment** (i.e., the importer must have properly applied for and been granted CPTPP status for these goods).

---

**4. Conditions for Remission**  
Importers are required to meet the following **key condition** to qualify for the remission:  
- They must **submit a formal claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (a key government body responsible for customs and border-related matters) **within two years of the date of importation**.  

This deadline is critical: failure to make the claim within the two-year window will result in the **loss of the right to remission**, even if the goods were eligible under the CPTPP agreement.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (e.g., the Canada Gazette or the Department of Justice). This means that the remission provision becomes legally effective upon official publication and registration, not upon issuance.

**6. Key Implications**  
- **Benefit to Importers**: Importers of eligible goods (classified under 4011.90.90) who imported between December 30, 2018, and the Order’s effective date can recover the customs duties they paid or would have paid, provided they meet the claim deadline.  
- **Compliance Requirement**: The two-year deadline emphasizes the importance of timely compliance and record-keeping. Importers must maintain documentation related to the import, the CPTPP claim, and the remission application.  
- **Alignment with CPTPP Rules**: This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the CPTPP, which includes ensuring that eligible goods receive duty-free treatment when imported under the agreement.  
- **Administrative Burden**: The requirement to file a claim with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness adds an administrative step, which importers must manage carefully.

**7. Conclusion**  
This CPTPP Remission Order is a targeted measure designed to **support trade flows** under the CPTPP by eliminating customs duties on specific goods imported after December 30, 2018. It is conditional on timely claims and proper classification, ensuring both compliance with trade agreement obligations and accountability in customs administration. Importers must act promptly and accurately to benefit from this remission.

> **Note**: The exact nature of goods under tariff item 4011.90.90 should be confirmed via the official tariff schedule or the CPTPP tariff schedule annex, as classification can vary by product type and country of origin.
