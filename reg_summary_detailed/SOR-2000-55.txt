### **Overview**

The *Port Authorities Operations Regulations* (the "Regulations") were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **subsection 62(1) of the Canada Marine Act**. These regulations establish comprehensive rules governing the operations of ports in Canada, particularly focusing on **safety, environmental protection, navigation, property management, and authorized activities** carried out within port areas.

The Regulations apply to **navigable waters of ports**, **port works and activities**, and **property managed, held, or occupied by a port authority**. They are designed to ensure that all activities in a port do not compromise public safety, navigation, environmental integrity, or port operations.
