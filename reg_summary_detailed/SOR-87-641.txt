### **Detailed Summary of the Environmental Studies Research Fund Regions Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Context**

These regulations are issued under **subsection 107(2)** of the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* (C.P.R.A.), which empowers the Governor in Council to prescribe regions for the purposes of **subsection 76(1)** of the Act. This provision relates to the establishment of **Environmental Studies Research Fund (ESRF) regions**, which are designated areas where environmental research and monitoring may be conducted, particularly in relation to petroleum exploration and development.

- The proposed regulations were first published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **May 23, 1987**, as required by law.
- A **reasonable opportunity** was provided for interested parties (including Indigenous communities, scientists, environmental groups, and industry stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Ministers of Energy, Mines and Resources and Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
- **No representations were received** during this period.
- Therefore, based on the recommendation of both Ministers and under **paragraph 83(c)** of the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*, the Governor in Council has formally adopted the regulations.

#### **2. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define specific geographic regions** in Canada that are designated for environmental research and monitoring under the Environmental Studies Research Fund. These regions are established to:

- Support scientific studies on marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
- Assess environmental impacts of oil and gas exploration.
- Promote sustainable resource development with environmental safeguards.
- Provide a structured framework for federal funding and oversight of environmental research.

The regulations may be cited as the **Environmental Studies Research Fund Regions Regulations**.

#### **3. Structure of the Prescribed Regions**

The regulations define **12 prescribed regions**, each with a distinct geographic boundary. These regions are divided into two categories based on their purpose under subsection 76(1) of the C.P.R.A.:

| Purpose | Regions Covered |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Paragraph 76(1)(a)** | Regions 1 to 8 (primarily in the northern and eastern parts of Canada) |
| **Paragraph 76(1)(b)** | Regions 9 to 12 (focusing on the Atlantic shelf and continental margins) |

All regions are illustrated in **Part III of the Schedule**, which includes maps showing the boundaries and spatial relationships.
