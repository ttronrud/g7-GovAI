### **I. Purpose and Legal Basis**

These regulations were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of:
- The **Minister of Health** (for all provisions except Sections 53 and 54), and  
- The **Minister of Health and the Minister of Industry** (for Sections 53 and 54).

They are made under the authority of:
- **Section 30a of the Food and Drugs Act (Act)** — enabling expedited regulatory pathways for clinical trials related to COVID-19;
- **Section 9 of S.C. 2021, c. 7** (amending the Act);
- **Subsection 134(1)c of the Patent Act** — to support innovation in medical devices and drugs;
- **Section 199 of S.C. 2018, c. 27** (related to patent and regulatory flexibility).

The primary objective is to **facilitate the rapid development, testing, and evaluation of medical devices and drugs intended for use in treating, preventing, or mitigating COVID-19**, while ensuring **public safety, ethical standards, and regulatory oversight** during a public health emergency.

### **III. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
1. **Importation and sale** of:
   - A **COVID-19 medical device (Class II or III/IV)** that is to be tested in a clinical trial;
   - A **COVID-19 drug (excluding those listed in Schedule C of the Act)** that is to be tested in a clinical trial.
2. **Conduct of clinical trials** involving such devices or drugs.

> ⚠️ **Exclusions:**
> - **Class I devices** are excluded from the scope.
> - **Drugs listed in Schedule C** (e.g., certain vaccines or therapeutics already approved or under specific conditions) are excluded.
> - The **full scope of the Medical Devices Regulations (except Sections 6, 7 and Schedule 1)** and the **Food and Drug Regulations (except specific sections)** do not apply to devices/drugs undergoing clinical trials **if a valid authorization has been issued and not revoked**.

> ✅ **Exceptional Flexibility:** If a **COVID-19 medical device authorization** is already in place and not revoked, the usual regulatory requirements (e.g., labeling, safety standards, post-market surveillance) are **suspended or relaxed** to allow faster trial conduct.
