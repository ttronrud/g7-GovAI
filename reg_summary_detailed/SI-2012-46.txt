The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Order Acknowledging Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments  
**Source:** S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)  
**Issuing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  

**Key Provision:**  
This order formally acknowledges receipt of scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** under subsection **23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**. These assessments pertain specifically to a list of species included in the **annexed schedule** of the order.

---

**Background and Context:**

- The *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, enacted in 2002, establishes a legal framework to protect wildlife species at risk in Canada.
- Under **Section 23(1)** of SARA, the Minister of the Environment is required to receive and consider scientific assessments from COSEWIC to determine the status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern) of species.
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada. Its assessments are based on scientific data and expert evaluation.
- This regulation serves as an official administrative step to confirm that the government has received and recognized these assessments as part of the formal process under SARA.

---

**Purpose of the Order:**

1. **Formal Recognition:** The order provides official recognition that the assessments of the listed species by COSEWIC have been received and are now part of the legal and scientific foundation for determining the status of those species under SARA.

2. **Trigger for Further Action:** Upon receipt of these assessments, the Minister of the Environment may proceed with:
   - Designating species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" (as per COSEWIC recommendations),
   - Initiating the development of recovery strategies,
   - Potentially listing species under the Act for protection,
   - Ensuring compliance with the Act’s requirements for species at risk.

3. **Transparency and Accountability:** The regulation ensures transparency by documenting the official government acknowledgment of COSEWIC’s scientific evaluations, which strengthens public confidence in the decision-making process.

**Scope of the Annexed Schedule:**

- The schedule attached to the order lists the specific species that have been assessed by COSEWIC.
- These species are subject to formal evaluation under SARA, and their status will be used as a basis for future regulatory, conservation, and policy decisions.

---

**Legal Significance:**

- This order is a critical procedural step in the SARA process. It does not itself impose protection or regulations, but it initiates the legal pathway by confirming that the scientific basis for species status has been received and is now available for ministerial action.
- It demonstrates the government’s commitment to science-based conservation and adherence to the principles of the Species at Risk Act.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a foundational administrative instrument under the *Species at Risk Act*. It formally recognizes the scientific assessments of endangered or at-risk species conducted by COSEWIC and serves as the starting point for potential listing, protection, and recovery planning under Canadian environmental law. It reflects the integration of scientific expertise into policy and underscores Canada’s legal obligation to conserve biodiversity.

**Note:**  
While this regulation is dated 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), it may have been amended or supplemented over time through subsequent orders or updates to the COSEWIC assessments. The specific species listed in the annexed schedule would need to be referenced in the full text of the regulation for detailed species-level information.
