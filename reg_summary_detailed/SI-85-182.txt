This Order formally **revokes** the previous *Courier Imports Remission Order* (P.C. 1982-197), dated January 21, 1982, and replaces it with a new, updated version that provides a modernized framework for the **remission (exemption) of customs duties and excise taxes** on certain imported goods transported into Canada via **courier services**.

### **Key Definitions**

The Order establishes specific definitions to clarify the scope and application of the remission provisions:

1. **Cannabis Product**  
   - Defined as having the same meaning as in **Section 2 of the Excise Act, 2001**.  
   - Excludes cannabis products from the scope of remission (i.e., they are not eligible for duty or tax remission).

2. **Courier**  
   - Refers to a **commercial carrier engaged in scheduled international transportation of shipments of goods**.  
   - Excludes **mail-based imports** (e.g., postal services, parcel post).  
   - Examples include DHL, FedEx, UPS, or other recognized international express delivery companies.

3. **Goods (Exclusions)**  
   The term *goods* excludes the following categories:
   - **Alcoholic beverages**
   - **Cannabis products**
   - **Vaping products**
   - **Cigars, cigarettes, and manufactured tobacco**
   - Goods classified under **tariff item 9816.00.00** (e.g., certain goods subject to reduced duty under Section 85 of the Customs Tariff)
   - **Books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and similar publications** where:
     - The supplier is required to register under **Subdivision d of Division V of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**
     - But is **not registered**

4. **Vaping Product**  
   - Defined as per **Section 2 of the Excise Act, 2001**

### **Scope of Application (Who and What is Covered?)**

The Order applies to **imported goods transported by courier services**, but **only under specific conditions**:

#### ✅ Eligible Goods (with value restrictions):

| Country of Origin | Value Threshold | Remission Granted |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **All countries (except Mexico and the U.S.)** | Up to **$20 (CAD)** | **Customs duties and excise taxes** |
| **Mexico or United States** | Up to **$150 (CAD)** | **Customs duties** |
| **Mexico or United States** | Up to **$40 (CAD)** | **Excise taxes** |

> ⚠️ Note: The remission applies **only** to goods transported by **courier**, not by mail or other postal methods.

### **Exclusions (When the Order Does NOT Apply)**

The Order explicitly **does not apply** in the following situations:

1. **Goods purchased from a Canadian retailer** and shipped directly from outside Canada to the purchaser.  
   → This is considered a domestic retail transaction, not a courier import.

2. **Goods ordered or purchased through**:
   - A Canadian address
   - A post office box
   - A telephone number in Canada  
   → These are treated as domestic purchases, not foreign courier imports.

3. **Goods imported by a person other than the one who ordered or purchased them**  
   → For example, if a third party (e.g., a friend or family member) receives goods on behalf of someone in Canada, the remission does not apply.

> These exclusions prevent abuse of the remission scheme and ensure it targets **direct, personal courier imports** from abroad.

---

### **Remission Process and Claims**

- **Remission is granted automatically** at the time of importation **if the conditions are met**.
- If the **remission is not claimed at the time of importation**, the claimant may still apply for remission **within two years** of the importation date.

> This two-year window provides flexibility for individuals or businesses who may have missed the opportunity to claim the benefit initially.

- To claim remission:
  - A **formal claim must be submitted** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
  - The claim must include details of the importation, value, origin, and nature of the goods.

> This ensures accountability and allows the government to audit and verify claims.

### **Key Policy Objectives**

1. **Support consumer convenience**  
   - Enables Canadians to receive small, urgent international shipments without paying high import fees.

2. **Encourage e-commerce and global trade**  
   - Facilitates cross-border shopping by reducing barriers for low-value, time-sensitive goods.

3. **Maintain fiscal integrity**  
   - Excludes high-risk or regulated items (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, vaping products) to protect public health and revenue.

4. **Ensure transparency and accountability**  
   - Clear eligibility criteria and a defined claim period help prevent fraud and ensure fair application.

### **Legal and Regulatory Context**

- The Order operates under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make regulations for the administration of federal finances.
- It is aligned with the **Customs Tariff** and the **Excise Tax Act**, particularly regarding tariff classifications and excise tax obligations.
- The definition of "goods" reflects current regulatory frameworks, especially the **Excise Act, 2001**, which governs the taxation of tobacco, alcohol, and vaping products.

### **Conclusion**

The *Courier Imports Remission Order* represents a **targeted, consumer-focused policy** that simplifies and modernizes the customs and tax treatment of small-value courier imports into Canada. By setting clear thresholds, defining eligible goods, and excluding high-risk or regulated items, the Order balances **economic efficiency** with **public policy and fiscal responsibility**.

It reflects a shift toward supporting digital trade and global consumer access, while maintaining safeguards to protect public health, ensure tax compliance, and prevent misuse of the remission system.

✅ **In short**:  
Canadians can now receive small-value, courier-delivered goods (up to $20 from non-Mexico/US countries, or up to $150 in customs duties and $40 in excise taxes from Mexico/US) **without paying customs or excise taxes**, provided the goods are directly ordered by the recipient, not purchased through a Canadian address, and are not in the excluded categories (e.g., tobacco, cannabis, vaping products). A claim must be made within two years if not claimed at importation.
