**Detailed Summary of the Grosse Isle, P.Q., Prohibited Place Order**

**1. Title and Citation:**  
The regulation is formally titled the *Grosse Isle, P.Q., Prohibited Place Order* and may be cited as such. This designation allows the order to be formally referenced in legal and regulatory contexts.

**2. Geographic Scope:**  
The order designates the area of *Grosse Isle, located in the County of Montmagny, Province of Quebec*, as a "prohibited place" under the *Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act* (FISIA). This means that certain activities related to foreign interference or the security of information are strictly restricted within this specific geographic location.

**3. Legal Basis:**  
The declaration is grounded in the *Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act*, a Canadian federal law enacted to protect national security by preventing foreign influence on critical information systems, government operations, and public discourse. The Act empowers the government to designate specific locations as prohibited places where activities that could pose a risk to national security—particularly those involving foreign interference—are banned or restricted.

**4. Purpose of the Prohibited Place Designation:**  
The primary purpose of declaring Grosse Isle as a prohibited place is to:
- Prevent unauthorized access, surveillance, or data collection activities that could be exploited for foreign interference.
- Protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of national security-related communications and operations.
- Limit the potential for foreign actors to use the area as a covert operational hub or for espionage activities.

**5. Scope of Application:**  
- The order applies to **any person or entity** engaged in activities that constitute foreign interference or compromise the security of information within the designated area.
- It specifically targets **on-the-ground activities** that may involve intelligence gathering, unauthorized surveillance, or the use of information systems for foreign influence operations.

**6. Exemption Clause:**  
Crucially, the order **does not apply to over-flying aircraft**. This means that:
- Aircraft flying over Grosse Isle are not subject to restrictions or prohibitions under this order.
- Commercial, governmental, or private flights, including those for surveillance or monitoring, are permitted to pass through or over the area without violating the regulation.
- This exemption ensures that air traffic and aerial operations remain operational and unaffected by the ground-based prohibitions.

**7. Legal Implications:**  
- Violations of the prohibited place designation may constitute a breach of the Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act and could lead to legal consequences, including penalties or criminal charges.
- The designation is enforceable by relevant federal authorities, such as the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) or the Department of National Defence, in coordination with law enforcement.

**8. Duration and Review:**  
While the specific duration of the order is not detailed in the provided text, such designations under FISIA are typically temporary and subject to periodic review. The government may extend, modify, or revoke the order based on evolving security assessments or changes in threat levels.

**9. Public Awareness and Compliance:**  
The order is intended to inform individuals, organizations, and agencies operating in or near the area of their legal obligations. Compliance is expected, and failure to adhere to the restrictions may result in enforcement actions.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Grosse Isle, P.Q., Prohibited Place Order* is a targeted security measure under the *Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act* aimed at protecting national security by restricting activities that could be exploited for foreign interference within a specific geographic area. It is narrowly focused—applying only to ground-based activities and not to over-flying aircraft—ensuring a balance between security concerns and operational necessity. This order reflects Canada’s proactive approach to safeguarding critical information infrastructure from external threats.
