The regulation you provided is a formal designation under Canadian statutory law, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Here is a detailed summary of its content, purpose, and legal context:

---

**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
The regulation is issued under **section 3 of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act (NSICPA)**, which was enacted as **Chapter 15 of the Statutes of Canada, 2017**. This Act establishes the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICP), a body responsible for overseeing the activities of Canada’s national security and intelligence agencies.

Section 3 of the NSICPA provides for the appointment of a **Minister** to serve in a specific capacity for the purposes of the Act. This Minister is responsible for facilitating the committee’s operations, including ensuring that the committee can carry out its oversight functions effectively and in accordance with the law.

**2. Key Provision of the Regulation**  
The regulation designates the **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** (i.e., the Prime Minister, as the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons) as the **Minister for the purposes of the NSICPA**.

This designation is not a ministerial appointment in the traditional sense (such as a cabinet minister with portfolio responsibilities), but rather a **designated representative** with specific statutory authority under the Act. The role is defined by the Act itself and is limited to the functions required to enable the NSICP to operate effectively.

---

**3. Effective Date**  
The designation takes effect on the **day on which the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act comes into force**. This is typically the day the Act receives royal assent and is published in the Canada Gazette, which in this case is **April 18, 2017** (the date of enactment of the Act).

---

**4. Purpose and Significance**  
- The designation ensures that the NSICP has a clear and constitutionally grounded point of contact within the federal government for oversight purposes.  
- It allows the committee to engage with the government on national security and intelligence matters in a formal, accountable manner.  
- By assigning the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (the Prime Minister) as the Minister under the Act, the government establishes a direct link between the executive branch and the parliamentary oversight body.  
- This reflects a principle of **accountability and transparency** in national security governance, ensuring that intelligence activities are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

**5. Legal and Constitutional Context**  
- The Prime Minister, as the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, is a constitutional figurehead of the executive branch and holds significant authority in governance.  
- The fact that the Prime Minister is designated as the Minister under this Act underscores the importance of parliamentary oversight in national security matters.  
- The designation is made by the Governor General in Council (the Crown), on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, which reflects the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister leads the government and is responsible for the executive branch’s actions.

---

**6. Scope and Limitations**  
- The role of “Minister for the purposes of the Act” is **limited to the functions specified in the NSICPA**. It does not confer additional powers or responsibilities beyond those defined in the legislation.  
- The designation does not create a new ministerial portfolio or a separate department.  
- The Prime Minister’s role is primarily administrative and procedural in this context—ensuring that the NSICP can function with access to necessary information and government coordination.

---

**7. Implications**  
- The regulation strengthens the **independence and effectiveness** of the NSICP by providing it with a clear and authoritative government representative.  
- It reinforces the principle that **national security and intelligence activities are subject to parliamentary oversight**, a cornerstone of democratic governance in Canada.  
- It ensures continuity and clarity in the governance of intelligence oversight, even as political leadership changes.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a critical step in implementing the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act. By formally designating the Prime Minister as the Minister for the purposes of the Act, it ensures that the NSICP can operate with the necessary governmental support and accountability. It reflects a balanced approach to national security—protecting sensitive information while maintaining democratic oversight through Parliament.
