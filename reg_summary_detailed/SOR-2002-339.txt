**Detailed Summary of the Shared Premises Regulations (Banks)**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The *Shared Premises Regulations (Banks)* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 413.3(4)(a)a of the Bank Act**. This provision grants regulatory authority to establish rules governing banking operations, particularly in relation to shared physical premises.

These regulations are codified under:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 104** (the enabling provision in the Bank Act)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 46** (a reference to prior statutory framework or related legislation)

---

**Key Definitions:**

- **"Member institution"** is defined in the same way as in **Section 2 of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act**.  
  This means a member institution refers to a financial institution that is a member of the CDIC, such as a bank, credit union, or other institution that is insured by the CDIC. The definition ensures consistency in regulatory interpretation across deposit insurance and banking frameworks.

**Core Provision:**

A **bank** that is subject to **paragraph 413(1)(b) or (c)** of the Bank Act may operate its business in Canada from **shared premises** with a **member institution that is affiliated** with the bank — provided that specific conditions are met.

**Conditions for Permissibility of Shared Premises:**

1. **Separate and Distinct Workspaces:**  
   Whenever a customer makes a **personal request to open a deposit account** with the bank, the bank must open the account **at a work space that is separate and distinct from every work space** where the affiliated member institution carries out its business.

2. **Purpose of the Requirement:**  
   The rule is designed to **protect the integrity and independence of banking services**, particularly in deposit-taking activities. By ensuring that account openings are conducted in a physically separated area, the regulation prevents confusion between the bank and its affiliated member institution, reduces potential conflicts of interest, and maintains public confidence in the banking process.

3. **Affiliation Requirement:**  
   The affiliated member institution must be a **direct or indirect affiliate** of the bank. This implies a relationship such as common ownership, control, or shared management, as defined under applicable financial regulations.

---

**Operational Implications:**

- Banks can share office space with affiliated CDIC-member institutions (e.g., a bank and a credit union or another bank under the same holding company).
- However, **deposit account opening must occur in a dedicated, clearly demarcated area** — not in any shared workspace used by the affiliate.
- The requirement applies **only to in-person requests** to open a deposit account. It does not extend to online, telephone, or other non-personal account opening methods.
- The physical separation must be **clear and tangible** — for example, different floors, rooms, or zones with distinct signage, security, and operational controls.

**Effective Date:**

The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*. This ensures immediate applicability upon official publication and implementation.

---

**Regulatory Objectives:**

1. **Consumer Protection:**  
   Prevents customers from being misled or confused about which institution is processing their deposit account, thereby safeguarding consumer trust.

2. **Regulatory Oversight:**  
   Ensures that banking operations remain distinct and compliant with the Bank Act, particularly in areas involving deposit-taking and financial services.

3. **Affiliate Accountability:**  
   Maintains clear boundaries between affiliated institutions, supporting transparency and accountability in financial operations.

4. **Preservation of Deposit Insurance Coverage:**  
   By ensuring that deposit accounts are opened by a clearly identifiable bank entity, the rules help maintain the integrity of the CDIC insurance scheme.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Shared Premises Regulations (Banks)* allow banks to share office space with affiliated member institutions under strict conditions. The central requirement — that deposit account openings must occur in a workspace **separate and distinct** from those used by the affiliate — ensures operational clarity, protects consumer interests, and upholds regulatory standards. These regulations are a practical tool enabling operational efficiency while preserving the integrity of banking services and deposit-taking activities under the Bank Act.
