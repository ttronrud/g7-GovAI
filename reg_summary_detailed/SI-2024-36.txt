**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Certain Fees in Respect of the Issuance of Replacement Documents (2024 Wildfires) Remission Order*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is made under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11), which allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to remit (i.e., waive or cancel) certain fees associated with the replacement of travel or identification documents when it is in the public interest to do so.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this remission order is to provide **financial relief to individuals affected by the 2024 Canadian wildfires**. It waives specific fees that would otherwise be charged when a person applies to replace a lost, damaged, destroyed, or inaccessible document—such as a passport, citizenship certificate, or consular document—due to the impact of wildfires.

This measure reflects a public interest consideration: ensuring that individuals who have suffered significant hardship due to natural disasters are not burdened with administrative fees during a time of crisis.

### **Scope of Fees Remitted**

The regulation waives fees for the following specific documents and services, as listed in the relevant regulatory schedules and provisions:

1. **Items 3 to 8, 14, and 15 of the Schedule to the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations**  
   → These cover fees for replacing various types of travel documents, including:
   - Replacement of a passport (e.g., lost, damaged, destroyed)
   - Replacement of a permanent resident card
   - Replacement of a travel document for a child or adult
   - Replacement of a Canadian citizenship certificate (in some cases)

2. **Item 6 of the Schedule to the Citizenship Regulations**  
   → Covers the fee for replacing a **certificate of citizenship** or related documents.

3. **Subsection 308(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations**  
   → Relates to fees for replacing certain immigration-related documents, such as a **refugee travel document** or **immigration record**.

4. **Section 4 of the Consular Services Fees Regulations**  
   → Covers fees for replacing consular documents (e.g., birth certificates, notarial documents, or other services provided by consular offices).

> **Note:** This remission applies only to fees associated with **replacement** of documents, not initial issuance or other services.

### **Eligibility Conditions**

To qualify for the fee remission, an individual must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Wildfire Impact Requirement**  
   The person must have been **in Canada or had their residence in an area affected by a wildfire** at any time during the period from **April 1, 2024, to November 30, 2024**.

   - The term "affected area" refers to regions officially declared by the Government of Canada as impacted by wildfires during that period.
   - The list of affected areas is determined by the federal government (e.g., based on emergency declarations or wildfire reports from Environment and Climate Change Canada).

2. **Document Loss or Damage Due to Wildfire**  
   The document in question must have been:
   - **Lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible** as a direct result of the wildfire.

   - This must occur while the document was **valid** (i.e., not expired or otherwise invalid).

3. **Application Submitted by November 30, 2024**  
   The person (or someone acting on their behalf) must submit a formal application to replace the document **on or before November 30, 2024**.

4. **Proof of Residency or Presence in Affected Area**  
   The application must include **one of the following**:
   - A **declaration** signed by the applicant or someone acting on their behalf stating that:
     - The document was lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible due to the wildfire; **and**
     - At the time of loss, the applicant was **a resident** of an area affected by the wildfire; **or**
     - The applicant was **in** an affected area at the time of the incident.

   > This requirement ensures that only those who genuinely experienced the wildfire's effects are eligible.

5. **No Prior Remission Under Section 11**  
   The fees in question must **not have already been remitted** under **Section 11 of the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations**.

   - This prevents double-remission and ensures the policy is applied fairly and consistently.

---

### **Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- The remission applies **only to replacement fees**, not to:
  - Initial issuance of documents
  - Fees for services like photo-taking, processing, or courier charges (unless those are included in the listed fees)
- The remission is **time-bound** and applies only to applications submitted **by November 30, 2024**.
- The regulation does **not apply retroactively** beyond the specified period.
- It does **not cover** all types of document replacement—only those specifically listed in the four regulatory provisions above.

---

### **Implementation and Administration**

- The remission is administered by **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** and other relevant federal departments.
- Applicants must provide **clear documentation or declarations** confirming the wildfire impact and their residency or presence in an affected area.
- The burden of proof lies with the applicant, who must clearly state and support their claim.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**

The government has determined that it is in the **public interest** to waive these fees because:
- Wildfires are natural disasters that cause significant personal and financial hardship.
- Individuals affected by wildfires often face displacement, loss of property, and disruption of essential services.
- Requiring payment for document replacement during such crises may be seen as unfair or burdensome.
- Waiving fees supports equitable access to essential identification and travel documents during times of emergency.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides targeted, temporary relief to Canadians who lost, damaged, or had their documents rendered unusable due to wildfires between April 1 and November 30, 2024. It ensures that individuals affected by these disasters are not financially penalized when trying to regain access to critical personal documents such as passports, citizenship certificates, or immigration-related papers.

It is a **proportionate, time-limited, and conditionally based** policy designed to balance fiscal responsibility with humanitarian concerns during a national emergency.
