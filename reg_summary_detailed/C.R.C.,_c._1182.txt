**Detailed Summary of the Height of Wires of Telegraph and Telephone Lines Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Height of Wires of Telegraph and Telephone Lines Regulations*

---

**1. Citation and Purpose**  
These regulations are formally cited as the *Height of Wires of Telegraph and Telephone Lines Regulations*. Their primary purpose is to establish minimum height requirements for the installation, maintenance, and operation of telegraph and telephone lines when they are positioned above, across, or adjacent to highways, public places, and private roads used for vehicular traffic. This ensures public safety, facilitates safe vehicular movement, and prevents interference with traffic operations.

---

**2. Applicability**  
The regulations apply to any company that is legally authorized—either by a **Special Act of Parliament** or by **other federal authority**—to **construct, operate, and maintain telegraph or telephone lines** in Canada.

Such companies include telecommunications providers, utility operators, and other entities operating under federal regulatory frameworks.

---

**3. Scope of Application**  
The height requirements for wires must be strictly observed in the following locations:

- **Highways** (public roads open to vehicular traffic)  
- **Public places** within cities, towns, and incorporated villages  
- **Private ways, entrances, or lanes** that are used for **vehicular traffic** (even if privately owned, if used by vehicles)

This means that even if a private driveway or access lane is used by vehicles, the wires must be installed at a safe height to avoid collision or obstruction.

---

**4. Governing Standard**  
The height at which wires must be installed is determined by reference to the **Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standard C22.3 No. 1-1970**, titled *Overhead Systems and Underground Systems Being Part of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part III*.

Key points about this standard:

- **C22.3 No. 1-1970** provides detailed technical specifications for the design, installation, and safety of overhead and underground communication systems.
- The standard includes **minimum clearance requirements** between overhead wires and vehicles, pedestrians, and other structures.
- These clearances are based on engineering safety factors to account for:
  - Vehicle height and movement (e.g., trucks, buses)
  - Wind loads
  - Sag and thermal expansion of wires
  - Maintenance and emergency access
- The standard is considered a **binding technical reference** under these regulations and is treated as an integral part of the Canadian Electrical Code, Part III.

---

**5. Exceptions and Authority**  
The regulations state that **unless otherwise directed or permitted by the Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)**, the height requirements must be strictly followed.

This means:
- The Railway Transport Committee (a federal body responsible for regulating transportation infrastructure) may issue **specific exemptions or variances** in rare or exceptional circumstances (e.g., due to topographical constraints, historical infrastructure, or unique operational needs).
- Any deviation from the standard height must be **formally approved** by this committee.
- Without such approval, all telegraph and telephone line operators must adhere to the CSA C22.3 No. 1-1970 standards.

---

**6. Enforcement and Compliance**  
While not explicitly detailed in the regulation text, the enforcement of these rules would fall under the jurisdiction of:
- The **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)** or its successor regulatory body
- Provincial or municipal authorities with jurisdiction over transportation and infrastructure
- The relevant federal or provincial regulatory agencies overseeing telecommunications and utilities

Compliance is essential to prevent:
- Vehicle collisions with wires
- Power or signal disruptions
- Public safety hazards
- Legal liability for operators

---

**7. Key Implications**  
- **Safety First**: The regulation prioritizes the safety of road users, especially vehicles, by ensuring wires are installed at sufficient height.
- **Standardization**: By referencing a national standard (CSA C22.3), the regulation promotes uniformity across Canada, reducing confusion and risk.
- **Federal Oversight**: The requirement for approval from the Railway Transport Committee underscores the federal government’s role in regulating critical infrastructure that affects public transportation and safety.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Height of Wires of Telegraph and Telephone Lines Regulations* establish a clear, safety-based framework for the installation and maintenance of telegraph and telephone lines above or across roads and public spaces. They require compliance with the CSA C22.3 No. 1-1970 standard, which provides scientifically based clearance requirements. Deviations are only permitted with formal approval from the Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission. This regulation ensures public safety, maintains consistent standards across Canada, and reflects the federal government’s regulatory oversight of critical communication infrastructure.
