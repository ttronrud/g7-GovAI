**Summary:**

This regulation designates the **Minister of Transport** as the official **Minister responsible for the purposes of the Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act**.

Under Section 6 of the Act, the federal government has the authority to designate a specific minister to act as the principal point of responsibility for implementing and overseeing the provisions of the Act. This designation is not merely administrative—it confers formal authority to that minister to:

- Receive and act on notifications, requests, or communications related to the Act;
- Issue directions or directives under the Act;
- Coordinate with other departments and agencies in implementing the Act’s objectives;
- Serve as the primary liaison between the federal government and stakeholders (such as provinces, territories, employers, and workers) regarding labour mobility and trade-related policies.

The designation is made by the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which reflects the constitutional process for ministerial appointments and the delegation of responsibilities in federal legislation.

**Implications and Context:**

While the *Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act* is intended to promote economic integration by enabling the free movement of labour and goods across provinces and territories, the designation of the Minister of Transport suggests that transportation systems—such as border crossings, transit corridors, and mobility infrastructure—are integral to the success of labour mobility initiatives. This reflects a strategic alignment between transport policy and labour market flexibility.

The choice of the Minister of Transport may also signal a focus on practical, operational aspects of mobility, such as:

- Reducing delays at provincial borders;
- Coordinating with provincial transport authorities;
- Ensuring safe and efficient movement of workers (e.g., seasonal or temporary workers);
- Supporting the development of shared mobility networks.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally assigns the Minister of Transport as the designated minister responsible for the implementation and administration of the *Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act*. It establishes a clear line of accountability and ensures that the transportation dimension of labour mobility is effectively managed within the federal government’s structure. This designation supports the Act’s goal of creating a more integrated, efficient, and accessible Canadian labour market by aligning transport policy with labour mobility objectives.
