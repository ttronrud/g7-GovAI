---

### 6. **Totalization of Creditable Periods (Key Benefit Mechanism)**

This is the **core mechanism** of the Agreement, allowing individuals to **combine contributions from both countries** when determining eligibility for pensions.

#### a) **For OAS Eligibility (Canada)**
- A **creditable period under Indian legislation** is treated as a **period of residence in Canada**.
- This applies to:
  - The person themselves
  - Their spouse or common-law partner
  - Dependants living with them

> Even if the person is not employed in Canada, time spent in India may count toward Canadian residency requirements.

#### b) **For CPP Eligibility (Canada)**
- A **calendar year with at least 3 months of creditable periods under Indian legislation** counts as **one full year** of CPP contribution.
- This helps individuals with part-time or intermittent work in India accumulate enough contributions to qualify for CPP.

#### c) **For Indian Pension Eligibility**
- A **calendar year under CPP** is treated as **12 months** of creditable periods under Indian law.
- A **month under OAS Act** (not part of CPP) counts as **one month** of creditable time under Indian law.

> This allows Indian citizens working in Canada to build pension eligibility in India using their Canadian contributions.

---

### 7. **Eligibility Determination (Article 12)**

If a person is **not eligible** due to insufficient creditable periods under one country:

- Totalize all creditable periods from:
  - Both Canada and India
  - Any third country with which both nations have social security agreements (totalization agreements)

> This ensures that individuals are not denied benefits due to gaps in one country’s coverage.

---

### 8. **Minimum Period Requirement (OAS Outside Canada)**

- A person outside Canada **cannot receive OAS** unless their **totalized periods of residence in Canada** (including time in India under CPP) meet or exceed the **minimum residency requirement** set by the OAS Act.

> This ensures that individuals do not receive benefits without meeting basic residency thresholds.

---

### 9. **Benefit Calculation Rules**

#### a) **For Canada (OAS/Partial Pension)**
If a person qualifies **only through totalization**:
- **Earnings-related portion** of the pension is calculated **based only on CPP pensionable earnings**.
- **Flat-rate portion** is calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Flat-rate} = (\text{CPP flat-rate}) \times \left(\frac{\text{Contributions in Canada}}{\text{Minimum qualifying period}}\right)
  $$
  - The ratio **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., no more than full flat-rate).

> This prevents overpayment and ensures fair calculation.

#### b) **For India (Old Age, Survivor, or Disability Benefits)**
- The **theoretical amount** of benefit would be calculated **as if all periods were accumulated under Indian law alone**.
- The **actual benefit** is then adjusted using the ratio:
  $$
  \text{Actual Benefit} = \text{Theoretical Amount} \times \left(\frac{\text{Periods under Indian law}}{\text{Total periods under both countries}}\right)
  $$

> This ensures a fair, proportional distribution of benefits based on actual contribution history.

### 10. **Administrative Cooperation and Information Exchange**

#### a) **Mutual Communication**
- Competent authorities and institutions must:
  - Share **necessary information** for benefit determination.
  - Provide **free assistance** in determining eligibility or benefit amounts (as if it were their own legislation).
  - Communicate **changes in laws or policies** affecting the Agreement promptly.

#### b) **Confidentiality**
- All information exchanged under the Agreement is:
  - **Confidential**
  - Used **only for implementing the Agreement**
  - Not disclosed to third parties without **prior notification from the sending country**

> This protects privacy
