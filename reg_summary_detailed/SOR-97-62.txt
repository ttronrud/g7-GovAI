## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Definitions for "Imported from Israel or Another CIFTA Beneficiary"**

### **Legal Basis**

- **Statutory Reference:**  
  - S.C. 1996, c. 33, s. 45 (Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act)  
  - R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.) – *Customs Tariff* (as amended)

> This regulation establishes specific definitions to clarify how goods imported from **Israel or other CIFTA beneficiary countries** are treated under Canadian customs law, particularly in relation to **origin, processing, and tariff treatment**.

## 📌 Key Definitions

### 1. **"Imported from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary"**  
This term defines when goods are considered to have originated in Israel or another country eligible under the **Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA)**.

The definition is structured in **three scenarios**, depending on the route of shipment:

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 1: Direct Shipment (No Third Country Involvement)**  
> Goods shipped **directly** from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary to Canada **without passing through any other country**.

- **Example:** A shipment from Tel Aviv to Montreal via sea or air.
- **Implication:** These goods qualify as "imported from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary" and are generally eligible for **preferential tariff treatment** under CIFTA.

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 2: Shipment Through a Third Country (Non-Party Excluded)**  
> Goods shipped through a **third country**, but **not** through the territory of a **non-Party** (i.e., a country not part of CIFTA).

**Conditions for eligibility:**
- The goods must **not undergo further production or any other operation** in that third country, **except**:
  - Unloading  
  - Splitting up of loads  
  - Reloading  
  - Any operation necessary to preserve the goods in good condition or to ship them to Canada  
- The goods must **remain under customs control** throughout their stay in that third country.

> This ensures that the goods are not substantially transformed or processed in a non-CIFTA country, preserving their origin under CIFTA.

**Example:**  
A shipment from Israel → Germany → Canada.  
If the goods are only unloaded, reloaded, and stored in Germany without any manufacturing or value-added processing, and remain under customs control, they qualify.

> ⚠️ **Exclusion:** Goods listed in **Chapters 50 to 63** of the *List of Tariff Provisions* are treated differently — see below.

---

#### ✅ **Scenario 3: Shipment Through a Non-Party (With Exceptions)**  
> Goods shipped through the territory of a **non-Party** (a country not part of CIFTA) are eligible **only if**:

##### **Option A: Minor Processing Allowed**  
- The goods undergo **only minor processing** in the non-Party.  
- **Processing must not increase the transaction value** of the goods by more than **10%**.

> This is a **value threshold rule** to prevent substantial value addition in non-CIFTA countries.

##### **Option B: Goods Listed in Chapters 50–63 of the List of Tariff Provisions**  
For goods specifically listed in **Chapters 50 through 63** of the *List of Tariff Provisions* (e.g., certain textiles, apparel, or food products), the following applies:

- The goods must **not undergo any further production or operation** in the non-Party, **except**:
  - Unloading  
  - Splitting up of loads  
  - Reloading  
  - Operations necessary to preserve condition or facilitate shipment  
- The goods must **remain under customs control** during their stay in the non-Party.

> This creates a **special exception** for certain sensitive or high-value product categories, ensuring that even in non-Party countries, origin is preserved if no significant transformation occurs.

---

### 2. **"Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary"**  
This defines the geographic and legal scope of the CIFTA beneficiary.

- Refers to the **territory where Israel’s customs laws apply**.
- Includes areas where those laws are applied under **Article III of the Protocol on Economic Relations** in the **Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip**, dated September 28, 1995.
- This protocol is **amended from time to time** — so the definition remains dynamic and responsive to changes in the political or legal status of the territories.

> This ensures that even if parts of the West Bank or Gaza Strip are subject to different administrative arrangements, they may still be considered as part of Israel’s customs territory under CIFTA.

---

### 3. **"Non-Party"**  
- Has the **same meaning** as defined in **Section 1 of the CIFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**.
- Refers to countries that are **not parties to CIFTA** and therefore do not participate in the preferential tariff regime.
- Example: The United States, China, or any country not in the CIFTA agreement.

> This term is critical in determining whether a transit country is treated as a "non-Party" (which may allow for more lenient rules) or a "Party" (which may require stricter origin rules).

---

## 📅 Effective Date  
- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 45 of the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 1996, c. 33)** comes into force.  
- **Note:** The regulations were effective on **January 1, 1997** (as indicated in the footnote).

> This ensures alignment with the broader implementation timeline of the CIFTA agreement.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Significance

This regulation serves several key functions:

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarify Origin Rules** | Defines exactly when goods can be considered "originating from Israel or a CIFTA beneficiary" to qualify for preferential tariff treatment under CIFTA. |
| **Prevent Misclassification** | Establishes clear thresholds (e.g., 10% value increase, prohibited operations) to prevent fraud or misrepresentation of origin. |
| **Support Trade Facilitation** | Allows for legitimate international transit without requiring full reprocessing, especially for goods moving through third countries. |
| **Protect CIFTA Benefits** | Ensures that only goods that have not undergone substantial transformation in non-CIFTA countries receive preferential treatment. |
| **Legal Consistency** | Aligns with the broader framework of CIFTA and international trade rules (e.g., WTO rules on origin). |

## 📚 Notes and Practical Implications

- **Tariff Preference:** Goods meeting these criteria may be eligible for **lower tariffs or duty-free treatment** under CIFTA.
- **Customs Control:** The requirement that goods remain under customs control during transit is crucial — it prevents goods from being "processed" or "re-exported" in a way that would change their origin.
- **Chapter 50–63 Exception:** These chapters likely contain goods subject to strict rules (e.g., textiles, clothing, certain food items). The stricter rules here reflect the sensitivity of these product categories in trade policy.
- **Geopolitical Sensitivity:** The inclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian Protocol shows that CIFTA recognizes the complex political situation in the region and attempts to define origin in a legally and politically sound manner.

## ✅ Summary in One Sentence

> Under these regulations, goods are considered "imported from Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary" if they are shipped directly, or through a third country (excluding non-Parties), without undergoing significant processing or value addition — with specific exceptions for goods listed in Chapters 50–63 — ensuring that origin is preserved and preferential tariff treatment is maintained under CIFTA.
