**Regulatory Summary:**

On behalf of the Crown, Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and pursuant to the authority granted by Section 2 of the *National Capital Act*, R.S., c. N-4, the following actions are taken:

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2015-1252 (November 4, 2015):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2015-1252, issued on November 4, 2015. This prior order had previously established or designated certain administrative arrangements or responsibilities related to the governance of the National Capital, Ottawa. By repealing this order, the government removes any legal effect or continuing authority previously conferred by it. This action signals a change in the administrative framework governing the National Capital, likely to reflect updated policy, structural reorganization, or a shift in ministerial responsibilities.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services as Minister for the National Capital Act:**  
   The regulation designates the current **Minister of Public Works and Government Services** as the official "Minister for the purposes of the National Capital Act." This designation means that the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is now the designated minister responsible for overseeing the administration, policy development, and implementation of the provisions of the *National Capital Act*.  
   
   This designation is made under Section 2 of the *National Capital Act*, which provides for the appointment of a Minister to act as the principal responsible official for the governance of the National Capital. The designation is formalized by the recognition of the Minister as a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal title conferred upon individuals who are entrusted with significant government responsibilities, including those involving national policy and public administration.

**Key Implications and Context:**

- **Administrative Streamlining:** The repeal of P.C. 2015-1252 suggests that the previous administrative structure or responsibilities under that order are no longer needed or are being replaced by a more current or efficient framework.
  
- **Ministerial Accountability:** By designating the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, the government ensures that a specific, accountable minister is responsible for the day-to-day governance and oversight of the National Capital, including infrastructure, planning, and public services within Ottawa.

- **Continuity and Legal Clarity:** The designation provides legal clarity and continuity in the governance of the National Capital, ensuring that there is a clearly defined ministerial lead, which is essential for coordination with federal agencies, municipalities, and other stakeholders.

- **Privy Council Status:** The requirement that the Minister be a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada is a formal requirement under the Act, ensuring that the individual has the appropriate status and authority to act in a high-level, policy-making capacity.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal update to the governance structure of the National Capital. It removes an outdated administrative order and assigns the current Minister of Public Works and Government Services as the principal minister responsible for the National Capital under the *National Capital Act*. This change enhances administrative coherence, ensures accountability, and aligns the governance of Ottawa with current government priorities and ministerial responsibilities.
