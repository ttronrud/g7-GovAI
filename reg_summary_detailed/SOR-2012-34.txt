**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2012-1**

---

### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
This exemption order was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. This provision allows the government to make temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.

The order is formally titled:  
**Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2012-1**  
It is registered under the authority of **S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 34** and **R.S., c. R-2; S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2**, which establish the legal framework for such exemptions.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Exemption**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant a temporary exemption** from two key provisions of the *Radiocommunication Act*:

- **Subsection 4(1)**: Prohibits the installation, operation, or possession of radio apparatus that interferes with or obstructs radiocommunications.
- **Paragraph 9(1)(b)**: Prohibits interference with or obstruction of radiocommunications.

This exemption is specifically authorized for **security, safety, or international relations** purposes.

---

### **3. Scope and Duration**
- **Effective Period**: The exemption is valid **from March 2, 2012, to March 5, 2012** — a five-day window.
- **Exempt Entity**: The exemption applies to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- **Geographic Limitation**: The exemption is limited to a specific area within **Ontario**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following geographical coordinates:

| Point | Latitude | Longitude |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 45°33′ N | 75°57′ W |
| 2 | 45°30′ N | 75°36′ W |
| 3 | 45°18′ N | 75°41′ W |
| 4 | 45°22′ N | 75°32′ W |

This area represents a localized region in central Ontario, likely near the **northwestern part of the province**, possibly overlapping with areas of strategic interest such as border zones or emergency response corridors.

> *Note: The coordinates form a roughly rectangular region approximately 20 km in width and 15 km in length, centered around the area near **Sarnia or near the Ontario–Michigan border region**.*

### **4. Conditions for Exemption**
The exemption is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

#### **A. For subsection 4(1) of the Act**  
The radio apparatus must be:
- Installed, operated, or possessed **specifically to interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication**;
- In accordance with **subsection 4(2)** of this Order;
- **Only for the purposes of security, safety, or international relations**.

#### **B. For paragraph 9(1)(b) of the Act**  
The radiocommunication must be interfered with or obstructed:
- **Only for the purposes of security, safety, or international relations**.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization**
To ensure responsible use and minimize unintended consequences, the Order mandates that:
> *"Every reasonable effort must be made to confine or restrict interference or obstruction to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies, and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives."*

This means:
- Interference should be **as localized as possible** (spatially).
- Only **necessary frequencies** should be affected.
- The **duration** of the interference should be the shortest feasible time to achieve the objective.

This principle reflects a balance between operational necessity and the protection of legitimate radiocommunications.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Oversight**
- The exemption is **limited in scope and duration** to prevent misuse or overreach.
- The **RCMP** is responsible for implementing and overseeing the use of the exemption.
- The order is subject to review and compliance with the broader principles of the Radiocommunication Act, including the need for transparency and accountability.

### **7. Entry into Force**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (e.g., the Registrar of Regulations), which typically occurs shortly after publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
| Element | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Temporary, targeted interference with radio communications for national security, safety, or international relations. |
| **Who is Exempt** | The Government of Canada, represented by the RCMP. |
| **When** | March 2–5, 2012 (5-day window). |
| **Where** | A defined quadrilateral area in central/northwestern Ontario. |
| **Conditions** | Must serve security, safety, or international relations; must be minimal in scope (area, frequency, duration). |
| **Legal Basis** | Subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act. |

---

### **Context and Implications**
This Order is a **temporary and narrowly defined exception** to Canada’s strict rules against radio interference. It demonstrates how regulatory frameworks can be flexibly applied in emergencies or sensitive operations where public safety or national interests require overriding normal radio communication protections.

Such exemptions are rare and require strong justification. This particular order appears to have been issued in response to a **specific operational need**, possibly involving:
- Border security operations,
- Counter-terrorism efforts,
- Emergency response coordination,
- Or international diplomatic activities requiring signal disruption (e.g., to prevent interference with hostile communications).

However, due to its **short duration and geographic limitation**, it does not represent a broad policy shift or a routine use of interference powers.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Radiocommunication Act Exemption Order No. 2012-1* is a **targeted, time-limited, and highly restricted exemption** allowing the Canadian government to interfere with radio communications in a specific Ontario region for security, safety, or international relations purposes. It reflects a careful balance between national interest and the protection of lawful radiocommunications, governed by strict procedural and minimization requirements. The Order underscores the importance of accountability, proportionality, and legal oversight in the use of such exceptional powers.
