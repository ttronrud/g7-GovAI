**Detailed Summary of the *Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are formally titled the **Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Regulations** and may be cited as such. They are a set of administrative rules that implement and detail the provisions of the **Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Act** (Act).

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined within the regulations and carry the same meaning as in the underlying Act:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Act* (Loi).
- **Policy**: A valid insurance contract established under the Act (police).
- **Reserve**: The net premium value of a policy calculated using the **British Offices Life Tables, 1893, Om (5)**, with interest applied at **4% per annum** (réserve).
- **Superintendent**: The official responsible for administering the Veterans’ Insurance program — specifically, the **Superintendent of Veterans’ Insurance** (surintendant).

> Any other term defined in the Act is used in these regulations with the same meaning as in the Act.

---

### **3. Authority and Responsibility**
- Where the **Board of Pension Commissioners for Canada** (or "Board") is empowered under a policy term or condition to perform an action, such authority is **exercised by the Superintendent** instead.
- This ensures centralized and consistent administration of policies, with the Superintendent acting as the operational head of the insurance program.

---

### **4. Payment of Premiums**
- All premiums are due **monthly**, with the due date being the **first day of each month**.
- Premiums may also be paid **quarterly, semi-annually, or annually in advance**, at which rates they are:
  - Quarterly: 3 times the monthly premium,
  - Semi-annual: 6 times,
  - Annual: 12 times.
- Payments made in advance are treated as full prepayments and are not subject to additional interest or penalties.

---

### **5. Refund on Death During a Premium Period**
- If the insured **dies during a period for which a premium has been paid**, the policy settlement includes:
  - A **refund of the portion of the premium** paid for the **unexpired portion of that period**, calculated from the **end of the calendar month** in which death occurs.

> Example: If the insured dies in the middle of June, the refund covers the premium for the remainder of June and any subsequent months, calculated from the end of June.

---

### **6. Refund on Surrender of Policy**
- If the policy is **surrendered**, the insured receives:
  - The **cash surrender value** of the policy, **plus**
  - A refund of the premium for the unexpired portion of the period.

> The unexpired portion is calculated from **either**:
> - The **beginning** of the month in which surrender occurs, or  
> - The **end** of the month in which surrender occurs  
> — whichever results in the **greater total**.

> This ensures the insured receives the maximum possible refund in the event of surrender.

---

### **7. Paid-Up Insurance (When Premiums Are Missed)**
- If the insured **fails to pay a premium within the grace period** and **applies in writing within three months** of the due date for **paid-up insurance**, they are entitled to a reduced amount of insurance that continues without further premium payments.

#### **Calculation of Paid-Up Insurance**:
- **For policies requiring 20 years of premium payments**:
  - The paid-up amount equals the **proportion of the original insurance** based on the **total premiums paid** relative to the **total premiums originally payable** over 20 years.

- **For all other policies**:
  - The paid-up amount is the **single net premium** that the reserve (calculated using the same life table and 4% interest basis) would provide, **applied at the insured’s attained age**.

> Paid-up insurance is subject to the **same conditions** as the original policy (e.g., benefit eligibility, medical requirements).

---

### **8. Cash Surrender Value (CSV)**
- A cash surrender value may be paid **only if**:
  1. The insured submits a **written application** to the Superintendent;
  2. The application is made by the **insured** or by the **beneficiary/beneficiaries** (unless their whereabouts are unknown or cannot be found after a search satisfactory to the Superintendent);
  3. The policy is **returned to the Superintendent for cancellation or retention**.

> This allows policyholders to access cash value in specific, controlled circumstances.

---

### **9. Automatic Continuation of Policy (If No Action Taken)**
- If the insured **fails to pay a premium within the grace period** and:
  - No application is made for paid-up insurance,
  - No cash surrender value is requested,
  - And the automatic extension period has **not expired**,

> The policy is **automatically extended** in full for the **full amount of insurance**, for a period determined by the **cash surrender value** at the date of default.

> The extension period is calculated as the number of months that the cash surrender value, if applied as a **net single premium** at the insured’s current age, would cover — **rounded down to full months**.

> This ensures that the policy remains in force without requiring active action from the insured, preserving coverage in the event of temporary financial hardship.

---

### **10. Medical Examination and Disability Benefits**
- To apply for any benefit under **Section 9 of the Act** (likely covering disability or medical benefits), the insured must provide:
  - A **medical report** from a **competent physician**, on a form provided by the Superintendent.

> The **fees for the physician** are borne by the insured.

- A **medical referee**, appointed by the Superintendent, will review each claim.
- The referee’s **decision is final** and binding.

- In cases of **mental derangement** causing disability:
  - The disability benefit may be paid to **any person or persons** the Superintendent deems appropriate (e.g., family members, legal representatives).

---

### **11. Restoration of Policy (After Default)**
- If the insured:
  - Fails to pay a premium by the end of the grace period,
  - Does not apply for paid-up insurance,
  - Does not surrender the policy,
  - And the automatic extension period has not expired,

> The insured may **restore the policy** to a premium-paying basis **at any time within five years** from the due date of the first missed premium.

> To restore:
- The insured must pay:
  - All **arrears of premiums**,
  - **Interest** on those arrears at **6% per annum compounded annually**.

> This provision offers a grace period of up to five years to recover from financial difficulties without permanent loss of coverage.

---

### **12. Proof of Age, Identity, and Existence**
- The age, identity, existence, or death of individuals must be proven by **documents or evidence** as required by the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**.

> If proof of age is provided during the insured’s lifetime, the age may be **endorsed on the policy** by an authorized official.

---

### **13. Financial Accountability – The Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Fund**
- A dedicated account in the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** is established and named the **Returned Soldiers’ Insurance Fund (Fund)**.
- The Fund:
  - Is **credited** with all premiums and other moneys received,
  - Is **charged** with all payments made under the Act (e.g., benefits, refunds, surrenders).

> This ensures transparent financial tracking of the insurance program.

---

### **14. Annual Liability Review and Fund Balancing**
At the end of each **fiscal year**, the Superintendent must:

1. **Calculate the total liability** arising from all policies issued under the Act.
2. Compare this liability to the **current balance of the Fund**.

#### **Adjustment Rules**:
- If **liability > Fund balance**:
  - The Fund is **credited** with the **difference** (i.e., the shortfall is covered by the government or other sources).

- If **liability < Fund balance**:
  - The Fund is **charged** with the **excess** (i.e., surplus is transferred out to the government or other accounts).

> This mechanism ensures the Fund remains solvent and financially stable, with automatic adjustments to prevent deficits or surpluses from accumulating.

> In this section, "Superintendent" has the same meaning as defined in the **Department of Insurance Act**.
