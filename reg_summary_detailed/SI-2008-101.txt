**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the Northwest Territories from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer) in order to **facilitate the establishment and expansion of the Nahanni National Park Reserve**.

This action ensures that these lands are protected and preserved for conservation, environmental protection, and the sustainable management of natural resources, consistent with Canada’s national parks policy and the goals of environmental stewardship.

### **Scope of Withdrawal**

#### 1. **Land Withdrawn from Disposal**
- The tracts of territorial land listed in **Schedule 1** are withdrawn from disposal.
- This includes:
  - **Surface rights** to the lands.
  - **Subsurface rights** to the lands listed in **Schedule 2**.
- The withdrawal is effective from the **date the Order is made** until **October 31, 2010**.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This withdrawal applies only to the **disposal of land** (such as through leasing or selling), not to other forms of mineral or resource activities.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exemptions)**

Despite the general withdrawal, the following activities are **exempt** and **not affected** by this Order:

1. **Mineral Claims Prior to the Order’s Effective Date**  
   - Locating a mineral claim by a holder of a prospecting permit issued *before* the Order came into force.
   - Recording a mineral claim that was already located or referred to before the Order.

2. **Leasing of Recorded Claims**  
   - Granting a lease under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person with a *recorded claim*, even if the lease covers part of that claim.

3. **Significant Discovery Licences**  
   - Issuance of a significant discovery licence under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of an exploration licence issued *before* the Order, if the licence covers an area subject to that exploration licence.

4. **Production Licences**  
   - Issuance of a production licence to a holder of:
     - A significant discovery licence (if issued before the Order), or
     - An exploration licence (if issued before the Order),
     provided the production licence covers land subject to the prior licence.

5. **Surface Leases for Claim Operations**  
   - Granting a surface lease to a claim holder (under mining regulations or petroleum interests) where the lease is required to allow the holder to exercise rights under their claim or interest.

6. **Renewal of Interests**  
   - Renewal of existing mineral or surface interests (e.g., leases, licences) that were already in place prior to the Order.

> ✅ These exemptions ensure continuity in existing mineral exploration and development activities, particularly those already underway or legally established before the Order was issued.

### **Repeal Clause (Land Repealed)**

This Order includes a **repeal provision** that removes certain previously designated parcels of land from the jurisdiction of the Territorial Lands Act.

#### **Repealed Land Description (First Parcel)**  
A large parcel of land in the Northwest Territories, approximately **28,800 km²**, described in precise coordinates using the **NAD83 (CSRS)** datum and the **UTM projection**. The boundaries are defined by a series of straight-line bearings and points, including:
- Starting at the intersection of the Yukon/NWT boundary with the southern boundary of the Sahtu Settlement Area.
- Progressing through multiple directional lines to the Nahanni monument and the Yukon/NWT boundary.
- Ending at the point of commencement.

> 🔍 **Key Exemptions from Repeal**:
> - All lands already included in the **Nahanni National Park Reserve of Canada** under the *Canada National Parks Act* (as described in **Schedule 2 to that Act**).
> - All lands described in **Schedule 2 to this Order** (i.e., the land withdrawn under this Order).

> 💡 This means the land is *not* being reclassified or removed from federal or park jurisdiction — it is being *protected* and *withdrawn from disposal*, not simply erased.

#### **Second Parcel (Smaller Area)**  
A smaller parcel of approximately **367 km²**, located near the northern part of the Nahanni region, described as follows:
- Commencing at latitude 61°44′24″ N, longitude 124°42′36″ W.
- Proceeding through a series of directional lines back to the starting point.

> This parcel is also **exempt** from being subject to the general withdrawal rules due to its inclusion in Schedule 2 of this Order.

---

### **Geospatial and Technical Details**

- All coordinates are referenced to the **1983 North American Datum (NAD83)** and the **Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS)**.
- All "straight lines" refer to **direct lines on the NAD83 UTM projection plane**, not necessarily on the Earth’s surface.
- This ensures accuracy in land boundary definition and legal mapping.

### **Key Implications and Context**

1. **Environmental Protection**  
   The Order supports the expansion of the **Nahanni National Park Reserve**, one of Canada’s most ecologically significant protected areas, known for its pristine wilderness, biodiversity, and cultural importance to Indigenous communities.

2. **Conservation Over Development**  
   By withdrawing large tracts from disposal, the government prioritizes conservation and prevents potential land-use conflicts (e.g., mining, logging, or industrial development) that could harm the park’s ecological integrity.

3. **Legal Continuity for Existing Rights**  
   The exemptions ensure that existing mineral exploration and development rights are not disrupted. This is crucial for maintaining economic activity and legal certainty in the sector, especially for companies with pre-existing exploration permits.

4. **Temporary Nature of the Withdrawal**  
   The withdrawal is **temporary**, ending on **October 31, 2010**. This allows for a defined period during which the park can be established and managed, after which the lands may be reconsidered for disposal or other uses, depending on future policy decisions.

5. **Indigenous and Regional Considerations**  
   The Sahtu Settlement Area and the involvement of Indigenous communities in land use planning are implicitly recognized, as the area overlaps with Indigenous territories and traditional lands.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, temporary measure** to protect and expand the **Nahanni National Park Reserve** by withdrawing specific tracts of territorial land from disposal. It balances environmental conservation with legal and economic realities by:

- Withholding large areas from commercial use,
- Preserving existing mineral rights and development activities (where they predate the Order),
- Ensuring precise, geographically accurate land descriptions using modern survey standards,
- Maintaining continuity in the operation of mineral exploration and production under existing regulatory frameworks.

It reflects a broader national policy of protecting ecologically sensitive regions while respecting the rights and interests of existing stakeholders.

**Final Note:**  
This Order is **not a permanent land-use restriction** but a **strategic, time-limited intervention** to support the establishment of a national park. Its expiration on **October 31, 2010**, indicates that the government intended to use this mechanism as a temporary step in the broader process of park development and land management.
