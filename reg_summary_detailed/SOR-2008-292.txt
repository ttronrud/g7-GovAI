**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2008-1**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**
This exemption order was issued under the authority of **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act** (R.S.C., c. R-2), as recommended by the **Minister of Industry** and approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**. The order is formally titled:

> *Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2008-1.*

It was enacted under the legal framework established by:
- **S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 34** (amending the Radiocommunication Act)
- **R.S., c. R-2; S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2** (providing foundational provisions for exemptions)

The purpose of this Order is to provide a **temporary exemption** from certain provisions of the Radiocommunication Act that normally regulate the use and operation of radio communications, specifically **subsection 4(1)** and **paragraph 9(1)(b)**, in order to support **national security, public safety, or international relations**.

### **2. Scope of the Exemption**

#### **Applying Entity**
- The exemption applies to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- This means the RCMP is granted special authority to conduct radio interference or obstruction activities without being subject to the usual regulatory requirements under the Radiocommunication Act.

#### **Time Period**
- The exemption is **temporary and time-limited**, effective from:
  - **October 16, 2008**, to
  - **October 19, 2008** (a period of 4 days).

#### **Geographic Limitation**
- The exemption is restricted to a **specific geographic area within Quebec**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following coordinates:
  1. 47°06′ N latitude and 71°24′ W longitude  
  2. 47°06′ N latitude and 70°52′ W longitude  
  3. 46°47′ N latitude and 70°52′ W longitude  
  4. 46°47′ N latitude and 71°24′ W longitude  

This area represents a **narrow region in central Quebec**, approximately 19 kilometers wide and 12 kilometers long, centered around the region near the **border between Quebec and Ontario**, possibly near the **Sudbury or Ottawa–Gatineau corridor**, though exact municipal boundaries are not specified.

> *Note: This area is not the entire province of Quebec, nor does it extend beyond the defined quadrilateral.*

### **3. Conditions for Exemption**

#### **Exemption under subsection 4(1) of the Act**
- The exemption applies **only if**:
  - The radio apparatus used is installed, operated, or possessed **specifically to interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication**.
  - Such interference is carried out **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
  - The purpose of the interference is **security, safety, or international relations**.

> *This means the RCMP cannot use this exemption for any arbitrary or unrelated reason. The activity must be directly tied to one of the three stated objectives.*

#### **Exemption under paragraph 9(1)(b) of the Act**
- This provision allows for interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication **only if**:
  - The interference is conducted for the purposes of **security, safety, or international relations**.

> *This ensures that the exemption is not used for political, commercial, or non-essential purposes.*

---

### **4. Principle of Minimization and Proportionality**

A key requirement established in the Order is the principle of **proportionality and minimal impact**:

> *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies, and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This means:
- The RCMP must **limit the geographic scope** of the interference to only what is necessary.
- The **number of radio frequencies** affected must be minimized.
- The **duration** of the interference must be as short as possible.
- This reflects a commitment to **regulatory accountability**, ensuring that the exceptional power granted does not cause unnecessary disruption to civilian or commercial radio services.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette*).

---

### **6. Key Objectives and Rationale**

The Order was likely issued to address a **specific, time-sensitive operational need**, such as:
- Preventing or disrupting unauthorized transmissions that threaten national security (e.g., terrorism, espionage).
- Responding to a critical safety emergency (e.g., a threat to public infrastructure or emergency services).
- Supporting international diplomatic or intelligence operations requiring temporary signal disruption.

By granting a **limited, time-bound, and geographically restricted exemption**, the government ensures that the exceptional powers are used responsibly and in compliance with legal and democratic principles.

---

### **7. Legal and Policy Significance**

- This Order exemplifies the **balance between national security and regulatory compliance**.
- It demonstrates how the Canadian government can use **emergency or exceptional powers** under the Radiocommunication Act to respond to urgent threats, while maintaining safeguards to prevent abuse.
- It underscores the importance of **proportionality, necessity, and transparency** in the use of such exemptions.

### **Conclusion**

The **Radiocommunication Act Exemption Order No. 2008-1** is a **temporary, narrowly scoped, and strictly regulated exemption** that allows the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police** to interfere with or obstruct radio communications within a defined geographic area in Quebec for a short period (October 16–19, 2008). The exemption is strictly limited to **security, safety, or international relations purposes**, and must be conducted in a way that minimizes disruption to radio services. It reflects a well-structured legal mechanism to address exceptional national interests while preserving the integrity of the broader radiocommunication regulatory framework.

> **Bottom Line**: This is not a general or permanent power. It is a **targeted, time-limited, and accountability-driven measure** designed to serve urgent public interests without undermining the broader rules governing radio spectrum use in Canada.
