### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

- **Section 33 of the Government Organization Act, 1979 (S.C. 1978-79, c. 13; R.S., c. F-17)**  
  This section establishes the administrative responsibility of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** for the implementation and administration of the **Great Lakes Fisheries Convention Act**.  
  The Act governs the management and conservation of fishery resources in the Great Lakes region, which includes Canada’s share of the Great Lakes fishery.  
  This responsibility implies that the MFO oversees compliance with international agreements, coordinates with other Canadian federal departments, and manages relations with the United States and other Great Lakes nations through the **Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC)**.

### **2. Purpose of the Transfer**

- The regulation formally **transfers certain powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans **in relation to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission** to the **Minister of Foreign Affairs (MFA)**.

- This transfer is not a general reorganization of fisheries responsibilities, but specifically targets **international cooperation and intergovernmental coordination** under the Great Lakes Fishery Commission — an international body established under the **Great Lakes Fisheries Convention** (signed in 1955, with subsequent agreements).

---

### **3. Legal Authority for the Transfer**

- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(c) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22; R.S., c. P-34).  
  This Act provides the legal framework for reassigning governmental duties and functions between ministers, typically to improve efficiency, enhance interdepartmental coordination, or align with broader policy goals.

- The Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) has the authority to make such transfers under this Act, reflecting a formal and constitutionally sound process of ministerial reorganization.

### **4. Scope of the Transfer**

- The transfer specifically includes:
  - **Powers** related to the administration and participation in the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.
  - **Duties** such as representing Canada in GLFC meetings, negotiating agreements, and ensuring compliance with international fishery management frameworks.
  - **Functions** involving coordination with U.S. authorities and other member nations (e.g., the United States, Mexico, and the Great Lakes nations) on shared fishery resources.

- Importantly, this transfer **does not extend to other domestic fisheries management responsibilities** of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (e.g., aquaculture, domestic fishery regulations, or inland fisheries). It is limited to **international cooperation and diplomatic functions** related to the GLFC.

---

### **5. Rationale and Implications**

- **Strategic Realignment**: The shift reflects a recognition that the **management of shared transboundary fisheries** — especially in the Great Lakes — requires strong **foreign policy and international relations expertise**. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is better positioned to manage diplomatic engagement, multilateral negotiations, and cross-border environmental agreements.

- **Enhanced Diplomatic Coordination**: By placing GLFC responsibilities under the Foreign Affairs portfolio, Canada ensures that fishery-related diplomacy is integrated into broader foreign policy frameworks, improving consistency and strategic coherence in international environmental and resource management.

- **Continuity of Policy**: While the administrative responsibility shifts, the underlying objectives — sustainable fishery management, ecosystem protection, and equitable resource use — remain unchanged. The transfer ensures that Canada continues to participate actively in the GLFC, with appropriate diplomatic oversight.

---

### **6. Effective Date and Legal Citation**

- The regulation was enacted through **Statutory Instrument S.C. 2003, c. 22, section 207** (and is cited in the Revised Statutes as R.S., c. P-34).  
- It became effective upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and is binding on all federal departments and agencies.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant **restructuring of intergovernmental responsibilities** within the Canadian federal government. It reflects a strategic decision to centralize the diplomatic and international coordination aspects of Great Lakes fisheries management under the Minister of Foreign Affairs, ensuring that Canada’s participation in the Great Lakes Fishery Commission is aligned with broader foreign policy and international environmental cooperation goals. The transfer enhances Canada’s ability to negotiate and implement sustainable, transboundary fishery policies while preserving the integrity of domestic fisheries governance.
