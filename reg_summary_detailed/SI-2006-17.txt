**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Designation of Deputy Head:**  
   The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) officially designates the **Registrar of the Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists** as the **deputy head** of that office. This means the Registrar holds the position of deputy to the head of the Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists, which is responsible for administering and overseeing the federal lobbying regime in Canada.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The designation is authorized under **paragraph 11(2)(a)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the federal government to designate individuals to serve in key administrative or leadership roles within federal offices, including those with oversight responsibilities. It provides the legal foundation for appointing a deputy head in a manner consistent with federal administrative practices.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   The designation takes effect on **February 6, 2006**. This date marks the beginning of the Registrar’s formal role as deputy head, with all associated responsibilities and reporting relationships coming into force.

4. **Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists:**  
   This office is established under the *Lobbying Act* (originally enacted in 2003 and later amended). Its primary functions include:
   - Registering individuals and organizations that engage in lobbying activities before Parliament.
   - Ensuring transparency and accountability in lobbying practices.
   - Maintaining a public registry of lobbyists and their activities.
   - Enforcing compliance with lobbying rules and regulations.

5. **Implications of the Designation:**
   - The Registrar now serves as the **second-in-command** of the Office, assisting the head (typically a senior official appointed by the Minister of Justice or another relevant minister) in managing operations.
   - The designation strengthens the administrative structure of the office, ensuring clear leadership and operational continuity.
   - It reflects a formal recognition of the Registrar’s role in the federal oversight of lobbying, reinforcing the importance of transparency and accountability in the legislative process.

6. **Historical Context:**  
   This regulation was issued in the context of the 2003 *Lobbying Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22), which established a formal framework for regulating lobbying in Canada. The designation of the Registrar as deputy head was part of institutionalizing the office to ensure effective implementation of the Act.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally establishes the Registrar of the Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists as the deputy head of the office, effective February 6, 2006. It is grounded in the *Financial Administration Act* and serves to strengthen the governance and operational capacity of Canada’s federal lobbying oversight body.
