**Governing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, pursuant to **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act**.

**Purpose:**  
This regulation authorizes the **Minister of Agriculture** to issue a formal order that establishes and prescribes **fees** to be paid by users who receive **technical assistance services** or **access to research and development (R&D) facilities** provided by the **Food Research and Development Centre (FRDC)** of the **Department of Agriculture**, located in **Saint-Hyacinthe, Québec**.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Legal Basis:**  
   The authority to prescribe fees is derived from **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) to authorize the Minister of Agriculture to set fees for services provided by government departments and agencies. This ensures that fee-setting is conducted within a framework of financial accountability and administrative oversight.

2. **Applicable Entity:**  
   The **Food Research and Development Centre (FRDC)**, which is part of the **Department of Agriculture**, is the entity providing the services. The FRDC is located in **Saint-Hyacinthe, Québec**, and is responsible for delivering technical assistance and R&D facilities to users.

3. **Scope of Services Covered:**  
   The regulation applies to:
   - **Technical assistance services** (e.g., advisory support, training, on-site guidance, or expert consultation related to food production, processing, or safety).
   - **Use of research and development facilities** (e.g., laboratory access, testing equipment, pilot-scale production units, or specialized instrumentation).

4. **Fee Authorization:**  
   The **Minister of Agriculture** is granted the authority to:
   - Determine the **amounts** of fees to be charged.
   - Specify **conditions** under which fees apply (e.g., based on the type of service, duration of use, volume of output, or user category).
   - Issue a formal **order** (a regulatory instrument) that sets these fees and makes them legally binding.

5. **User Responsibility:**  
   Any individual, business, or organization that accesses the technical assistance or R&D facilities at the FRDC is required to pay the fees as prescribed in the Minister’s order.

6. **Administrative Oversight:**  
   The Treasury Board’s recommendation ensures that the fee structure is transparent, fair, and aligned with broader government financial policies. This regulatory step also ensures that the FRDC can maintain operational sustainability while serving public interest.

7. **Implementation and Review:**  
   While the regulation does not specify timelines or review mechanisms, it implies that the Minister will issue a detailed order outlining the fee structure, which will be subject to potential public consultation, internal review, or periodic evaluation to ensure continued appropriateness and fairness.

**Significance and Implications:**

- It introduces a **market-based mechanism** for resource allocation, ensuring that high-demand or resource-intensive services are appropriately valued.
- It supports **public accountability**, as fees are established under clear legislative authority and subject to Treasury Board oversight.
