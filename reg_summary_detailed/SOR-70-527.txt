**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Claims (Hungary) Settlement Regulations**

### **Claim Submission and Deadlines**

- **Notice Deadline**: No claim can be considered by the Commission unless notice is given **on or before March 31, 1971**.
- **Effective Notice**: Any notice submitted to the Government of Canada by that date is deemed to have been submitted to the Commission and is referred to it by the Minister.
- **Posthumous Claims**:
  - If a claimant dies before the Commission determines their claim, and a surviving person is legally entitled to the award, the Commission may proceed with the claim as if the claimant were still alive.
  - **After June 1, 1970**: No award can be paid to a non-Canadian citizen if the claimant died after that date.
  - **Before June 1, 1970**: Awards may be paid to a surviving person regardless of nationality.

---

### **Submission of Evidence**

- All **documentary evidence and written representations** necessary to support a claim must be submitted to the Commission **by March 31, 1975**.

---

### **Exclusion of Non-Canadian Claimants**

- **No award** will be made to a claimant who was **not a Canadian citizen at the time notice of the claim was given**.

---

### **Offsetting Compensation from Other Sources**

- If a claimant receives or is likely to receive compensation from **any source other than the Foreign Claims Fund**, the Commission must **deduct that amount** from the recommended award.
- If a claimant **loses eligibility** due to their own neglect or failure to act (e.g., failing to apply before a deadline), they are **deemed to have received** the compensation from another source.
- **Neglect** is defined as failing to act when a claimant knew or should have known that non-application would result in losing eligibility for compensation elsewhere.

---

### **Additional Payments by the Chief Commissioner**

The Chief Commissioner may recommend, in addition to the base award:

1. **One-third of the award** in lieu of accrued interest.
2. **$50 or 10% of the award (whichever is less)** as reimbursement for **necessary expenses** incurred in establishing the claim.

> These are optional recommendations and not guaranteed.

---

### **Reporting Requirements**

The Chief Commissioner must report to the **Minister of External Affairs** and the **Minister of Finance** on each claim, including:

- Whether the claimant is **eligible** for an award;
- The **recommended amount** of the award;
- The **specific paragraph** in the claim definition under which the claim arises.

> The Chief Commissioner may issue a report **early** if delay would cause undue hardship—especially when assessing recovery from other sources.

---

### **Final Determination and Payment Authority**

- The **Minister and Minister of Finance** jointly determine:
  - The **final amount** of any award to be paid from the Fund;
  - To whom (if the claimant is deceased) the award shall be paid.

> **Important**: A recommendation by the Chief Commissioner **does not confer a right** to an award. Final approval rests with the Ministers.

---

### **Funding Allocation for Awards**

Awards are paid from **specific portions of the Foreign Claims Fund**, based on the type of claim:

| Claim Type | Source of Fund |
|----------|----------------|
| (a), (b), (c), (e) | Moneys credited under **paragraph (b)** of Vote 22a + interest |
| (d) | Moneys credited under **paragraph (a)** of Vote 22a + interest |

> This ensures that different types of claims are funded from designated portions of the Fund.

---

### **Provisions for Insufficient Funds**

If the funds in a designated portion are **insufficient** to pay all awards:

1. **Offset**: Awards are reduced by any compensation already received or likely to be received from other sources.
2. **Equal Payments**: All awards are paid in **equal installments**, up to:
   - The full amount, or
   - **$1,000**, whichever is **lesser**.
3. **Pro Rata Payments**: Remaining balances are paid on a **pro rata basis** from any remaining funds in that portion.

> This ensures fairness and prevents overburdening the Fund.

---

### **Payment Timing and Conditions**

- **No payment** from a portion of the Fund is made until **all awards from that portion are fully paid**.
- Payments may be made in **one or more installments**, based on:
  - Availability of funds in the relevant portion;
  - The potential size of future awards pending before the Commission.

---

### **Pre-Payment Requirements**

Before any award is paid, the **Minister of Finance** must obtain:

1. A **release** (in a form acceptable to the Minister) from the claimant or relevant party.
2. All **documents of title** related to the claim.

> These ensure legal clarity and prevent future disputes.

---

### **Assignment of Rights**

- The Minister of Finance may require that a claimant **assign their entitlement** to compensation from a source other than the Fund to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
- If assignment is not possible, the claimant must provide an **undertaking** to take all necessary actions to vest those rights in the Crown.

> This ensures that the Crown retains control over claims that may have alternative compensation sources.

---

### **Succession and Continuity of Office**

- In the event of:
  - **Absence or incapacity** of the Chief Commissioner → The **Deputy Chief Commissioner** performs all duties.
  - **Absence or incapacity of two Commissioners** → The **remaining Commissioner** performs the functions of the Commission.

> Ensures continuity of operations even in leadership gaps.

---

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

1. **Limited Scope**: Only claims involving **Canadian citizens** and certain treaty obligations are covered.
2. **Time-Bound Submission**: Strict deadlines for claim notice and evidence submission.
3. **Fairness and Equity**:
   - Provisions for posthumous claims and surviving beneficiaries.
   - Offset of compensation from other sources.
4. **Funding Accountability**:
   - Clear allocation of funds by claim type.
