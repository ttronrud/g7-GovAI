**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Turkey Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Quebec Turkey Marketing Levies Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes a system of levies on turkey producers in Quebec who market turkeys beyond their allocated market quotas.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Quebec* (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation and the authority of the Commodity Board.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Fédération des producteurs de volailles du Québec* (Fédération of Quebec Poultry Producers), established under the Farm Products Marketing Act. This body is responsible for administering the marketing plan and collecting levies.

- **Market Allotment**: The maximum quantity of turkey meat (in weight) that a producer is permitted to market—whether intraprovincial, interprovincial, or exported—based on the Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations and the Commodity Board’s regulations under the Plan.

- **Plan**: The *Quebec Poultry Producers’ Joint Plan*, established and amended over time under the Farm Products Marketing Act. This Plan sets out the framework for managing turkey production, distribution, and marketing, including the allocation of market quotas and the imposition of levies.

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the growing or production of turkeys within the Province of Quebec who is subject to the Plan and its associated regulations.

- **Turkey**: A turkey that is produced or grown in Quebec specifically for slaughter purposes.

### **3. Purpose of the Levies**

The primary purpose of the levies is to **generate revenue for the Commodity Board** to support the management and sustainability of the Quebec turkey marketing system. These levies are imposed **only on turkeys marketed in excess of a producer’s market allotment**.

- **Levy Rate**: A flat rate of **$0.05 per pound of live weight** is applied to every turkey that exceeds a producer’s market allotment.
- **Scope**: Applies to all turkeys marketed beyond the allotted amount—regardless of whether the sale is intraprovincial, interprovincial, or exported.

---

### **4. Obligations of Buyers (Purchasers)**

Any person who purchases turkeys from a producer is required to:

- **Deduct the applicable levy** from the total payment made to the producer.
- **Pay the full levy amount directly to the Commodity Board** within a specified timeframe.

**Payment Deadline**:  
The buyer must pay the levies to the Commodity Board **not later than the 15th day of the month next following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

> Example: If turkeys are sold in March 2024, the buyer must pay the levies by April 15, 2024.

---

### **5. Obligations of Producers**

Producers are responsible for ensuring that all levies due on turkeys sold beyond their market allotment are paid to the Commodity Board. If the buyer fails to deduct and remit the levies:

- The producer must **pay the levies directly** to the Commodity Board.

**Payment Deadline**:  
Producers must pay any unpaid levies **not later than the 15th day of the month next following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

> Example: If turkeys are sold in April 2024, the producer must pay any unpaid levies by May 15, 2024.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The Commodity Board is the designated authority for receiving payments.
- The payment address is: **515 Viger Street East, Montreal, Quebec**.
- The system ensures that levies are collected regardless of whether the buyer or the producer makes the payment, with clear responsibilities assigned to each party.

---

### **7. Legal and Regulatory Context**

- The levies are **additional to those already established under the Plan**, meaning they are not a replacement but a supplementary charge.
- The Plan and its regulations are central to the operation of the marketing system and govern how market allotments are determined and how levies are applied.
- The Order operates under the authority granted by the Farm Products Marketing Act, ensuring legal enforceability.

---

### **8. Key Objectives and Implications**

- **Revenue Generation**: Funds collected support the Commodity Board in managing market stability, pricing, and distribution.
- **Market Control**: Limits the total volume of turkey marketed in Quebec and beyond, helping prevent market oversupply and price volatility.
- **Fair Distribution**: Ensures that producers who exceed their quotas contribute financially to the system, promoting equitable management of supply.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Clear rules for buyers and producers ensure transparency in levy collection and compliance.

### **Conclusion**

The **Quebec Turkey Marketing Levies Order** is a critical component of the province’s poultry marketing framework. It imposes a **$0.05 per pound live weight levy** on producers who market turkeys beyond their allocated market allotment. The levy is collected through a shared responsibility system: **buyers must deduct and remit the levy**, and **producers must pay any unpaid levies**. All payments are due by the **15th day of the following month** after the sale. This system supports market stability, ensures equitable resource distribution, and generates revenue for the Commodity Board to manage the broader turkey marketing system in Quebec.
