**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Hydro Nuclear Facilities Exclusion Regulations (Use of Tobacco)**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, under **section 8.2a of the Non-smokers’ Health Act (NSHA)**. This provision allows for the creation of exclusions from the Act in specific circumstances where public health or safety concerns require special consideration.

The regulations are part of the broader legislative framework aimed at protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke exposure in workplaces. However, they establish a **specific exemption** for employment at certain nuclear facilities in Ontario — particularly those operated by **Ontario Hydro** — to balance public health concerns with the unique operational and safety requirements of nuclear facilities.

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Primary Statute**: *Non-smokers’ Health Act* (R.S.O. 1990, c. S.13)  
- **Specific Authority**: Section 8.2a of the NSHA enables the government to exclude certain workplaces from the Act’s provisions if the exclusion is justified on grounds of public health, safety, or operational necessity.
- **Applicable Regulation**: *Smoking in the Workplace Act* (R.S.O. 1990, c. S.13), which is the primary legislation governing smoking in workplaces in Ontario.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Smoking in the Workplace Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.13 (Loi).  
   → This is the main legislation being modified or excluded in certain contexts.

2. **Employment**  
   Means employment with:
   - Ontario Hydro, or  
   - A "person referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of nuclear facility."  
   → This ensures that only those working directly at or in connection with nuclear facilities are covered under the exemption.

3. **Nuclear Facility**  
   Defined as:
   - A nuclear facility in Ontario that is subject to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA) or its regulations, **and**  
     - Owned and operated by Ontario Hydro; **or**  
     - Owned or operated by another entity, **but only if** it becomes owned and operated by Ontario Hydro on the day these regulations come into force or on any day after that date.  
   → This creates a dynamic exemption that applies to facilities that may transition into Ontario Hydro’s ownership.

   → The definition is designed to ensure that only facilities with a direct operational link to nuclear power generation and safety regulation are excluded.

### **Core Exclusion Provision**

> **Employment on or in connection with a nuclear facility is hereby excluded from the application of the Non-smokers’ Health Act, except sections 8.1 and 8.2.**

This means:
- The general rules of the NSHA (which prohibit smoking in workplaces and require employers to manage tobacco use) **do not apply** to employees working at nuclear facilities.
- **Exception**: Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the NSHA **remain in force** and are still applicable.  
  → This suggests that while smoking is not prohibited in general, the Act retains certain provisions related to:
  - The right of non-smokers to be protected from exposure (section 8.1),
  - The obligation of employers to take reasonable steps to prevent exposure (section 8.2).

This narrow exception ensures that the fundamental protections for non-smokers are not entirely removed, even in high-risk environments.

### **Application of Other Provisions of the Smoking in the Workplace Act**

> **Subject to section 4, the Act, as amended from time to time, applies, to the extent that it is relevant, in relation to employment on or in connection with a nuclear facility.**

This means:
- While the main prohibitions on smoking are excluded, **other relevant provisions** of the Smoking in the Workplace Act may still apply — for example, those related to:
  - Employer responsibilities,
  - Health and safety standards,
  - Employee rights,
  - Compliance with workplace policies.
- The exclusion is not absolute; it is conditional and limited to the specific scope of the NSHA’s smoking prohibitions.

### **Amendment to Section 3 of the Smoking in the Workplace Act**

> For the purposes of section 3, the reference to “another Act or a regulation” in subsection 11(1) of the Act shall be read as a reference to “another Act or a regulation including the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, and any regulations made pursuant to that Act”.

This amendment clarifies that:
- When the Smoking in the Workplace Act refers to "another Act or regulation" (e.g., in relation to health and safety obligations), it **must now include**:
  - The *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA),
  - Any regulations made under the NSCA.
- This ensures that nuclear facility operations are governed by the full scope of nuclear safety laws, even in the context of workplace smoking rules.

→ This strengthens the integration of nuclear safety regulations into workplace compliance, reinforcing that nuclear facility operations are subject to stricter regulatory oversight.

---

### **Effective Date**

> These Regulations come into force on **April 1, 1998**.

This date marks the beginning of the exemption for nuclear facility workers, allowing Ontario Hydro and any nuclear facilities it later acquires or operates to be exempt from the general smoking prohibitions under the NSHA — with the noted exceptions.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To protect nuclear safety and operational integrity**  
   - Smoking near nuclear facilities poses significant risks due to the potential for fires, explosions, or contamination.  
   - The exclusion is justified by the need to maintain strict safety protocols in high-risk environments.

2. **To recognize the unique nature of nuclear facilities**  
   - These sites are subject to stringent federal and provincial safety regulations, which already regulate smoking and fire hazards.

3. **To maintain a balance between public health and workplace safety**  
   - While the NSHA aims to protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke, this regulation acknowledges that in certain high-hazard environments, the risks of smoking may outweigh the benefits of general prohibition.

4. **To ensure legal clarity and consistency**  
   - By clearly defining which parts of the NSHA apply and which are excluded, the regulation avoids ambiguity and provides certainty for employers, employees, and regulators.

### **Limitations and Implications**

- **Not a blanket exemption**: Smoking is not fully permitted; only the *prohibitions* under the NSHA are excluded. Other workplace health and safety rules still apply.
- **Exclusion is time-bound and location-specific**: Applies only to nuclear facilities in Ontario and only when operated by Ontario Hydro or transitioning into Ontario Hydro ownership.
- **Does not extend to other industries**: The exemption is limited to nuclear facilities and does not apply to other workplaces or sectors.
- **Does not protect employees from secondhand smoke**: The exclusion does not guarantee that non-smokers are free from exposure; safety measures must still be implemented under other laws (e.g., NSCA).

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Hydro Nuclear Facilities Exclusion Regulations (Use of Tobacco)* provide a targeted exemption from the *Non-smokers’ Health Act* for employees working at nuclear facilities in Ontario — particularly those operated by Ontario Hydro or that come under its ownership. While it removes the general smoking prohibitions under the NSHA, it preserves key protections under sections 8.1 and 8.2 and ensures that nuclear safety regulations remain paramount. The regulations reflect a pragmatic approach to public health and safety, recognizing the unique risks and operational needs of nuclear facilities while maintaining a balance with broader workplace health policies.

These regulations were a significant step in tailoring workplace tobacco policies to high-risk environments and remain relevant in the context of nuclear energy regulation in Canada.
