The statement "[Repealed by operation of law, 2011, c. 25, s. 39]" indicates that a particular regulation (or statute section) has been officially repealed—not through a deliberate legislative act, but by operation of law—under the provisions of **Act No. 25 of 2011** (commonly referred to as "2011, c. 25"), specifically **Section 39** of that act.

### Detailed Summary:

1. **Repeal by Operation of Law**:
   - The term "repealed by operation of law" means that the regulation was automatically terminated or invalidated due to a legal mechanism established in the legislation itself. This is not a result of a subsequent legislative decision to repeal it, but rather a consequence of the legal framework created in the 2011 Act.
   - Such repeals often occur when a new law supersedes an older one, or when a statutory provision explicitly states that certain rules are no longer in force due to changes in the legal or administrative framework.

2. **Legal Citation**:
   - **2011, c. 25**: This refers to a specific Act passed in the year 2011, which is typically a legislative amendment or reform act. In the context of Canadian law (as the citation format suggests), "c. 25" denotes Chapter 25 of the Statutes of the province or territory in question.
   - **Section 39**: This section of the Act contains the specific provision that triggers the repeal of the referenced regulation.

3. **Implication of Repeal**:
   - Any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously established by the repealed regulation are no longer enforceable or applicable.
   - The repeal takes effect as of the date specified in the Act (often the date of enactment or a specific date mentioned in the section).
   - The repeal may be part of a broader legislative modernization effort—such as streamlining administrative processes, eliminating outdated rules, or aligning with new policy objectives.

4. **Purpose of the Repeal**:
   - The repeal likely reflects a change in policy, administrative efficiency, or legal consistency. For example, the regulation may have been outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current legislation or best practices.
   - It may also reflect a shift in governance or jurisdictional responsibilities, such as the transfer of functions to a new agency or the integration of rules into a consolidated statute.

5. **Legal Effect**:
   - Once repealed, the regulation is legally void and cannot be cited or enforced.
   - Any prior actions or decisions based on the regulation may be subject to review or interpretation under current law, depending on the context.

6. **Public Access and Compliance**:
   - Legal professionals, regulators, and the public are advised to consult current statutes and regulations to ensure compliance.
   - This repeal should be noted in legal databases, regulatory registers, or official government publications to prevent reliance on obsolete provisions.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the statement is no longer in force. It was formally and automatically repealed by Section 39 of Act No. 25 of 2011, which was enacted as part of a broader legislative reform. This repeal signifies that the regulation has been superseded by law and should not be used as a basis for legal or administrative action. For accurate and up-to-date regulatory information, one should refer to the current version of the statute or related administrative codes.
