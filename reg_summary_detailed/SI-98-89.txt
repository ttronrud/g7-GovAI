### **Regulatory Summary: Charges and Remission for Environmental Assessment Services**

#### **1. Authority to Prescribe Charges**
- **Regulatory Text**:  
  *"His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(b)a of the Financial Administration Act, hereby authorizes the Minister of the Environment to prescribe by order the charges to be paid to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (the Agency) by the proponent of a project for the services that are provided by the Agency on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada in the course of an environmental assessment conducted by a review panel under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act."*  
  *(S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6)*

- **Key Elements**:
  - **Legal Authority**: The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) grants the **Minister of the Environment** the power to **establish and prescribe fees** (charges) for environmental assessment services.
  - **Scope of Charges**: The fees apply to services provided by the **Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA)** during the environmental assessment process.
  - **Context of Services**: These services are delivered **on behalf of the Government of Canada** and are conducted in the course of an assessment carried out by a **review panel** under the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA)*.
  - **Nature of the Power**: This is a **prescriptive authority**, meaning the Minister can issue formal orders (regulations) setting specific fees for different types of assessments or services (e.g., review panel meetings, reports, consultations, etc.).

- **Purpose**:
  - To ensure **transparent, fair, and consistent pricing** for environmental assessment services.
  - To provide a **clear financial framework** for project proponents (private or public entities) to budget for environmental review costs.
  - To align fee structures with the **costs of delivering services** and ensure the Agency can operate efficiently and sustainably.

- **Legal Basis**:  
  Paragraph 19(1)(b)a of the *Financial Administration Act* allows the government to authorize fees for services provided by agencies in the course of public administration, provided the fees are reasonable and necessary.

#### **2. Authority to Grant Remission of Charges**
- **Regulatory Text**:  
  *"Pursuant to subsection 23(2.1)b of the Financial Administration Act, if a service is not rendered to the proponent and the charges have already been paid in whole or in part, considering that it is in the public interest to remit the charges, hereby grants remission of the charges paid so that the Agency reimburses the charges to the person who paid them."*  
  *(S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))*

- **Key Elements**:
  - **Remission Condition**: Charges may be **cancelled or refunded** (remitted) **only if**:
    1. The **service was not actually rendered** to the proponent (i.e., the review panel did not perform the required work or the assessment was cancelled or terminated early).
    2. The proponent has **already paid the charges in full or in part**.
  - **Public Interest Test**: The decision to remit charges must be based on a determination that it is **in the public interest** to do so.
  - **Outcome of Remission**: The Agency will **reimburse the proponent** (or the person who paid the charges) for the amount remitted.

- **Purpose**:
  - To **protect proponents** from financial loss when assessments are cancelled or services are not delivered due to procedural, administrative, or other reasons.
  - To maintain **public trust** in the environmental assessment process by ensuring fairness and accountability.
  - To prevent unjust financial burdens on project developers when government processes fail to deliver on commitments.

- **Legal Basis**:  
  Subsection 23(2.1)b of the *Financial Administration Act* permits the government to remit fees when a service is not delivered and a public interest justification exists. This provision supports **financial accountability and flexibility** in public service delivery.

   - Must maintain clear records of services rendered.
   - Must justify remission decisions to ensure transparency and accountability.

3. **For Regulatory Oversight**:
   - The Treasury Board and Minister of the Environment are responsible for ensuring fees are reasonable, transparent, and consistent with public interest.
   - The process supports both **financial sustainability** of the Agency and **fairness** to project developers.
