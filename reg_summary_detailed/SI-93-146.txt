**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Investment Development Division under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the power to reorganize the public service by transferring control, supervision, or administrative responsibilities between departments or divisions, as recommended by the Prime Minister.

**Subject of the Transfer:**  
The **Investment Development Division** of **Investment Canada**.

**Scope of the Transfer:**  
The transfer involves the **control and supervision** of the Investment Development Division — specifically, that portion of the public service within Investment Canada responsible for investment-related development activities.

**Destination Department:**  
The Division will be transferred to the **Department of External Affairs** (DEA).

**Key Implications:**

1. **Administrative Reorganization:**  
   This move reflects a strategic realignment within the federal public service to better align investment development functions with broader foreign policy and international economic engagement objectives.

2. **Functional Integration:**  
   By placing the Investment Development Division under the Department of External Affairs, the government aims to strengthen coordination between investment promotion, international trade, and diplomatic relations. This integration may enhance Canada’s ability to attract foreign investment through policies that are aligned with national economic and foreign policy goals.

3. **Continuity of Functions:**  
   While the administrative oversight changes, the core functions of the Investment Development Division — such as promoting Canadian investment opportunities abroad, supporting foreign investors, and facilitating investment in Canada — will remain intact. The operational responsibilities and staff will continue to serve the same public interest functions.

4. **Governance and Oversight:**  
   The Department of External Affairs will now be responsible for setting policy, strategic direction, performance monitoring, and resource allocation for the division. This includes compliance with relevant legislation and reporting requirements.

5. **Legal and Procedural Compliance:**  
   The transfer is formally enacted through a statutory instrument under the authority granted by the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, ensuring that the reorganization follows established legal and procedural safeguards.

**Purpose and Rationale (Implied):**  
The transfer is likely intended to:
- Improve the coherence and effectiveness of Canada’s international investment strategy,
- Align investment promotion with Canada’s broader foreign policy and economic diplomacy,
- Enhance interdepartmental coordination between trade, investment, and foreign affairs.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation constitutes a formal and legally valid reassignment of administrative control within the federal public service. It transfers the oversight of the Investment Development Division from Investment Canada to the Department of External Affairs, enabling a more integrated approach to international investment promotion under the umbrella of foreign policy and economic diplomacy. The change underscores the government’s intent to streamline and strategically position key public service functions to support national economic and diplomatic objectives.
