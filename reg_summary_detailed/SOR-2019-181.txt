**Detailed Summary of the European Space Agency Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**

The *European Space Agency Privileges and Immunities Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of two key federal ministers:

- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs**
- The **Minister of Finance**

This action is grounded in **Section 5a of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act* (FMOA)**, which empowers the government to establish orders granting privileges and immunities to international organizations and their representatives, in accordance with international agreements and conventions.

The Order was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (S.C. 2002, c. 12, s. 3 and 10) and is referenced in the historical context of prior legislation (S.C. 1991, c. 41), which provides the foundational legal framework for such orders.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant specific privileges and immunities to the European Space Agency (ESA)** and its associated personnel — including representatives of member states and officials — under the terms of a bilateral cooperation agreement between Canada and ESA. These privileges and immunities are granted **not for personal benefit**, but to ensure the **independence, effectiveness, and operational integrity** of the Organization and its representatives in carrying out their duties.

This Order replaces the previous *European Space Agency Privileges Order* (SOR/82-464), which is hereby **repealed**.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes the following core definitions:

- **Agreement**: Refers to the *Cooperation Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the European Space Agency*, signed on **February 12, 2019, in Paris**. This agreement forms the basis for the privileges and immunities granted under this Order.
  
- **Convention**: Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*. This international treaty serves as the model for the privileges and immunities granted to the ESA.

- **Organization**: Refers to the **European Space Agency (ESA)**, an intergovernmental organization composed of 22 member states.

---

### **4. Legal Capacity of the Organization**

The Order explicitly recognizes that the **European Space Agency has the legal capacity of a body corporate**. This means that ESA is treated as a legal entity capable of entering into contracts, owning property, and being held liable in legal proceedings — a critical recognition that enables it to operate independently and engage in formal diplomatic and scientific cooperation with Canada.

### **5. Privileges and Immunities Granted**

The Order grants distinct privileges and immunities to different categories of persons associated with the ESA, each grounded in specific provisions of the Cooperation Agreement and the United Nations Convention.

#### **A. Privileges and Immunities of the ESA (Organization)**

- **Basis**: This is granted **to the extent specified in paragraph 2 of Article X of the Cooperation Agreement**.
- **Purpose**: These privileges and immunities are intended to ensure the **independence and operational effectiveness** of the ESA in carrying out its scientific, technical, and cooperative missions with Canada and other nations.

> *Examples of such privileges may include immunity from jurisdiction, protection of property, and freedom from interference in official functions.*

#### **B. Privileges and Immunities of Member State Representatives**

- **Scope**: Representatives of the **Member States of the ESA** are granted privileges and immunities under **Article IV of the UN Convention**.
- **Basis**: This is granted **to the extent specified in paragraph 5 of Article X of the Cooperation Agreement**.
- **Purpose**: These privileges are granted **to safeguard the independent exercise of their functions** in connection with the ESA, not for personal gain or benefit.
- **Key Principle**: The privileges are **not personal**; they are instrumental to enabling representatives to perform their official duties without fear of political or legal interference.

> *This ensures that national delegates can act freely and impartially in international scientific and technical discussions.*

---

#### **C. Privileges and Immunities of ESA Officials**

- **Scope**: Officials of the ESA who are referred to in **paragraph 3 of Article X of the Agreement** are granted privileges and immunities under **Article V of the UN Convention**.

- **Purpose**: The privileges are granted **in the interest of the Organization**, not for personal benefit.

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day the Cooperation Agreement between Canada and the European Space Agency enters into force**.

- The Cooperation Agreement was signed on **February 12, 2019**.
- The Order officially came into force on **June 13, 2019**, as noted in the note at the end of the document.

This timing ensures that the legal framework for privileges and immunities is in place *before* any substantive cooperation or joint activities begin.

### **7. Repeal of Prior Order**

The previous *European Space Agency Privileges Order* (SOR/82-464) is **fully repealed** by this Order. This reflects a modernization of Canada’s legal framework to align with the new bilateral agreement and updated international standards.

### **8. Legal and Diplomatic Significance**

This Order is a key component of Canada’s international engagement with the European Space Agency. It:

- Formalizes Canada’s recognition of ESA as a legitimate international organization with corporate status.
- Provides a clear, legally binding framework for the operation of Canadian-ESA cooperation in space science, satellite technology, and research.
- Ensures that Canadian authorities and officials can engage with ESA without fear of legal or procedural obstacles that might undermine scientific collaboration.

### **Conclusion**

The *European Space Agency Privileges and Immunities Order* is a targeted, legally sound, and diplomatically significant regulation that enables Canada to operate effectively and independently with the European Space Agency. By granting specific privileges and immunities to the ESA, its representatives, and its officials — all grounded in international law and the bilateral Cooperation Agreement — the Order supports the free flow of scientific information, protects the integrity of official functions, and fosters long-term collaboration in the field of space exploration and innovation.

This Order reflects Canada’s ongoing commitment to international cooperation in science and technology, and underscores the importance of legal clarity and mutual respect in cross-border scientific partnerships.
