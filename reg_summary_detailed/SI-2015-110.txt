In general, when a statutory instrument is marked as "repealed," it means that the legislation or rule it established is no longer in force. The repeal is typically enacted by a subsequent piece of legislation or order, often to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated rules.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

- The full title of the statutory instrument (e.g., *The [Name of Regulation] 2018*)
- The sector or area it governed (e.g., environmental protection, employment standards, transport, health)
- The key provisions or objectives of the original regulation
- The reason for its repeal (e.g., superseded by a new law, redundancy, or policy change)

Since only the reference "[Repealed, SI/2018-77]" is provided, and no further details are available, the most accurate response is:
