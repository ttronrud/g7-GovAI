The regulation you have referenced — "[Repealed, SI/2008-91]" — appears to be a reference to a statutory instrument (SI) that has been formally repealed by a subsequent legislative action. However, based on the information provided, there is no specific regulation named or described in your query. The repeated mention of "[Repealed, SI/2008-91]" indicates that the original regulation was a Statutory Instrument issued in 2008, number 91, and has since been repealed.

To provide a detailed summary, we would need the actual title or content of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2008-91. As of now, there is no publicly available, widely recognized regulation with that exact designation that is known to have been repealed under that SI number in a manner that allows for a detailed summary of its provisions.

However, here is a general explanation of what such a reference implies:

**Summary of "[Repealed, SI/2008-91]"**

1. **Status of the Regulation**:  
   The regulation referenced is no longer in force. It was formally repealed by a later statutory instrument, specifically SI/2008-91. This means that the original rules, directives, or provisions contained in the regulation have been legally removed and are no longer applicable.

2. **Statutory Instrument (SI) Numbering**:  
   SI/2008-91 refers to the 91st Statutory Instrument enacted in the United Kingdom in 2008. Statutory Instruments are secondary legislation used to implement primary Acts of Parliament. The repeal of a regulation by another SI typically occurs when a new law renders the previous one obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent.

3. **Reason for Repeal**:  
   Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
   - The enactment of a more comprehensive or updated law.
   - Legislative simplification or streamlining of rules.
   - Inconsistencies or ambiguities in the original regulation.
   - The regulation being superseded by a more effective or modern policy framework.

4. **Impact of Repeal**:  
   Any legal, administrative, or operational obligations previously governed by the repealed regulation are now nullified. Authorities or organizations that previously relied on it must transition to the new legislation or policy that replaced it.

5. **Source and Accessibility**:  
   The full text of SI/2008-91 and the regulation it repealed can be found in the UK’s official legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk). However, without the specific title of the repealed regulation, a detailed summary of its content — such as the scope, key provisions, enforcement mechanisms, or affected parties — cannot be provided.

6. **Example (Hypothetical)**:  
   *If* SI/2008-91 had repealed a regulation on "the licensing of small retail premises," the summary might include:
   - The regulation previously required all small retail shops to obtain a specific license.
   - It set conditions on opening hours, staffing, and environmental standards.
   - It was repealed because a broader retail licensing framework was introduced under a new Act in 2008, which simplified licensing and removed the need for such a specific rule.

**Conclusion**:  
The reference "[Repealed, SI/2008-91]" indicates that a regulation was formally revoked by a UK Statutory Instrument in 2008. However, without the name or content of the original regulation, a detailed summary of its provisions cannot be accurately provided. To obtain a precise and detailed summary, the full title of the repealed regulation (e.g., "The Small Retail Premises (Licensing) Regulations 2007") must be identified.

👉 **Recommendation**:  
To proceed, please provide the full title of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2008-91, or confirm if you are referring to a specific area of law (e.g., environmental, health, transport, etc.). This will allow for a detailed, accurate, and context-specific summary.
