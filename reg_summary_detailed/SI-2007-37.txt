**Detailed Summary of the Citizenship Fees Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, known as the *Citizenship Fees Remission Order*, was issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Treasury Board. It is enacted under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the government to remit certain fees when it is in the public interest to do so.

The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., waive) citizenship application fees** for specific individuals who meet defined criteria. These individuals are typically those who have long lived in Canada, held a mistaken belief that they were Canadian citizens, and whose applications for citizenship were in process or submitted after a key date—January 24, 2007.

### **Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to fees associated with:

- Applications for a **grant or resumption of citizenship**; or  
- A **right to be a citizen**, as defined under **subsection 31(1)** and **section 32** of the *Citizenship Regulations, 1993*.

This means the Order covers both new applications for citizenship and cases where a person seeks to resume citizenship after previously having it lost or renounced.

### **Eligibility Criteria (Conditions for Remission)**

To qualify for a fee remission under this Order, a person must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Granted or Under Consideration for Citizenship**  
   The individual must either:
   - Have already been granted citizenship under **subsection 5(4) of the Citizenship Act**, or  
   - Be currently under consideration for citizenship under the same provision.

   This ensures that the remission applies only to those who are genuinely seeking or have been awarded citizenship.

2. **Application in Process or Submitted After January 24, 2007**  
   The individual must have:
   - Had an application for citizenship (grant or resumption) **in process on January 24, 2007**, *or*  
   - Submitted such an application **on or after that date**.

   The date January 24, 2007, is significant as a threshold for eligibility. It likely reflects a point in time when the government began recognizing or revisiting certain historical cases involving mistaken identity or long-term residency.

3. **Reasonable but Mistaken Belief in Citizenship**  
   The applicant must have had a **reasonable but mistaken belief** that they were a Canadian citizen.  
   - This implies that the person did not knowingly lack citizenship and believed—based on credible evidence or circumstances—that they were a citizen.  
   - The belief must be "reasonable," meaning it was not delusional or based on misinformation without basis, but rather a genuine and logical assumption.

4. **Lived in Canada Most of Their Life**  
   The applicant must have lived in Canada for the **majority of their life**.  
   - This criterion emphasizes the importance of long-term residence and integration into Canadian society.  
   - It reflects the government’s interest in supporting individuals who have built lives in Canada despite a mistaken belief about their citizenship status.

5. **Currently Living in Canada**  
   The individual must be **currently residing in Canada**.  
   - This ensures that the remission is applied to individuals who are still part of the Canadian community and not abroad.

### **Exclusions (Who Does NOT Qualify)**

The following individuals are **excluded** from the remission:

1. **Permanent Residents of Canada**  
   A person who is a permanent resident under **subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)** is not eligible.  
   - This exclusion distinguishes between permanent residents and citizens.  
   - The Order is specifically for those seeking **citizenship**, not those already in the permanent resident category.

2. **Prohibited from Being Granted Citizenship**  
   Individuals who are barred from citizenship under:
   - **Section 20** of the Citizenship Act (e.g., due to criminal convictions or fraud), or  
   - **Section 22** of the Citizenship Act (e.g., due to involvement in terrorism or threats to national security)  
   are not eligible.

3. **Those Who Have Renounced Citizenship**  
   Individuals who have formally **renounced their citizenship** under:
   - The **Canadian Citizenship Act (as it existed from 1947 to 1977)**, or  
   - The **Citizenship Act (post-1977)**  
   are excluded.  
   - This rule prevents the remission from being used to reverse or restore citizenship in cases where the individual has formally given up their status.

### **Legal Basis and Policy Rationale**

- **Legal Authority**: The Order is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the federal government to waive fees when it is in the public interest.
- **Public Interest Justification**: The remission is intended to:
  - Recognize individuals who have lived in Canada for decades under a mistaken belief of citizenship.
  - Support reconciliation and inclusion of long-term residents who may have been marginalized due to administrative or legal gaps.
  - Promote fairness and equity in the citizenship process, especially for those who have not had access to proper documentation or information about their status.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Humanitarian and Equity Focus**: The Order reflects a policy of compassion and recognition of historical injustices or information gaps that may have led individuals to believe they were citizens.
- **Limited Scope**: The eligibility is narrow and strictly defined, ensuring that the remission is not broadly applied to all applicants.
- **No Automatic Fee Waiver**: The remission is conditional and requires verification of all five criteria. It does not apply to routine applications or those without a mistaken belief.
- **Historical Context**: The January 24, 2007 cutoff suggests the Order may have been designed to address a specific wave of applications or cases arising from earlier administrative errors or lack of clarity about citizenship status.

### **Conclusion**

The *Citizenship Fees Remission Order* provides a targeted and compassionate mechanism to waive application fees for individuals who have lived in Canada for most of their lives, held a reasonable but mistaken belief that they were Canadian citizens, and whose applications were submitted or were in progress after January 24, 2007. It excludes permanent residents, those barred by law from citizenship, and those who have formally renounced their citizenship. This regulation underscores the government’s commitment to fairness, inclusion, and recognizing the lived experiences of individuals who have contributed to Canadian society despite past misunderstandings about their legal status.
