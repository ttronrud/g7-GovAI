This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 400 of the Statutory Instrument OR 2007-115** (SOR/2007-115), which is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation:**
- The regulation is **no longer in force**.
- It was officially **repealed** on the date specified in SOR/2007-115, section 400.
- Repeal means that the legal provisions of the regulation are no longer applicable, effective, or enforceable.

**2. Source of Repeal:**

- Section 400 of that instrument specifically identifies the regulation being repealed.
- SORs (Statutory Instruments) are a method by which the federal government can amend or repeal existing regulations without requiring a full legislative act, typically used for administrative or procedural changes.

**3. Implications of Repeal:**
- Any legal obligations, duties, or requirements previously established by the regulation are now **invalid**.
- Entities (such as businesses, government bodies, or individuals) that were previously bound by the regulation are no longer subject to its provisions.
- The repeal may have been made to:
  - Improve clarity or efficiency in legislation,
  - Address outdated or obsolete rules,
  - Align with new policies or frameworks,
  - Consolidate or modernize regulatory frameworks.

**4. Contextual Note:**
- The repeated listing of the same repeal entry suggests that the regulation may have been referenced in multiple sections or contexts in a larger document or database, but the actual content of the regulation itself has been removed.
- There is **no substantive text** of the regulation provided — only its status as repealed.

**Conclusion:**
The regulation referenced in the text has been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2007-115, section 400**. As such, it is **no longer enforceable or applicable** under Canadian law. There is no current legal text or operational requirement derived from this regulation.
