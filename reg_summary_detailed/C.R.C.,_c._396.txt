**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Regulations** and may be cited as such. They form a key component of the framework governing pension and superannuation benefits for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, particularly under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* (the "Act").

---

### **2. Key Definitions and References**

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the pension system.
- **"a(f) Ultimate Table"**: A mortality table published in 1924 by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland. This table is used for actuarial calculations in determining pension benefits, especially annuity payments.
- **"Minister"**: Refers to the **Minister of National Defence**, who has authority over policy implementation and administrative decisions related to the regulations.
- **"Past Earnings Election"**: This provision has been **repealed** (SOR/2016-64, s.1), meaning it no longer applies.
- **"Pensionable Earnings Election"**: Applies specifically to individuals who were participants under subsection 4(2) of the *Reserve Force Pension Plan Regulations*. It refers to an election made under subsection 11(1) of those Regulations to count certain service periods as pensionable.

### **3. Definition of "Days of Canadian Forces Service"**

This section establishes how service days are counted, with distinctions between the **regular force** and **reserve force**:

#### **Regular Force**
- All days for which pay was authorized.
- Days of maternity or parental leave granted under the *Queen’s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces*.

#### **Reserve Force**
- Days for which pay was authorized, **except**:
  - For duties/training of **less than six hours**: counted as **1/2 day**.
- Days during periods of exemption or leave (as defined in paragraph 2(b) of the *Reserve Force Pension Plan Regulations*) are counted in **proportion** to the member’s service during the 364-day period prior to the leave.
- For periods **before April 1, 1999**, if records allow verification of duration but not exact pay days:
  - Counted as **1/4 day per day** of service.

#### **Class "A" Reserve Service**
- Any day of service during which a member served on **Class "A" Reserve Service** (as defined in Article 9.06 of the Queen’s Regulations) counts as **1 2/5 days** of Canadian Forces service.

> **Formula for Proportion of Leave Days**:
>  
> $$
> \text{Proportion} = \frac{\text{Days of service in the 364 days before the period}}{\text{Total days in the 364-day period the member was a member}}
> $$

> **Note**: Days of service are calculated **without applying section 11** (which may relate to special service rules or exceptions).

> **Rounding Rule**: Any fractional total number of days is **rounded up to the next whole day**.

### **4. Minimum Service Requirements for Pension Eligibility**

#### **General Threshold**
- A contributor is considered to have **not less than 25 years of Canadian Forces service** if they have completed **at least 9,131 days** of service.

#### **Special Thresholds for Officers (Effective 2007–2009)**
To account for changes in pension policy and service valuation, specific thresholds were established for officers:

| Period | Rank | Equivalent Years | Equivalent Days |
|-------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| March 1, 2007 – Dec 31, 2007 | Colonels and above | 28 years | 10,227 days |
| Jan 1, 2008 – Dec 31, 2008 | Colonels and above | 27 years | 9,861 days |
| Jan 1, 2009 – Dec 31, 2009 | Colonels and above | 26 years | 9,496 days |
| Same periods | Other officers | 26 years | 9,496 days |

> These thresholds were introduced to adjust for changes in service valuation and ensure fair treatment of long-serving officers.

Under specific conditions, a **reserve force member may be treated as a member of the regular force** and become a contributor to Part I of the Act (the main Canadian Forces pension scheme), effective **March 1, 2007**, or on other dates depending on circumstances.

4. Was a member of the Canadian Forces during the first month of that period and remained continuously (without more than 60-day interruptions) until March 1, 2007.

#### **Alternative Entry Dates**:
- If a member would have become a participant under subsection 4(2) of the *Reserve Force Pension Plan Regulations* due to a transfer value payment under subsection 22(2) of the Act.

#### **General Rule for Later Entry**:
- For any other case, entry occurs on the **first day of the month after a 60-month period ending after March 1, 2007**, provided:
  - At least 1,674 days of service during that period;
  - Continuous membership (no more than 60-day interruptions);
  - No prior pensionable service under Part I.

#### **Adjustments to Effective Dates**:
- If the member is required to contribute to PSPF or RCMP Pension Fund:

### **11. Early Contribution Option (Section 8.1(3)(b))**

A reserve force member may exercise an **early contribution option** to become a contributor under Part I of the Act, with the following limits:
