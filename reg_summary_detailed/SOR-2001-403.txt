**Detailed Summary of the Minority Investment (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Minority Investment (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 314; amended under S.C. 1991, c. 48) were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **section 396a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCA)**. These regulations establish rules governing when and under what conditions a cooperative credit association (CCA) may acquire or increase a substantial investment in a "designated entity," or give up control of such an entity while retaining a substantial investment.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect cooperative credit associations from excessive exposure to financial risk**—particularly through investments in entities that are subject to market or credit risk—by imposing **strict limits on the total value of such exposures relative to the association’s regulatory capital**.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCA), the foundational legislation governing cooperatives in Canada.

2. **Designated Entity**  
   A defined category of entities into which a CCA may be exposed. A designated entity includes:
   - Any entity listed in paragraphs 390(1)(a) to (h) of the CCA;
   - An entity whose business includes one or more of the activities listed in paragraph 390(2)(a) of the CCA and that engages in **financial intermediary activities** that expose it to **material market or credit risk** (e.g., factoring, financing, financial leasing);
   - An entity whose business includes an activity under paragraph 390(2)(b) of the CCA (specialized financing), **except** where the association is permitted under subparagraph 390(4)(c)(iii) to acquire or increase a substantial investment.

   > *Note:* This definition ensures that only entities with significant financial risk exposure are subject to these investment restrictions.

3. **Regulatory Capital**  
   Defined as in the *Regulatory Capital (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations*. This refers to the minimum capital requirement set for CCAs to ensure financial stability and resilience.

4. **Value**  
   Has two components:
   - For **shares, ownership interests, or loans**: The **book value** as reported on the association’s balance sheet under the accounting principles and specifications set out in subsection 292(4) of the CCA.
   - For **guarantees**: The **face value** of the guarantee.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Permitted Investments and Control Changes (Subject to Section 3)**

Under **section 3**, subject to the limitations in sections 5 and 6, a CCA may:
- **Acquire or increase a substantial investment** in a designated entity (under paragraph 390(4)(a)(ii), (b)(ii), or (c)(ii) of the CCA);  
- **Give up control** of a designated entity while **retaining a substantial investment** in it (under paragraph 390(10)(a) of the CCA).

> These actions are allowed *only if* they do not trigger the risk thresholds outlined below.

---

#### **2. Prohibition on Excessive Exposure (Section 3 – Limit on Total Value)**

An association **must not**:
- Acquire or increase a substantial investment in a designated entity under paragraph 2(a) of the CCA;  
- Give up control of a designated entity while retaining a substantial investment under paragraph 2(b) of the CCA,  

**if**, after the transaction, the **total value** of the following exceeds **50% of the association’s regulatory capital**:

| Exposure Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Shares & Ownership Interests** | All shares or ownership interests beneficially owned by the association and by entities it controls in designated entities where it has a substantial investment but **does not exercise control**. |
| **Loans** | All loans held by the association or entities it controls, made to designated entities where it has a substantial investment but **does not control**. <br> *Exclusion:* Loans to designated entities that are **not foreign institutions** and are **deemed controlled by a group of associations**. |
| **Guarantees** | All outstanding guarantees given by the association or entities it controls on behalf of designated entities where it has a substantial investment but **does not control**. |

> This rule applies to **all such exposures** that are not already excluded.

---

#### **3. Deemed Control by a Group of Associations**

A designated entity is **deemed to be controlled** by a group of associations if:
- The association in question and other associations **jointly beneficially own securities** in the entity in such proportions that, **if they were combined into a single association**, that combined entity would have **control** over the designated entity.

> This provision allows for collective risk management among cooperatives, recognizing that joint ownership may imply de facto control.

---

#### **4. Prohibition on Lending or Guaranteeing (Section 4)**

An association that has a substantial investment in a designated entity **over which it does not exercise control** must **not**:
- Make a loan to the entity;  
- Provide a guarantee on its behalf;  
- Allow entities controlled by it to make such loans or guarantees,  

**if** such actions would cause the total value of:
- Shares, ownership interests, loans, and guarantees  
(under the same categories as in section 3)  
to **exceed 50% of the association’s regulatory capital**.

> This rule prevents further risk accumulation through lending or guarantees, even if the association does not own a controlling interest.

---

#### **5. Exclusions from the Definition of "Substantial Investment"**

Certain investments are **not included** in the calculation of "substantial investment" for the purposes of these regulations:

- Investments made under **regulations made under paragraph 396(a)** of the CCA, **except these specific Regulations**;  
- Investments made by a **specialized financing entity** controlled by the association.

> This ensures that certain types of investments (e.g., those made under specific regulatory frameworks or by internal financing arms) are not counted toward the 50% threshold.

---

#### **6. Exclusions from Value Calculations**

When calculating the total value of exposures under section 3 or section 4, the following **are excluded**:
- Shares or ownership interests acquired under **sections 393 to 395** of the CCA (e.g., under specific acquisition or merger provisions);  
- Shares acquired by a **bank controlled by the association** under subsections 193(12) or (13) of the *Bank Act* (chapter B-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985).

> This prevents double-counting or overvaluation of certain types of investments, particularly those involving banking entities or internal restructuring.

---

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day that section 396 of the CCA comes into force**, as enacted by **section 314 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**.

> The regulations were first published in force on **October 24, 2001** (SI/2001-102).

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Mitigation** | Limits the exposure of CCAs to high-risk financial entities, reducing the potential for systemic or insolvency-related losses. |
| **Financial Stability** | Ensures that CCAs maintain adequate capital buffers to absorb losses from investments in designated entities. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires clear tracking of investments, loans, and guarantees, especially in non-controlling stakes. |
| **Group Cooperation** | Recognizes that multiple cooperatives may jointly control a target entity, allowing for shared risk management. |
| **Exclusion of Certain Transactions** | Protects specific investment types (e.g., internal financing, bank-controlled investments) from being counted in risk thresholds. |

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations set strict limits on how much a cooperative credit association can invest in or lend to other financial institutions (designated entities) that carry market or credit risk—especially when the association does not have control over them.

- **No investment or guarantee** can be made if it would push the total value of the association’s exposure (in shares, loans, or guarantees) in such entities **above 50% of its regulatory capital**.
- Even if the association doesn’t own a controlling interest, it cannot lend or guarantee to such entities if that would breach the 50% limit.
- The rules are designed to protect the financial health of cooperatives by preventing overexposure to risky investments.
- Certain types of investments (e.g., those made under specific regulatory provisions or by internal financing arms) are excluded from the calculation to avoid overreach.

### **Conclusion**

The *Minority Investment (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* are a critical component of the regulatory framework designed to **ensure financial stability and prudent risk management** in the cooperative credit sector. By limiting exposure to non-controlling investments in high-risk entities and enforcing strict thresholds based on regulatory capital, the regulations help safeguard both individual cooperatives and the broader cooperative financial system.

These rules reflect a balance between allowing cooperatives to engage in strategic investments and protecting them from undue
