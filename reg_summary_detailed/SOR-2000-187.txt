- These serve as clear, concise summaries of the specific violation committed, helping ensure transparency and public understanding.

---

### **5. Classification of Violations: Minor, Serious, Very Serious**

- **Minor violation**: Less serious, low risk, minimal harm.
- **Serious violation**: Significant risk, potential harm to health/environment or economic impact.
- **Very serious violation**: Severe consequences, including widespread harm or major financial loss.

> This classification determines the **penalty amount** and influences enforcement strategy.

### **6. Penalty Amounts by Violator Type and Violation Severity**

| Violation Type | Penalty Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Individual** (not in business, not for financial gain) | |
| – Minor violation | $500 |
| – Serious violation | $800 |
| – Very serious violation | $1,300 |
| **Individual** (in business or for financial benefit) | |
| – Minor violation | $1,300 |
| – Serious violation | $6,000 |
| – Very serious violation | $10,000 |

> ⚠️ **Note**: For serious and very serious violations involving business or financial gain, the penalty is **adjusted based on a "total gravity value"** (see Section 6).

---

### **7. Total Gravity Value Calculation (for Business/Financial Gain Violations)**

The penalty for serious or very serious violations involving business or financial benefit is **adjusted** based on a **total gravity value** derived from three criteria:

#### **Criteria and Associated Gravity Values (from Schedule 3):**

| Criterion | Source in Schedule 3 | Description |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| **(a) History of Prior Violations** | Part 1 of Schedule 3 | Includes prior convictions or violations. Higher history = higher gravity value. |
| **(b) Degree of Intention or Negligence** | Part 2 of Schedule 3 | Determines whether the violation was intentional, reckless, or negligent. |
| **(c) Harm Caused or Potentially Caused** | Part 3 of Schedule 3 | Assesses actual or potential harm to human/animal/plant health, environment, or persons. |

#### **Process:**
1. For each criterion, assign a **gravity value** from Column 1 of the corresponding part of Schedule 3.
2. Sum the values from all three criteria.
3. The **total gravity value** determines the final penalty amount (up to a maximum of $10,000).

> This ensures penalties are **proportional to the severity and context** of the violation.

### **8. Penalty Reduction for Compliance Agreements**

- If a person enters into a **compliance agreement** with the Minister:
  - The penalty amount is **reduced by $1 for every $2 spent** by the person.
  - **Maximum reduction**: Penalty can be reduced to **zero**.
- The agreement must include **specific corrective actions** to ensure future compliance.
- The request to enter into such an agreement must be made **within 30 days** of the notice being served.
