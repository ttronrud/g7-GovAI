### **Detailed Summary of the NAFTA Prescribed Class of Goods Regulations**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
The regulation is issued under the following legal provisions:

- **Subsection 35.02(4) of the Customs Act**  
  This subsection authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue) to prescribe a class of goods for specific customs purposes—specifically, to determine which goods are subject to certain tariff or regulatory treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

- **Paragraph 164(1)(i) of the Customs Act**  
  This provision provides the statutory basis for the Minister of National Revenue to recommend the creation of such prescribed classes of goods, particularly in the context of implementing trade agreements like NAFTA.

These provisions together empower the Canadian government to define a specific class of goods that will be treated under special customs rules—particularly those related to tariff classification, duty treatment, or regulatory compliance—under the framework of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Prescribe a class of goods** that are subject to specific treatment under subsection 35.02(4) of the Customs Act.
- Ensure that goods falling within this class are properly identified and treated in accordance with the **tariff and trade obligations under NAFTA**.
- Facilitate the smooth implementation of NAFTA by providing clarity on which goods are included in a designated category for customs valuation, classification, or duty treatment.

---

#### **3. Scope and Application**
- The regulation applies specifically to **goods for which regulations made under paragraph 19(1)(a) of the Customs Tariff** are in force.
- These goods are **prescribed as a class** for the purposes of subsection 35.02(4) of the Customs Act.
- This means that once a good is included in this class, it will be subject to the specific customs rules defined in subsection 35.02(4), such as:
  - Duty exemptions or reductions
  - Special classification rules
  - Simplified procedures for importation or exportation
  - Alignment with NAFTA tariff schedules or origin rules

> Note: Paragraph 19(1)(a) of the Customs Tariff typically refers to regulations that establish tariff classifications or duties for goods, often based on the Harmonized System (HS) codes.

---

#### **4. Effective Date**
The regulations come into force on the date that **Section 83 of the *Act to Implement the North American Free Trade Agreement*** (S.C. 1993, c. 44) becomes effective.

- This section of the NAFTA implementation act is critical because it establishes the **timing and conditions** under which the new trade rules (including those related to tariff treatment and origin) take effect.
- The effective date is thus **not arbitrary**—it is tied directly to the official implementation of NAFTA in Canada, ensuring that customs rules align with the broader agreement's timeline.

---

#### **5. Citation and Reference**
The regulation is officially titled:

> **The NAFTA Prescribed Class of Goods Regulations**

It may be cited as such and is referenced in the following legal instruments:

- **S.C. 1993, c. 44, s. 83** – The implementing provision of the NAFTA Act that triggers the effective date of these regulations.
- **S.C. 1992, c. 28, s. 30(1)** – Likely a reference to an earlier enabling provision or transitional rule related to the implementation of trade agreements.
- **R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)** – Refers to the *Regulations of the Customs Act*, specifically the second supplementary volume, which contains the current statutory framework for customs rules and regulations.

#### **6. Key Implications**
- **Clarity in Customs Processing**: Businesses importing or exporting goods within this class benefit from clearer rules, reducing uncertainty and administrative burden.
- **Compliance with NAFTA Obligations**: The regulation ensures Canada meets its international commitments under NAFTA by properly classifying and treating goods that are subject to origin rules or preferential tariff treatment.
- **Potential for Duty Exemptions or Lower Rates**: Goods in this class may be eligible for reduced or zero duties under NAFTA, depending on their origin and classification.
- **Alignment with HS Codes and Trade Classification**: The prescribed class is likely based on specific Harmonized System (HS) codes or product categories that are central to NAFTA’s trade flows.

---

#### **7. Interpretation and Enforcement**
- The **Minister of National Revenue** is responsible for recommending the class of goods.
- The **Governor General in Council** (acting on that recommendation) formally adopts the regulation.
- Enforcement is carried out by the **Customs and Border Services** (or equivalent Canadian authority), which applies the rules during import/export inspections, valuation, and duty assessments.

---

### **Conclusion**
These regulations serve as a **key administrative tool** in implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement within Canada’s customs framework. By formally prescribing a class of goods under subsection 35.02(4) of the Customs Act, the government ensures that specific products are treated consistently and in accordance with NAFTA’s provisions—particularly those related to tariff treatment, origin, and trade facilitation.

The regulation is not standalone but is **integrated into the broader legislative framework** of the Customs Act and the NAFTA implementation legislation, ensuring legal coherence, predictability, and alignment with international trade obligations.

> **Note**: While the original text does not specify the actual list of goods in the class, the regulation's structure implies that the "annexed" regulations (not included in the excerpt) would contain the detailed list of goods, HS codes, or product descriptions that fall within the prescribed class.
