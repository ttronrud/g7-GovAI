**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Press Pension Plan Solvency Deficiency Funding Regulations, 2010***  
*(S.C. 2010, c. 12, s. 1820; R.S., c. 32 (2nd Supp.))*

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, made under **section 39a of the Pension Benefits Standards Act (PBSA), 1985**, establish a framework for addressing the **solvency deficiency** of the **Canadian Press pension plan**—specifically, the *Canadian Press Pension Plan for Employees Represented by the Canadian Media Guild* (Plan No. 56945) and the *Pension Plan of the Canadian Press* (Plan No. 56457). The goal is to ensure the plan meets minimum solvency standards by requiring specific funding mechanisms, transparency, and oversight, while protecting pension benefits and ensuring compliance with federal pension regulations.

The regulations came into force on **November 1, 2010**, with certain provisions (such as subsection 15(2)) taking effect later, on **April 1, 2011**, following the enactment of the *Jobs and Economic Growth Act, 2010*.

The regulations **cease to be in force on January 1, 2024**, unless earlier terminated by the employer.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

### 1. **Applicable Plan**
- The Canadian Press pension plans registered under the PBSA as:
  - **No. 56945**: Canadian Press Pension Plan for Employees Represented by the Canadian Media Guild
  - **No. 56457**: Pension Plan of the Canadian Press

### 2. **Key Definitions**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Beneficiary** | A member or former member entitled to pension benefits under the plan, *excluding* those who have: (a) transferred all pension credits; (b) used credits to buy a life annuity; (c) had benefits transferred to another plan; or (d) had their benefits purchased by the administrator via an immediate or deferred life annuity. |
| **Aggregate Amount of Deferred Special Payments** | The total amount owed to the pension fund under two sources: (1) section 8 of these regulations, and (2) deferred special payments under subsection 6(1) of the *Solvency Funding Relief Regulations*, including interest. |
| **Subsidized Portion of Early Retirement Benefits** | The amount by which an early retirement benefit is increased due to employer consent—i.e., the "extra" benefit paid above what would have been payable without consent. This is capped to prevent solvency ratio degradation. |
| **Solvency Ratio** | A key financial metric indicating whether the plan’s assets exceed its liabilities. A ratio of 1.0 is the prescribed minimum. |

> All other terms are defined as in the *Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985* or *Solvency Funding Relief Regulations*, unless otherwise specified.

> In case of conflict, **these regulations prevail** over those older statutes.

1. **Employer provides written confirmation to the Superintendent** that:
   - The information in **section 3** has been provided to beneficiaries.
   - Less than **one-third of members** and less than **one-third of non-member beneficiaries** have objected to the plan being subject to these regulations.

4. **Employer provides written confirmation** that it has received an **initial investment of $2.25 million**.

> If any of these conditions are not met, the employer must **immediately notify the Superintendent in writing** and **pay the aggregate amount of deferred special payments** to the pension fund. In that case, the regulations **no longer apply**.

## **Mandatory Information to Be Provided to Beneficiaries**

The administrator must provide beneficiaries with the following information:

1. **Solvency Ratio** as of:
   - December 31, 2008
   - December 31, 2009
   - Estimated ratio as of June 30, 2010

2. **Solvency Deficit (liabilities minus assets)** as of:
   - December 31, 2008
   - December 31, 2009
   - Estimated deficit as of June 30, 2010

3. **Impact of Plan Termination**: A description of how beneficiaries’ benefits would be reduced if the plan were fully terminated and wound up using the June 30, 2010 estimated solvency ratio.

4. **Statement of Benefit Reduction Risk**: A clear statement that applying these regulations may result in **reduced benefits** compared to those available as of June 30, 2010.

5. **Cap on Subsidized Early Retirement Benefits**:  
   - The subsidized portion of early retirement benefits may only be paid if such payments **do not reduce the solvency ratio as of December 31, 2008 by more than 10%**.

> If the costs of providing this information are paid from the plan, the **employer must reimburse the plan within 30 days** of the regulations coming into force.

---

## **Solvency Deficiency Determination**

The **solvency deficiency as of December 31, 2009** is defined as:

> The amount by which **solvency liabilities** exceed:
> - Solvency assets (excluding deferred amounts under section 7 of these regulations)
> - The **present value** of going concern special payments payable from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2023

This is the baseline for funding obligations.

---

## **Funding Mechanisms**

### **On December 1, 2010 (One-Time Payment)**
The plan must be funded with a single payment equal to the sum of:

1. **One-sixth of one equal annual solvency special payment** that would fully liquidate the December 31, 2009 solvency deficiency over **14 years**.

2. **One-sixth of the going concern special payments** (adjusted to exclude those deferred under section 7 of the Solvency Deficiency Regulations).

3. **Normal cost contribution** of the plan.

> This initial payment ensures immediate stabilization of the plan’s financial position.

---

### **From January 1, 2011 Onward (Monthly Payments)**
The plan is funded through **monthly payments**, equal to the aggregate of:

1. **One-twelfth of one equal annual solvency special payment** (same 14-year amortization as above).

2. **One-twelfth of the going concern special payments** (adjusted to exclude deferred amounts).

3. **Normal cost contribution**.

> This creates a steady, predictable funding stream to maintain solvency.

---

## **Annual Funding Adjustments (2011 and Beyond)**

### **For the 2011 Plan Year**
The plan is funded under **section 9 of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985**, with modifications:

- **Unfunded Liability** = Going concern deficit (as of Dec 31, 2010) minus:
  - Present value of going concern special payments (from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec 31, 2023)
  - Present value of solvency special payments (from paragraph 5(3)(a))

- **Solvency Deficiency (Dec 31, 2010)** = Amount by which solvency liabilities exceed:
  - Solvency assets
  - Present value of going concern special payments (Jan 1, 2010 – Dec 31, 2023)
  - Present value of solvency special payments (paragraph 5(3)(a))

- **Solvency Special Payments** must be sufficient to **liquidate the deficiency over 13 years** (not 14) in equal annual installments.

> This reflects a gradual reduction in the required annual payments as the plan stabilizes.

---

### **For 2012 and Subsequent Years**
The funding framework is modified further:

- **Unfunded Liability (after Dec 31, 2010)** = Going concern deficit at valuation date minus:
  - Present value of going concern special payments payable *after* the valuation date
  - Present value of solvency special payments payable *after* the valuation date

- **Solvency Deficiency (at valuation date)** = Amount by which solvency liabilities exceed:
  - Adjusted solvency asset amount
  - Present value of going concern special payments payable *after* valuation date but **no later than Dec 31, 2023**
  - Present value of solvency special payments payable *after* valuation date

- **Annual Solvency Special Payment** (for the next plan year) is calculated using this formula:
