**Detailed Summary of the *Exceptions for Educational Institutions, Libraries, Archives and Museums Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 24, s. 18(1))**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Copyright Act* of Canada, establish specific exceptions that allow **libraries, archives, museums**, and **educational institutions** to make copies of copyrighted works for **educational, research, and preservation purposes**—without requiring the permission of the copyright owner. The regulations are designed to balance the rights of creators and owners of intellectual property with the legitimate needs of institutions that serve the public interest through access to information.

The regulations come into force on **September 1, 1999**, and are governed by specific provisions of the *Copyright Act*, particularly **sections 30.2, 30.21, and 30.3**, which provide fair dealing and exceptions for copying in certain circumstances.

## **Key Definitions and Interpretations**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Copyright Act* as the primary legislative framework under which these rules operate.

2. **"Copy of a work"**  
   Includes a copy of **all or any substantial part** of a work—this broad definition ensures that even partial reproductions (e.g., excerpts, pages) are covered.

3. **"Newspaper or periodical"**  
   For the purposes of **section 30.2(6)** of the Act, a "newspaper or periodical" means:
   - A newspaper or general-interest periodical (non-scholarly, non-scientific, non-technical),
   - **Excluding** scholarly, scientific, or technical periodicals,
   - That was published **more than one year before** the copy is made.

   This limitation ensures that older publications are eligible for copying under fair dealing, while newer, current scholarly works are not covered under this exception.

## **Application of the Exceptions**

### **1. Section 30.2(1): Copying for Libraries, Archives, and Museums**
- Allows libraries, archives, and museums to reproduce works for **research, private study, or preservation**.
- **Section 4 of the Copyright Act applies only to reproduction**, meaning that the exception covers copying (reproduction), not distribution or public performance.

> This means institutions can make copies for internal use or for patrons, but cannot distribute them broadly without authorization.

---

### **2. Mandatory Recording of Copy Information (Section 4)**

When a library, archive, or museum makes a copy under section 30.2 of the Act, it must **record and retain** the following information:

| Information Required |
|---------------------|
| Name of the library, archive, or museum making the copy |
| If the request is made on behalf of a patron, the name of the requesting library/organization |
| Date of the request |
| Identifying details of the work (e.g., title, ISBN, ISSN) |
| Source of the work (newspaper, periodical, or scholarly journal) including: |
| - Title of the work |
| - International Standard Book Number (ISBN) |
| - International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) |
| - Name of the newspaper or periodical (if applicable) |
| - Date, volume, or issue number (for periodicals) |
| - Number of copied pages |

> This information must be recorded in a **form that is intelligible and reproducible in writing** within a reasonable time (e.g., on a request form or digital record).

> **Exemption from recording**:  
> If the copy is made **after December 31, 2003**, the institution is **not required** to record the information. This reflects a policy shift toward simplifying compliance for post-2003 copying activities.

---

### **3. Retention and Accessibility of Records**

- The institution must **retain the records** for **at least three years** from the date of the copy.
- The records must be kept in a format that allows them to be **reproduced in readable form** within a reasonable time (e.g., paper copy, digital file).
- The records must be made available **once per year** to one of the following, upon written request:
  - The **copyright owner** of the work;
  - The **representative** of the copyright owner;
  - A **collective society** authorized by the copyright owner to grant licenses.

> The institution must respond to such requests within **28 days**, or agree to a longer period mutually acceptable to both parties.

> The request must be:
> - In **writing**
> - Include the **author’s name** and **title of the work**
> - Be **signed by the requester**
> - State clearly that the request is made under **paragraph (5)(a), (b), or (c)**

> *(Note: Paragraph (5) was repealed by SOR/2008-169, s. 5 — this section no longer applies.)*

### **4. Use Restrictions and Notification to Patrons**

#### **For Archives:**
- If a person **registers as a patron** of an archive:
  - The archive must inform them in writing at registration that:
    - Any copy made under section 30.21 is for **research or private study only**.
    - Any use beyond research or private study requires **authorization from the copyright owner**.

- If a person **requests a copy without being a registered patron**:
  - The archive must inform them at the time of request that:
    - The copy is for **research or private study only**.
    - Any other use may require **copyright owner authorization**.

#### **For Libraries, Archives, and Museums Making Copies:**
- The institution must **notify the person requesting the copy** (via text on the copy or a stamp in printed format, or via other appropriate means in digital formats) that:
  - The copy is for **research or private study only**.
  - Any use for other purposes (e.g., teaching, public distribution) requires **authorization from the copyright owner**.

> This ensures transparency and prevents misuse of copies.

### **5. Notice to Users of Photocopiers in Educational Institutions**

For institutions that fall under **sections 30.3(2), (3), or (4)** of the *Copyright Act* (typically educational institutions), the regulations require:

- A **clear warning notice** to be affixed to or near **every photocopier** in the institution.
- The notice must be:
  - **Readily visible and legible**
  - Placed in a location accessible to users

> **Required content of the notice**:
> ```
> WARNING!
> Works protected by copyright may be copied on this photocopier only if authorized by:
> - the Copyright Act for the purpose of fair dealing or under specific exceptions set out in that Act;
> - the copyright owner; or
> - a licence agreement between this institution and a collective society or a tariff, if any.
> 
> For details of authorized copying, please consult the licence agreement or the applicable tariff, if any, and other relevant information available from a staff member.
> 
> The Copyright Act provides for civil and criminal remedies for infringement of copyright.
> ```

> This notice serves as a **public awareness tool**, informing users about the legal boundaries of copying and the need for authorization.

## **Key Provisions and Their Purpose**

| Provision | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Recording and retention** | Ensures accountability and transparency in copying activities, allowing copyright owners to track use. |
| **Use restrictions** | Prevents unauthorized commercial or public use of copies made for research. |
| **Notice to patrons and users** | Protects copyright owners by clearly stating the limited purpose of copies. |
| **Photocopier warnings** | Educates the public about fair dealing limits and legal consequences of infringement. |
| **Exemption post-2003** | Reduces administrative burden for institutions copying after a certain date. |

---

## **Legal and Policy Implications**

- These regulations reflect a **fair dealing exception** for non-commercial, educational, and archival use.
- They **do not grant blanket permission** to copy any work—specific conditions (e.g., time limits, type of work, purpose) apply.
- The rules emphasize **accountability**, **transparency**, and **respect for copyright**.
- Institutions are required to **maintain records**, which can serve as evidence in disputes or licensing negotiations.

---

## **Repealed Provisions**

- The provision allowing requests to be made under paragraphs (5)(a), (b), or (c) was **repealed by SOR/2008-169, section 5**.  
  → This means that the specific request format and statement are no longer required.

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Exceptions for Educational Institutions, Libraries, Archives and Museums Regulations* provide a **clear, structured, and legally sound framework** for institutions to copy copyrighted materials for research, education, and preservation purposes. By requiring **detailed record-keeping**, **use restrictions**, and **public awareness notices**, the regulations ensure that these exceptions are exercised responsibly and in compliance with Canadian copyright law.

They represent a **balance between access to knowledge** and the **protection of creators’ rights**, supporting the mission of libraries, archives, and museums to serve the public while respecting intellectual property.
