## **General Principles**

1. **Retention Period for Personal Property**  
   - All **personal property** (non-vehicle items) that is **lost or abandoned** at an airport or remains unclaimed must be:
     - Retained at the airport in the custody of the **Airport Manager**.
     - Held for **at least 30 days**.
   - During this period, the **owner may reclaim** the property.
   - After 30 days, if not reclaimed, the **Regional Administrator** may dispose of it **at their discretion** using one or more of the following methods:
     - Return to the **finder** (if the finder is not an employee of the Department);
     - **Private sale** or **public auction**;
     - **Gift or donation** to a **charitable institution in Canada**;
     - **Destruction**, if no other method is appropriate.

2. **Retention Period for Abandoned Vehicles**  
   - Abandoned vehicles (not derelict) must be retained by the **Airport Manager** for **at least 90 days**.
   - The Airport Manager must send a **registered mail notice** to the owner’s **latest known address or place of business**.
   - If the vehicle is **not claimed within 30 days of the notice**, the Regional Administrator may dispose of it by:
     - Private sale;
     - Public auction;
     - Destruction.

3. **Retention Period for Derelict Vehicles**  
   - Derelict vehicles (value < $200, unclaimed for ≥14 days) are retained for **at least 30 days**.
   - The Airport Manager must send a **registered mail notice** to the owner’s latest known address or place of business.
   - If the vehicle is **not claimed within 20 days of the notice**, the Regional Administrator may dispose of it by:
     - Private sale;
     - Public auction;
     - Destruction.

4. **Disposal After Notice**  
   - If a notice has been issued under Section 4(2) or 5(2) (for abandoned or derelict vehicles), and the vehicle remains unclaimed within the specified time (30 or 20 days respectively), the Regional Administrator may proceed with disposal **using the method(s) specified in the notice**.

5. **Proceeds from Sales**  
   - All proceeds from any sale (under Sections 3, 4, or 5) — whether private or public — must be paid to the **Receiver General of Canada**.

## **Key Provisions and Their Implications**

| Provision | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **30-day retention for personal property** | Ensures a fair opportunity for owners to reclaim lost or abandoned items. Prevents immediate disposal. |
| **90-day retention for abandoned vehicles** | Reflects greater scrutiny for vehicles, which may be more complex to trace or claim. |
| **30-day notice period for abandoned vehicles** | Gives owners a clear window to respond before disposal. |
| **20-day notice period for derelict vehicles** | Shorter due to low market value; reflects the practicality of disposing of low-value items. |
| **Notice by registered mail** | Ensures legal documentation and proof of delivery, protecting both the airport authority and the owner. |
| **Disposal options** | Offers flexibility in handling unclaimed items while promoting responsible stewardship (e.g., charity donations). |
| **Destruction as a fallback** | Ensures that items with no identifiable owner or value are properly disposed of in a safe, accountable manner. |
| **Funds go to Receiver General** | All revenue from sales is collected by the federal government, ensuring public accountability and funding for government operations. |

## **Purpose and Objectives**

1. **Public Safety and Order**  
   - Prevents clutter, hazards, and obstruction at airports due to unclaimed vehicles or property.

2. **Fairness to Owners**  
   - Provides a clear, transparent process for owners to reclaim their property within a defined time frame.

3. **Efficient Resource Management**  
   - Allows airports to manage space and costs associated with unclaimed items.

4. **Environmental and Social Responsibility**  
   - Encourages donation to charities and safe disposal of low-value or unusable items.

5. **Legal Accountability**  
   - Establishes clear roles (Airport Manager, Regional Administrator) and procedural safeguards (registered mail notices, disposal discretion).

## **Important Notes and Exceptions**

- **No automatic disposal** occurs — owners have a right to reclaim their property.
- **Only the Regional Administrator** has authority to dispose of property after the retention period.
- **Private sale or public auction** are common methods, allowing market-driven recovery.
- **Charitable donations** promote social good and align with public service values.
- **Destruction** is only permitted when no other method is suitable — e.g., items that are hazardous, unidentifiable, or of no use.
