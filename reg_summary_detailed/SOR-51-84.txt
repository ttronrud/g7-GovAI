Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, presented in clear, accessible language while preserving the legal precision and intent of the original text.

### **Regulation Summary: Designation of the Canadian Army Special Force and Application of the Defence Services Pension Act**

**Effective Date:** August 7, 1950  
**Issuing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**Basis:** Recommendation of the Minister of National Defence, pursuant to **Section 6 of the Canadian Forces Act, 1950**

---

### **1. Designation of the Canadian Army Special Force**

- The **Canadian Army Special Force**, established by **Order in Council P.C. 3860 dated August 7, 1950**, is officially designated as a **"special force"** under **Section 6 of the Canadian Forces Act, 1950**.
- This designation grants the Special Force a distinct status within the Canadian Armed Forces, allowing it to be recognized as a special operations or reserve-type unit under the legal framework of the Act.

> 🔍 *Purpose:* To formally recognize the Special Force’s unique role and operational nature within the broader structure of the Canadian military.

---

### **2. Exemption from the Defence Services Pension Act (DSPA)**

- **General Rule:**  
  No officer or member of the Canadian Army Special Force shall be subject to the **Defence Services Pension Act (DSPA)** *unless* they were **already a member of one of the following forces immediately before joining the Special Force**:
  - Canadian Army Active Force  
  - Royal Canadian Navy (Regular)  
  - Royal Canadian Air Force (Regular)

> ⚠️ *Implication:* Individuals who joined the Special Force without prior service in any of these regular forces are **not entitled to pension benefits under the DSPA**.

---

### **3. Exception: Elective Enrollment in the DSPA**

- **Exception for Transfers or Reattestations:**  
  An officer or member of the Canadian Army Special Force who:
  - Is **transferred** to another regular force (Canadian Army Active Force, Royal Canadian Navy, or Royal Canadian Air Force), or  
  - Is **reattested** for a new term of service **longer than 18 months**,  
  may **elect** within **one year** of the transfer or reattestation to have the **Defence Services Pension Act apply** to their service in the Special Force.

> ✅ *Key Points:*
> - The election must be made **within one year** of the transfer or reattestation.
> - Once elected, the service in the Special Force **counts as service in the forces** for pension purposes under the DSPA.
> - This provision provides flexibility for personnel who may later wish to claim pension benefits based on their Special Force service.

---

### **4. Retroactive Election for Pension Service Counting**

- **Post-Service Election:**  
  An officer or member of the Canadian Army Special Force may be **counted as having served in the forces** for the purposes of the DSPA **if**:
  - They **become a contributor** to the DSPA (i.e., start paying pension contributions), and  
  - They **elect to count** their service in the Special Force **on or before August 1, 1956**, or **within one year of becoming a contributor**, whichever is later.

> ✅ *Key Points:*
> - This allows individuals to retroactively include their Special Force service in their pension eligibility.
> - No election is required **if** the individual is already counting this service under **paragraph 3** (i.e., under the transfer/reattestation rule).
> - This rule effectively closes a gap in pension entitlement for those who joined the Special Force and later began contributing to the DSPA.

---

### **5. Contribution and Pension Calculation – Legal Equivalence**

- For the purposes of determining **pension amounts and contribution obligations** under the DSPA:
  - Any election made under this Order (whether under paragraph 3 or 4) shall be **deemed equivalent** to an election made under **subsection (1) of Section 48 of the Defence Services Pension Act**.
  - Section 48(1) deals with **prior non-contributory service** — meaning service that was not covered by contributions (e.g., service in a special force or reserve unit).

> ✅ *Significance:*  
> This ensures that the service in the Special Force is treated **as if it were contributory service** in the eyes of the pension system, even though it was initially outside the scope of the DSPA.  
> It allows the pension system to properly calculate benefits based on total service, including non-contributory periods.

### **Historical and Practical Context**

- This regulation was issued in **1950**, shortly after the formation of the Canadian Army Special Force, which was likely intended for **special operations, intelligence, or unconventional warfare** roles.
- The DSPA was designed to provide pension benefits to members of the Canadian Armed Forces, but initially excluded certain specialized or non-regular units.
- This Order **creates a pathway** for those in the Special Force to eventually access pension benefits, either through:
  - A transfer to a regular force,
  - A reattestation for long-term service, or
  - A later election when they begin contributing to the pension system.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **clear legal pathway** for members of the Canadian Army Special Force to have their service recognized for pension purposes under the Defence Services Pension Act. While initial service in the Special Force is **exempt** from the Act, it provides **flexible, time-bound opportunities** for individuals to opt in and have that service counted — ensuring both operational autonomy and long-term financial security for personnel.

It reflects a balance between:
- Maintaining the unique status of special forces,
- Ensuring fairness in pension entitlements, and
- Aligning with broader military and social welfare policies of the time.
