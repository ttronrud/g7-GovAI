**Detailed Summary of the Mattresses Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Mattresses Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, are a set of safety standards established by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. These regulations specifically address the **fire safety requirements for mattresses** sold in Canada. The primary objective is to reduce the risk of fire-related injuries and fatalities by setting strict combustion resistance standards for mattresses.

The regulations came into force on the day of registration and are designed to ensure that mattresses meet minimum safety benchmarks, particularly in terms of how they behave when exposed to a flame source.

### **Definition of "Mattress" (Key Scope and Exclusions)**

To determine which products are covered under these regulations, a precise definition of "mattress" is provided:

#### **What is included in the definition of a mattress?**
A mattress is defined as:
- An item **intended, promoted, or normally used for sleeping** on.
- It **contains resilient material** (such as foam, springs, or other cushioning materials).
- The resilient material is **enclosed within a ticking** (a fabric cover or outer layer).

#### **What is explicitly excluded from the definition (and thus not covered):**
1. **Mattress pads** – These are supplementary padding items, not standalone sleeping surfaces.
2. **Infant multi-use pads** – Designed for use in cribs or on the floor, not as primary sleeping surfaces.
3. **Parts of upholstered furniture** that may be used for sleeping but are not standalone mattresses (e.g., a sofa cushion used as a bed).
4. **Crib, cradle, or bassinet mattresses** – These are specifically governed by separate regulations due to infant safety concerns.
5. **One-of-a-kind prescription mattresses** – Custom-made mattresses prescribed for medical reasons are excluded due to their unique and non-commercial nature.

> **Note**: This definition ensures that only standard, commercially available, sleep-supporting mattresses are subject to the combustion resistance requirements.

### **Fire Safety Requirement: Combustion Resistance Test (CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.7-2013)**

The core safety requirement under these regulations is based on the **Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB) standard CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.7-2013**, titled *Textile test methods — Combustion resistance of mattresses — Cigarette test*, published in April 2013.

#### **Test Procedure Overview**
The cigarette test simulates a real-world scenario where a cigarette is placed on the surface of a mattress and ignited. The test evaluates how the mattress responds to the flame.

#### **Acceptable Performance Criteria**
A mattress **must not exhibit** the following conditions in **more than one test specimen** (i.e., out of a batch of tested units):

1. **Melting or charring** that extends **more than 50 mm in any horizontal direction** from the nearest point where the cigarette was placed.
   - This means the surface of the mattress should not melt or burn significantly beyond a 50 mm radius from the ignition point.

2. **Continuing combustion** in the mattress assembly **for 10 minutes or more** after the cigarette has been extinguished.
   - This prevents the fire from spreading and smoldering uncontrollably after the initial flame source is removed.

> **Critical Point**: If **more than one specimen** in a batch fails to meet either of these criteria, the entire batch of mattresses is considered non-compliant and cannot be legally sold in Canada.

---

### **Regulatory Enforcement and Compliance**
- Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of mattresses must ensure that their products meet these fire safety standards.
- Compliance is required during product design, production, and marketing.
- The regulations are enforced under the authority of the **Minister of Health** and the **Consumer Product Safety Act**, with the potential for product recalls or market withdrawals if non-compliant items are found.

---

### **Repeal Clause**
The regulations include a **repeal clause**, which indicates that any previous or conflicting regulations on mattress fire safety are being replaced or superseded by these new standards. This ensures consistency and clarity in the regulatory framework.

---

### **Effective Date**
The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*), meaning they are immediately enforceable upon official notification.

---

### **Purpose and Public Safety Impact**
- **Reduces fire risk**: By limiting the spread of flame and charring, the regulations help prevent fires from spreading rapidly, especially in homes where children or vulnerable individuals may be present.
- **Protects consumers**: Ensures that mattresses sold in Canada are safe and meet national safety benchmarks.
- **Supports international standards**: Aligns with international best practices in fire safety for consumer products.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Mattresses Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish a clear, science-based, and enforceable standard for the fire safety of standard mattresses in Canada. By setting strict limits on flame spread and after-burning, the regulations significantly enhance consumer safety. The definition of a mattress ensures targeted application, while exclusions protect specialized or non-commercial products. These rules are a critical component of Canada’s broader consumer product safety framework under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act*.

--- 

**Key Takeaway**:  
A mattress sold in Canada must pass the cigarette test under CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.7-2013 without showing more than 50 mm of charring or continuing combustion for 10 minutes after the cigarette is extinguished — and this must be true for no more than one specimen in a batch.
