The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
This particular regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on the date specified in **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on **April 18, 2017**.

**What Does "Repealed" Mean?**  
Repeal means that the regulation was officially canceled and is no longer applicable or enforceable. Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously set out in the regulation are now void and superseded by other laws or regulations, if any.

**Context of SOR/2017-84:**  
SOR/2017-84 is a *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, which contains a series of regulatory amendments and repeals. Section 1 of this supplement specifically identifies the repeal of certain prior regulations. While the exact regulation being repealed is not explicitly named in your query, the repeated reference to "s. 1" suggests that the repeal applies to one or more specific prior rules (possibly related to licensing, safety, or environmental standards — depending on the original regulation).

**Key Implications:**
- No current legal authority exists for the repealed regulation.
- Any actions or decisions based on this regulation are now invalid or outdated.
- Legal or compliance officers must refer to current, active regulations to ensure adherence to current standards.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization, streamlining, or consolidation effort.

**Next Steps for Users or Stakeholders:**
- Verify whether any successor regulation has replaced the repealed rule.
- Consult the full text of SOR/2017-84 or the Canada Gazette for the specific regulation being repealed.
- Refer to the current version of the relevant statute or regulation for updated requirements.

**Conclusion:**  
The regulation referenced is **fully repealed and no longer in effect**. It was removed under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, and its provisions are no longer enforceable. Any reliance on it would be legally incorrect. Users should consult current, active regulations for compliance and legal purposes.
