**Detailed Summary of the Support Organizations Superannuation Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Citation**  
The *Support Organizations Superannuation Regulations* are issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, pursuant to **Vote No. 547 of the Appropriation Act No. 5, 1961**. This means the regulations are authorized by a specific legislative appropriation, providing the legal foundation for their creation and implementation.  
These regulations may be cited as the **Support Organizations Superannuation Regulations**.

---

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **recognize and provide pensionable service credit** for members of the Canadian Forces who have served in certain **support organizations or positions** associated with foreign military forces—specifically those that support the Canadian Forces' operational and administrative needs.

This recognition allows eligible individuals to count their service in these designated organizations toward their pension entitlement under the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Act (CFSA)**, provided they meet specific conditions.

---

**3. Designated Organizations and Positions**  
The Governor in Council has determined, in the public interest, that the following organizations and positions are in support of the forces specified in clauses (E) and (F) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of section 5 of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act:

- **South African Military Nursing Service**  
- **Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Services (QARNNS)**  
- **Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS)**  
- **A full-time position with the Royal Navy under T124 or T124X agreements**

These designations are based on the assessment that these organizations and roles provide direct support to military forces—particularly in healthcare and nursing services—similar to those provided by Canadian forces.

**4. Eligibility for Pensionable Service**  
Full-time service in any of the above-mentioned organizations or positions **may be counted as pensionable service** for a contributor under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, **provided** that:

- The individual was a member of the **regular Canadian Forces** at the time of service; and  
- The individual **elects** to treat such service as pensionable service **within one year** of one of the following dates:
  - The date on which these regulations come into force; **or**  
  - The date on which the individual becomes a contributor under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, **whichever is later**.

This one-year window ensures that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to make an informed decision about whether to include their service in their pension entitlement, without being penalized for delayed action.

---

**5. Contribution Requirements**  
Once a contributor elects to count their service in a designated organization or position as pensionable service, the **amount of contributions** required will be:

- **The same as required for elective service** under clause (E) or (F) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of section 5 of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, depending on the **period of service**:
  - If the service falls within the period specified in **clause (E)**, contributions will be calculated and paid according to the rules governing that clause.
  - If the service falls within a **different period** specified in **clause (F)**, contributions will be calculated and paid according to the rules governing that clause.

This ensures consistency and fairness in how contributions are assessed, aligning the treatment of foreign support service with existing elective service provisions under the CFSA.

---

**6. Key Implications and Interpretation**  
- **Pensionable Service Recognition**: This regulation allows individuals who served in non-Canadian military nursing services or under specific Royal Navy employment agreements to have their service recognized for pension purposes, even though they were not serving in the Canadian Forces directly.
- **Service Type**: Only **full-time service** is eligible. Part-time or temporary service is not included.
- **Timing of Election**: The one-year election window is critical—individuals must act promptly to benefit from this recognition.
- **Contribution Equivalence**: The contribution rates are not increased or reduced; they mirror existing elective service rates, ensuring equitable treatment under the Act.

---

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The regulations do **not** extend to other foreign military organizations or positions not specifically listed.
- Service must be in a **designated organization** or under a **specific agreement (T124 or T124X)**.
- The individual must have been a member of the **regular forces** during the period of service.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Support Organizations Superannuation Regulations* provide a formal mechanism for recognizing the pensionable value of service rendered by Canadian Forces members in key foreign military nursing services and Royal Navy positions. By allowing such service to count toward pension entitlements under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act—subject to timely election and adherence to established contribution rules—the regulations promote fairness, recognition of international service contributions, and consistency in pension entitlements.

This is a significant step in acknowledging the global nature of military service and the support roles played by allied forces in the broader context of national defense and international cooperation.
