### 📅 **6. Creditable Periods and Totalization (Key Benefit Calculation Rules)**

#### 🟩 **For Old Age Security Act (Canada)**:
- **Periods in Turkey**:
  - If a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial plan during a period in Turkey, that time is **counted as residence in Canada** — for the person and their spouse/dependants (if not employed/self-employed in Turkey).
- **Periods in Canada**:
  - If a person is subject to Turkish legislation during a period in Canada, that time is **not counted** as residence in Canada for CPP or provincial pension purposes.

> **Conditions**:
> - Must have **contributed** to the plan (employment or self-employment).
> - Must be contributing **under the relevant plan**.

#### 🟩 **For Turkish Old Age Benefits**:
- A **calendar year** of CPP creditable periods is treated as **360 days** of creditable service in Turkey.
- A **day** of Old Age Security Act (OAS) creditable period (not part of a CPP year) is treated as **one day** of creditable service in Turkey.

#### 🟩 **For Invalidity or Death Benefits (Turkey)**:
- A **calendar year** of CPP creditable periods counts as **360 days** of creditable service in Turkey.

#### 🟩 **Entry into Turkish Scheme**:
- If a person completed a creditable period in Canada **before** joining the Turkish scheme, the **start date of that Canadian period** is treated as the **entry date** into the Turkish scheme.

#### 🟩 **Totalization of Periods**:
- If a person lacks sufficient creditable periods under either country, entitlement is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods from both Parties
  - Creditable periods from a **third country** with which both Parties have a social security agreement allowing totalization.

> **Exception (Non-Entitlement Rule)**:
> - If total creditable periods from both Parties are **less than one year**, and no right exists under either system, **no benefit is required** under this Agreement.
> - However, these periods **shall be counted** by the other Party in determining entitlement to benefits under its own legislation.

### 💰 **7. Calculation of Benefits (Canada)**

#### For a person entitled to a pension **only via totalization**:
- **Earnings-related portion**:
  - Calculated based on **pensionable earnings under CPP**.
- **Flat-rate portion**:
  - Calculated by multiplying:
    - The flat-rate amount under CPP
    - By the **fraction** of total CPP contributions relative to the **minimum qualifying period**.
  - This fraction **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., maximum benefit is equivalent to full minimum period).

#### For a person entitled to a pension **only through totalization**:
- The **competent Turkish institution** determines entitlement as if the periods were completed under Turkish law.
- The **amount** of the pension is calculated as:
  - The fraction of the Turkish pension determined under its own rules
  - Based on the **ratio of total creditable periods** (Canada + Turkey) to the **total required Turkish creditable periods**.

> Turkish rules on **pension reductions, suspensions, or withdrawals** apply during this calculation.
