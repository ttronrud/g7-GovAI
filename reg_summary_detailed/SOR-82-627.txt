### **3. Insurance Coverage (Section 3)**

- **Coverage Scope**:  
  The Minister may provide **insurance for the full amount of any loss** that may occur due to a loan made by a private lender to The Lake Group Ltd.

- **Eligibility and Application Process**:  
  A private lender wishing to have the Minister provide insurance must:
  - Submit a formal **application** to the Minister.
  - Provide **all information and documents** that the Minister may reasonably require to assess the risk and approve the insurance.

- **Limit on Insurance Payment**:  
  When a private lender demands repayment of a loan for which insurance has been provided, the **amount payable under the insurance will not exceed the amount of insurance in effect on the date of the demand**.  
  This means that if the loan is later repaid in full or partially, the insurance payout is capped at the level of coverage that existed at the time the repayment demand was made — preventing overpayment or retroactive claims.

  The total amount of insurance that the Minister may provide for **all loans made by private lenders to The Lake Group Ltd.** at any one time **shall not exceed $18 million**.

- **Approval Requirement**:  
  Any request to exceed this $18 million limit requires **prior approval from the Treasury Board**.  
  This ensures that the government maintains fiscal responsibility and oversight over the use of public funds in this insurance program.

### **Conclusion**

The *The Lake Group Ltd. Regulations* constitute a **targeted, risk-mitigated insurance program** designed to support private lending to a specific corporation in Newfoundland. By limiting exposure to $18 million and requiring Treasury Board approval for any increase, the regulations balance the need to encourage private investment with fiscal responsibility and accountability.

This regulation serves as a **historical example of government intervention in private financial markets** to promote economic development through risk-sharing mechanisms — a practice that remains relevant in modern financial policy.
