**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the **Order Designating New Brunswick for the Purposes of the Criminal Interest Rate Provisions of the Criminal Code**, establishes that **New Brunswick is designated under section 347.1 of the Canadian Criminal Code** to apply the criminal interest rate provisions in the context of payday lending.

The primary objective of this order is to **align New Brunswick’s legal framework with the federal Criminal Code’s interest rate limits**, particularly in cases involving high-interest loans such as payday loans. By designating the province, the federal government recognizes that New Brunswick has implemented **provincial legislative safeguards**—specifically, laws and regulations that limit the total cost of borrowing in payday loans and protect consumers from predatory lending practices.

### **Background and Legislative Foundation**

1. **New Brunswick’s Legislative Measures**  
   The regulation begins with two key factual premises:
   - New Brunswick has enacted **legislative measures** that protect recipients of payday loans.
   - These measures include **clear limits on the total cost of borrowing** under a payday loan agreement, ensuring that consumers are not subjected to exorbitant interest rates or fees that could lead to financial harm.

   These protections are grounded in:
   - The **Act Respecting Payday Loans, S.N.B. 2008, c. 3**  
   - The **Payday Lending Regulation – Cost of Credit Disclosure and Payday Loans Act**

   These laws establish:
   - Maximum allowable interest rates or total cost of credit (e.g., interest plus fees).
   - Requirements for transparent disclosure of loan terms, including the total cost of borrowing.
   - Consumer protections against exploitative lending practices.

2. **Federal Request and Designation Authority**  
   The **Lieutenant Governor in Council** (the executive authority of the provincial government) formally requested that the **Governor in Council** (the federal government’s executive authority) designate New Brunswick for the purposes of **section 347.1 of the Criminal Code**.

   This designation is made **pursuant to subsection 347.1(3)a of the Criminal Code**, which allows for provincial designation when a jurisdiction has enacted laws that protect consumers from excessive interest rates and have established limits on the total cost of borrowing.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

- **Designation of New Brunswick**:  
  The Order formally designates **New Brunswick** as a jurisdiction where the **criminal interest rate provisions of section 347.1 of the Criminal Code** apply.  
  This means that **any person who charges or collects interest in excess of the legal rate** (as defined by provincial law) **in a payday loan or other short-term loan** may be subject to criminal penalties under the federal Criminal Code.

- **Conditions for Effectiveness**:  
  The Order does **not come into force immediately**. It only becomes effective when **both of the following provincial laws are in force**:
  1. **An Act Respecting Payday Loans, S.N.B. 2008, c. 3**  
  2. **Payday Lending Regulation – Cost of Credit Disclosure and Payday Loans Act**

  This ensures that the federal criminal provisions are only activated when the province has a fully operational and enforceable regulatory framework in place to protect consumers.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Order came into force on **January 1, 2018**, which is the date when both provincial laws were in force. This reflects a deliberate synchronization between federal criminal provisions and provincial consumer protection legislation.

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

1. **Consumer Protection**:  
   The designation strengthens consumer protection by preventing lenders from charging interest rates that exceed the legally permissible total cost of borrowing. This helps prevent debt traps and financial exploitation, especially among vulnerable populations.

2. **Federal-Provincial Cooperation**:  
   The Order demonstrates a model of **cooperative governance** between federal and provincial governments. It allows the federal government to apply criminal sanctions against interest rate violations in provinces that have robust consumer safeguards in place.

3. **Criminal Liability for Excessive Interest**:  
   Under section 347.1 of the Criminal Code, individuals or entities that charge interest rates exceeding the legal maximum (as set by provincial law) may face criminal charges, including fines and potential imprisonment. This creates a strong deterrent against predatory lending.

4. **Clarity and Consistency**:  
   By clearly linking federal criminal provisions to provincial legislation, the Order ensures legal clarity and consistency in how interest rate violations are addressed across Canada.

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in Canada’s effort to **protect consumers from predatory lending practices** through a combination of **provincial regulation and federal criminal enforcement**. By designating New Brunswick, the federal government affirms that the province has met the necessary standards for consumer protection in the payday lending sector. The Order ensures that **excessive interest rates are not only financially penalized but also criminally punishable**, reinforcing the principle that financial justice must include safeguards against exploitative lending.

It also sets a precedent for other provinces that may adopt similar consumer protection legislation and seek federal recognition of their regulatory frameworks under the Criminal Code.
