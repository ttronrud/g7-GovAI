**Detailed Summary of the Regulatory Capital (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**

The *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (Act)**.  

This regulatory instrument is part of the broader regulatory framework governing the financial strength and stability of insurance holding companies in Canada. It was enacted under the authority granted by the Act to establish rules for determining the minimum regulatory capital required for insurance holding companies.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465* (Statute of Canada, 2001, Chapter 9, Section 465)  
  - *S.C. 1991, c. 47* (Original enabling legislation)

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to define and standardize the method by which the **regulatory capital** of an **insurance holding company** is calculated. Regulatory capital serves as a measure of the financial resilience of the company, ensuring it can meet its obligations to policyholders and creditors even under adverse conditions.

By establishing a clear, transparent, and consistent formula, the regulations enhance regulatory oversight, promote financial stability, and support prudential governance within the insurance sector.

### **3. Key Definitions**

#### **(a) "Act"**  
Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the legal foundation for regulating insurance companies and their holding structures in Canada.

#### **(b) "Minority Interest"**  
Defined as:
- An equity interest in an entity that is **controlled by an insurance holding company**, but held by **a third party** (i.e., not the holding company itself); or  
- An entity that is **controlled by the insurance holding company** and in which the holding company does not hold a majority ownership.

> This definition ensures that the regulatory capital calculation includes not only the holding company’s own equity but also the equity interests of third parties in subsidiaries it controls—providing a more complete picture of the financial structure.

### **4. Formula for Determining Regulatory Capital**

The regulatory capital of an insurance holding company at any given time is calculated using the following formula:

> **Regulatory Capital = (Shareholders’ Equity + Minority Interests + Subordinated Indebtedness) – Goodwill**

Where:

- **Shareholders’ Equity** = The total shareholders’ equity reported in the financial statements of the holding company.
- **Minority Interests** = Equity interests in controlled entities held by third parties (as defined above).
- **Subordinated Indebtedness** = The amount of debt that is subordinate in payment priority to other liabilities.
- **Goodwill** = The amount of goodwill that would be included in the financial statements of the holding company (this is subtracted because it is not a liquid asset and does not represent a reliable source of capital).

> **Note**: All values are derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out in **subsection 887(4) of the Insurance Companies Act**, as prescribed by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.

### **5. Conditions for Including a Security in Regulatory Capital**

For a security (such as a bond or preferred share) to be included in the regulatory capital calculation, it must meet **all of the following conditions**:

#### **(a) Subordination in Payment Rights**  
The security must be **subordinate in right of payment** to all other liabilities of the issuing entity—except those that are:
- Ranked equally with it, or  
- Subordinate to it.

> This ensures that only truly subordinated instruments (which would be paid after other debts) are counted, reflecting their limited claim on assets in a liquidation.

#### **(b) Fully Paid-Up**  
The security must be **fully paid up**—meaning all required capital contributions have been made by the investor.

#### **(c) Minimum Term and Non-Redemption Clause (for Subordinated Debt or Preferred Shares)**  
For **subordinated indebtedness or preferred shares**, the security must:
- Have an **initial minimum term of five years or more**, or  
- Have **no fixed term** (i.e., perpetual),  
- And **cannot be redeemed or purchased for cancellation** during the first five years after issuance.

> This requirement ensures that the capital base includes long-term, non-redeemable instruments that provide a buffer against financial stress and are not easily withdrawn by the issuing company.

> These provisions protect policyholders and creditors by ensuring that only instruments with long-term, binding commitments are counted as part of the regulatory capital pool.

### **6. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day when **sections 970 and 984 of the Insurance Companies Act** are activated. These sections were enacted by **section 465 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**.

> The regulations officially came into force on **October 24, 2001** (as noted in the footnote).

This phased implementation ensures that the new capital rules are applied consistently with the broader legislative and regulatory reforms introduced in 2001, particularly those aimed at strengthening consumer protection and financial stability in the insurance sector.

### **7. Key Implications and Regulatory Significance**

- **Enhanced Financial Transparency**: By linking regulatory capital to standardized financial reporting under the Superintendent’s accounting rules, the regulations ensure consistency and comparability across insurance holding companies.
  
- **Prudential Oversight**: The inclusion of minority interests and subordinated debt strengthens the assessment of a holding company’s overall financial health and risk exposure.

- **Risk Mitigation**: The exclusion of goodwill and the strict requirements for subordinated instruments reduce the risk of overstatement of capital and promote a more conservative, realistic capital base.

- **Stakeholder Protection**: The rules protect policyholders and creditors by ensuring that only stable, long-term, and subordinate financial instruments contribute to the company’s capital base.

### **8. Conclusion**

The *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* provide a clear, rule-based framework for calculating the regulatory capital of insurance holding companies. By defining key terms, establishing a precise formula, and imposing strict eligibility criteria for included securities, the regulations enhance financial accountability, strengthen prudential oversight, and contribute to the long-term stability of Canada’s insurance sector.

These regulations remain a foundational component of Canada’s insurance regulatory framework, particularly in assessing the financial strength and resilience of large insurance holding companies.

**Note**: These regulations are part of a broader suite of measures introduced in the early 2000s to modernize and strengthen the regulatory regime for insurance companies in response to global financial risks and evolving market dynamics.
