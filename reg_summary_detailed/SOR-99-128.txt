**Detailed Summary of the Mutual Company (Life Insurance) Conversion Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Mutual Company (Life Insurance) Conversion Regulations*, made under the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), provide a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the process by which a life insurance company that operates as a **mutual company** can be converted into a **company with common shares** (i.e., a publicly held or shareholder-owned entity). This conversion allows mutual life insurers—owned and governed by their policyholders—to transition into a structure that may offer greater access to capital, flexibility in governance, and potential for growth through share issuance.

The regulations were enacted in 1999 (S.C. 1999, c. 1, s. 4 and s. 5(1)) and are rooted in earlier provisions (S.C. 1991, c. 47), and apply specifically to life insurance companies engaged in mutual ownership structures.
