**Detailed Summary of the Corporate Interrelationships (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**:

- **Section 76.01a** and **Section 755.1b** of the ICA – which relate to corporate interrelationships and share transfers between insurance companies and their subsidiaries.
- **Subsection 1021(1)c** of the ICA – which provides authority for regulatory measures to ensure transparency and prevent tax avoidance in corporate structures involving insurance entities.

The regulations were enacted through:
- **S.C. 2007, c. 37, s. 197** (amending the ICA)
- **S.C. 2007, c. 37, s. 316** (providing additional regulatory framework)
- **S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 364** (related provisions on corporate structure)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47** (original foundational legislation)

These regulations are designed to **regulate the transfer of shares** between insurance companies and their subsidiaries in a way that ensures **tax neutrality**, **arm’s length transactions**, and **prevents abuse of corporate structures** to evade Canadian income tax obligations.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA), the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada. |
| **Delivery Shares** | Shares issued by an insurance company or an insurance holding company to a *particular subsidiary* as part of an acquisition under either **subsection 76.01(1)** or **755.1(1)** of the ICA. These are not sold to the public but are issued specifically for internal corporate restructuring. |
| **Particular Subsidiary** | A subsidiary body corporate that is specifically identified in the ICA as the recipient of delivery shares under sections 76.01(1) or 755.1(1). This term is central to defining the scope of permissible transactions. |

### **3. Prescribed Conditions for Acquisitions (Under Sections 76.01(1) and 755.1(1))**

These conditions must be met *before* an insurance company or insurance holding company delivers shares to a particular subsidiary for an acquisition:

1. **Fair Market Value Consideration**  
   The consideration (payment or value) received by the insurance company or holding company for the delivery shares must equal the **fair market value** of those shares at the time of issuance.

2. **Shares Must Be Widely Held and Actively Traded**  
   The class of shares to which the delivery shares belong must be:
   - **Widely held**, and  
   - **Actively traded** on one of the following Canadian stock exchanges:
     - Canadian Venture Exchange (CVE)
     - Montreal Exchange (MX)
     - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)

   This ensures that the market value of the shares is reliable and transparent, reducing the risk of artificial or inflated valuations.

3. **Sole Purpose of Transfer**  
   The **sole purpose** of the acquisition by the particular subsidiary is to **transfer the delivery shares** to the shareholders of another body corporate.  
   → This means the transaction must be structured as a transfer, not as a holding or investment.

4. **Arm’s Length Transactions Prior to Acquisition**  
   Immediately before the acquisition of delivery shares:
   - The other body corporate (the recipient of the shares) and its shareholders must have dealt with the insurance company or holding company and the particular subsidiary **at arm’s length**.
   - "Arm’s length" is determined in accordance with the **Income Tax Act**, meaning transactions must reflect market pricing and not be influenced by relationships or favoritism.

5. **Non-Residency Requirement**  
   Immediately before the acquisition, **neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate** can be **resident in Canada** for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.  
   → This ensures that the transaction avoids being used to shift income or assets into Canada for tax purposes.

---

### **4. Prescribed Conditions for Post-Acquisition Transfers (Under Sections 76.01(2) and 755.1(2))**

These conditions apply *after* the acquisition of delivery shares and govern the subsequent transfer of shares to shareholders:

1. **No Beneficial Interest Acquired by the Subsidiary**  
   The particular subsidiary must **not acquire a beneficial interest** in the delivery shares as a result of the acquisition.  
   → The shares must be transferred directly to the shareholders of the other body corporate.

2. **Immediate Transfer to Shareholders**  
   The acquisition must be **immediately followed** by a transfer of the delivery shares to the shareholders of the other body corporate.  
   → There must be no delay or retention of shares by the subsidiary.

3. **Non-Residency After Transfer**  
   Immediately after the transfer, **neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate** can be resident in Canada under the Income Tax Act.  
   → Ensures that the transaction remains outside Canada’s tax jurisdiction.

4. **Post-Transfer Subsidiary Relationship**  
   After the transfer, the **other body corporate must become a subsidiary** of the particular subsidiary.  
   → This creates a new corporate structure that is subject to oversight and transparency requirements.

> *Note: This condition may appear paradoxical — the other body corporate becomes a subsidiary, yet must not be resident in Canada. It reflects a structured reorganization intended to maintain tax neutrality while enabling cross-border corporate repositioning.*

### **5. Remedies When Conditions Are Breached (Under Sections 76.01(3) and 755.1(3))**

If any of the conditions outlined in sections 2 or 3 **cease to be met or are not met**, the insurance company or holding company must act within **30 days** to:

1. **Cancel the Delivery Shares**  
   - The shares must be canceled.  
   - If the company’s by-laws limit the number of authorized shares, the delivery shares may be restored to the status of **authorized but unissued shares** (i.e., they remain in the authorized share capital but are not issued to anyone).

2. **Return the Consideration**  
   - The consideration (value) paid by the insurance company or holding company for the delivery shares must be **returned to the particular subsidiary**.

3. **Cancel the Entry in Stated Capital**  
   - The entry recording the consideration in the company’s **stated capital account** must be removed from the books.

> These corrective actions ensure that the transaction remains compliant and that no tax advantage or asset shift is improperly achieved.

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on:
- The day that **Section 197 of S.C. 2007, c. 37** (the amendment to the ICA) comes into force, **or**
- If that date is later, on the day the regulations are **registered** (officially published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*).

> **Effective Date:** March 8, 2008 (as noted in SI/2008-33)

### **7. Purpose and Objectives of the Regulations**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

- To **prevent tax avoidance** through complex corporate structures involving insurance companies and their subsidiaries.
- To ensure that **share transfers** between insurance companies and their subsidiaries are **transparent, legitimate, and market-based**.
- To maintain **compliance with Canadian income tax rules**, especially regarding residency and arm’s length dealings.
- To preserve the **integrity of the insurance sector’s capital structure** and prevent manipulation of share values or ownership.

By requiring fair market valuation, active trading, and clear transfer purposes, the regulations ensure that such transactions are not used to artificially shift profits or assets into Canada to reduce tax liabilities.

### **8. Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Implications |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Insurance Companies & Holding Companies** | Must ensure all share transfers meet strict valuation, residency, and arm’s length criteria. Failure to comply triggers mandatory corrective actions. |
| **Subsidiaries** | Can only acquire delivery shares for the sole purpose of transferring them to other shareholders. Cannot retain ownership. |
| **Tax Authorities (e.g., CRA)** | Can use these regulations to verify that transactions are not structured to evade income tax. |
| **Investors & Shareholders** | The transaction structure ensures that ownership shifts are transparent and not hidden through complex corporate maneuvers. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Corporate Interrelationships (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations** establish a clear, enforceable framework for share transfers between insurance companies and their subsidiaries. By imposing strict conditions on valuation, market activity, tax residency, and transaction purpose, the regulations ensure that such corporate actions remain **legitimate, transparent, and compliant with Canadian tax law**. They serve as a critical tool in preventing tax avoidance and maintaining financial integrity within the Canadian insurance sector.

These rules reflect a balance between allowing flexibility in corporate restructuring and protecting the Canadian tax system from abuse through cross-border or structured ownership shifts.
