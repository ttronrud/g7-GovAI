The provided text consists entirely of repeals of a specific regulation, indicating that the regulation in question has been officially removed from force and is no longer in effect.

**Detailed Summary:**

The listed entries indicate that a particular regulation (originally issued under the *Regulations of the Government of Canada*, specifically referenced by SOR/2009-296, section 17, and subsequently repealed under SOR/2011-13, section 2, multiple times) has been **repealed** (i.e., formally canceled or abolished) by statutory instrument.

- **SOR/2009-296, s. 17**: This section originally contained the regulation that was later repealed. It was part of a regulatory order (SOR stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Government of Canada") issued in 2009, likely related to a specific area such as environmental protection, transportation, or workplace safety, depending on the context of the original regulation. However, the exact content of the regulation is not provided in the text.

- **SOR/2011-13, s. 2**: This statutory instrument formally repeals the regulation referenced in s. 17 of SOR/2009-296. The fact that this repeal is listed **eight times** suggests either:
  - A typographical or formatting error (e.g., duplication in the original document),
  - A procedural or administrative oversight (e.g., the repeal was applied multiple times in different contexts or for different sections),
  - Or the repealing instrument (SOR/2011-13, s. 2) was applied to multiple provisions, and the reference was repeated for clarity or tracking purposes.

**Conclusion:**

As of the date of the repeal (effective under SOR/2011-13), the regulation originally contained in **section 17 of SOR/2009-296** has been **fully and permanently removed** from legal force. It is no longer enforceable, applicable, or recognized under current Canadian regulatory law.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The regulation is **repealed** and **no longer in effect**.
- The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2011-13, section 2**.
- The repetition of the repeal reference is likely a duplication or formatting artifact and does not indicate multiple separate repeals.
- No substantive content of the original regulation is available in the provided text, so a detailed description of its provisions cannot be offered.

**Recommendation for Further Research:**
To understand the original purpose or scope of the regulation, one should consult the full text of SOR/2009-296 (as amended or amended by SOR/2011-13) or the official government database such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Statutes* section of the Government of Canada website.

In summary: **This regulation has been officially repealed and is no longer in force.**
