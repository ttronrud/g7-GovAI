**Detailed Summary of the Gallantry Awards Order (Revocation and Replacement of Previous Orders)**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation, known as the **Gallantry Awards Order**, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Veterans Affairs** and the **Treasury Board**, to **revise and replace** outdated provisions related to the payment of gratuities and annuities for gallantry awards received by members of the Canadian armed forces.

It formally **revokes** three prior Orders in Council:
- **P.C. 1987-1960** (September 17, 1987)
- **P.C. 1960-41/526** (April 21, 1960)
- **P.C. 1965-36/1401** (August 6, 1965)

These earlier orders established a framework for the financial recognition of gallantry awards given by the British Crown (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II) to Canadian service members. The new Order replaces them with a more modern, equitable, and clearly defined structure for financial benefits.

### **2. Title and Citation**

- The new regulation is officially titled: **The Gallantry Awards Order**.
- It may be cited as: **Gallantry Awards Order**.

### **3. Definition of "Member of the Armed Services of Canada"**

The term **"member of the armed services of Canada"** is broadly defined to include:
- Individuals who were members of the **British armed forces** who:
  - Enlisted **before March 31, 1949**, and
  - Were **domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland** at the time of enlistment.

This provision ensures that individuals who served in the British military under Canadian domicile are recognized and entitled to the same benefits as Canadian-born or Canadian-domiciled service members.

### **4. Financial Obligations and Funding**

The **Minister of Veterans Affairs** is responsible for:
- Paying **gratuities and annuities** arising from gallantry awards made by:
  - **King George VI** or
  - **Queen Elizabeth II**

These payments are funded from **moneys appropriated by Parliament** specifically for this purpose.

---

### **5. Payment Structure Based on Award Type and Circumstances**

The Order establishes a tiered system of financial benefits depending on the **type of gallantry award** and the **recipient’s status** (e.g., whether receiving a pension or not).

#### **(a) Victoria Cross (VC) or George Cross (GC)**
- Recipients receive an **annuity of $3,000**.

#### **(b) Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), Military Cross (MC), Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM), Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM), Distinguished Service Medal (DSM), Military Medal (MM), or Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM)**  
*Only if the recipient is NOT receiving a disability pension, war veterans allowance, or long service pension*:
- Upon **discharge from service**, the recipient receives a **one-time gratuity of $100**.

#### **(c) Same gallantry awards (VC, DSC, MC, DFC, DCM, CGM, DSM, MM, DFM)**  
*If the recipient has been awarded a disability pension, war veterans allowance, or long service pension*:
- The recipient receives an **annuity of $50**.

> **Note**: This annuity begins on the **date the pension or allowance is first awarded**, unless exceptions apply.

#### **(d) Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM) Holders**
- Qualified holders of the **Conspicuous Gallantry Medal** continue to receive an **annuity of $100**, regardless of other circumstances.

### **6. Exceptions to Annuity Payments (Section 3(1)(c))**

An annuity under section (c) (i.e., the $50 annuity for those receiving a pension) is **not payable** under the following conditions:

1. **For Commissioned Officers**:
   - The annuity **shall not be payable** for any period **before August 24, 1972**.

2. **For Members of British Forces Enlisted Before March 31, 1949 (in Canada or Newfoundland)**:
   - The annuity **shall not be payable** during the time the individual is receiving a gallantry award from the **British government**.
   - The annuity **shall not be payable** for any month **before January 1, 1990**.

> These exceptions reflect both historical recognition and policy adjustments to avoid double benefits or overlapping support from British and Canadian sources.

---

### **7. Key Policy Implications and Rationale**

- **Modernization**: The Order updates outdated rules from the 1960s and 1980s to reflect current financial and administrative practices.
- **Equity and Fairness**: It ensures that all eligible service members—especially those from the pre-1949 era—receive appropriate recognition and financial support.
- **Avoiding Overlap**: The exclusion of annuity payments during British gallantry award receipt prevents double benefits.
- **Historical Recognition**: The inclusion of pre-1949 British service members domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland acknowledges their contribution to Canada’s military history and ensures they are not excluded from benefits due to nationality or service origin.

---

### **8. Legal Authority and Enforcement**

- The Order is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the advice of the **Minister of Veterans Affairs** and the **Treasury Board**.
- It is enforceable through the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**, who administers the payments from approved parliamentary funds.

---

### **9. Relevance and Impact**

- **Primary Beneficiaries**: 
  - Veterans who received gallantry awards during the 20th century (especially World Wars I and II, and Cold War-era conflicts).
  - Individuals who served in the British forces but were based in Canada or Newfoundland.
- **Financial Support**: Provides both **one-time gratuities** and **ongoing annuities** as a form of recognition and compensation for bravery.
- **Recognition of Service**: Reinforces the Canadian government’s commitment to honoring the sacrifices of military personnel, particularly those who served during times when Canada and the UK shared a common military framework.

### **Conclusion**

The **Gallantry Awards Order** represents a significant update to the financial recognition system for gallantry awards in Canada. By revoking outdated provisions and introducing a clear, structured, and equitable payment framework, it ensures that service members—especially those from the pre-1949 era and those with British service roots—receive fair and timely financial benefits in recognition of their acts of bravery. The Order balances historical context with modern administrative clarity, reflecting both respect for past service and the need for transparent, consistent policy.
