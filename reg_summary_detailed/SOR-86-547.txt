**Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**  
This regulation, officially titled the *Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Fee Order*, was issued by the Minister of Justice on May 22, 1986, pursuant to **Order in Council P.C. 1986-851** of April 10, 1986. The authority for this order stems from **subsection 27(1) of the Divorce Act, 1985**, which empowers the Minister to establish fees for services provided by the Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings.

The regulation came into effect on **June 1, 1986**, and is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on page 1925. It is also referenced in the Statutes of Canada as **S.C. 1986, c. 4**. The Order may be cited as the *Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Fee Order*.

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to prescribe a standardized fee that must be paid by individuals who file for divorce and who receive services from the Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings. The Central Registry is responsible for maintaining records and processing administrative aspects of divorce proceedings across Canada, and this fee ensures that administrative costs are covered.

**Key Provisions**

1. **Standard Fee for Divorce Applications**  
   - A person who files an application for divorce and for whom a service is provided under **Section 5 of the Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Regulations** is required to pay a fee of **$10 per application**.  
   - This fee applies to all individuals initiating divorce proceedings and is directly tied to the administrative processing of their application through the Central Registry.

2. **Exemption for Legal Aid Recipients**  
   - A person who receives **legal aid from a province** in connection with their divorce application is **exempt from paying the $10 fee**.  
   - This exemption is conditional upon the **provincial law waiving the filing fee** for such individuals.  
   - In other words, if the province’s legal aid system determines that the individual is eligible for fee waiver under its own rules, the $10 fee is not required to be paid.

**Scope and Application**  
- The fee applies specifically to applications for divorce processed through the Central Registry.  
- It covers administrative services such as record-keeping, processing, and maintaining the official status of the divorce application.  
- The fee is not applicable to legal or judicial proceedings themselves, but rather to the administrative services provided by the Central Registry.

**Effective Date**  
- The fee provisions take effect on **June 1, 1986**.

**Significance and Context**  
This regulation was part of a broader effort to standardize administrative fees across Canada’s divorce system, ensuring transparency and consistency in the cost of initiating divorce proceedings. By establishing a uniform fee of $10, it simplified the process for individuals and provided a predictable cost structure for the federal government’s registry system.

The inclusion of the legal aid exemption reflects a recognition of equity and access to justice—ensuring that individuals who rely on provincial legal aid do not face financial barriers due to administrative fees, particularly when such fees are already waived under provincial law.

**Conclusion**  
The *Central Registry of Divorce Proceedings Fee Order* establishes a clear, equitable, and administratively practical fee structure for divorce applications. It sets a $10 fee for all applicants, with a critical exemption for those receiving legal aid under provincial programs where filing fees are waived. This balance between administrative cost recovery and access to justice underscores the regulation’s role in promoting both fiscal responsibility and fairness in the Canadian divorce process.
