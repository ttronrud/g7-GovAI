Certainly. Below is a **detailed, comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

## **Crown Liability and Proceedings (Provincial Court) Regulations, C.R.C., c. 447**  
*Issued under section 34 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act (C.L.P.A.)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**

These Regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, pursuant to **section 34 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act**. The purpose is to **revise and replace** the previous *Crown Liability (Provincial Court) Regulations, C.R.C., c. 447*, with new, updated rules governing the **practice and procedure in provincial courts** for claims brought against the Crown under **Part II of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act**.

The new regulations come into force **on the date that the Act to amend the Federal Court Act, the Crown Liability Act, the Supreme Court Act, and other related Acts (Chapter 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 1990) comes into effect** — which was **April 1, 1990**.

These Regulations are officially known as the **Crown Liability and Proceedings (Provincial Court) Regulations**.

- **"Act"** = The *Crown Liability and Proceedings Act*

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These Regulations apply to:

1. **Proceedings taken in a provincial court under Part II of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act**, and  
2. **Proceedings against an agency of the Crown** where **section 35 of the Act applies** (i.e., where the agency is subject to Crown liability).

---

### **4. Service of Documents Originating Proceedings**

#### **General Rule**
Service of a document initiating proceedings (e.g., a claim) must be made on the **Deputy Attorney General** at their **office in Ottawa**.

#### **Exceptions and Alternatives**
A document may be validly served if it is served on:

- The **Director of the appropriate Regional Office of the Department of Justice**, depending on the province:
  - **BC**: Vancouver Regional Office  
  - **Alberta**: Edmonton Regional Office  
  - **Saskatchewan**: Saskatoon Regional Office  
  - **Manitoba**: Winnipeg Regional Office  
  - **Ontario**: Toronto Regional Office  
  - **Quebec**: Montreal Regional Office  
  - **NS, NB, PEI, NL**: Halifax Regional Office  
  - **Yukon**: Whitehorse Regional Office  
  - **NWT**: Yellowknife Regional Office  

- Or on and **accepted by an agent or mandatary** duly authorized to act for the Attorney General in that specific proceeding.

#### **Service in New Brunswick, PEI, or Newfoundland**
If proceedings are in **New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland**, service made on the Director of the Halifax Regional Office is deemed to have been made **within the province** where the proceedings are taken.

#### **Service by Mail**
Where service is by mail (as permitted under provincial rules), it must be:
- **Registered or certified mail**, and  
- Effective on the **tenth day after mailing**.

#### **Service on Agency Chief Executive Officers**
Service on the chief executive officer of a Crown agency may be made in the manner provided in this section.

#### **Service Outside Ontario**
Service may be made **without special order**, even if proceedings are in a court outside Ontario — consistent with **section 23 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act**.

---

### **5. Time Limits for Filing a Defence or Reply**

The Attorney General may file a defence or reply (including a counterclaim) within:
- **30 days after service of the originating document**, **or**
- The time allowed under the **provincial rules**, **whichever is longer**,  
- Or within **further time allowed by the court**.

> This ensures the Crown has a reasonable, yet not unreasonably extended, window to respond.

---

### **6. Preliminary Exceptions in Quebec**

In **Quebec**, the Attorney General may raise preliminary exceptions (e.g., challenges to jurisdiction or validity of the claim) in accordance with **articles 160, 161, and 162 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure**, **except** that the 5-day period in those articles is **read as 30 days**.

> This adjustment aligns Quebec’s procedural timelines with the rest of the federal system and provides the Crown with a longer period to respond.

---

### **7. Certification of Judgments and Orders**

When a **judgment or order** is made against the Crown for the payment of money, the court (or its registrar, clerk, or protonotary, or a deputy) must certify the judgment/order to the **Minister of Finance** under the following circumstances:

- **Immediately** if no appeal is allowed by law;  
- **On expiration of the appeal period** if no appeal has been filed and no extension applied for;  
- **On final disposition of the claim** if an appeal has been filed;  
- **On dismissal of an application for extension of time** for appeal; or  
- **At an earlier time** if the Attorney General files notice that they do **not intend to appeal**.

> The certification must be transmitted to:
> - The **Deputy Attorney General in Ottawa**, or  
> - The **appropriate Regional Office** of the Department of Justice (as listed in section 4).

> A **certified copy of the judgment**, or a certified copy of the judgment **together with a certified copy of the taxed bill of costs**, is **sufficient** as a certificate of judgment.

---

### **8. Discovery of Crown Officers or Servants**

Under the provincial rules, if a corporation (non-Crown) would be required to allow discovery of an officer or servant, then **an officer or servant of the Crown or an agency of the Crown** may be examined for discovery **under the same conditions and with the same effect** — **subject to sections 37 to 39 of the Canada Evidence Act**.

> This ensures that the Crown is not treated as a "non-party" in discovery and allows for the same level of access to records and information as would be available to a private corporation.

---

### **9. Filing of Lists or Affidavits of Documents**

If, under provincial rules, a party (e.g., a private individual or corporation) would be required to file or serve a **list or affidavit of documents**, then the **Deputy Attorney General** must do so **within 60 days** of the event triggering the obligation — or within any additional time allowed by the court.

> This ensures timely disclosure by the Crown and maintains fairness in litigation.

---

### **10. Production of Documents or Copies**

If, under provincial rules, a party would be entitled to **inspect or obtain a copy of documents** from the Crown (as a person), then such production **may be ordered by the court** — **subject to sections 37 to 39 of the Canada Evidence Act** — after considering any objections that the Crown might raise if it were a private entity.

> This balances the Crown’s duty of confidentiality with the need for transparency in litigation.

---

### **11. Confession of Judgment**

The **Attorney General may file a confession of judgment** at any stage of proceedings — for part or all of the claim.

#### **Plaintiff’s Response**
- The plaintiff has **30 days** from receiving notice of the confession to:
  - File a **written notice** of **acceptance or refusal** of the confession.

#### **If Acceptance is Given**
- The court or a judge may enter judgment accordingly, with **costs determined as just in the circumstances**.

#### **If Refusal is Given (or no notice is filed)**
- The matter proceeds in the **ordinary manner** (i.e., without judgment being entered on the confession).

#### **If Final Disposition is in the Plaintiff’s Favour and Less Than the Confession Amount**
- Even if the plaintiff recovers less than the amount offered in the confession, the **Crown is entitled to costs incurred after the date of the confession**.

> This protects the Crown from being financially burdened by ongoing litigation after a confession is made.

#### **Important Provisions**
- A **confession of judgment is not admissible as evidence** in the original action or in any other proceeding.  
- **No provincial rules relating to confessions of judgment apply** in proceedings under Part II of the Act.

---

### **12. Time Extensions for Procedural Obligations**

Where the provincial rules require or permit the Attorney General or a Crown agency to do something (e.g., file a document, respond to a request) within a certain time, a **14-day extension** is automatically added to the time allowed.

> This accounts for the administrative complexity and potential delays in dealing with a federal government
