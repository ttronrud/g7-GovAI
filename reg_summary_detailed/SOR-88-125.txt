### **Detailed Summary of the Pembroke Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Pembroke Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of official regulations enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 4.4**, and based on a prior public consultation process under **Section 4.5**. These regulations establish spatial and environmental constraints around **Pembroke Airport** (located in the Township of Petawawa, Ontario) to ensure aviation safety by controlling the elevation of structures, natural growth, and land use in the vicinity of the airport.

## **1. Legal Basis and Public Consultation**

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The regulations were made pursuant to **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to adopt zoning regulations for airports to ensure safe operations.
  
- **Public Notice and Opportunity to Comment**:  
  A proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette, Part I** (October 17 and 24, 1987), and in **two issues of the Pembroke Observer** (October 24 and 26, 1987), and **two issues of Le Droit** (October 2 and 9, 1987). This ensured that all interested parties—such as landowners, developers, environmental groups, and aviation stakeholders—had a reasonable opportunity to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  Based on the Minister’s recommendation, the Governor General in Council formally enacted the regulations, effective upon publication.

## **2. Key Definitions in the Regulations**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Pembroke Airport located in the Township of Petawawa, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point used as a reference for measuring elevations and distances. It is located at coordinates **5,081,022.677 N and 325,079.673 E**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 17–35). It ensures that aircraft can safely approach the runway without obstruction. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, except where it would be less than 9 meters above ground level—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The central landing area of the airport, including the runway. For runway 17–35, it is **300 meters wide** and **1,643.41 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward until it intersects with the outer surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 160 meters above sea level.

## **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances.
- The **boundary of the outer limits** of the regulated area is precisely defined in a detailed, coordinate-based description (as referenced in the zoning plan).
- The area spans across multiple municipalities:
  - Township of Alice
  - Township of Petawawa
  - Village of Petawawa
  - Township of Buchanan
  - County of Renfrew

This boundary is defined through a series of precise directional and coordinate-based instructions, starting and ending at the **southeastern corner of Lot 15, Concession 1, Township of Petawawa**, forming a closed loop.

## **4. Elevation Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
   - Two surfaces: one for each end of runway 17–35.
   - Each is an **inclined plane** with a slope of **1 meter vertically per 50 meters horizontally**.
   - Rises to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
     - 15,000 meters horizontally from the end of the strip.
     - 2,400 meters from the centerline of the strip.
     - 300 meters vertically above the elevation at the end of the strip.

2. **Outer Surface**  
   - A horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (160 m ASL → 205 m ASL).
   - If this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground**, the surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.

3. **Transitional Surface**  
   - An inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally**.
   - Extends from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces to meet the outer surface.

> **Purpose**: Prevents visual and physical obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

## **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- Any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land that exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional) is considered a potential hazard.
- The **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that vegetation does not interfere with aircraft operations due to shadows, turbulence, or bird attraction.

---

## **6. Prohibition on Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**

- No owner or occupier may use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - Edible to birds
  - Attractive to birds

> This is a critical safety measure to prevent **bird strikes**, which can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft.

---

## **7. Zoning Plan Reference**

All spatial descriptions are based on **Pembroke Airport Zoning Plan No. 47-074 84-131**, dated **August 21, 1986**, and referenced across multiple sheets:

- **Approach Surfaces**: Sheets 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13
- **Outer Surface**: Sheets 1–9, 11, 12
- **Strip**: Sheet 5
- **Transitional Surface**: Sheets 4, 5, 6, 11, 12

These plans provide the official technical blueprint for the regulation’s spatial boundaries and elevation controls.

## **8. Key Safety and Operational Objectives**

The regulations are designed to achieve the following primary goals:

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aircraft Safety** | Prevents obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting structure and vegetation height. |
| **Visual and Physical Clearance** | Ensures clear sightlines and unobstructed flight paths using defined approach and transitional surfaces. |
| **Bird Hazard Mitigation** | Reduces bird activity by prohibiting waste disposal that attracts birds. |
| **Consistency with Aviation Standards** | Aligns with international and Canadian aviation safety standards for airport zoning. |
| **Environmental and Land Use Management** | Balances development with safety, protecting the airport’s operational integrity. |

---

## **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
  - Monitor and inspect land use within the regulated zone.

- Compliance is enforced through **legal means**, and violations may result in penalties or orders to correct the issue.

## **Conclusion**

The **Pembroke Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and technically precise set of land-use controls designed to protect aviation safety at a key regional airport. By defining strict elevation limits for structures and vegetation, and prohibiting bird-attractive waste disposal, the regulations ensure that aircraft can operate safely and efficiently without interference from external factors.

The rules are grounded in detailed surveying data, clearly defined boundaries, and a transparent public consultation process. They serve as a model for how federal aviation policy can be implemented through localized, science-based zoning regulations that balance development with public safety.

These regulations remain in force as a legal instrument under the Aeronautics Act and continue to guide land use and development in the Pembroke Airport area.
