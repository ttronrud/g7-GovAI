### **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation Revoking the Public Order Emergency in Canada (February 23, 2022)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The document is an **official Proclamation** issued under the authority of the **Governor in Council** of Canada.
- It is enacted pursuant to **Section 22 of the Emergencies Act**, a federal law that allows the government to declare a public order emergency and to take temporary and exceptional measures to address threats to public order.
- The proclamation is signed by **Mary May Simon**, the **Governor General of Canada**, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council for Canada**.

#### **2. Background and Context**
- On **February 14, 2022**, the Government of Canada declared a **public order emergency** across the entire country through a proclamation under the Emergencies Act.
- This emergency was introduced in response to **real-time threats** to public safety and order, particularly in:
  - **Ottawa**
  - Key **border crossings** in:
    - Ontario
    - Manitoba
    - British Columbia
    - Alberta
- The emergency was primarily triggered by **illegal blockades** and **protests** that posed a risk of **breach of the peace**, including:
  - Obstruction of transportation routes
  - Resistance to law enforcement efforts to remove blockades
  - Threats to public safety and economic stability

#### **3. Rationale for Revocation**
The Governor in Council determined that:
- The **temporary and exceptional measures** enacted under the emergency declaration had been **effective** in addressing the immediate threats as of February 14, 2022.
- The situation in Canada had evolved, and the **ongoing threats to public order had diminished**.
- The government now believes that **no longer necessary** to maintain the emergency declaration because:
  - **Sufficient existing legal powers** (such as those under the *Criminal Code*, *Peacekeeping and Public Order Laws*, and other statutes) are sufficient to:
    - Prevent or respond to any **residual illegal blockades**
    - Stop or manage any **new public assemblies** that might lead to a breach of the peace
- Therefore, the **public order emergency is no longer required**.

#### **4. Key Action of the Proclamation**
- The **declaration of a public order emergency** made on **February 14, 2022**, is **officially revoked**.
- This revocation is **effective immediately upon publication** of the proclamation.
- The revocation applies **across all provinces and territories of Canada**.

#### **5. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This action signifies a **transition from emergency to normal governance** in response to the specific public order threat.
- It demonstrates that the government has assessed the situation and determined that:
  - The emergency measures were **sufficiently effective**
  - The threat to public order has **subsided or is manageable under existing legal frameworks**
- The revocation does **not imply that the underlying issues (e.g., protests, blockades)** have been resolved, only that the **emergency powers are no longer needed**.

#### **6. Publication and Authentication**
- The proclamation was officially **published** and **affixed with the Great Seal of Canada**.
- It was issued from **Government House in Ottawa**.
- The date of issuance is **February 23, 2022** — just nine days after the original emergency declaration.

#### **7. Signatory and Authority**
- **Mary May Simon**, as Governor General of Canada, formally signs the proclamation on behalf of the Crown.
- She holds several prominent appointments, including:
  - Chancellor of the Order of Canada
  - Commander of the Order of Military Merit
  - Chancellor of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces
- Her role is **ceremonial and constitutional**, representing the Crown in executing official government actions such as proclamations.

#### **8. Implications and Relevance**
- **End of Emergency Powers**: The revocation removes the legal basis for emergency powers (such as expanded policing authority, use of force, or restrictions on civil liberties) that were in place during the emergency period.
- **Restoration of Normal Legal Order**: It allows law enforcement and courts to operate under standard legal procedures, without the need for emergency provisions.
- **Public Confidence**: It signals to citizens and institutions that the government has responsibly managed the crisis and is returning to a stable, rule-based system.
- **Precedent**: This is a notable example of the **temporary use and subsequent termination** of emergency powers under the Emergencies Act, reinforcing accountability and proportionality in government response to public order threats.

### **Conclusion**
This proclamation marks the **formal and legally binding end** of a public order emergency that had been declared in response to illegal blockades and public disruptions across Canada in early February 2022. The government concluded that the emergency was no longer necessary due to the resolution of the immediate threats and the availability of existing legal tools to maintain public order. The revocation reflects a responsible, evidence-based, and constitutionally sound approach to emergency governance.
