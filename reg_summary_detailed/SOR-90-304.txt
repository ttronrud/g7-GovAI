**Detailed Summary of the Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations (S.C. 1988, c. 65)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Vessel Duties Regulations") were enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under authority granted by **Supplementary Note No. 1 to Chapter 89 of Schedule I to the Customs Tariff**. These regulations provide a framework for the **temporary reduction or complete removal of customs duties** on specific types of vessels that are temporarily imported into or stored in Canadian customs waters.

The regulations aim to:
- Promote economic activity by reducing or eliminating customs duties on vessels used for essential services (e.g., cruise ships, cargo transport, or vessels undergoing repairs/modifications).
- Support maritime industries by facilitating access to Canadian waters for vessels that may otherwise face high duty burdens.
- Ensure compliance with customs requirements and safeguard national interests through conditions and reporting obligations.

These regulations are currently cited as **R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)** and are part of the broader Canadian customs regime governing the importation and use of vessels.

## **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms to clarify scope and application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Canadian customs waters** | Includes all waters within the territorial sea, internal waters, and the waters above the continental shelf where a vessel falls under customs jurisdiction under the *Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act*. |
| **Continental shelf of Canada** | The seabed and subsoil extending beyond the territorial sea to the outer edge of the continental margin or up to 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea boundary (or as otherwise prescribed by the Governor in Council). |
| **Cruise ship** | A passenger vessel with overnight accommodations for at least 100 persons (excluding crew), excluding scheduled ferry services. |
| **Duty-paid vessel** | A vessel that has been released under Section 32 of the *Customs Act*. |
| **Inland waters** | All rivers, lakes, and fresh water bodies in Canada, including the St. Lawrence River up to specific geographic boundaries. |
| **Internal waters** | Waters on the landward side of territorial sea baselines, areas with sovereign title, and inland waters. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (responsible for administering the regulations). |
| **Modifications** | Any work on a vessel that is not routine repair (e.g., structural changes, equipment upgrades). |
| **Repairs** | Restoration of a vessel to its original condition at the time of last departure from Canadian waters, including parts, materials, and labor. |
| **Storage** | Safekeeping of a demobilized vessel in a Canadian port. |
| **Territorial sea** | As defined in the *Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act*. |
| **Vessel** | A good falling under specific tariff headings (e.g., heading 89.01, 89.05, 89.06, or tariff items 8903.91.00, 8903.92.00, etc.). |

> Note: "Customs duties" were repealed in 1998 (SOR/98-28, s. 9), but the term is retained in the regulations for historical continuity.

## **Core Provisions**

### **1. Temporary Importation (Section 3)**

- **Duty Reduction/Removal**: For vessels temporarily imported into Canadian customs waters, customs duties are reduced or removed **for up to 12 consecutive months**.
- **Extension**: If the vessel remains in Canadian customs waters after the initial 12-month period, an **additional 12-month period** (or multiple periods) may be granted, provided conditions are met.
- **Calculation of Duty Reduction**:
  - The reduction is equal to the difference between:
    - The original customs duty on the vessel, and  
    - The customs duty on **1/120 of the vessel’s duty value per month** (or part of a month) it remains in Canadian waters.
  - This applies **except for cruise ships**, where the duty is **fully removed**.

> **Example**: If a vessel has a duty value of $10 million and is in Canadian waters for 6 months, the duty reduction would be based on $10M × (1/120) × 6 = $500,000.

### **2. Vessels Transporting Cargo Between Specific Canadian Points (Section 4)**

- **Duty Removal**: For vessels used to transport cargo between:
  - A point **west of 95°W** and a point **east of 95°W**,  
  - *Excluding* movements between points **north of 60°N**.
- **Effect**: The customs duty on such vessels is **fully removed**.

> This provision supports interprovincial freight movement and regional economic integration.

---

### **3. Storage in Canadian Ports (Section 7)**

- **Duty Removal**: A vessel placed in storage in a Canadian port facility may have customs duties **fully removed for up to 12 consecutive months**.
- **Extension**: If the vessel remains in Canadian waters after the initial period, an additional 12-month period may be granted.
- **Security Deposit**: For removal of duty under this section, the importer must **deposit security** (in a form acceptable to the Minister) equal to the customs duty that would otherwise be payable.

---

### **4. Conditions for Duty Reduction or Removal (Section 8)**

The reduction or removal of duty is **conditional** and must meet the following criteria:

#### a) **For non-duty-paid Canadian-registered vessels**:
- No suitable duty-paid or domestically built Canadian-registered vessel is available to perform the required service.

#### b) **For non-duty-paid foreign-registered vessels**:
- No suitable Canadian-registered vessel is available to perform the required service.

#### c) **For vessels engaged in activities under the Coasting Trade Act**:
- The activity must be explicitly specified in the application.

> These conditions ensure that duty relief is only granted when there is a genuine need due to lack of alternatives.

---

### **5. Application Requirements (Section 9)**

To qualify for duty reduction or removal, the following must be fulfilled:

- A formal **application** must be submitted to the Minister in a format acceptable to the Minister.
- The application must include **documentary evidence** satisfactory to the Minister (e.g., contracts, service plans).
- For temporary importation:
  - The vessel must be used **solely for the purpose** for which the duty relief was granted.
- Upon expiration of the period:
  - The vessel must either:
    - Be **exported from Canada**,  
    - Be **removed beyond the territorial sea** (if conditionally exempted under the *Customs and Excise Offshore Application Act*),  
    - Be **released under Section 32 of the Customs Act**, or  
    - Be **authorized by the Minister** for repairs, overhauls, or adjustments in a Canadian facility.

> **Penalty Clause**: If the vessel is readmitted to Canada at any time outside of the approved period or under other regulations, **customs duty must be paid in full**, with **no deduction** for previously reduced or removed amounts.

### **6. Penalty for Breach of Conditions (Section 10)**

If any of the conditions in Sections 8, 9, or 10 are **not met**:

- For vessels qualifying under **Section 4 (duty reduction)**:
  - The duty reduction is reduced to the difference between:
    - Original duty, and  
    - Duty on **1/50 of the vessel’s duty value per month** during non-compliance.
- For vessels qualifying under **Section 5, 6, or 7 (duty removal)**:
  - The reduction is reduced to the difference between:
    - Original duty, and  
    - Duty on **1/100 of the vessel’s duty value per month** during non-compliance.

> This creates a financial penalty mechanism to enforce compliance.

#### a) **General Rule (Section 18)**  
Duty reduction or removal is granted for **Canadian-built or duty-paid vessels** returning to Canadian waters after repairs or modifications abroad — **except** if the vessel was exported specifically for repair/modification.

- If a vessel returns within **12 months** of repairs abroad (during operations), the duty reduction is:
  - Equal to the difference between:
    - Original duty, and  
    - The customs duty on **the value of the repairs** (calculated at the same rate as would apply to the vessel).

> This incentivizes cost-effective maintenance.

#### c) **Modifications Done Abroad (within 3 years)**  
- If a vessel returns within **3 years** of modifications abroad (during operations), the duty reduction is:
  - Equal to the difference between:
    - Original duty, and
