**1. Status of the Regulation**  
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed by **SOR/2014-275, section 111**, which is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the Government of Canada. This means the regulation no longer applies, and its provisions are no longer enforceable or legally binding.

**2. What SOR/2014-275 Is**  
SOR stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulation*. SOR/2014-275 is a regulatory document issued in 2014 that contains various amendments, additions, or repeals to existing laws or regulations. Section 111 of this instrument specifically targets the repeal of certain provisions.

**3. Purpose of the Repeal**  
While the original regulation (which is not provided in the text) may have addressed a specific area such as environmental protection, workplace safety, licensing, or public health, the repeal suggests that:
- The regulation was outdated,
- It was superseded by newer legislation or regulations,
- It was inconsistent with current policy or law,
- Or it was found to be redundant or unnecessary.

Repealing a regulation is a common administrative action to streamline laws, eliminate confusion, or align with updated legal or policy frameworks.

Any legal action, compliance requirement, or enforcement based on the repealed regulation is now invalid. Entities or individuals relying on it would need to refer to current, active regulations instead.

**5. Access to the Original Regulation**  
Since the regulation has been repealed, its original text is no longer active in the current legal framework. However, it may still be accessible in historical legal databases (e.g., Canada Gazette, legislation.gov.ca, or the Statutes of Canada) for reference or archival purposes.
