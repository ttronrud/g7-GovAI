**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on Public Inquiries into Objections to Proposed Incorporations, Continuances, and Amalgamations**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, issued under the authority of *His Excellency the Governor General in Council*, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **subsection 26(5) of the Insurance Companies Act**, establishes the procedural framework governing **public inquiries** into objections raised by parties against proposed incorporations, continuances, or amalgamations of insurance companies. These inquiries are conducted by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions (SFI)** to ensure transparency, fairness, and public interest in decisions affecting the insurance sector.

The regulation was originally enacted in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 47)** and was **repealed in part by SOR/98-534, s. 2**, though the core procedural elements remain relevant in the context of ongoing regulatory oversight. The current version reflects a streamlined, publicly accessible process for reviewing objections to insurance company proposals.

- **Application**: A formal submission made under sections 25, 32, or 250 of the Act, seeking incorporation, continuation, or amalgamation of an insurance company.
- **Inquiry**: A public hearing conducted under subsections 26(3), 33(1), or 250(3) of the Act to examine an objection to an application.
- **Objection**: A formal challenge to a proposed incorporation, continuation, or amalgamation.

These Rules apply specifically to **public inquiries** initiated under:
- Subsection 26(3): Objections to proposed incorporations

### **Initiation and Notice of Inquiry**

1. **Trigger for Inquiry**  
   The Superintendent may initiate an inquiry if they are satisfied that it is **necessary and in the public interest** to hold such a hearing.

2. **Timing of Notice**  
   At least **14 days before the scheduled inquiry**, the Superintendent must:
   - Publish a **notice of inquiry** in the *Canada Gazette* and in a **newspaper of general circulation** located at or near the head office of the proposed company.
   - Serve the parties (applicant and objector) with:
     - A notice of the inquiry
     - A copy of the objection
     - An invitation to attend the inquiry

3. **Content of the Notice**  
   The notice must clearly state:
   - The **date, time, and location** of the inquiry
   - The **purpose of the inquiry** and the **substance of the objection**
   - The name of the **presiding officer**
   - Any other information the Superintendent deems appropriate

### **Cancellation of Inquiry**

An inquiry may be **cancelled** under the following circumstances:
- The application is withdrawn
- The objection is withdrawn (or, if multiple objections exist, **all** objections are withdrawn)

Upon cancellation:
- The Superintendent must serve the parties with a **notice of cancellation**
- Publish the notice in the *Canada Gazette* (as per paragraph 4(1)(a))

> This ensures transparency and provides parties with timely notice of changes in the process.

### **Service of Documents**

Documents required under these rules may be served using one of the following methods:
1. **Personal delivery** to the party
2. **Registered or certified mail** to the party’s address for service
3. **Last known or usual address** if no current address is available
4. **Other method** as specified by the presiding officer

> The **address for service** is defined as:
> - For the **applicant**: The address listed in the application
> - For the **objector**: The address listed in the objection

This ensures that all parties receive all necessary documents in a timely and verifiable manner.

### **Role of the Presiding Officer**

- The Superintendent may **appoint a person** (e.g., a legal expert or independent official) to preside over the inquiry in place of the Superintendent themselves.
- The presiding officer has discretion to:
  - **Allow parties to call witnesses** (subject to relevance and procedural rules)
  - **Receive relevant information** (information that pertains to the inquiry)
  - **Refuse to receive information** that is not relevant to the inquiry

> This provides flexibility in managing the inquiry while maintaining procedural integrity and focus.

---

### **Submission and Participation Rights**

- **Written and Oral Submissions**:
  - Any party may submit **written submissions** and make **oral submissions** to the presiding officer during the inquiry.

- **Representation**:
  - A party may attend the inquiry **in person** or be represented by **legal counsel**.

- **Order of Submissions**:
  - The **objector** must make their submissions **first**.
  - After the objector has presented their case, the **applicant** may respond with rebuttals or supporting arguments.

> This procedural order ensures that the objection is thoroughly examined before the applicant has the opportunity to defend or clarify their position.

---

### **Public Access and Transparency**

- The inquiry is **open to the public**.
- The public may:
  - Attend the hearing
  - Observe proceedings
  - Engage with the process

> This promotes accountability and public confidence in the regulatory decision-making process.

---

### **Access to Objection and Supporting Documents**

- During a defined period:
  - **From the day the notice of inquiry is published in the Canada Gazette** until the day the **Minister issues (or declines to issue) the letters patent**, any person may:
    - **Examine** the objection
    - **Request a copy** of the objection and any documents submitted in support of or in opposition to it

- These requests must be made at:
  - The **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Ottawa**, or
  - The **location where the inquiry is being held**, during the inquiry period

> This ensures transparency and allows stakeholders, including the public, to review the basis of the objection and the supporting evidence.

---

### **Reporting and Distribution of Findings**

- After the inquiry concludes, the **Superintendent prepares a report** of the findings.
- The Superintendent must **immediately send a copy of the report** to the parties (both applicant and objector) **as soon as the Minister makes the report publicly available** under subsection 26(4) of the Act.

> This ensures that all parties receive the official outcome of the inquiry promptly and in a timely manner, supporting due process and legal clarity.

### **Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | Public access to inquiries, publication in *Canada Gazette*, and public availability of documents |
| **Fairness** | Structured order of submissions (objection first, then applicant response), right to representation |
| **Accountability** | Clear notice, cancellation procedures, and mandatory distribution of findings |
| **Public Interest** | Inquiries are only held when necessary and in the public interest |

### **Important Notes on Repeal**

- **Paragraphs 4(1)(a) and 4(2)** (relating to address for service) were **repealed by SOR/98-534, s. 4**.
- However, the **core procedural framework** (notice, service, submissions, public access, reporting) remains in force and continues to guide public inquiries.

> The repeal of specific administrative details does not invalidate the broader regulatory structure. The remaining provisions ensure that public inquiries are conducted fairly, transparently, and in accordance with the principles of good governance.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **clear, structured, and transparent process** for public inquiries into objections to insurance company proposals. It balances the need for regulatory oversight with the rights of applicants and objectors, while ensuring public access and accountability. By setting out detailed procedures for notice, service, participation, evidence, and reporting, the regulation strengthens the integrity of decisions related to the formation, continuation, or amalgamation of insurance companies in Canada.

It remains a vital tool for ensuring that proposed insurance companies meet regulatory standards, protect consumer interests, and operate in the public interest.
