**Detailed Summary of the Consumer Products Containing Lead Regulations (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67; Repealed SOR/2010-273)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Consumer Products Containing Lead Regulations* were introduced by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under **section 37a of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. These regulations establish specific limits on the amount of lead allowed in certain consumer products that may come into contact with a person’s mouth, particularly those used by children.

The regulations came into force on **November 2, 2018**, as noted in the note at the end of the document.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Accessible Part**  
   - Defined as any part of a product that a user may **touch, lick, mouth, or swallow** during normal or reasonably foreseeable use.  
   - This definition is critical because it determines which components are subject to lead limits. For example, a toy's surface, a child’s clothing, or a product’s handle may be considered accessible if they can be touched or ingested.

2. **Consumer Product Containing Lead**  
   A product containing lead is defined as any of the following, **except** where specifically excluded:

   - **Products that come into contact with the user’s mouth during normal use**, *except*:
     - Kitchen utensils (e.g., spoons, knives), which are exempt due to their functional and common use in food preparation.
     - Products covered under the *Glazed Ceramics and Glassware Regulations* (which have their own lead limits).

   - **Clothing or clothing accessories intended for children under 14 years of age**  
     (e.g., socks, hats, shoes, or accessories like buttons or zippers).

   - **Products intended for learning or play by children under 14 years of age**  
     (e.g., toys, puzzles, educational tools).

   - **Books or similar printed products intended for children under 14 years of age**, *except*:
     - If printed on paper or cardboard and bound using conventional methods (e.g., binding with glue or staples, not lead-based inks or materials).

   - **Products whose primary purpose is to facilitate relaxation, sleep, hygiene, carrying, or transportation of a child under four years of age**  
     (e.g., baby blankets, sleep sacks, diapers, strollers, baby carriers).

> **Note**: These exclusions ensure that essential or functional products—especially those used in daily household activities—are not unnecessarily restricted, while still protecting vulnerable populations like young children.

3. **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)**  
   - Refers to scientific standards established by the **OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)** in the document *OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice, No. 1 (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17)*.  
   - The English version was issued on **January 21, 1998**, and the French version on **March 6, 1998**.  
   - GLP ensures that testing for lead content is conducted in a **reproducible, transparent, and scientifically valid** manner, with proper documentation, controls, and quality assurance.

### **Lead Content Limitations**

#### **General Rule (Section 3):**
- **Each accessible part** of a consumer product containing lead must **not contain more than 90 mg/kg of lead** when tested in accordance with **good laboratory practices**.

> This means that if a child could potentially touch, lick, or swallow a part of a product (such as a toy’s surface or a child’s clothing), the lead content in that part must be ≤ 90 mg per kilogram (i.e., 0.09% by weight).

#### **Exceptions (Section 4):**
A product may contain **more than 90 mg/kg of lead** in an accessible part **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Lead is necessary to produce an essential characteristic** of the part.  
   - Example: Lead in a paint additive that provides UV resistance in a protective coating, or lead in a component that enables a specific electrical function in a device.

2. **No alternative part with less lead is available**.  
   - The manufacturer must demonstrate that there is no feasible, safe, or commercially viable substitute material that would achieve the same function without exceeding the lead limit.

3. **The part does not release more than 90 mg/kg of lead** when tested under good laboratory practices.  
   - This includes testing for **leaching or migration** of lead into the environment (e.g., through ingestion or contact with moisture).  
   - The product must not release lead into the user’s body via exposure or contact.

> This exception allows for limited use of lead in products where it is functionally essential and cannot be replaced, provided that the lead does not pose a health risk through exposure.

### **Repeal of Previous Regulations**

- The *Consumer Products Containing Lead (Contact with Mouth) Regulations* (SOR/2010-273) are **repealed** by these new regulations.  
- This indicates an update and modernization of Canada’s lead safety standards, aligning them with current scientific understanding and risk assessments.

---

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on:
> The **day in the sixth month after the month of publication** in *Canada Gazette, Part II*, that has the **same calendar date** as the publication date.  
> If no such day exists in that sixth month (e.g., if the publication date is June 15), then the regulations take effect on the **last day of that sixth month**.

**Example**:  
- If the regulations are published on **March 10, 2016**, then the effective date is **September 10, 2016** (sixth month after March = September).  
- If published on **May 31**, the effective date would be **November 30, 2016** (since November has 30 days, matching May 31).

However, the note at the end of the regulation states:  
> **[Note: Regulations in force November 2, 2018]**  
This suggests that the final effective date was **November 2, 2018**, which may reflect a correction or adjustment due to publication timing or administrative processes.

### **Purpose and Public Health Rationale**

- Lead is a **toxic heavy metal** that can cause serious health effects, especially in children.  
- Exposure through ingestion or skin contact can lead to neurological damage, developmental delays, behavioral issues, and cognitive impairment.
- The regulation targets **products most likely to expose children to lead**, such as toys, clothing, books, and items used in sleep or hygiene.
- By setting a strict **90 mg/kg limit**, the regulation aims to minimize exposure while allowing for reasonable technological or functional needs.

### **Key Implications for Industry and Consumers**

| Stakeholder | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Manufacturers** | Must ensure all accessible parts of products intended for children under 14 (especially under 4) meet the 90 mg/kg lead limit. Must conduct GLP-compliant testing. Must provide justification for any exceptions. |
| **Importers and Distributors** | Must verify compliance with these regulations before selling products in Canada. |
| **Retailers** | Should be aware of compliance requirements when stocking children’s products. |
| **Consumers** | Can have greater confidence that children’s products are safer, with reduced risk of lead exposure. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Consumer Products Containing Lead Regulations* represent a significant step in Canada’s effort to **protect children from lead exposure** through targeted product safety standards. By clearly defining which products are subject to lead limits, establishing a strict 90 mg/kg threshold, and allowing limited exceptions only under strict conditions, the regulations balance **public health safety** with **practical product design and manufacturing realities**.

These regulations are a key component of the broader **Canada Consumer Product Safety Act**, reflecting international best practices (such as OECD GLP standards) and aligning with global efforts to reduce toxic chemical exposure in consumer goods.
