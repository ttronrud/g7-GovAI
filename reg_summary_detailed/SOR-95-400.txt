### **Detailed Summary of the General Import Permit No. 20 – Wheat and Wheat Products and Barley and Barley Products**

This regulation is a **General Import Permit** issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** of Canada under the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, specifically on **August 3, 1995**. It authorizes the importation of certain **wheat and wheat products**, and **barley and barley products** into Canada, subject to specific conditions and limitations. The permit was originally issued to manage import access in response to supply constraints and was later **repealed in 1997** (SOR/97-47, s. 2), indicating it was a temporary measure.

## **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

- **Authority**: The permit is issued under:
  - **Section 6.2(1)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)*: This allows the Minister to determine an **import access quantity** (a cap on how much of a product can be imported during a given period).
  - **Section 8.3(2)** of the EIPA: This grants the Minister the power to issue **general import permits** when access is limited.

- **Background**:
  - Wheat and barley products were already included on the **Import Control List** (C.R.C., c. 604, SOR/89-251, 1989).
  - The Minister determined a **maximum import quantity** (import access quantity) for these goods based on supply, demand, and economic considerations.
  - The permit ensures that only a **limited amount** of these essential agricultural products can be imported during a 12-month period, preventing market saturation and protecting domestic producers.
