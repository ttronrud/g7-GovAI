**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Spotted Wolffish (Anarhichas minor) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk. The key provisions cited in the Order are:

- **Section 58(1) of SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29):** This section establishes that the critical habitat of a listed species is defined as the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of the species. The critical habitat must be identified and protected under the Act.

- **Section 58(4) and (5) of SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29):** These subsections authorize the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and regulate the critical habitat of a species listed as threatened under SARA. The Minister may issue an Order to formally define and designate the critical habitat, provided certain conditions are met.

- **Section 60 of SARA (S.C. 2015, c. 10):** This provision confirms that the recovery strategy for a species may be included in the *Species at Risk Public Registry* (a public database of species at risk and their recovery plans), and that such strategy may contain a scientifically determined description of the critical habitat.

**2. Species at Issue: Spotted Wolffish (Anarhichas minor)**

- The Spotted Wolffish is a marine fish species native to the North Atlantic, particularly found along the coasts of Canada, including the Atlantic provinces and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
- It is classified as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**, which includes species that are at risk of becoming extinct in the wild due to natural or human-induced factors.
- The species is considered vulnerable due to threats such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and climate change impacts.

---

**3. Critical Habitat Designation**

- The critical habitat for the Spotted Wolffish has been identified through a **formal recovery strategy** developed by scientific experts and environmental assessors.
- This recovery strategy has been **officially included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the scientific basis for the habitat designation.
- The Order formally **designates specific geographic areas** (as detailed in the annexed document) as the critical habitat for the Spotted Wolffish. These areas are those where the species currently relies on specific environmental conditions (e.g., rocky reef substrates, depth ranges, water temperature, and food availability) for survival and reproduction.

**4. Exclusion from Prohibited Areas**

- The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.
- Subsection 58(2)b prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas that are:
  - In a place where the species is not present or is not likely to be present,
  - Or where the designation would conflict with existing federal or provincial land use plans or other legal instruments.
- By confirming that the critical habitat is not in such a prohibited area, the Order ensures that the designation is legally valid and consistent with SARA’s requirements.

---

**5. Purpose and Legal Effect**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally recognize and protect the specific habitats essential for the survival and recovery of the Spotted Wolffish**.
- The designation serves as a legal tool to:
  - Prevent activities (such as development, mining, or fishing) that could degrade or destroy the critical habitat.
  - Require federal agencies to consult with the Minister before undertaking projects that may impact the habitat.
  - Promote recovery efforts by focusing conservation actions on the most biologically significant areas.
- The Order is binding and enforceable under SARA, and any federal activity that may affect the designated critical habitat must comply with the Act’s requirements, including environmental assessments and mitigation measures.

---

**6. Implementation and Effective Date**

- This Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- The registration process ensures that the Order is legally valid and accessible to stakeholders, including government departments, Indigenous communities, environmental organizations, and the public.
- Once in force, the critical habitat designation becomes a part of the legal framework for species protection and will be monitored and reviewed periodically, in accordance with SARA’s recovery and monitoring requirements.

---

**7. Significance and Broader Implications**

- This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the implementation of science-based recovery strategies.
- It strengthens the legal protection of marine ecosystems by identifying and protecting the specific environmental conditions required by the Spotted Wolffish.
- It also contributes to broader ecological resilience by preserving habitat integrity in marine environments, which can benefit other species that share similar habitats.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Spotted Wolffish (Anarhichas minor) Order*, issued on August 25, 2020, by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, is a legally binding designation under the *Species at Risk Act*. It formally identifies and protects the essential habitats required for the survival and recovery of this threatened marine species. The Order is grounded in a scientifically developed recovery strategy, complies with all legal requirements under SARA, and ensures that federal actions are aligned with the conservation of the species and its habitat. It represents a key step in the ongoing effort to reverse population declines and support the long-term survival of the Spotted Wolffish in Canadian waters.
