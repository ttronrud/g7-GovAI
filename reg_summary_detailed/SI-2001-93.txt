**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Reference:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)  
**Title:** Notification of Remittance of Accrued Interest Under the Financial Administration Act  

**Summary:**

This regulation establishes a formal decision by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (acting on behalf of the Government of Canada) to remit an amount of **$200,000 (two hundred thousand Canadian dollars)** to the Government of Jamaica. This sum represents **accrued interest** that has accumulated on a loan originally provided by the Government of Canada to the Government of Jamaica.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Legal Authority:**  
   The decision is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the power, in the public interest, to make financial adjustments—such as remitting or collecting amounts—related to loans or financial obligations between governments, particularly when such actions are in the public interest.

2. **Recommendation and Process:**  
   The decision follows a formal recommendation from two key governmental bodies:
   - The **Minister of Finance**  
   - The **Treasury Board**  
   This ensures that the financial decision is thoroughly reviewed and aligned with fiscal policy, budgetary considerations, and broader economic interests.

3. **Nature of the Transaction:**  
   - The original transaction involved a **loan made by the Government of Canada to the Government of Jamaica**.  
   - Over time, interest has accrued on this loan, and the amount of **$200,000** is the total interest that has become due and owing to Canada.  
   - The regulation specifically states that this amount is being **remitted to the Government of Jamaica**, which may indicate a correction or adjustment in the financial relationship, possibly due to a reassessment of interest calculations, timing, or bilateral agreement.

4. **Public Interest Justification:**  
   The Governor General in Council has determined that the remittance is in the **public interest**. This implies that the action serves broader objectives such as:
   - Maintaining good bilateral relations between Canada and Jamaica
   - Ensuring transparency and accountability in financial dealings
   - Promoting stability and trust in international financial commitments
   - Aligning with Canada’s broader foreign policy or development objectives

5. **Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
   - The regulation serves as a formal, legally binding instrument under Canadian law, confirming the transfer of funds.
   - It reflects Canada’s role as a creditor in international financial relationships and demonstrates its capacity to manage and adjust such obligations in accordance with established legal frameworks.

6. **Historical Context (Implied):**  
   This regulation was enacted in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 24), indicating that the original loan and interest accrual likely occurred in an earlier period. The timing suggests it may be part of a long-standing financial arrangement between the two nations, possibly related to development assistance, infrastructure projects, or economic cooperation.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a formal, legally authorized transfer of $200,000 in accrued interest from the Government of Canada to the Government of Jamaica. It is grounded in the Financial Administration Act and executed through a structured process involving financial and policy oversight. The action underscores Canada’s commitment to transparent, accountable, and interest-based financial relationships with other nations, particularly in the context of public interest and international cooperation.

**Note:**  
It is important to clarify that the direction of the interest payment—remitted *to* Jamaica—may seem counterintuitive if one assumes interest is owed by the borrower to the lender. However, the regulation explicitly states that the interest is "owing to the Government of Canada," suggesting that Canada is the lender and the interest is due *to* Canada. Therefore, the phrasing in the regulation may contain a misstatement or typographical error. A more accurate interpretation would be:  
> "The Government of Canada is owed $200,000 in accrued interest on a loan made to Jamaica, and this amount is being remitted to Jamaica."  
This would imply that Canada is paying back interest, which is inconsistent with the stated "owing to the Government of Canada."

**Critical Correction and Interpretation:**  
Given the statement: *"representing accrued interest owing to the Government of Canada on a loan made to the Government of Jamaica"*, the correct interpretation is that **Canada is owed** the $200,000 interest. Therefore, the regulation must be read as a **remittance of $200,000 from Canada to Jamaica**—which contradicts the phrase "owing to Canada."

This suggests a **likely error in the original text or translation**. The correct reading should be:

> "The Government of Canada has remitted to the Government of Jamaica the amount of $0.2 million, representing accrued interest *owed by the Government of Jamaica to the Government of Canada*."

Alternatively, if the interest is being *paid by Canada*, then the wording should reflect that Canada is *paying* interest, not receiving it.

**Final Interpretive Summary (Corrected):**  
The regulation appears to contain a **textual error**. Based on the structure and logic, it is most likely that the intended meaning is:

> The Government of Canada is remitting $200,000 to the Government of Jamaica, representing **accrued interest owed by Jamaica to Canada** on a prior loan.  
> This action is authorized under subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act, in the public interest, following recommendations from the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board.

Thus, the regulation is a formal, legally valid financial adjustment involving the repayment of interest on a Canadian loan to Jamaica—**not** a remittance of interest to Canada, but rather a **payment of interest by Canada to Jamaica**, which would only make sense if the interest was due by Jamaica to Canada. This suggests a possible misstatement in the original text.

**Conclusion (Final):**  
Despite the apparent inconsistency in phrasing, the regulation is a formal, legally sound decision to **remit $200,000 to Jamaica** as part of a financial obligation arising from a Canadian loan. It reflects Canada’s financial responsibility and the public interest in managing international financial relationships with transparency and accountability. The text likely contains a typographical or interpretive error and should be corrected to reflect that Canada is remitting interest due from Jamaica.
