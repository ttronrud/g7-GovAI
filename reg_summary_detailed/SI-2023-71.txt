#### **4. Rationale and Strategic Intent**
The transfer reflects a shift in how federal policy on homelessness is being managed:
- **Integration with Infrastructure and Communities**:  
  The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is better positioned to coordinate homelessness policy with broader infrastructure investments (e.g., affordable housing, transportation, community development), urban planning, and regional development initiatives.
  
- **Improved Cross-Departmental Coordination**:  
  By placing homelessness policy under a minister with responsibility for infrastructure and community services, the government aims to ensure that housing and homelessness solutions are aligned with physical and social infrastructure development.

- **Alignment with National Priorities**:  
  This realignment supports Canada’s broader goals of building inclusive, resilient, and accessible communities through integrated planning and investment.

#### **5. Implications**
- **Policy Continuity**:  
  The core homelessness policy and programs are not discontinued; they are simply reorganized under a new ministerial portfolio to enhance implementation and accountability.

- **Interdepartmental Collaboration**:  
  The new minister will work closely with other departments (e.g., Health, Indigenous Services, Finance) to ensure that homelessness policy is effectively integrated into broader social and economic planning.

- **Accountability and Oversight**:  
  The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities will now be responsible for the performance, reporting, and strategic direction of the Homelessness Policy Directorate.

#### **6. Legal and Procedural Compliance**
- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reallocation of public service functions based on government policy and administrative needs.
- The process follows standard public service governance procedures, including ministerial recommendation and formal approval by the Governor General in Council.
- The transfer is consistent with the principles of transparency, accountability, and efficiency in public administration.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation marks a significant administrative reorganization within the federal government’s approach to homelessness policy. By transferring the Homelessness Policy Directorate from the Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, the government aims to embed homelessness policy within a more holistic framework of community development, infrastructure investment, and urban planning. The move strengthens interdepartmental coordination and ensures that housing and homelessness solutions are developed in tandem with broader economic and social infrastructure goals.
