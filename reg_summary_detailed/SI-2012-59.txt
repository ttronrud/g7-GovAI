### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision to Shared Services Canada**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement Act").
- The specific statutory provision cited is **Section 207 of the Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207).
- The regulation is also referenced under the *Regulations of the Public Service (R.S., c. P-34)*, which provides the broader framework for public service restructuring and duty transfers.

#### **2. Subject Matter of the Transfer**
- The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of a specific component within the federal public administration:
  - **Branch**: Acquisitions Branch of the Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS).
  - **Specific Directorate**: The *Information Technology Shared Services Procurement Directorate* (ITS SPD).
- This transfer involves not just administrative oversight but also the **management, policy direction, and operational control** of the Directorate’s functions.

#### **3. Purpose of the Transfer**
- The transfer is part of a broader **public service restructuring initiative** aimed at:
  - Improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness in federal procurement.
  - Centralizing and standardizing information technology (IT) procurement processes across government.
  - Enhancing accountability and service delivery through shared services models.
- By moving the IT procurement function to **Shared Services Canada (SSC)**, the federal government seeks to:
  - Reduce duplication and fragmentation in IT procurement.
  - Leverage economies of scale through centralized procurement.
  - Ensure consistent standards, compliance, and oversight in IT spending.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The regulation **comes into force on the day that Section 711 of the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act (JGLTPA)** comes into force.
- Section 711 of the JGLTPA was enacted as part of **Bill C-19, introduced in 2012** (S.C. 2012, c. 19).
- This provision was designed to implement key elements of the federal government’s strategy to modernize public service operations and promote shared services.
- Therefore, the transfer of control to Shared Services Canada became effective on the date that Section 711 of the JGLTPA was activated — a date determined by the government’s legislative schedule.

#### **5. Implications and Significance**
- **Structural Change**: This marks a significant shift in the organizational structure of the federal public service, moving IT procurement from a departmental function (DPWGS) to a centralized, cross-departmental shared services entity (SSC).
- **Accountability and Oversight**: Shared Services Canada, as a dedicated federal agency, is better equipped to provide standardized, transparent, and auditable procurement processes for IT services.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination**: The transfer facilitates greater coordination among federal departments in IT procurement, reducing inefficiencies and improving access to reliable, cost-effective technology solutions.
- **Alignment with Government Modernization Goals**: This action supports broader federal goals related to digital transformation, service delivery, and fiscal responsibility.

#### **6. Context and Background**
- The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* enables the reorganization of public service functions to improve performance, reduce costs, and align with modern governance needs.
- The move reflects a trend in Canadian federal policy toward **centralization of core service functions** (e.g., procurement, human resources, IT) to enhance efficiency and scalability.
- Shared Services Canada, established as a key agency in the federal public service, is tasked with managing shared services across departments, including procurement, finance, and IT.

### **Conclusion**
