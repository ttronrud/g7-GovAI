**Detailed Summary of the Softwood Lumber Products Export Allocations Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
These regulations are issued under the authority of two primary pieces of Canadian legislation:

- **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)** – Specifically, **paragraphs 12(a) to (b)a**, which empower the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to establish export allocation rules for certain goods.
- **Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006** – Specifically, **Section 108**, which authorizes the Minister to set rules governing the allocation of export quotas for softwood lumber products.

This regulatory framework was enacted on **October 12, 2006**, and is part of **S.C. 2006, c. 13**, Section 115.

---

### **2. Scope of the Regulations**
The regulations apply specifically to **softwood lumber products**, defined as goods listed under **item 5104 of Group 5** in the **Export Control List**. This includes various types of unprocessed or minimally processed softwood lumber (e.g., logs, sawn timber, beams, planks) that are subject to export controls due to economic, environmental, or trade policy considerations.

---

### **3. Application Process: Requirements for Exporters and Agents**

To apply for an **export allocation** (a quota allowing a specified volume of softwood lumber to be exported), an exporter—or their agent or mandatary—must submit the following information to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by a sworn statement confirming that all information is **true, correct, and complete**:

#### Required Information:
- **Name and address** of the exporter; and, if applicable, the agent or mandatary.
- The **official language** (English or French) preferred for all future communications with the exporter.
- Whether the exporter and/or agent/mandatary are **residents of Canada**.
- **Additional information** necessary for the Minister to assess the considerations outlined in **paragraphs 4(b) and (c)** of the Act.

> *Note:* The Minister may request further clarification or supporting documents at any time. The applicant must provide such information promptly upon request.

#### Key Requirement for Non-Canadian Residents:
- If the **exporter is not a resident of Canada**, the application **must be submitted by a Canadian-resident agent or mandatary**.

### **4. Considerations in Granting Export Allocations**

When determining whether to issue an export allocation, the Minister must consider the following factors:

1. **Compliance with Information Requirements**  
   The Minister must verify that the exporter (or agent) has fully and accurately provided all required information as per these regulations.

2. **Compliance History (Past 12 Months)**  
   The Minister must assess whether the exporter has:
   - Complied with the provisions of the **Export and Import Permits Act** or any regulations made under it;
   - Met all conditions attached to any prior **export allocation or export permit** issued within the **12-month period preceding** the month for which the new allocation is being requested.

3. **Fraud or Misrepresentation**  
   The Minister must evaluate whether the exporter has:
   - Provided **false or misleading information** in any official report required under:
     - The Act;
     - Regulations made under the Act; or
     - Any condition of a prior export allocation or permit — again, within the 12-month period before the application.

> *This establishes a strict accountability framework, emphasizing transparency and integrity in export operations.*

---

### **5. Duty to Report Non-Compliance**

An **export allocation holder** has a legal obligation to **report promptly** to the Minister when:

- They become aware that:
  - **They themselves** are likely to fail to comply with the requirements of these regulations; or
  - **Any other person** (e.g., a subcontractor, agent, or supplier) involved in the export process is likely to fail to comply with the terms of the allocation or the regulations.

This reporting requirement ensures ongoing oversight and helps prevent violations or fraud from going undetected.

### **6. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- These regulations **came into force on October 12, 2006**.
- They are enforceable under the legal framework of the Export and Import Permits Act and the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006.
- The regulations are designed to ensure **fair, transparent, and accountable** allocation of export quotas for softwood lumber, particularly in the context of managing Canada’s softwood lumber exports, which are subject to international pricing and market dynamics.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Market Stability** – To prevent over-exportation and maintain a stable supply of softwood lumber in domestic and international markets.
2. **Economic Protection** – To protect Canadian domestic industries by ensuring that export volumes do not undermine domestic availability.
