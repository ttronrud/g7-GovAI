Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which provides the legal framework for the inclusion of certain land areas within land grants, particularly in relation to shoreline boundaries.

**2. Scope of the Regulation**  
The regulation expands the scope of a land grant by including specific shoreline areas adjacent to Great Slave Lake in the **Northwest Territories**.

**3. Specific Land Area Included**  
The regulation specifies that **any portion of the lands described in the schedule attached to this regulation**—which is not fully detailed in the excerpt—must be included in the grant **if such portions lie within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of **Great Slave Lake**.

- The **ordinary high water mark** is the standard reference point used in land surveys and legal descriptions to define the boundary between land and water, particularly for purposes of land ownership, access, and jurisdiction.
- This 100-foot buffer zone is significant because it establishes a legal boundary for land rights that extends from the water’s edge to the shore, often protecting access or ownership interests for Indigenous communities or land users.

**4. Specific Property Mentioned**  
In addition to the general shoreline inclusion, the regulation explicitly refers to the following property:

- **Lots 137 and 149**, and  
- **A road**,  
all located within the **Community of Fort Resolution**, in the **Northwest Territories**.

These lots and the road are defined by reference to a **plan of survey of record number 82896**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**. A copy of this plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories at Yellowknife** under reference number **3446**.

This means that the legal description and boundaries of these lots and the road are officially documented and recognized in the public land records of the Northwest Territories.

**5. Purpose and Implications**  
- The inclusion of the 100-foot shoreline zone suggests a recognition of **traditional use, access rights, or land tenure interests**—particularly relevant in Indigenous communities near lakes and water bodies.
- It may also support **community development, environmental protection, or access to natural resources** by clearly defining land ownership or use rights along the shoreline.
- The regulation strengthens the legal clarity of land boundaries, especially in areas where water levels fluctuate, and ensures that land grants include areas of practical and cultural importance.

**6. Key Legal and Administrative Notes**  
- The regulation is binding and enforceable under Territorial Lands Act provisions.
- The inclusion of the shoreline area is not automatic—it is explicitly tied to the description in the schedule and the requirement that the land be within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark.
- The reference to the survey plan and filing in the Land Titles Office ensures that the land description is publicly accessible and verifiable.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation formally extends a land grant to include a 100-foot (30.48 metres) strip of shoreline along Great Slave Lake, specifically for lands described in an attached schedule. It also confirms the legal status and boundaries of Lots 137, 149, and a road in Fort Resolution, Northwest Territories, based on an officially recorded survey plan. The regulation reflects a legal and administrative effort to clarify land rights, particularly in relation to water boundaries, and supports the recognition of land use and access in Indigenous communities.
