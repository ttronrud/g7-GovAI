## ✅ Core Requirements for Disclosure of Securities

### 1. **Mandatory Prospectus Disclosure**
Before distributing securities, a federal credit union **must prepare and provide a prospectus** containing specific information.

#### Required Content in the Prospectus (as per column 2 of the Schedule for the Relevant Jurisdiction):
- The prospectus must include all **information required under applicable provincial or federal securities legislation** (as listed in the schedule).
- The disclosure must:
  - Be in **clear, simple language**.
  - Be **non-misleading**.
  - Be in the **form required** by the relevant jurisdictional legislation.

> 🔍 *Note:* The regulation references a "schedule" with jurisdictional columns (e.g., federal vs. provincial), implying that the specific list of required disclosures may vary depending on where the credit union operates or which legislation applies (e.g., provincial securities laws).

### 2. **Additional Compliance Requirements**
Beyond the base disclosure requirements:
- Any **additional requirements** in the applicable legislation (e.g., specific reporting, audit standards, or disclosures) must also be met.
- If a federal credit union is **exempt** from prospectus requirements under:
  - Federal legislation (e.g., the Bank Act), or  
  - A provincial regulator,
  → Then it is **also exempt** from the prospectus requirements under these regulations.

> ⚠️ *Exception:* Even if exempted from prospectus requirements under section 3 of the Bank Act, a federal credit union **must still comply with sections 5 to 9** when distributing securities to individual members — **except** for:

---

### 📌 Required Statements and Information (on the first page or prominently displayed):

1. **Government Independence Statement**  
   > “No official of the Government of Canada has considered the merits of the matters addressed in this disclosure.”

   > “The agreement is not binding on the member if the federal credit union receives written notice of the member’s intention not to be bound by the agreement not later than the second business day after the day on which the federal credit union provided the information.”  
   → Gives members a **cooling-off period** of two business days to withdraw from the agreement without penalty.
