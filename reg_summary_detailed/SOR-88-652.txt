**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Authorization Order, 1988-2"**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically:

- **Section 101(6)** of the Financial Administration Act: This provision grants the Governor in Council (the federal government's executive authority) the power to authorize certain corporations—such as Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)—to incorporate new entities and to hold or acquire shares in those entities, provided that the Governor is satisfied that such actions are in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the Act.

- **Paragraphs 101(1)(a) and (b)** of the Financial Administration Act: These provide the foundational legal powers for the Governor in Council to make orders authorizing a corporation to:
  - Procure the incorporation of a new corporation;
  - Hold, acquire, or manage shares in that corporation.

This Order is therefore a formal exercise of delegated governmental authority, enabling AECL to act in a corporate capacity to establish and invest in new entities.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **authorize Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)** to:

- **Incorporate a new corporation** (i.e., create a new legal entity), where:
  - All shares of the newly incorporated company will be **held by, on behalf of, or in trust for AECL**.

- **Acquire shares** in an existing or newly incorporated corporation, where:
  - The acquired shares will also be **held by, on behalf of, or in trust for AECL**.

This authorization allows AECL to strategically expand its corporate structure to support its mandate in nuclear energy research, development, and technology, including the design, construction, and operation of nuclear facilities.

### **3. Scope and Application**

- **Scope of Authorization**: The Order grants AECL broad authority to:
  - Establish new corporations (incorporation);
  - Purchase or acquire ownership interests (shares) in such corporations.

- **Ownership and Control**: Upon incorporation or acquisition, the shares are not held directly by AECL in a private capacity, but rather:
  - **On behalf of AECL** (meaning AECL is the legal representative or agent);
  - **In trust for AECL** (meaning the shares are held under a fiduciary obligation to AECL, ensuring that they are managed solely for AECL’s benefit and in accordance with its objectives).

This structure ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with corporate governance and financial administration standards.

### **4. Regulatory Context and Background**

- **Historical Precedent**: The Order references prior legislative provisions (e.g., S.C. 1974–76, c. 33(E); S.C. 1978–79, c. 9, ss. 1(F), 57), indicating that this type of authorization has been used previously in the context of nuclear energy development and corporate structuring.

- **Government Oversight**: The Order is made **on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Treasury Board**, emphasizing that such decisions are not made unilaterally but are subject to interdepartmental review and policy alignment.
