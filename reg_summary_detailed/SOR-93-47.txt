### **Overview**

The *Adjudication Division Rules*, approved on **February 1, 1993**, govern the procedures and practices of the **Adjudication Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)** in Canada. These rules were enacted under the authority of **subsection 65(1) of the Immigration Act**, based on a recommendation by the Minister of Employment and Immigration and approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council.

The rules establish a comprehensive, fair, and efficient framework for conducting hearings in immigration and refugee matters, including the procedures for initiating inquiries, holding hearings, managing evidence, handling witnesses, scheduling conferences, and ensuring access to justice for all parties involved.

These rules may be cited as the **Adjudication Division Rules** and are designed to ensure that proceedings are conducted in a manner that is **transparent, timely, and respectful of the rights of individuals** involved in immigration and refugee determinations.
