### 🔹 **7. Credit Periods and Benefit Calculation (Old Age Benefits)**

This section establishes how **contribution periods** from both countries are credited toward old age benefits.

#### 📌 **Credit Rules for Old Age Benefit (Canada and Italy)**

| Scenario | How It Counts |
|--------|----------------|
| A week ending on or before December 31, 1965 | Treated as a **week of residence** under Canadian OASA |
| A year from January 1, 1966 onward | A year with CPP contributions = **52 weeks of contribution** under Italian law |
| A year with no CPP contribution but an equivalent period credited | One week in that equivalent period = one week of contribution under Italian law |
| A week from January 1, 1966 onward with no CPP contribution | Treated as a week of contribution under Italian law |
