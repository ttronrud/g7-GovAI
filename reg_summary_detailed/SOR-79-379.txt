The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The referenced regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Notice**: It was repealed under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument (regulation) published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on June 15, 2017.
- **Purpose of the Repeal**: The repeal means that the specific regulation in question no longer exists or is no longer in force. It was likely replaced by a new regulation or deemed unnecessary, outdated, or inconsistent with current policy or legislation.
- **Repetition**: The repeated line "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggests that this information was copied multiple times—possibly due to a formatting or data entry error—rather than indicating multiple distinct regulations.

### Interpretation:
There is **no active, enforceable regulation** present in the provided text. The content only serves as a notice of repeal. Therefore, **no detailed policy, rules, or provisions** are contained in the original regulation because it has been officially removed from the legal framework.

### Implication:
- Any legal or operational obligations previously derived from this regulation are now **void**.
- Legal or compliance personnel should refer to current, active regulations for relevant requirements, as this one is no longer applicable.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does **not** represent an active regulation. It is a notice of repeal, indicating that the regulation was formally removed from force on or around June 15, 2017, under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. As such, **no detailed summary of its content or provisions is possible**, because the regulation itself no longer exists.

> ✅ Recommendation: To find the current applicable regulation, consult the official *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Codes* database (e.g., through the Government of Canada’s legislation website) and search for SOR/2017-84 or related amendments.
