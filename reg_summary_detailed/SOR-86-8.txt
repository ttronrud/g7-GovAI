### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Quota Regulations, 1986**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The **Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Quota Regulations, 1986** are a set of regulatory rules established under the **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (the "Act")** and the **Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation (C.R.C., c. 646)**. These regulations were enacted to implement a marketing plan for eggs in Canada, ensuring fair and orderly distribution in both **interprovincial and export markets**.

- The **Governor in Council** created the **Canadian Egg Marketing Agency (Agency)** in 1970 through the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation, giving it authority to manage the marketing of eggs.
- The Agency is empowered to implement a marketing plan under the Act, and these Quota Regulations are part of that plan.
- The proposed regulations fall under **paragraph 7(1)(d)** of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act, which allows for the creation of regulations to support marketing plans, and were approved by the **National Farm Products Marketing Council** on **December 13, 1985**, based on their determination that the regulations are necessary for effective implementation.

Thus, the regulations are officially made by the Agency under:
- **Paragraph 23(1)(f)** of the Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (authorization to make regulations);
- **Subsection 2(1) of Part II of the Schedule to the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation** (procedural authority).

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Establish and administer quotas** for egg producers regarding the number of dozens of eggs they may market in **interprovincial and export trade**.
- Ensure that egg supply is managed in a way that prevents market oversaturation, maintains stable prices, and supports domestic producers.
- Provide a structured framework for allocating quotas among producers based on provincial production levels and market needs.

> **Note**: The regulations do **not apply** to eggs placed in an incubator for hatching.

#### **5. Conditions for Marketing Eggs**

A producer **must meet all of the following conditions** to market eggs in interprovincial or export trade:

1. **Quota Allocation**: The producer must have been allotted a **federal quota**, **special temporary market requirement quota**, or **vaccine quota** by the **Commodity Board** of the province where their production facilities are located.

2. **Quota Compliance**: The number of eggs marketed must **not exceed** the allocated quota.

3. **Compliance with Commodity Board Rules**: The producer must comply with any existing rules adopted by the Commodity Board that the Agency has authorized under **subsection 22(3) of the Act**.

4. **Special Temporary Market Requirement Quota Requirements**:
   - Eggs must be sold to a processor at a price **not less than** the price of equivalent eggs sold under the Agency’s **Industrial Products Program**.
   - The sale must occur under a **contract approved by the Agency**.

5. **Vaccine Quota Requirements**:
   - Eggs must be sold to a vaccine manufacturer at a price **not less than** that of equivalent eggs under the Industrial Products Program.
   - The sale must occur under a **contract approved by the Agency**.
   - The producer must hold a **seller’s licence**, and the vaccine manufacturer must hold a **buyer’s licence** issued under the *Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations, 1987*.

> ⚠️ These conditions do **not apply** to eggs marketed under **quota exemptions** (as specified in subsection 7(2)).

#### **6. Eligibility for Federal Quota Allocation**

A producer is **only eligible** for a federal quota if:

- **Before the coming into force** of these regulations:
  - The producer had a **provincial quota** allocated by their provincial Commodity Board.
  - The producer was previously entitled to a federal quota under the **old Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Quota Regulations (C.R.C., c. 656)**.

> **After** the regulations come into force:
- A producer becomes eligible for a federal quota **only if** they are allotted a **provincial quota** by their provincial Commodity Board.

This ensures continuity and prevents new producers from gaining federal market access without a prior provincial commitment.

---

#### **7. Allocation of Federal Quotas**

The **total number of dozens of eggs** a producer may market under a federal quota during the period in **Schedule 1** is calculated as:

> **Federal Quota = Provincial Quota – (Eggs marketed in intraprovincial trade)**

This means that the federal quota is **deducted by the amount of eggs already sold within the province**.

---

#### **8. Total Quota Limits by Province**

The Commodity Board of each province must ensure that, during the period in **Schedule 1**, the **sum of the following three components** does **not exceed** the total allowed in column 2 of that schedule:

1. **Federal quota sales** (eggs marketed in interprovincial/export trade)
2. **Provincial quota sales** (eggs marketed within the province)
3. **Quota exemptions** (eggs marketed under special exemptions)

> **Quota exemptions include**:
- Eggs from flocks below the minimum size specified by the provincial Commodity Board.
- Hatching eggs authorized for human consumption.
- Eggs marketed by organizations granted exemptions by the Commodity Board.

This ensures that **total egg output** (both marketed and exempted) remains within provincial production capacity.

---

#### **9. Allocation of Special Temporary Market Requirement Quotas**

The Commodity Board must allocate special temporary market requirement quotas so that, during the period in **Schedule 1.1**, the sum of:

1. Eggs marketed under special temporary quotas
2. Eggs marketed under equivalent intraprovincial quotas

**does not exceed** the total allowed in column 2 of Schedule 1.1.

> Purpose: To meet **temporary market demands** (e.g., during seasonal spikes or supply shortages) without exceeding overall provincial capacity.

---

#### **10. Allocation of Vaccine Quotas**

The Commodity Board must allocate vaccine quotas so that, during the period in **Schedule 2**, the sum of:

1. Eggs marketed under vaccine quotas
2. Eggs marketed under equivalent intraprovincial quotas

**does not exceed** the total allowed in column 2 of Schedule 2.

> Purpose: To ensure that vaccine manufacturers have access to eggs for production, while protecting against over-supply.
