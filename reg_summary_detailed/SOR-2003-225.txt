---

### **Overview**

The *Saskatchewan Canola Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### **1. Definitions**
The Order begins with clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act of the Province of Saskatchewan*. This provides the legal foundation and authority for the Commission’s operations.
- **Canola**: Defined as canola, rapeseed, or oilseed of the genus *Brassica* that is produced in Saskatchewan. This broad definition ensures that all relevant oilseed crops grown in the province fall under the scope of the Order.
- **Commission**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission* (SCDC), a statutory body established to promote and manage the canola industry.
- **Plan**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Canola Development Plan Regulations*, which are made under the *Agri-Food Act*. These regulations outline strategic goals, objectives, and operational frameworks for the development of the canola sector.

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in how the Order is interpreted and applied.

#### **2. Regulatory Authority of the Commission**

The Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission is granted specific regulatory powers over the **marketing of canola in interprovincial and export trade**. This includes:

- The ability to exercise **all or any powers** similar to those it has under the *Agri-Food Act* and the *Canola Development Plan* when managing local canola marketing within Saskatchewan.

This provision effectively extends the Commission’s regulatory reach beyond domestic markets to cover trade outside the province and international sales, ensuring consistency in standards, pricing, and market practices.

---

#### **3. Levies and Charges**

The Commission has the authority to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on individuals and entities involved in the **production or marketing of canola**.
- **Classify persons into different groups** (e.g., by size of operation, type of activity, or level of involvement).
- **Set different levies or charges** for members of each group, allowing for a tiered and equitable system based on capacity or contribution.

This flexibility enables the Commission to tailor financial obligations to different segments of the industry, promoting fairness and economic efficiency.

---

#### **4. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial stability during market downturns),
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of canola,
- **Equalization or adjustment** of income among canola producers during any period the Commission determines.

This last point is particularly significant: it allows the Commission to **distribute financial benefits or compensate producers** when market conditions result in uneven returns (e.g., poor prices during a downturn). This mechanism helps to stabilize incomes and reduce economic volatility for farmers and producers.

---

#### **5. Repeal Clause**

The Order includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that this document supersedes or replaces any prior regulations or orders that may have governed canola marketing in Saskatchewan. This ensures that the current regulatory framework is up-to-date and aligned with the Commission’s strategic goals.

---

#### **6. Coming Into Force**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Saskatchewan Gazette*). This ensures immediate applicability once it is formally adopted by the government.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Saskatchewan Canola Order are:

1. **Stabilize the canola market** by regulating interprovincial and export trade.
2. **Support producer income** through mechanisms like equalization and loss compensation.
3. **Ensure fair and transparent financial practices** through the imposition of structured levies.
4. **Promote long-term development** of the canola industry in alignment with the broader *Saskatchewan Canola Development Plan*.
5. **Provide financial resilience** through reserve creation and operational funding.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

- This Order strengthens the role of the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission as a central body for managing the economic and market dynamics of the canola sector.
- It provides a mechanism for **risk-sharing** between producers, especially in volatile global commodity markets.
- It supports **farmer stability** by protecting against price fluctuations and ensuring that producers are not disproportionately affected by market downturns.
- It enables the Commission to act as a **market stabilizer and financial intermediary**, contributing to the overall competitiveness of Saskatchewan’s canola exports.

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is enacted under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which grants the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food the authority to make orders regulating the marketing of agricultural products—specifically canola—in Saskatchewan.

This legislative foundation ensures that the Order is both legally sound and aligned with broader agricultural policy objectives.

### **Conclusion**

The *Saskatchewan Canola Order* is a comprehensive regulatory tool that empowers the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of canola. By establishing a framework for levies, equitable income distribution, and financial reserves, the Order enhances market stability, supports producer livelihoods, and promotes the long-term sustainability of Saskatchewan’s vital canola industry.

It reflects a balanced approach—combining market regulation with producer protection—making it a cornerstone of agricultural policy in the province.
