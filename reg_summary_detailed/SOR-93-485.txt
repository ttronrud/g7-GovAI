**Regulatory Citation:**  
S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6  
Official Title: *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Criminal Record Verification for Civil Purposes Fee Regulations*

**Enactment Authority:**  
These regulations were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Treasury Board. This authority is derived from **paragraph 19(1)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the government to establish fees for administrative services, including those related to financial and record-keeping functions.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a standardized, transparent, and publicly accessible fee for individuals who request a criminal record verification from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for **civil purposes**. Civil purposes include, but are not limited to, applications for employment, licensing, visas, insurance, or other personal or professional matters where a criminal background check is required by law or policy.

**Key Provision:**  
The regulation specifies that the **fee to be paid by an individual** for the verification of a criminal record by the RCMP for civil purposes is **$25**.

**Scope of Application:**  
- Applies to all individuals seeking a criminal record check from the RCMP for **civil purposes**.  
- The verification must be conducted through the RCMP’s official channels and must be processed in accordance with the RCMP’s established procedures.  
- The $25 fee is a one-time charge and is not subject to variation based on the individual’s age, location, or type of request, as long as the request falls under civil use.  
- The fee covers the administrative and processing costs associated with retrieving and verifying the individual’s criminal record, including access to official databases and record review.

**Exemptions and Exceptions:**  
The regulation does not explicitly list exemptions. However, under broader Canadian administrative principles and related legislation (e.g., the *Criminal Records Act* and *Privacy Act*), certain individuals may be exempt from fees, such as:  
- Children under a certain age (e.g., minors in specific government programs),  
- Individuals applying for public office or government employment under specific statutory exemptions,  
- Requests made by federally recognized Indigenous communities or organizations under specific programs.  
These exceptions would typically be governed by other legislation or policy and are not part of this specific fee regulation.

**Funding and Administration:**  
- The fee is collected directly by the RCMP upon request and is used to cover the administrative and operational costs of processing the verification request.  
- The fee is not refundable, regardless of whether the record is found to contain criminal convictions or not.  
- The RCMP is responsible for ensuring the fee is collected fairly and transparently, with clear communication to applicants about the cost and process.

**Public Accessibility and Transparency:**  
- The regulation is publicly available and accessible through official government sources, including the Government of Canada’s website and the RCMP’s official publications.  
- The fee is clearly stated to ensure transparency and to prevent misunderstandings or disputes regarding the cost of a criminal record check.

**Legal and Policy Context:**  
- This regulation aligns with broader government efforts to standardize administrative fees and ensure fiscal accountability.  
- It reflects the principle of charging reasonable fees for services that involve administrative costs, while maintaining access to vital information for civil applications.  
- It operates within the framework of privacy and access to information laws, ensuring that the fee does not compromise an individual’s right to know their own criminal record.

**Effective Date and Repeal Status:**  
- The regulations came into force on the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette* (as part of S.C. 1991, c. 24).  
- As of the current date (2024), these regulations remain in force unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation.  
- No amendments have been publicly announced to date, though periodic reviews may occur to reflect changes in administrative costs or policy.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Criminal Record Verification for Civil Purposes Fee Regulations* establishes a clear, uniform, and publicly known fee of **$25** for individuals seeking a criminal record verification from the RCMP for civil purposes. It ensures transparency, accountability, and financial sustainability in the administration of criminal record checks, while maintaining compliance with federal financial administration standards. The regulation remains a key component of Canada’s administrative framework for managing public services related to personal record verification.
