## 🎯 Purpose of the Order

1. **Fix Fees** for various regulatory actions, including:
   - Examination of new drug submissions (human/veterinary)
   - Supplements to new/abbreviated drug submissions
   - Establishment licence applications
   - Drug identification number (DIN) applications
   - Veterinary health product notifications
   - Preclinical submissions and experimental studies
   - Biocide market authorization applications
   - Medical device licence applications

3. **Exclude Certain Applications** from fees:
   - Publicly funded health care institutions
   - Government branches or provincial agencies
   - Extraordinary use new drug submissions (e.g., public health emergencies)

---

## 🚫 Exclusions (Fees Do Not Apply)

- **Publicly funded health care institutions** (e.g., hospitals, clinics funded by federal/provincial governments)
- **Government branches or provincial agencies**
- **Drugs under extraordinary use new drug submissions** (e.g., emergency drugs under section C.08.002.01)

> *Note: These exclusions ensure that public health services are not burdened by regulatory fees.*

---

## 💰 Fee Adjustment Mechanism (Inflation-Based)

Starting **April 1, 2021**, all fees are **adjusted annually** on April 1 based on inflation:

### Formula:
> New Fee = (Old Fee) × (1 + CPI change over previous 12 months)  
> → Rounded **up to the nearest dollar**

Where:
- **CPI** = April All-items Consumer Price Index for Canada (published by Statistics Canada under the *Statistics Act*)
- The change is calculated over the **previous fiscal year** (April 1 to March 31)

> Example: If the CPI increased by 3.2%, the fee increases by 3.2%.

> Applies to fees in **Divisions 1 to 5 of Part 2** and **Division 1 of Part 3** of the Order (i.e., most drug and device submissions).

---

## 📄 Fee Structure (Schedule 1)

The fee amounts are detailed in **Schedule 1**, organized by **submission class** (e.g., new drug, supplement, abbreviated submission) and **fiscal year**.

### Two Scenarios:
1. **Fees in listed fiscal years (columns 3–6 of Schedule 1)** → Use the fee amount specified in that column.
2. **Fees in other fiscal years** → Calculate using the inflation formula in subsection 4(2).

> The fee is **paid by the person who files the submission**.

---

## 📝 Payment Timeline (Preliminary Examination)

| Scenario | Payment Trigger |
|--------|----------------|
| **Preliminary examination conducted** | - Full fee paid upon receipt of notice that the submission is **complete and accepted**<br>- 10% fee paid if submission is found to be **incomplete** |
| **No preliminary examination** | Full fee paid upon receipt of notice that the submission has been **received** |

> ⚠️ **Important**: If the Minister issues a notice in the **following fiscal year**, the fee is still based on the **fiscal year in which the submission was filed**.

---

## 🚀 Deferred Payment for Co-Submitted Applications

If a person files:
- A **submission** (e.g., new drug) **and simultaneously** applies for authorization under **section C.07.003** of the *Food and Drug Regulations*,

Then **fee payment is deferred** until:
- A **notice of compliance** is issued under section C.08.004, **or**
- A **drug identification number (DIN)** is assigned under subsection C.01.014.2(1)

> This avoids double charging for overlapping processes.

---

## 🎁 Fee Remissions (Reduced or Full Exemptions)

### 1. **Remission for Small Business Applicants**

Subject to **section 18**, remission is granted if:

---
