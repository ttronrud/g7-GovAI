### **Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### 1. **Entry into Force of the 2002 Canada–Italy Double Taxation Convention**

- The **Convention between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Italian Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion**, signed on **June 3, 2002**, in Ottawa, has officially come into force on **November 25, 2011**.
- This convention is formally set out in **Schedule 7** of the *Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2002*.
- The 2002 treaty supersedes the earlier treaty and includes updated provisions to address modern tax issues such as digital services, intellectual property, and the prevention of tax evasion.

> **Purpose**: To eliminate double taxation of income earned by individuals and businesses in Canada and Italy, and to promote tax compliance and fairness by preventing tax avoidance.

#### 2. **Termination of the 1977 Canada–Italy Convention and Its 1989 Protocol**

- The **original Convention between Canada and Italy for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and for the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion**, signed on **November 17, 1977**, in Toronto, **ceases to have effect**.
- This termination is carried out in accordance with **Article 28** of the 1977 Convention, which provides for the automatic termination of the treaty upon the entry into force of a newer, more comprehensive agreement.
- The **1989 Protocol** modifying the 1977 Convention is also terminated as part of this process.

> **Reason for Termination**: The 1977 treaty and its 1989 amendment are outdated and no longer aligned with current international tax standards or the more comprehensive framework of the 2002 agreement.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Effective Date of Change**: All tax treatment for individuals and entities operating in both Canada and Italy will now be governed by the **2002 Canada–Italy Double Taxation Convention**, effective from **November 25, 2011**.

  - Dividends, interest, and royalties
  - Capital gains
  - Tax credits and exemptions
  - Residency and source of income
- **Fiscal Evasion Prevention**: The 2002 treaty includes stronger mechanisms to prevent tax evasion, such as enhanced information exchange and rules on tax residency and beneficial ownership.
