**Detailed Summary of the *New Classes of Practitioners Regulations* (S.C. 1996, c. 19)**

---

### **Overview**

The *New Classes of Practitioners Regulations*, made under subsection 55(1) of the *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* (CDSA), extend the legal authority of certain health professionals to prescribe and possess specific controlled substances. These regulations establish that **midwives, nurse practitioners, and podiatrists**—when registered and practicing under provincial laws—may prescribe or possess certain "listed substances" under specific conditions, provided they are authorized to do so in their province of practice.

This regulation is a significant expansion of prescribing rights for non-physician health professionals, aligning with broader efforts to improve access to care, promote patient safety, and support the roles of advanced practice professionals in Canada’s healthcare system.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **1. Definitions**

The regulations define three key classes of practitioners:

- **Midwife**  
  A person who is:
  - Registered and legally entitled to practice midwifery under provincial law;
  - Practicing midwifery in that province.  
  *(Note: This definition aligns with the legal framework of midwifery in each province.)*

- **Nurse Practitioner**  
  A person who is:
  - Registered and entitled to practice as a nurse practitioner or an equivalent designation;
  - Practicing in that role in the province.  
  For a designation to be considered "equivalent," it must meet the following criteria:
  - Be a registered nurse;
  - Have additional education and clinical experience relevant to healthcare;
  - Be able to autonomously:
    - Make diagnoses;
    - Order and interpret diagnostic tests;
    - Prescribe medications;
    - Perform specific medical procedures;
  - Practice in accordance with provincial laws such as:
    - Manitoba: *Extended Practice Regulation* (Reg. 43/2005) under the *Registered Nurses Act*;
    - Ontario: *Regulation 275/94* under the *Nursing Act, 1991*;
    - Quebec: *Regulation respecting classes of specialities* under the *Nurses Act* (R.R.Q., c. I-8, r. 8).

- **Podiatrist**  
  A person who is:
  - Registered and entitled to practice podiatry or chiropody under provincial law;
  - Practicing in that province.

> These definitions clarify who qualifies as a "practitioner" under the CDSA for the purposes of prescribing controlled substances.

#### **2. Scope of Prescribing Authority**

Under **subsection 2(1)** of the CDSA, the following classes of practitioners are explicitly recognized as "practitioners":

- Midwives  
- Nurse practitioners  
- Podiatrists  

**Key Principle**:  
A midwife, nurse practitioner, or podiatrist may prescribe or possess a *listed substance*, or conduct activities involving such substances, **if they are permitted to prescribe that substance under provincial law** in the province where they are registered and practicing.

This means that prescribing authority is **not granted universally**, but is **limited to substances that are legally authorized** in the province where the practitioner operates.

---

#### **3. Exclusions from Prescribing Authority**

Certain substances are **excluded** from the prescribing rights of these practitioners, depending on the professional:

##### **For Midwives and Podiatrists**:
The following substances are **excluded** from their prescribing authority:
- Any substance designated as a "designated drug" under **subsection G.04.001(1)** of the *Food and Drug Regulations*;
- Item 1 of **Part III of the schedule to Part G of the Food and Drug Regulations**;
- Any of the following subitems in the schedule to the *Narcotic Control Regulations*:
  - Subitem 1(1) and (10)
  - Subitem 2(1)
  - Subitem 5(4)
  - Subitem 10(1)

> These exclusions reflect the fact that certain high-risk or strictly regulated substances (e.g., narcotics, psychotropic drugs) are not authorized for prescribing by midwives or podiatrists.

##### **For Nurse Practitioners**:
The following substances are excluded:
- Item 1 of Part III of the schedule to Part G of the *Food and Drug Regulations*, **except subitem (40)**;
- Subitem 1(1) or 2(1) of the schedule to the *Narcotic Control Regulations*.

> This exclusion means that nurse practitioners **cannot prescribe certain narcotics or controlled substances**, even though they may have broader prescribing authority in other areas. However, **subitem (40)** in Part III of Part G is an exception—indicating that some specific substances may still be accessible to nurse practitioners.

> The exclusion of narcotics (e.g., oxycodone, morphine) underscores the continued regulatory caution around opioid prescribing.

---

#### **4. Conflict Resolution: Precedence of These Regulations**

In the event of **any inconsistency** between these *New Classes of Practitioners Regulations* and:
- The *Benzodiazepines and Other Targeted Substances Regulations*,
- Part G of the *Food and Drug Regulations*, or
- The *Narcotic Control Regulations*,

**these Regulations prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.

> This provision ensures that the expanded prescribing rights of midwives, nurse practitioners, and podiatrists are not undermined by more restrictive provisions in other regulations. It gives priority to the specific intent of allowing these practitioners to prescribe under provincial frameworks.

---

#### **5. Transitional Provisions**

- The regulations **come into force on the day they are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.
- For the purposes of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, the regulations **apply before publication** in the Canada Gazette.

> This means that the rules are effective immediately upon issuance, even before being formally published—ensuring continuity and legal certainty for practitioners and patients.

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Expanded Access to Care** | Allows midwives and nurse practitioners to prescribe medications in settings such as maternal health, chronic disease management, and primary care, improving access and reducing patient burden. |
| **Provincial Autonomy** | Prescribing authority is tied to provincial laws, ensuring that each province maintains control over the scope of practice for its health professionals. |
| **Safety and Oversight** | Exclusions for high-risk substances (especially narcotics and benzodiazepines) protect public health by limiting access to substances with potential for abuse or dependency. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Clearly defines who qualifies as a practitioner and what substances they may prescribe, reducing ambiguity in practice. |
| **Alignment with National Policy** | Reflects Canada’s shift toward value-based healthcare and the integration of advanced practice providers into primary care. |

### **Background and Context**

- The regulation was introduced in **1996** (S.C. 1996, c. 19), and has been **reaffirmed and updated** over time, with the version in force as of **November 21, 2012**.
- It is part of a broader legislative trend to **expand prescribing rights** for non-physician professionals, including nurse practitioners and midwives, in response to evolving healthcare needs.
- The *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act* governs the regulation of controlled substances in Canada, and this regulation modifies its scope to include these new practitioner classes.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *New Classes of Practitioners Regulations* represent a landmark development in Canadian healthcare policy. By legally recognizing midwives, nurse practitioners, and podiatrists as authorized practitioners under the CDSA, the regulations:

- Empower health professionals to prescribe certain substances in their areas of expertise;
- Improve access to timely and appropriate care;
- Maintain strict safeguards through exclusion of high-risk substances;
- Respect provincial jurisdiction over professional practice.

These regulations are a balanced approach that promotes patient-centered care while upholding public safety and regulatory integrity.

**Note**: While the regulation was originally issued in 1996, it has been updated and remains in force as of November 21, 2012, with continued relevance in the current healthcare landscape. Future amendments may further refine prescribing authority based on emerging evidence and public health needs.
