The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-319, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Notice**: It was repealed by **Statutory Instrument No. 2016-319**, under **section 1** of that instrument.
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such repeals typically take effect upon the publication of the statutory instrument in the *Canada Gazette* and are generally effective from the date of publication, which in this case would be **April 15, 2016** (the date of publication of SOR/2016-319).
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it no longer has any legal force or effect. Any provisions, requirements, or obligations previously established by it are no longer enforceable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred due to:
  - The regulation being outdated or superseded by newer legislation.
  - A consolidation of regulations to streamline the legal framework.
  - A change in policy or administrative structure.
  - The regulation being redundant or overlapping with other existing rules.

### Key Observations:
- The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2016-319, s. 1]") suggest that the regulation may have been referenced multiple times in a document or database, but the status of each instance remains the same: **repealed**.
- SOR/2016-319 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued by the Government of Canada, typically used to amend or repeal existing regulations under a federal statute.
- Section 1 of SOR/2016-319 specifically contains the repeal provisions — likely listing one or more regulations that are being removed from force.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text is **no longer in effect**. It was formally **repealed on or around April 15, 2016**, by **SOR/2016-319, section 1**. As such, it should not be cited or applied in any legal, administrative, or operational context. Any prior application of this regulation is invalid.
