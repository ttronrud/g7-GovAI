**Detailed Summary of the St. Leonard Airport Zoning Regulations (1993)**

---

### **Overview**

The *St. Leonard Airport Zoning Regulations* are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically pursuant to **Section 5.4** (regulatory authority) and **Section 5.5** (public notice and opportunity for comment). These regulations define spatial limits and restrictions on land use around St. Leonard Airport in the County of Madawaska, Province of New Brunswick, to ensure aviation safety, prevent interference with aircraft operations, and maintain clear airspace and approach paths.

The regulations were **published in multiple official and regional media** (Canada Gazette Part I, Telegraph Journal, Le Madawaska) between March 6 and April 7, 1993, to allow for public consultation and stakeholder input before final adoption. After receiving feedback, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally enacted the regulations.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key geographical and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to St. Leonard Airport, located in the County of Madawaska, New Brunswick. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for measuring distances and elevations. It is located at coordinates: **North 873,700.71 m, East 198,925.79 m** (New Brunswick Stereographic Double Projection Grid). |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 18–36), designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility and safe descent paths during landing. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the airport reference point (ARP), with a minimum elevation of 9 meters above ground level where the surface would otherwise be below that height. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, including the runway. For runway 18–36, it is **300 meters wide** (150 m on each side of the centerline) and **1,950 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes that extend from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface. These provide a buffer zone between the runway and the outer surface. |

---

### **Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point is 234 meters above sea level**.
- All height restrictions and surface definitions are based on this reference point.

---

### **Applicable Land**

The regulations apply to all land — including public road allowances — that falls within the following zones:

1. **Within the outer limit** described in **Part VI of the schedule**.
2. **Directly beneath any portion of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limit.

> This means that the zoning rules cover not only the immediate airport perimeter but also areas directly below the approach paths of aircraft.

---

### **Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:

- **Erect, construct, or expand** any building, structure, or object (including natural growths) on land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

  - The **approach surfaces**  
  - The **outer surface**  
  - The **transitional surfaces**

> This ensures that no structure — whether man-made or natural — will interfere with aircraft navigation, visibility, or landing approaches.

---

### **Prohibition of Interference with Aeronautics**

No owner or lessee may:

- Use or develop land in a way that **interferes with signals, communications, or services** used by aircraft or aeronautical facilities (e.g., radar, radio beacons, ground control).

> This includes blocking or reflecting radio waves or obstructing line-of-sight communication between aircraft and air traffic control.

---

### **Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the landowner or lessee to:

- **Remove or trim** the excessive growth to comply with the height limits.

> This provision ensures that natural elements do not become hazards to flight operations.

### **Geographic and Technical Descriptions**

#### 1. **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located by measuring:
  - **915 meters** along the centerline of runway 18–36 from the **northerly end of runway 18**
  - Then **150 meters eastward**, at right angles to the runway centerline
- Final coordinates: **North 873,700.71 m, East 198,925.79 m**

#### 2. **Approach Surfaces**
- Two inclined planes, one for each end of runway 18–36:
  - **Ratio**: 1 meter vertically to 50 meters horizontally (1:50 slope)
  - **Rise to a horizontal line** 15,000 meters horizontally from the end of the strip
  - **Width of the horizontal line**: 2,400 meters from the runway centerline
  - **Elevation of the horizontal line**: 300 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip
- **Exception**: Any portion of the approach surface lying within the **United States of America** is **excluded** from these restrictions.

#### 3. **Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 234 m + 45 m = 279 m above sea level)
- **Exception**: Where this plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is instead located at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe ground-level constraints.

#### 4. **Strip (Runway 18–36)**
- **Length**: 1,950 meters
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline)
- This is the active area for takeoff and landing.

#### 5. **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical for every 7 meters horizontal)
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces**
- Rise upward until they intersect with the **outer surface**
- Ensures a gradual transition from the runway edge to the outer surface, minimizing abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction.

#### 6. **Outer Limit**
- A **circular boundary** with a **radius of 4,000 meters**, centered at the Airport Reference Point (ARP)
- Defines the maximum extent of regulated land

> All land within this circle — and land directly beneath the approach surfaces beyond this circle — is subject to the height and interference restrictions.

### **Legal Authority and Process**

- **Authority**: Enacted under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to make regulations governing airport zoning.
- **Notice and Consultation**: Published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** (March 6 and 13, 1993), and in regional newspapers (Telegraph Journal, Le Madawaska), giving interested parties a **reasonable opportunity to submit representations**.
- **Final Adoption**: Approved by the Governor General in Council, following the Minister’s recommendation.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear flight paths and approach zones.
2. **Prevent visual and signal interference** with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
3. **Protect critical aeronautical infrastructure** (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation aids) from physical or electromagnetic obstruction.
4. **Provide a legally enforceable framework** for land use around the airport, balancing public development with aviation needs.

---

### **Key Implications for Landowners and Developers**

- **Strict height controls**: Any structure (buildings, towers, trees) must not exceed the defined surfaces.
- **Ongoing compliance obligations**: Landowners must monitor natural growth and comply with removal requirements.
- **Prohibition on signal interference**: Even non-physical development (e.g., placing antennas, reflective surfaces) is restricted.
- **Regulatory enforcement**: The Minister of Transport has the authority to enforce compliance and issue removal orders.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *St. Leonard Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around a key regional airport. By defining precise elevation limits, approach surfaces, and buffer zones, the regulations protect aviation safety and operational integrity. They represent a balanced approach to land development, ensuring that growth and community needs do not compromise flight safety.

These regulations remain in force as a foundational element of aviation safety in New Brunswick and serve as a model for similar airport zoning initiatives across Canada.
