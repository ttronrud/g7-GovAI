**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
*Energy Administration Act Sections 53 to 65 Non-application Order, 1986*

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 52(1.1)** of the *Energy Administration Act*. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources) to make orders that modify or limit the application of specific sections of the Act.

**Date of Issuance and Effective Date:**  
- **Issued:** November 1, 1986  
- **Effective Date:** November 1, 1986  

**Regulatory Text:**  
The Order declares that **Sections 53 to 65 of the Energy Administration Act are non-applicable** in respect of **any "producer-province"** of Canada.

**Key Provisions and Interpretation:**

1. **Definition of "Producer-Province":**  
   While not explicitly defined in this Order, the term "producer-province" refers to provinces that are known to produce significant quantities of energy resources—particularly oil, natural gas, or other energy commodities—such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Newfoundland and Labrador. These provinces are considered central to Canada’s energy production and are often subject to special regulatory treatment under federal energy legislation.

2. **Scope of Non-Application:**  
   - Sections 53 to 65 of the *Energy Administration Act* are **exempted** from application in any producer-province.  
   - This means that the federal government, through the Act, **does not impose or enforce** the requirements, obligations, or administrative procedures outlined in those sections within the jurisdiction of a producer-province.

3. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   The primary objective appears to be **regulatory flexibility** for energy-producing provinces. By excluding these sections, the federal government acknowledges the unique economic and operational realities of energy-producing provinces, which may have different regulatory needs or governance structures. It may also aim to:  
   - Reduce administrative burden on provinces with significant energy production.  
   - Allow provincial governments greater autonomy in managing energy resources.  
   - Prevent duplication or conflict between federal and provincial energy regulations.

4. **Legal Citation and Reference:**  
   - The Order is cited as **S.C. 1986, c. 39, s. 5**, referencing the Statutes of Canada 1986, Chapter 39.  
   - It is also referenced under earlier legislative provisions: *S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 114, s. 2*, indicating its alignment with broader legislative frameworks or amendments to the Energy Administration Act.

5. **Legal Effect and Duration:**  
   - The Order is **effective immediately upon issuance** (November 1, 1986) and remains in force unless revoked or amended by subsequent legislation.  
   - It is a **temporary or specific exemption**, not a permanent repeal of the sections. The sections themselves remain part of the Act but are simply **not triggered or enforceable** in producer-provinces.

6. **Implications:**  
   - Energy producers operating in these provinces (e.g., oil and gas companies) are **not subject to federal oversight or compliance requirements** under Sections 53 to 65.  
   - Provinces retain jurisdiction over energy regulation within their boundaries, consistent with the principle of provincial responsibility in energy matters.  
   - This Order reflects a **federal-provincial balance** in energy governance, recognizing that energy production is a key provincial economic activity.

**Conclusion:**  
This 1986 Order serves as a targeted regulatory exemption, removing federal application of specific provisions of the *Energy Administration Act*—Sections 53 to 65—within provinces known for energy production. It promotes provincial autonomy in energy policy and operational management, while maintaining the federal framework of the Act for other jurisdictions or non-producing provinces. The Order remains a foundational piece of regulatory history in Canada’s energy governance structure, illustrating how federal legislation can be adapted to accommodate regional economic realities.
