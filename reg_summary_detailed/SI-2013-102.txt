### 🔹 **5. Key Geographic and Administrative Rules in the Descriptions**

To ensure consistency and clarity in the boundary definitions, the proclamation includes the following **guidelines**:

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **"Road, street, hill, cove, etc."** | Refers to the **centre line** of the feature unless otherwise specified. |
| **Territorial divisions** | Boundaries are based on the **January 1, 2011** municipal limits (i.e., prior to any municipal reorganizations). |
| **Translation standards** | "Street" is translated according to **Treasury Board standards** (official, formal). All other public thoroughfares use **commonly used terms** (not officially recognized). |
| **Coordinates** | All geographic coordinates are in **NAD 83**, the standard reference system used in Canada for mapping. |
| **Population data** | All population figures are derived from the **2011 Canadian Census**. |

> 💡 This ensures that the boundaries are **precise, legally binding, and consistent** with national standards for land and population measurement.

### 🔹 **6. Purpose and Significance of the Redistricting**

- The redistricting was driven by **population growth and shifts** observed between 2001 and 2011.
- The goal is to ensure **equal representation** in Parliament — each riding should have roughly the same number of residents.
- In Newfoundland and Labrador, the population distribution was uneven, with some areas growing rapidly (e.g., Gander, St. John’s), while others remained relatively stable.
- The new boundaries **rebalance representation** across regions to reflect current demographics.

2. **September 27, 2013** – The **Governor in Council** issues the proclamation (P.C. 2013-963), declaring the order **in force**.
3. **Effective date** – The boundaries become legally binding **on the first dissolution of Parliament at least seven months after September 27, 2013**.
4. **First possible effective date** – The next federal election after this period would be **December 17, 2014** (if called), or later, depending on political developments.

> 📅 *This timeline reflects a standard practice in Canada to allow time for public consultation, voter education, and administrative adjustment.*

### 🔹 **8. Legal and Political Implications**
