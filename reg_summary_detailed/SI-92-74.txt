Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, presented in clear, accessible language while preserving all legal and technical elements.

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Issuing Authority**
- **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, has issued this regulation.
- This action is grounded in **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which grants the authority to withdraw certain lands from disposal for specific purposes.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective is to **facilitate the settlement of Indigenous land claims**, specifically those related to the **Gwich’in people** and the **Mackenzie Delta region** in the Northwest Territories (NWT).  
By withdrawing specific parcels of land from disposal, the government ensures that these lands are reserved for:
- Indigenous land rights and title claims,
- Future negotiations and settlements,
- Environmental protection,
- Site-specific development planning (e.g., infrastructure or energy projects).

---

#### **3. Scope of Land Withdrawal**
The regulation orders the **withdrawal of certain lands** from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or development) under the following conditions:

##### **a. Lands Described in the Schedule**
- The withdrawal applies to all lands listed in the **schedule attached to the regulation**.
- These lands are located in the **Northwest Territories**.

##### **b. Exclusions from Withdrawal**
Despite the general withdrawal, the following types of rights and interests are **exempted** and remain unaffected:
1. **Located or recorded mineral claims or prospecting permits** in good standing under the **Canada Mining Regulations**.
2. **Rights in good standing** established under:
   - Section 8 of the **Territorial Lands Act** or the **Territorial Lands Regulations**.
3. **Rights to obtain a surface lease** on mineral claims, under the same provisions as above.
4. **Permits, special renewal permits, and leases** in good standing under the **Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations**.
5. **Permits in good standing** under the **Territorial Quarrying Regulations**.
6. **Existing rights and interests** granted under:
   - The **Canada Petroleum Resources Act**.
   - The **Territorial Coal Regulations**.
   - The **Territorial Dredging Regulations**.
   - The **Forest Management Act (Northwest Territories)**.
7. **Interests in lands described in "Exhibit 2"** to the **Acquisition Agreement dated May 5, 1988**, among:
   - Her Majesty in right of Canada,
   - The Northern Canada Power Commission,
   - The Government of the Northwest Territories,
   - The Northwest Territories Power Corporation.

> ⚠️ *Note:* These exemptions ensure that existing legal rights (such as mineral exploration rights or surface lease rights) are preserved and not disrupted by the withdrawal.

---

#### **4. Specific Land Designations (Mackenzie Delta and Gwich’in Claim)**
The regulation specifically applies to lands designated as:
- **"RURAL LANDS"**
- **"AREAS FOR SITE SPECIFIC SELECTION"**
- **"MACKENZIE DELTA SUBSURFACE WITHDRAWAL AREA"**

These designations are **based on maps** available at the **Office of the Regional Manager, Land Resources Division, Yellowknife, NWT**, specifically:
- **National Topographic Series (NTS) Maps**

These maps serve as the official reference for identifying the exact geographic boundaries of the withdrawn areas.

---

#### **5. Time Limit for Withdrawal**
The withdrawal is effective **until one of the following dates occurs, whichever comes first**:
- **September 30, 1993**, or  
- The **date on which settlement legislation implementing the Gwich’in Agreement is enacted**.

> This time limit ensures that the withdrawal is temporary and tied to the implementation of a formal agreement between the Government of Canada and the Gwich’in people. If settlement legislation is passed before September 30, 1993, the withdrawal will end on that date. Otherwise, it remains in effect until 1993.

---

#### **6. Saving, Exempting, and Reserving Provisions**
The regulation explicitly **saves, excepts, and reserves** any tract of territorial land that:
- Is subject to a **lease or agreement for sale** under the **Territorial Lands Act** or the **Territorial Lands Regulations**.

> This means that if any land in the withdrawn area already has a valid lease or sale agreement in place, that agreement remains in full force and effect, and the land is not subject to the withdrawal.

---

#### **7. Key Implications**
- **Indigenous Land Rights**: The regulation supports the resolution of long-standing Indigenous land claims, particularly the Gwich’in claim, which is central to the Mackenzie Delta region.
- **Environmental and Cultural Protection**: The withdrawal helps protect ecologically sensitive areas and culturally significant lands.
- **Development Restrictions**: No new development (such as mining, drilling, or construction) can proceed on the withdrawn lands without a formal agreement or exception.
- **Legal Clarity**: By clearly defining which rights are preserved and which are withdrawn, the regulation provides legal certainty for Indigenous groups, developers, and government agencies.

---

#### **8. Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**
- **Territorial Lands Act, paragraph 23(a)**: Provides the statutory authority for land withdrawal.
- **Canada Mining Regulations**: Governs mineral claims and prospecting.
- **Territorial Lands Regulations**: Supports land rights and surface use.
- **Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations**: Applies to oil and gas exploration rights.
- **Forest Management Act (NWT)**: Covers timber rights.
- **Gwich’in Agreement**: A key Indigenous land and resource agreement (later implemented through legislation) that may end the withdrawal period.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **critical step in the process of Indigenous land claim settlement** in the Northwest Territories. It formally withdraws large tracts of land—especially in the Mackenzie Delta—from disposal to support the resolution of the Gwich’in claim and to protect Indigenous rights, environmental values, and future development planning. While it broadly restricts land use, it preserves existing rights and ensures that the withdrawal is temporary and tied to the finalization of a formal settlement agreement.

It reflects a balance between:
- **Indigenous self-determination and land rights**,  
- **Government land management**, and  
- **Environmental and economic considerations**.

---

### **Key Takeaways (Bullet Points)**
- Withdrawal of lands in the Mackenzie Delta and Gwich’in Claim area.
- Excludes mineral claims, surface leases, and existing rights in good standing.
- Effective until September 30, 1993 or the Gwich’in Agreement settlement legislation, whichever comes first.
- Based on NTS maps and specific land designations.
- Preserves existing leases and agreements for sale.
- Supports Indigenous land claim settlement and environmental protection.
