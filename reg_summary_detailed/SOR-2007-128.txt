### **Detailed Summary of the *Cargo, Fumigation and Tackle Regulations* (S.C. 2005, c. 29, s. 16(1))**

These regulations are made under the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (the "Act") by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. They provide comprehensive rules governing the **safe loading, carrying, stowing, unloading, and handling of cargo**, particularly **bulk cargo**, **dangerous goods**, and **packaged goods**, on **Canadian vessels** and **foreign vessels in Canadian waters**.

The regulations are structured into several key divisions, each addressing specific types of cargo and operational requirements. Below is a detailed and organized summary of the key provisions, definitions, and application criteria.

## **I. Scope and Application**

### **1. Applicability**
- **Applies to:**
  - All **Canadian vessels** **everywhere**.
  - **Foreign vessels** in **Canadian waters**.

  - **Pleasure craft** (non-commercial vessels).
  - **Fisheries vessels** used for catching, harvesting, or transporting fish or marine resources **unless**:
    - The vessel is **24 meters or longer**, and
    - Its sole activity is related to the catch or harvest of other vessels or aquaculture facilities.
  - Vessels engaged in **oil or gas drilling, production, conservation, or processing** — these are excluded from the scope.

> ⚠️ *Note: The regulations do not apply to vessels involved in oil/gas operations or pleasure craft, emphasizing focus on commercial cargo transport.*

> ✅ **Note:** For documents incorporated by reference (except CAN/CSA S826.1-01), "should" is interpreted as "shall" — meaning **mandatory compliance**.

> ✅ **"Administration"** in referenced documents:
> - For **Canadian vessels** → Minister of Transport
> - For **foreign vessels** → Government of the flag state

> ✅ All references to documents are to the **latest amended version** unless otherwise specified.

## **III. General Requirements for Cargo Loading and Carrying (Division 1)**

### **1. Mass Marking Requirement**
- **No package or object** with a **gross mass of 1 tonne or more** may be loaded on a vessel in Canadian waters **unless**:
  - Its gross mass is **clearly and durably marked** on the outside.
- If exact mass is impractical, an **approximate mass** may be marked with the word **“approximate”** or **“approximatif”**.
- Applies to:
  - **Authorized representatives**
  - **Vessel masters**
  - **Agents responsible for loading**

> 📌 *Purpose: Prevents misloading due to unmarked heavy cargo, reducing risk of structural failure or accidents.*

---

## **IV. SOLAS Compliance for General Cargo (Division 2)**

This section applies to **all cargo except bulk or dangerous goods**.

### **Key Requirements:**
| Regulation | Requirement |
|---------|------------|
| **Regulation 2 (Chapter VI, SOLAS)** | Every shipper must comply with SOLAS Chapter VI, Regulation 2 — safe loading and stowage. |
| **Regulations 5.2 & 5.5 (Chapter VI, SOLAS)** | Every person packing cargo must comply with these rules — including proper labeling, packaging, and securing. |
| **Regulation 5.1, 5.3, 5.4 (Chapter VI, SOLAS)** | Master must ensure these are met — covering cargo stowage, securing, and stability. |
| **Regulation 5.6 (Chapter VI, SOLAS)** | Master must keep a **Cargo Securing Manual** on board unless: |
> - Vessel is a Canadian vessel on a **sheltered waters voyage** or **near coastal voyage, Class 2**; or  
> - Vessel is engaged on an **inland voyage**.  

> 🔍 **Approval of Cargo Securing Manual:**  
> - The Minister may approve a manual if it meets or exceeds the **standard in the Annex to Appendix 2 of the CSS Code** (Code of Safe Practice for Cargo Stowage and Securing).

## **V. Solid Bulk Cargo (Division 3)**

This division governs the **safe handling of solid bulk cargo** (e.g., iron ore, coal, cement), excluding grain.

### **Applicable Rules:**
- Master must ensure compliance with:
  1. **Regulation 3.1 of Chapter VI of SOLAS**
  2. **Part B of Chapter VI of SOLAS** (excluding terminal representative requirements)
  3. **IMSBC Code** (subject to Section 117)

  - The master has **comprehensive information** on:
    - Effects of solid bulk cargo on vessel stability
    - Distribution of cargo to avoid over-stressing the vessel's structure under standard loading conditions
