### **Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Trust and Loan Companies Act (TLC Act)**:

- **Section 459a** – Authority to make regulations relating to activities involving information technology.
- **Section 531b** – Power to regulate certain business activities, particularly those involving financial services and information systems.

The regulations were enacted under the authority of:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 550** and **s. 569** (provisions authorizing the regulation of IT-related activities),
- **S.C. 1991, c. 45** (the original framework of the TLC Act).

These regulations provide a **framework for trust and loan companies** (including their subsidiaries) to engage in **information technology (IT) activities** that are materially related to the provision of financial products or services — while imposing **strict limits on ownership and investment** in such entities to ensure financial stability and regulatory oversight.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The following definitions apply throughout the regulations:

- **"Act"**  
  Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which forms the legal basis for these rules.

- **"Balance sheet value"**  
  Means the value of shares and ownership interests reported on an entity’s **unconsolidated balance sheet**.  
  → This is a critical metric used to determine thresholds for investment limits.

- **"Member of a company’s group"**  
  Defined as per **subsection 449(2)** of the Act.  
  → This refers to companies that are part of the same corporate group (e.g., parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entities), and is used to assess consolidated exposure.

> ⚠️ *Note: "Book value" was previously used but has been repealed by SOR/2008-168, s. 29.*

#### **3. Permitted IT Activities (Section 1)**

A trust or loan company may engage in the following **IT-related activities**, provided they are **materially related** to the provision of financial products or services:

- Developing, designing, holding, managing, manufacturing, selling, or otherwise dealing with:
  - Data transmission systems
  - Information sites (e.g., websites)
  - Communication devices
  - Information platforms or portals

✅ **Conditions:**
- The activity must be **materially related** to the company’s or a member of its group’s financial services.
- Approval must be obtained under **paragraph 410(1)(c.1)** of the Act before engaging in such activities.

> 🔍 *Example:* A trust company could develop a secure online portal for mortgage applications or a mobile app for loan servicing — as long as the purpose is directly tied to financial services.

---

#### **4. Restrictions on Investment in IT Entities (Section 2)**

A company **may not acquire control of, or increase a substantial investment in**, an entity engaged in the IT activities described in Section 1, **if the sum of the following exceeds 5% of the company’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests the company and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity (under paragraph 453(2)(f) of the Act).  
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares/ownership interests held by the company and its subsidiaries in **other entities** engaged in such IT activities (that the company controls or has a substantial investment in).  
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the company and its subsidiaries to such entities.

📌 **Key Points:**
- The 5% threshold applies to the **total exposure** across all such IT-related entities.
- The calculation is based on **unconsolidated balance sheet values**, not consolidated financial statements.
- This cap is designed to prevent **over-concentration of risk** in IT ventures that are tied to financial services.

> 🚨 *Example:* If a trust company owns a digital banking platform, it cannot invest in another fintech platform (e.g., a credit scoring site) such that the total exposure (shares + loans) exceeds 5% of its regulatory capital.

#### **5. Prohibited Activities in IT Entities (Section 3)**

A company **cannot** acquire control of or increase a substantial investment in an entity that engages in any of the following activities:

| Prohibited Activity | Explanation |
|--------------------|-----------|
| **Accepting deposit liabilities** | Entities that take deposits (e.g., savings accounts) are excluded. This prevents IT companies from becoming de facto deposit-taking institutions. |
| **Dealing in securities** | Except as permitted under: <br> - Paragraph 453(2)(e) of the Act (limited securities trading), or <br> - Paragraph 409(2)(c) of the Act (specific exceptions). |
| **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** | Not permitted unless explicitly allowed under subsection 410(2) of the Act. <br> → This prevents IT companies from engaging in retail or commercial trading. |
| **Acting as executor, administrator, or guardian** | Prohibited unless under specific legal roles. |
| **Being a trustee for a trust** | Not allowed. |
| **Engaging in activities prohibited under Section 416** | Especially if the entity is a finance entity or falls under a prescribed category in paragraph 453(3)(e). |
| **Acquiring control of or holding a substantial investment in another entity** | Only permitted if: <br> - The company itself is authorized under **Part IX of the Act** to invest in that entity, or <br> - The company is authorized under **subsection 451(2), paragraph 451(3)(b) or (c), subsection 451(4), or subsections 453(1) or (2)** to invest in the other entity. |

> ⚠️ *Exception:* The regulations explicitly **exclude** certain prescribed activities under **paragraph 453(3)(g)** — meaning some IT-related activities may be allowed if specifically authorized.

---

#### **6. Exemption from Subsection 453(5) (Section 4)**

For the purpose of determining whether a company can acquire a substantial investment in another entity under certain subsections (e.g., 451(2), 451(3)(b)/(c), 451(4), 453(1)/(2)):

- **Subsection 453(5) of the Act does not apply** when the company acquires control of or increases investment in an entity whose business is **limited to the activities described in subsection 3(1)**.

📌 This means:
- If the IT entity only engages in **basic, non-prohibited IT services** (e.g., a secure data transmission system used solely for financial product delivery), then the stricter investment rules (e.g., those under 453(5)) are **not triggered**.
- This provides **flexibility** for smaller or narrowly focused IT operations.

> ✅ *Benefit:* Encourages innovation in IT services without exposing companies to excessive risk.

---

#### **7. Operational Scope and Effectiveness**

- **No Limit on Subsections 3(2) and (3)**  
  → The rules do not restrict the operation of **subsections 3(2) and (3)** of the Act, which may relate to broader regulatory compliance or reporting obligations.

- **Effective Date**  
  These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., upon official publication in the *Canada Gazette*).
