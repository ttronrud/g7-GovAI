**Detailed Summary of the Toll Information Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
The *Toll Information Regulations* are a set of rules established under **Section 88 of the National Energy Board Act (Act)**. These regulations were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, and are designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and effective oversight of toll-charging companies operating in Canada.

The regulations may be cited as the **Toll Information Regulations** and are intended to strengthen the National Energy Board’s (NEB) ability to monitor and regulate the financial performance and operational accuracy of companies that charge tolls—such as toll roads, bridges, or other infrastructure operators.

**Key Provisions and Obligations of Toll-Charging Companies**

1. **Quarterly Reporting Requirement**  
   Every toll-charging company is required to submit a detailed report to the National Energy Board at the **end of each three-month period of operation**. The report must include the following components:

   - **Rate of Return on Rate Base Comparison**:  
     The company must provide the **actual rate of return on its rate base** (i.e., the capital investment used to determine toll rates) for the three-month period. This must be compared with the **rate of return on the rate base that was previously authorized by the Board during the company’s most recent rate hearing**.  
     *Note: If the company has not had its rate of return on rate base formally authorized by the Board, the company must instead report its **rate of return on equity** for that period.*

   - **Explanation of Material Changes**:  
     The company must provide a clear and detailed explanation of any **material differences** between the actual financial results (e.g., revenues, expenses, traffic volumes) derived from toll collection and the **forecast figures** used to establish the toll rates. These forecasts were typically developed during the rate-setting process and are based on assumptions about traffic, demand, and economic conditions.

   - **Supporting Calculations**:  
     The report must include **detailed calculations** that explain the reasons behind the material changes. These calculations must cover the following key areas:
     - Capital (e.g., asset values)
     - Traffic volumes and patterns
     - Revenues generated
     - Operating expenses
     - Rates of return

     These calculations serve as a foundation for the Board’s review to assess whether the tolls are financially sustainable and aligned with original forecasts.

**Exemption from Reporting (Under Certain Conditions)**  
If, at the end of a three-month period, the **Board determines that the company has no material changes** to explain between actual performance and forecasted performance, the Board may **exempt the company from compliance** with the reporting requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.

However, this exemption is conditional:
- The company must **apply formally** to the Board for such an exemption.
- Upon approval, the Board may impose a **new reporting requirement**: instead of quarterly reports, the company will be required to submit information **only at the end of longer operational periods** (greater than three months), as the Board deems necessary for effective regulatory oversight.

This provision allows for flexibility in reporting frequency when a company demonstrates consistent performance and stability.

**Requirement for Additional Information (When Forecasts Are Not Fully Explained)**  
If the Board finds that the information submitted under Section 3(b) **does not fully explain** the differences between actual results and forecasted results, the Board has the authority to **require the company to provide additional information**.

This additional information must be sufficient to enable the Board to:
- Maintain **effective surveillance** over the financial and operational impact of the tolls.
- Identify potential risks, such as unexpected drops in traffic or revenue shortfalls.
- Ensure that toll rates remain justified and aligned with actual performance.

The Board may request data, analyses, or explanations related to traffic trends, economic factors, construction or maintenance activities, or other variables that may have influenced outcomes.

**Compliance Obligations**  
All companies subject to these regulations are **required to comply fully** with the reporting requirements under Section 3 or Section 4 (as applicable). Failure to provide accurate, timely, or complete information may result in regulatory action, including review of rate approvals, enforcement measures, or financial penalties.

**Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**  
The primary goals of the Toll Information Regulations are:

1. **Transparency and Accountability**: To ensure that toll rates are based on realistic, up-to-date financial and traffic data.
2. **Performance Monitoring**: To allow the National Energy Board to continuously assess whether tolls are achieving their intended financial and operational outcomes.
3. **Risk Management**: To detect and respond to significant deviations from forecasts early, preventing financial instability or public dissatisfaction.
4. **Public Confidence**: To build trust in the toll system by demonstrating that pricing is based on actual performance, not speculative assumptions.

**Conclusion**  
The *Toll Information Regulations* establish a structured, transparent, and responsive reporting framework for toll-charging companies. By requiring regular, detailed financial and performance disclosures, the regulations empower the National Energy Board to maintain oversight, ensure rate fairness, and protect public interest in infrastructure financing. The flexibility to exempt companies with stable performance and the ability to request additional information when needed ensures both regulatory rigor and practical operational feasibility.

These regulations are a key component of the broader regulatory framework governing energy and transportation infrastructure in Canada, emphasizing accountability, data-driven decision-making, and long-term sustainability.
