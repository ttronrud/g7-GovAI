- It is authorized under **paragraph 36(1)(b)** and **subsection 36(3)** of the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act* (the "Act").
- This provision empowers the government to create regulations to implement and administer the fiscal management framework for First Nations communities, particularly concerning local revenue laws.

> **Purpose**: To establish a formal process for reviewing and approving local revenue laws within First Nations communities, ensuring compliance with federal fiscal standards and promoting transparency, accountability, and equitable financial governance.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions and Key Terms**
- **"Act"** refers to the *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act*.  
  This is the foundational legislation governing the financial and statistical management of First Nations communities.

---

#### **3. Establishment of a Review Panel**
- The **Commission** (referring to the First Nations Fiscal Management Commission) may **delegate its powers** under **Section 31 of the Act** to a **panel**.
- The panel must consist of **three or more commissioners**.
- The **Chief Commissioner** is responsible for **designating** the members of this panel.

> **Rationale**: This delegation allows for more efficient and specialized review of local revenue laws. By forming a panel of experts, the Commission can distribute the workload and ensure that complex fiscal matters are reviewed by knowledgeable individuals.

---

#### **4. Scope of Panel Powers**
- The panel has the authority to:
  - **Review** proposed local laws related to revenue (e.g., taxes, fees, licensing, or other financial instruments).
  - **Approve or reject** such laws based on compliance with:
    - The *First Nations Fiscal and Statistical Management Act*,
    - Any regulations or standards made under the Act.

> **Note**: This power is limited to laws that are submitted for review and approval under the Act’s framework.

---

#### **5. Compliance and Decision-Making Process**
- If the panel determines that a submitted law **does not comply** with:
  - The Act itself, or
  - Any regulations or standards made under the Act,
  
  then the panel **must not approve** the law.

- Instead, the panel is required to **refer the law back to the Commission** for further review and approval.

> **Implication**: This creates a two-tiered review process:
> - First, a panel evaluates the law for compliance.
> - If non-compliant, it is returned to the full Commission for final decision.
> - This ensures that only laws meeting federal fiscal standards are approved, protecting the integrity of financial governance across First Nations.
