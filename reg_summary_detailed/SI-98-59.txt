**Detailed Summary of the Honeywell Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7)**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, known as the *Honeywell Remission Order*, is a formal government decision issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*. It grants a tax remission (i.e., exemption from payment) to Honeywell Inc. (referred to as "Honeywell") for specific taxes related to the importation of certain equipment into Canada in 1998. The remission applies only to a specific aircraft and associated testing equipment used in air navigation system testing, with strict conditions regarding the removal of the items from Canada.

---

### **Legal Authority**
The order is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 23(2)(a)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the government to make remissions of taxes when it is in the public interest to do so.

---

### **Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined within the order and apply throughout:

- **Aircraft**:  
  A specific Cessna Citation V aircraft with the following identifiers:  
  - Model number: 560  
  - Serial number: 560-0004  
  - Registration number: N189H  

- **Honeywell**:  
  Refers to *Honeywell Inc.*, the Canadian company that imported the equipment.

- **Tax**:  
  Refers to the excise tax imposed under *Part IX of the Excise Tax Act*. This is a tax levied on the importation of goods into Canada.

- **Testing Equipment**:  
  Consists of two specific components:  
  - A **Trimble receiver** with part number 24840-51 and serial number 3535A12075  
  - A **Trimble antenna** with part number 22020-00 and serial number 0220085482  

These items are used in the testing of air navigation systems.

### **Main Provision – Tax Remission**
The government grants a full remission of the excise tax (and any related interest or penalties) that Honeywell would have otherwise been required to pay on the importation of the **aircraft and testing equipment** into Canada in **1998**.

This remission is not a general exemption but is **specifically tied to the purpose** of the importation:  
👉 To conduct **air navigation system testing**.

---

### **Conditions for the Remission**
The tax remission is **conditional** and subject to the following requirements:

1. **Use for Testing**:  
   The aircraft and testing equipment must be used exclusively for testing purposes related to air navigation systems.

2. **Removal from Canada**:  
   The aircraft and testing equipment must be **removed from Canada as soon as is practical after the testing is completed**.

3. **Time Limit for Removal**:  
   The removal must occur **within sixty (60) days of the date of importation** into Canada.

This time constraint ensures that the equipment does not remain in Canada beyond the necessary period for testing and that it is promptly exported, minimizing any potential tax exposure or public interest concerns.

---

### **Public Interest Justification**
The government determined that granting this remission is in the **public interest**. This likely stems from the importance of air navigation system testing in ensuring the safety, efficiency, and modernization of Canada’s aviation infrastructure. By enabling Honeywell to import specialized equipment for such critical testing, the government supports technological advancement and national aviation safety.

---

### **Scope and Limitations**
- The remission applies **only to the specific aircraft and testing equipment** listed above.
- It applies **only to the tax liability from the year 1998**.
- The remission does **not extend to future imports** or other equipment.
- Interest and penalties associated with the original tax liability are also waived, provided the conditions are met.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Honeywell Remission Order* is a targeted, temporary measure designed to:
- Facilitate critical aviation technology testing,
- Support the development of safe and reliable air navigation systems in Canada,
- Ensure compliance with public interest principles,
- And promote efficient use of imported equipment without unnecessary tax burdens.

It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and the need for innovation and infrastructure development in the aviation sector.
