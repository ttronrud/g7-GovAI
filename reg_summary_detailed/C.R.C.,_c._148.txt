**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Turkey Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *British Columbia Turkey Order* and may be cited as such. It serves as a specific administrative instrument under the broader legislative framework established by the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act* (Act).

---

**2. Key Definitions**  
- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the regulation of certain agricultural commodities, including turkeys, in British Columbia.  
- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *British Columbia Turkey Marketing Board* (also known as the "Office de commercialisation" in French), an agency established under the Act to oversee the marketing of turkeys in the province.  
- **Turkey**: Defined broadly as *any class of turkey raised in the Province of British Columbia*. This includes various types of turkeys (e.g., broilers, heritage breeds, or specific production categories) as long as they are raised within BC.

---

**3. Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted specific regulatory powers to manage the **interprovincial and export trade** of turkeys. These powers are distinct from its local marketing responsibilities and extend to activities involving trade outside of British Columbia.

Importantly, the Board is authorized—by order—to exercise **all or any powers** it would otherwise have under **Section 17 of the Act** in relation to local marketing, but now applied to **interprovincial and export markets**. This means the Board can regulate how turkeys are marketed beyond the province, including setting standards, pricing, or conditions for export.

> *Note: This provision reflects a delegation of authority to the Board to apply local marketing rules (such as pricing or quality standards) to out-of-province and international sales.*

**4. Key Regulatory Powers – Levies and Charges**  
A central function of the Order is the Board’s authority to **impose levies or charges** on individuals and entities involved in the production or marketing of turkeys within British Columbia.

Specifically, the Board may:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from producers and marketers of turkeys operating in the province.
- **Classify persons** into different groups (e.g., small farms, large processors, cooperatives, etc.) based on their size, type of operation, or production volume.
- **Set different levies or charges** for each group. For example, a small-scale farmer might pay a lower levy than a large processing company.

These levies are not arbitrary; they are designed to ensure equitable financial contributions and support the overall stability of the turkey market.

---

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**  
The funds collected through these levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (funds set aside for future use, e.g., during market downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** related to marketing, promotion, or infrastructure.
- **Reimbursement for losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of turkeys (e.g., price collapses, spoilage, or market disruptions).
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers.  
  This means that if some producers benefit from high market prices while others suffer losses, the Board can use levy revenues to redistribute funds so that producers are fairly compensated over time.

This mechanism helps to **stabilize the market**, reduce volatility, and ensure **fairness among producers**—especially during periods of fluctuating supply and demand.

---

**6. Periodicity and Duration**  
The Board may determine the **periods of time** over which these levies or adjustments apply. For example, levies may be set for a 12-month cycle or tied to specific market conditions (e.g., during a drought or a global supply shock). The Board has discretion in setting these timeframes.

---

**7. Revocation Note**  
The Order includes a note stating that a previous version of this regulation was **revoked by SOR/80-90** (Supplement to the Statutes of the Province of British Columbia, 1980, No. 90). This indicates that the current Order supersedes an earlier version, likely due to changes in market conditions, policy goals, or legislative amendments.

---

**8. Purpose and Intent**  
The overall purpose of the British Columbia Turkey Order is to:

- Ensure a stable and fair market for turkeys in both domestic and international trade.
- Provide financial support and risk mitigation for producers.
- Promote equitable distribution of market gains and losses.
- Maintain market integrity and protect producers from market volatility.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *British Columbia Turkey Order* empowers the British Columbia Turkey Marketing Board to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of turkeys by establishing a structured system of levies and charges. These levies are tiered by producer type, enabling targeted financial support and risk-sharing. The collected funds are used to build reserves, cover losses, pay operational costs, and ensure income equalization among producers. This regulatory framework enhances market stability, supports rural economies, and aligns with broader goals of fair and sustainable agricultural marketing.

> *Note: While this Order is specific to turkeys, it operates under the general framework of the Natural Products Marketing Act, which governs similar commodity markets in British Columbia.*
