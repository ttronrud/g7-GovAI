### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, outlines a significant restructuring of federal government departments and public service functions in Canada. It is enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**, and is grounded in specific provisions of the Act — namely, **paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b)**.

#### **1. Transfer of Public Service Divisions**

Under **paragraph 2(a)** of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, the following public service divisions and units are transferred from their current departments to the **Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)**:

##### **From the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST):**
- **Investment Review Division**
- **Investment Research and Policy Division**

> *Purpose:* These divisions are responsible for reviewing and evaluating foreign investment proposals under the *Investment Canada Act*. Their transfer strengthens DIST’s capacity to manage investment policy and oversight, ensuring greater coherence and strategic alignment within the department.

##### **From the Department of Communications:**
- **Automated Applications, Telematics and New Media**
- **Spectrum Management Operations**
- **Certification and Engineering Bureau**
- **Communications Research Centre (CRC)**
- **Office of the Assistant Deputy Minister (Quebec)**
- **Regional Spectrum Services Centre**
- **Canadian Workplace Automation Research Centre**

> *Purpose:* These units are involved in spectrum management, telecommunications technology development, research, and the regulation of emerging technologies such as telematics and workplace automation. Their transfer to DIST reflects a strategic shift to consolidate expertise in science, technology, and innovation under one department, enhancing coordination between technological development, policy, and industrial application.

This transfer is not merely administrative—it reflects a broader policy objective to **integrate technology, innovation, and investment policy** under a single, unified department.

#### **2. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**

Under **paragraph 2(a)**, the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** is granted **all powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** under any Act of Parliament.

> *Key Implications:*
- The Minister of Industry, Science and Technology now assumes full responsibility for consumer protection, corporate governance, and corporate affairs as defined in existing legislation (e.g., *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act*, *Corporate Insolvency and Restructuring Act*, *Competition Act*, etc.).
- This includes regulatory oversight of corporate conduct, consumer rights, and compliance with corporate governance standards.
- The transfer ensures that consumer and corporate affairs are no longer managed in isolation but are integrated into a broader framework of industrial policy, innovation, and market regulation.

> *Rationale:* This consolidation aims to improve policy coherence, reduce duplication, and strengthen the government’s ability to respond to complex, interconnected issues such as corporate accountability, innovation, and consumer trust in a digital economy.

#### **3. Amalgamation of Departments**

Under **paragraph 2(b)** of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, the following occurs:

- The **Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)** and the **Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs (DCCA)** are **amalgamated**.
- This new, unified department operates under the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**.
- The **Deputy Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** serves as the head of the combined department.

> *Structural Impact:*
- The merger eliminates the previous dual departmental structure, creating a more streamlined, efficient, and strategically focused government body.
- The combined department will have a broader mandate covering:
  - Industrial policy and investment review
  - Scientific research and innovation
  - Consumer protection and corporate governance
  - Spectrum and telecommunications technology development
- The Deputy Minister now has authority over both former departments, enabling better coordination and policy integration.

> *Strategic Rationale:*
- The amalgamation is designed to promote **interdepartmental synergy** between science, technology, industry, and consumer affairs.
- It aligns with Canada’s national priorities in **innovation, digital transformation, and economic competitiveness**.
- It enables more effective policy formulation and implementation by removing bureaucratic silos.

### **Overall Objectives and Policy Implications**

1. **Enhanced Policy Integration:** By merging consumer and corporate affairs with industry and science, the government ensures that innovation policies are aligned with consumer needs and corporate responsibility.

2. **Improved Efficiency:** Reducing duplication of functions and staff across departments leads to cost savings and more effective service delivery.

3. **Strategic Focus on Innovation:** The concentration of investment review, research, and technology units under one department supports Canada’s goal of becoming a global leader in science, technology, and innovation.

4. **Better Oversight of Investment and Corporate Activity:** With the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology now responsible for both investment screening and corporate governance, the government can ensure that foreign investment and domestic corporate behavior are evaluated through a consistent, forward-looking lens.

5. **Support for Emerging Technologies:** The inclusion of units like the CRC and Canadian Workplace Automation Research Centre signals a strong commitment to research and development in high-growth, future-oriented sectors.
