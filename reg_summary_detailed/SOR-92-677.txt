**Detailed Summary of the Specific Agreement Confirmation Regulations (S.C. 1988, c. 39)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Specific Agreement Confirmation Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Specific Agreement Confirmation Regulations") were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, under **Section 5 of the Indian Lands Agreement (1986) Act**. These regulations establish a formal, transparent, and democratic process for confirming specific agreements between Indigenous bands and the federal government through a **referendum**.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that any specific land or resource agreement entered into between a First Nation band and the federal government is confirmed by the band’s members through a **free, fair, and binding vote**, thereby upholding Indigenous self-determination and democratic governance.

These regulations are binding and apply to all bands in Canada that are subject to the Indian Lands Agreement (1986) Act and wish to confirm a specific agreement via referendum.
