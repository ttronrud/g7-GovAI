**Detailed Summary of the Safety of Sperm and Ova Regulations (S.C. 2004, c. 2; S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 737)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Safety of Sperm and Ova Regulations* are a set of administrative regulations made under **Section 65b of the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHRA)**, and are designed to ensure the **safety, quality, and traceability** of human reproductive materials—specifically sperm and ova—used in assisted reproduction. These regulations establish a comprehensive framework governing how sperm and ova are **donated, processed, tested, stored, distributed, and imported**, with a primary focus on **protecting human health and safety**.

The regulations apply to **primary establishments** (entities that oversee all processing activities) and **other establishments or health professionals** that may process, store, distribute, or import sperm or ova on behalf of a primary establishment.

## **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined to provide clarity and consistency throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Accident** | An unexpected event not due to deviation from standard procedures or laws that could compromise human health, safety, or the safety of sperm/ova. |
| **Activity (in respect of sperm or ova)** | Includes processing, distributing, and importing. Processing includes donor screening, obtaining, preparing, testing, preserving, assessing quality, labelling, quarantining, and storing. |
| **Adverse Reaction** | Unexpected presence of an infectious disease agent or occurrence of an infectious disease in a recipient or child resulting from sperm or ova. |
| **Directive** | The *Technical Requirements for Conducting the Suitability Assessment of Sperm and Ova Donors*, published by Health Canada, as amended. Amendments are valid if they do not undermine safety goals. |
| **Donation Code** | A unique identifier assigned to a specific sperm or ova donation. |
| **Donor Identification Code** | A unique identifier assigned to a donor. |
| **Donor Suitability Assessment** | A three-part evaluation: donor screening, physical examination, and donor testing. |
| **Error** | A deviation from standard operating procedures or laws that could compromise health or safety. |
| **Establishment** | A person, partnership, or entity conducting any activity involving sperm or ova. Excludes health professionals unless they conduct activities outside their standard scope. |
| **Health Professional** | A licensed medical practitioner authorized to use or distribute sperm/ova for personal use or distribution to recipients. |
| **Human Health and Safety** | Health and safety of recipients or children created from sperm/ova, in relation to the safety of the reproductive material. |
| **Medical Director (Primary Establishment)** | A licensed physician responsible for all medical and technical procedures during processing. |
| **Primary Establishment** | An establishment that conducts all processing activities—either directly or through subcontracted entities. |
| **Quarantine** | As defined in subsection 28(2) of the AHRA; a controlled period during which sperm or ova are held to ensure safety. |
| **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** | Instructions within a quality management system that outline how activities must be performed to ensure consistency and safety. |

> **Note**: The Directive is considered amended if changes do not undermine its core purpose of reducing risks to human health and safety.
