**Detailed Summary of the Halifax International Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 85)**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were issued under the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Section 5.4**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to amend or revoke existing aeronautical zoning regulations. The proposed regulations were previously published in multiple public notices:

- **Canada Gazette, Part I**: February 6 and 13, 1993  
- **The Mail-Star**: March 15 and 16, 1993  
- **Le Courrier de la Nouvelle-Écosse**: March 19 and 26, 1993  

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections. Based on this public consultation, the **Governor General in Council revoked the previous Halifax International Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 85)** and issued the **new, updated regulations in their place**.

### **Regulation Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Halifax International Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all land **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Halifax International Airport**, including public road allowances.

---

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Halifax International Airport, located in the County of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for all spatial measurements. Its elevation is **133 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runways (strips) to ensure safe aircraft approach paths. These surfaces rise at a **1:50 gradient** (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal distance). They extend **15,000 meters horizontally** from the runway end and reach a horizontal line **300 meters above the elevation at the runway end**. The outer ends of this line are **2,400 meters from the runway centerline**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane located **45 meters above the airport reference point** (i.e., 133 m + 45 m = 178 m above sea level). However, where this plane would be less than **9 meters above ground level**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe conditions. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, including the runway and its sides. Each strip is defined by its **width (300 meters)** and **length**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes that extend upward and outward from the **lateral edges of the strips and their approach surfaces**, rising at a **1:7 gradient** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), until they meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. |

### **Spatial Boundaries and Reference Points**

#### 1. **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located by measuring:
  - 1,372 meters **northeasterly** along the centerline of **runway 06–24** from its **southwesterly end**.
  - Then 122 meters **southeasterly** at right angles to the centerline.
- **Coordinates (Nova Scotia Grid)**:  
  N 4,971,371.71 m and E 5,577,972.20 m  
- This point serves as the **origin for all spatial measurements** in the regulation.

#### 2. **Approach Surfaces (Four in total)**
Each approach surface corresponds to one runway end:
- **Runway 06 (approach)**: 1:50 slope, extends 15,000 m from end, reaches 300 m above runway end elevation, outer ends 2,400 m from centerline.
- **Runway 24 (approach)**: Same as above.
- **Runway 15 (approach)**: Same as above.
- **Runway 33 (approach)**: Same as above.

These surfaces are derived from the **Halifax International Airport Zoning Plan No. S-2449-1 to S-2449-39**, dated March 30, 1990.

#### 3. **Outer Surface**
- A horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP (178 m above sea level)**.
- **Exception**: Where the 45-meter plane would be less than 9 meters above ground, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to avoid impractical or unsafe heights.

#### 4. **Strips**
- **Runway 06–24**:  
  - Width: 300 meters (150 m on each side of centerline)  
  - Length: 3,166.66 meters  
- **Runway 15–33**:  
  - Width: 300 meters (150 m on each side)  
  - Length: 2,467 meters  

These are based on zoning plans dated March 30, 1990 (Nos. S-2449-23, S-2449-24, S-2449-30).

#### 5. **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at **1:7 gradient** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal).
- Extend from the **edges of the strips and approach surfaces**.
- Continue until they intersect with:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - Another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.

#### 6. **Outer Limit**
- A **circular boundary** with a **radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This defines the **geographic boundary** of the regulated zone.

> **All land within this outer limit**, and **land directly under any part of the approach surfaces that extend beyond this limit**, is subject to the regulations.

### **Prohibited Activities and Restrictions**

#### 1. **Height Restrictions on Buildings, Structures, and Objects**
- **No construction or addition** to any building, structure, or object may result in a **highest point exceeding**:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This ensures that no object (e.g., towers, trees, antennas, buildings) interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

#### 2. **Interference with Aircraft Communications and Signals**
- No person may **use or develop land** in a way that:
  - Interferes with **radio signals or communications** between aircraft and ground control,
  - Disrupts **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, navigation aids, ATC systems).

#### 3. **Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the height of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), the **Minister may require** the landowner or lessee to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This prevents obstructions to flight paths and ensures clear visual and radar lines of sight.

#### 4. **Bird Attraction and Waste Disposal**
- No part of the regulated land may be used for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** or
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird strikes, which pose a significant risk to aircraft safety.

### **Regulatory Objectives and Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by maintaining clear, unobstructed flight paths around the airport.
- **Protect aircraft during critical phases** of flight — takeoff, landing, and approach — by limiting obstructions in key zones.
- **Preserve the integrity of aeronautical infrastructure** by preventing interference with communication and navigation systems.
- **Prevent environmental hazards** such as bird attraction and uncontrolled vegetation growth.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- The regulations are **binding on all landowners and lessees** within the defined zones.
- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth,
  - Enforce compliance with height and use restrictions.
- The regulations are **based on established zoning plans** (S-2449 series) approved in 1990, ensuring consistency with existing airport planning.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around Halifax International Airport. By defining precise spatial boundaries (using the ARP, strips, approach and outer surfaces), it establishes clear limits on construction, vegetation, and waste disposal to **protect aviation safety** and **maintain operational efficiency**.

It reflects a balance between **urban development needs** and **aeronautical safety requirements**, ensuring that growth and development do not compromise flight operations.

### **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Key Implications |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Landowners** | Must ensure all structures and natural growth remain below defined surfaces. Must avoid waste disposal
