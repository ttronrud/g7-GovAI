### **1. Introduction and Authority**
These regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to:
- Paragraphs **18(1)(b) to (d)a** and
- Section **37b** of the *Railway Safety Act*.

The purpose is to establish comprehensive requirements for the **prevention, detection, and control of fires on railway line works**, regardless of the cause or location of the fire. The regulations apply to all types of line works — including tracks, bridges, tunnels, and associated infrastructure — and cover both federal and non-federal railway operations.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Fire Service** | Any federal, provincial, or municipal organization responsible for preventing, detecting, and controlling fires. |
| **Fire Hazard** | Includes: <br> - Fuel or combustible materials (e.g., vegetation) with a fast-burning rate that can ignite easily; <br> - Environmental conditions (e.g., topography) that increase the likelihood of fire ignition or spread from the line work into surrounding areas. |
| **High-Risk Work** | Activities involving: <br> - Use of a **rail-grinding train**; <br> - **Controlled burning of brush** (e.g., vegetation management). |

---

### **3. Fire Danger Level Determination**
- The **fire danger level** for an area is determined using the **interactive map** within the **Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS)**, available on the **Department of Natural Resources** or other **Government of Canada websites**.
- If **multiple fire danger levels** are shown, the **highest level** applies.
- This level is critical for determining required fire prevention and suppression measures.

### **4. Fire Response and Notification Requirements**

#### **When a Fire Occurs**
- **Railway companies** (including local ones) must:
  - **Extinguish or control the fire as soon as practicable**.
  - **Notify the fire service responsible for the area** if the fire cannot be managed without their assistance.
  - **Notify the railway company that operates or maintains the line work**, if applicable.

#### **When Fire Services Are Responding**
- If requested by the fire service, the railway company must provide **reasonable assistance without delay**.
- Assistance may include **transportation to the fire scene** or access to equipment.

---

### **5. Fire Preparedness Plan (FPP)**

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Must be developed and **updated every five years**.

  - **Internal fire notification procedures** (e.g., chain of command);
  - Procedures for **notifying fire services**.

**Recordkeeping:**
- Must maintain a record of:
  - Each date and manner of communication of the FPP to employees conducting railway operations.

**Accessibility and Communication:**
- The FPP and **up-to-date contact information** for the responsible fire service must be:
  - Kept in a **readily accessible location**.
  - Communicated to all employees involved in railway operations.

**Retention:**
- All documents related to the FPP and contact information must be **retained for at least five years** after creation.
- A copy must be provided to the **Minister of Transport** upon request.

---

### **6. Fire Hazard Reduction Plan (FHRP)**

**Mandatory Requirements:**
- Must be developed and **updated every five years**.
- Must include:
  - A process for **identifying fire hazards**;
  - **Measures to reduce or eliminate** identified hazards;
  - For each fire danger level in the CWFIS (e.g., low, moderate, high, extreme), specific:
    - **Fire prevention measures**;
    - **Fire suppression equipment** to be used during high-risk work.

**Communication:**
- Must be communicated to:
  - Employees conducting high-risk work;
  - Supervisors of contractors performing high-risk work;
  - Contractors performing high-risk work.

**Recordkeeping:**
- Must maintain a record of each date and manner of communication of the FHRP.

**Retention:**
- All versions of the FHRP and related records must be **retained for at least five years**.

---

### **7. High-Risk Work and Fire Danger Level Protocols**

#### **Advance Notification Requirement**
- Before conducting high-risk work (e.g., rail grinding, brush burning) in an area:
  - If the **fire danger level is high or extreme**, the railway company must notify the responsible fire service:
    - **At least 24 hours in advance**, but **no later than 48 hours**.
  - If **no fire danger level is available**, notification must still be made **within 24–48 hours**.

#### **Notification Recordkeeping**
- The railway company must record:
  - Date and time of notification;
  - Names of individuals contacted at the fire service;
  - Any recommendations from the fire service;
  - If a recommendation was **not followed**, the **reasons for non-compliance**.

#### **Compliance with Fire Prevention Measures**
- When conducting high-risk work in an area:
  - The company **must implement the fire prevention measures** specified in the FHRP for the **actual fire danger level**.
  - If no fire danger level is available, the company must apply the measures for **at least a moderate fire danger level**.

#### **Suppression Equipment Requirements**
- Employees and contractors performing high-risk work must be equipped with the **fire suppression equipment** specified in the FHRP for the applicable fire danger level.
- If no level is available, equipment must meet the **moderate-level standard**.
