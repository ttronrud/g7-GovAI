**Regulation Title:**  
Single-Entry Visitor Visa Fee (Sporting and Cultural Events) Remission Order

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is made under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act*, and is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Treasury Board. This authority allows the government to remit (i.e., waive or cancel) certain fees when it is in the public interest.

**Effective Date:**  
The order was enacted as part of *Statutory Instrument S.C. 1991, c. 24, section 7(2)*, indicating it was formally introduced and came into force in 1991.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of this remission order is to waive the standard visitor visa processing fee of **$75** for specific individuals participating in two major international events in Canada in 2001:

1. The **IAAF World Championships in Athletics** in Edmonton, 2001  
2. The **2001 Games of La Francophonie**

This fee is normally charged under *item 3 of the Immigration Act Fees Regulations*, which applies to the processing of a single-entry visitor visa.

**Who Is Eligible for the Fee Remission?**  
The fee of $75 is waived for applicants who meet **one of the following two categories**:

### **Category 1: Sports Participants**
Applicants must be one of the following and participating in either:
- The **IAAF World Championships in Athletics** in Edmonton, 2001, or  
- The **2001 Games of La Francophonie**

Eligible individuals include:
- Athletes  
- Coaches  
- Trainers  
- Members of the medical staff  
- National team officials  
- Judges  
- Members of the sanctioning national or international sports federation  

> *Note:* The term "sanctioning national or international sports federation" refers to official bodies that govern or oversee the sport (e.g., national Olympic committees, international athletics federations like IAAF).

### **Category 2: Cultural Performers**
Applicants must be:
- A performer  
- Invited by the organizing committee of the **2001 Games of La Francophonie**  
- To participate in a **cultural festival** that is part of or associated with those games

**Key Conditions for Remission:**
- The applicant must submit a **duly completed application** for a single-entry visitor visa.  
- The visa must be for a **one-time entry into Canada**.  
- The applicant must be **participating in one of the two specified events** in 2001.  
- The remission applies **only to the $75 processing fee** under item 3 of the Immigration Act Fees Regulations.  
- The remission does **not** cover other fees or charges associated with the visa process (e.g., medical exams, security checks, or application fees unrelated to processing).

---

**Public Interest Justification:**  
The Governor General in Council determined that it is in the **public interest** to waive this fee. This decision was based on the following considerations:
- The events in 2001 (especially the IAAF World Championships and the Games of La Francophonie) were significant international gatherings that would bring global attention, economic benefits, and cultural exchange to Canada.
- Facilitating participation by athletes and performers helps promote international goodwill, supports Canada’s reputation as a host of high-profile events, and enhances national engagement in global sports and cultural affairs.
- Waiving the fee ensures that qualified individuals can participate without financial barriers, especially when their presence contributes to public interest and national pride.

---

**Scope and Limitations:**
- The remission is **limited to 2001** and the specific events mentioned.  
- It does **not apply** to future events or other years.  
- It does **not extend** to other types of visas (e.g., work, study, or family visas).  
- It does **not apply** to individuals who are not directly involved in the events or who are not invited or participating in the specified capacity.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation demonstrates a targeted use of administrative discretion under the *Financial Administration Act* to support Canada’s international engagement through sports and cultural events. By waiving the $75 visitor visa processing fee for athletes, officials, and performers involved in the 2001 IAAF World Championships and the Games of La Francophonie, the government promoted accessibility, participation, and the public benefit of these events.

**Note:** This regulation is historical and no longer in force, as it pertains specifically to events in 2001. Modern visa fee remission policies may apply to different events or circumstances, but this order serves as a precedent for fee waivers in the context of international sporting and cultural events.
