### **Regulatory Summary: Repeal and Designation of Minister under the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act and the Financial Administration Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
This regulation is issued under the authority of:
- **Section 2 of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act (SSHCRA)**, which defines the term "Minister" in relation to the Council.
- **Paragraph (c.1)(b) of the definition "appropriate Minister"** in **Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, which specifies the minister responsible for overseeing the operations of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) under federal financial administration rules.

The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, reflecting the standard mechanism by which federal government appointments and designations are made in Canada.

#### **2. Key Actions in the Regulation**

##### **(a) Repeal of Prior Order in Council**
- The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2018-1012**, issued on **July 18, 2018**.
- This prior order had previously designated a different minister (or set of ministers) as responsible for SSHRC functions under the SSHCRA or FAA.
- By repealing this order, the current regulation **withdraws and invalidates the previous ministerial designation**, effectively ending the prior administrative arrangement.

> *Rationale for repeal*: The change likely reflects a shift in government priorities, ministerial portfolio realignments, or a re-evaluation of administrative responsibilities. It ensures that the current ministerial designation is the only legally valid one.

---

##### **(b) Designation of the Minister of Industry as the Minister for SSHRC (under SSHCRA)**
- The regulation **designates the Minister of Industry** as the **"Minister"** for the purposes of the **Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act**.
- This means that the Minister of Industry is now the official minister responsible for:
  - Oversight of SSHRC’s strategic direction, funding, and operations.
  - Policy decisions affecting the Council’s mandate.
  - Accountability to Parliament for SSHRC-related matters.
- The designation is effective immediately upon publication and is binding under the SSHCRA.

> *Note*: This designation is based on the definition of "Minister" in Section 2 of the SSHCRA, which requires the Minister responsible for the Council to be a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada.

---

##### **(c) Designation of the Minister of Industry as the "Appropriate Minister" under the Financial Administration Act**
- The regulation also designates the **Minister of Industry** as the **"appropriate Minister"** with respect to the SSHRC under the **Financial Administration Act**.
- This role is critical for:
  - Ensuring compliance with federal financial management rules and procedures.
  - Approving expenditures, financial reports, and audits related to SSHRC.
  - Facilitating the transfer of funds and the administration of federal financial programs involving SSHRC.

> *Legal basis*: Paragraph (c.1)(b) of Section 2 of the FAA specifies that the "appropriate Minister" is the minister responsible for the agency or body in question. By designating the Minister of Industry, the regulation ensures that financial oversight of SSHRC is properly delegated and accountable.

---

#### **3. Implications and Significance**

- **Administrative Clarity**: The regulation provides clear, current ministerial responsibility for SSHRC, removing ambiguity from prior arrangements.
- **Portfolio Realignment**: It reflects a shift in ministerial responsibilities — moving SSHRC oversight from a previous department (e.g., Minister of Education or Science) to the **Minister of Industry**.
- **Policy and Funding Impact**: The Minister of Industry now has direct authority over SSHRC’s funding decisions, program priorities, and alignment with broader national innovation and economic development goals.
- **Financial Accountability**: Under the FAA, this designation ensures that SSHRC’s financial activities are subject to oversight by a minister with clear authority and accountability, enhancing transparency and compliance.

#### **5. Conclusion**
This regulation effectively:
- **Revokes a previous ministerial designation** for SSHRC.
- **Establishes the Minister of Industry** as both:
  - The **Minister** responsible for SSHRC under the SSHCRA.
  - The **appropriate Minister** for financial administration purposes under the FAA.

This change reflects a strategic reallocation of responsibilities, likely to better align SSHRC’s mission with Canada’s broader economic and innovation policies, particularly in the context of industry-led research and development.

---

*Note*: While the regulation is technically straightforward, its significance lies in the shift of oversight from a traditionally academic or education-focused portfolio to one with stronger ties to economic development and industry engagement. This may signal a policy emphasis on integrating academic research with industrial innovation and commercialization.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The regulation repeals a prior ministerial designation and designates the Minister of Industry as both the Minister and the appropriate Minister for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council under the respective Acts, effective immediately.
