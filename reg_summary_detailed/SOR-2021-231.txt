### **Detailed Summary of the Emergency Order for the Protection of the Western Chorus Frog Great Lakes / St. Lawrence — Canadian Shield Population (Longueuil)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

This **Emergency Order** was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under two key provisions of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*:

- **Section 80** of SARA: Allows the designation of critical habitat for species at risk.
- **Subsection 97(2)** of SARA: Provides the authority to issue emergency orders to protect species at risk when immediate action is required to prevent extinction or decline.

This Order specifically applies to the **Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata)** — more precisely, the **Great Lakes / St. Lawrence — Canadian Shield population** — which is found in the **Longueuil area of Quebec**.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Emergency Order is to **protect and conserve the critical habitat** necessary for the recovery of the Western Chorus Frog population in Longueuil. The areas identified in the schedule are legally recognized as **critical habitat** under paragraph **80(4)(c)** of SARA — meaning they are essential for the species’ survival, reproduction, and long-term recovery.

---

#### **3. Scope and Geographic Coverage**

The Order applies to specific parcels of land within the **cadastre of Quebec**, registration division of **Longueuil**, covering a total of **11 distinct parcels** across several lots. The total area of protected land is approximately:

- **Over 38,000 square meters** (about 9.4 acres), distributed across the following lots:
  - Lot 5,097,002 (12,233 m²)
  - Lot 4,920,896 (18,089 m²)
  - Lot 4,920,889 (1,831.8 m²)
  - Lot 5,097,003 (2,410.7 m²)
  - Lot 5,097,001 (partial parcel — description incomplete, but included)

Additionally, the Order includes **3,526,950 to 3,527,336** and **4,921,467–4,921,468**, **5,137,444–5,137,446**, and **5,468,104** — indicating a broader set of adjacent or related land parcels, likely to ensure full protection of the frog’s habitat network.

> **Note**: The exact boundaries of each parcel are described using precise **bearings, distances, and arcs of circles**, reflecting a highly technical and legally precise survey description typical of land use regulation in Quebec.

#### **4. Prohibited Activities**

Within the designated critical habitat areas, the following activities are **strictly prohibited**:

| Prohibited Activity | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Soil disturbance** | Digging, removing, compacting, or plowing soil |
| **Vegetation damage** | Removing, pruning, mowing, damaging, destroying, or introducing any vegetation (trees, shrubs, plants) |
| **Hydrological alteration** | Draining or flooding the ground; altering surface water flow, volume, or direction |
| **Infrastructure development** | Installing, constructing, or performing maintenance on any infrastructure (roads, buildings, etc.) |
| **Vehicle use** | Using any vehicle (including motorized or human-powered) **except on designated roads or paved paths** |
| **Barriers to movement** | Installing or constructing any structure or barrier that impedes frog migration, dispersal, or circulation |
| **Material deposition** | Depositing, discharging, dumping, or immersing any material (snow, gravel, sand, soil, garbage, greywater, pool water) |
| **Chemical use** | Applying fertilizers (as defined in the *Fertilizers Act*) or pest control products (as defined in the *Pest Control Products Act*) |

> These prohibitions are designed to **minimize human disturbance**, preserve natural hydrology, and maintain the integrity of the frog’s breeding and feeding environments.

---

#### **5. Exceptions**

The prohibitions **do not apply** to activities that are:

- **Authorized under provincial law** and related to **public safety or health** (e.g., emergency response, fire protection, medical services).

This exception ensures that essential public services can operate without being barred by the Order, while still protecting the species.

---

#### **6. Legal Consequences**

- Any **contravention** of the prohibitions (i.e., unauthorized activity within the protected area) constitutes an **offence under Section 97 of the Species at Risk Act**.
- Penalties for violations may include **fines, injunctions, or other enforcement actions** as determined by the courts or regulatory authorities.

---

#### **7. Effective Date and Legal Effect**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered**.
- For the purposes of the *Statutory Instruments Act*, the Order applies **immediately upon issuance** (before publication in the *Canada Gazette*), ensuring swift implementation.

---

#### **8. Key Ecological and Conservation Rationale**

The Western Chorus Frog is a **vulnerable species** in Canada, particularly in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence regions. This population is adapted to **cool, moist, forested, and wetland environments** typical of the Canadian Shield. The protected area in Longueuil supports:

- **Breeding sites** (ponds, wetlands)
- **Shelter and foraging grounds**
- **Migration corridors** (protected from barriers)

By preventing soil compaction, vegetation loss, and chemical contamination, the Order helps maintain the **ecological balance** essential for the frog’s survival and recovery.

---

#### **9. Broader Implications**

- This emergency order reflects Canada’s commitment to **species conservation** under SARA, especially in regions where biodiversity is under threat from urban development and land use change.
- It sets a precedent for **targeted, science-based habitat protection**, particularly in areas with high ecological value and declining species populations.
- The inclusion of **precise land descriptions** ensures legal clarity and enables effective enforcement and monitoring.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Emergency Order is a **critical conservation measure** designed to protect the Western Chorus Frog population in Longueuil, Quebec, by legally restricting harmful human activities in its critical habitat. It demonstrates the federal government’s ability to respond rapidly to biodiversity threats through targeted legislation, grounded in scientific assessment and ecological need. While the order is strictly enforced, it includes reasonable exceptions for public safety, balancing ecological protection with community needs.
