### **Detailed Summary of the Decision Body Time Periods and Consultation Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Purpose**

These regulations, titled *Decision Body Time Periods and Consultation Regulations*, are issued under the authority of the **Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act (YESA)**, specifically **paragraphs 122(d) and (e)** of the Act. They were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, following consultations with key stakeholders.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear timelines and procedural requirements** for how decision bodies (federal or territorial) must act when evaluating and responding to environmental and socio-economic recommendations related to projects in Yukon. The regulations ensure timely, transparent, and inclusive decision-making, particularly with respect to Indigenous communities.

Key consultation partners include:
- The **member of the Executive Council of Yukon** designated as the territorial minister,
- The **Gwich’in Tribal Council**, and
- The **Yukon First Nations**, as defined under the **Umbrella Final Agreement** and the *Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act*.

This underscores the importance of **Indigenous participation and rights** in environmental and socio-economic assessments.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 7). |
| **Recommendation** | A formal suggestion made under any of the following circumstances:<br>• Paragraph 56(1)(a), (b), or (c): by a designated office at the end of an evaluation;<br>• Paragraph 58(1)(a), (b), or (c): by the executive committee after screening;<br>• Subsection 72(4): by a panel of the Board or a joint panel after a review;<br>• Section 73: in a review panel’s report. |
| **New Recommendation** | A recommendation made or *deemed* to have been made under subsection 77(2) of the Act. This is distinct from a standard recommendation and often arises when a new issue or concern emerges during the assessment process. |
| **Review Panel** | A panel established under section 63 of the Act to review a recommendation. |

---

#### **3. Timelines for Issuing Decision Documents**

The regulations establish **mandatory timeframes** within which decision bodies must issue a final decision document in response to a recommendation.

| Type of Recommendation | Timeframe for Issuing Decision Document |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Made by a designated office** (e.g., evaluation report) | **30 days** after the report is issued |
| **Made by a joint panel or review panel** | **90 days** after the report is issued |
| **Accepted recommendation** (by executive committee) | **60 days** after the report |
| **Accepted recommendation** (by a panel of the Board) | **90 days** after the report |
| **Referral back for reconsideration** (to executive committee or Board panel) | **45 days** after the report |

> These timelines are strictly tied to the **date of the report** that includes the recommendation.

---

#### **4. Time Extensions for First Nation Consultation**

When a decision body is **required by subsection 74(2) of the Act to consult with a First Nation**, the deadlines for issuing a decision document are **extended** to account for consultation time.

The extension depends on the original deadline:

| Original Deadline | Extension |
|------------------|----------|
| 30 days → extended by **7 days** |
| 45 days → extended by **7 days** |
| 60 days → extended by **21 days** |
| 90 days → extended by **30 days** |

> This ensures that consultation with Indigenous communities — a legally mandated process — does not compromise the timeliness of final decisions.

---

#### **5. Coordination Among Multiple Decision Bodies**

For projects involving **two or more decision bodies**, the regulations require **cooperative coordination** on several procedural matters:

- **Time Schedules for Consultations**: Decision bodies must jointly determine when and how consultations will occur, taking into account:
  - The deadline for issuing decision documents,
  - The complexity of the project,
  - The geographic location of the project,
  - Any other relevant factors.

- **Manner of Consultation with First Nations**: If consultation with First Nations is required, the decision bodies must agree on:
  - How and with whom consultations will be conducted,
  - The methods (e.g., meetings, written submissions),
  - The responsibilities of each body.

- **Other Procedural Matters**: Any other issues relevant to consultation under subsection 78(1) of the Act must be resolved collectively.

> This promotes consistency, avoids duplication, and ensures that Indigenous voices are heard in a structured and respectful manner.

---

#### **6. Lead Federal Decision Body (for Multi-Body Projects)**

When **more than one federal decision body** is involved in assessing a project, the following process applies:

- The federal decision bodies must **elect one federal body** to act as the **lead federal decision body**.
- The lead body must provide **written notice to all other decision bodies (including non-federal ones)** within **7 days** of the report containing the recommendation.

**Responsibilities of the Lead Federal Decision Body**:

1. **Coordinate determinations under Section 7** of the Act (i.e., the final decision on whether a project should proceed).
2. **Coordinate consultations** between federal decision bodies.
3. **Coordinate consultations** between federal bodies and other decision bodies (e.g., territorial or Indigenous).
4. **Represent the federal government** in discussions with other decision bodies.

> This ensures unity of action and avoids conflicting positions or overlapping responsibilities among federal agencies.

---

#### **7. Resolving Disagreements Among Federal Decision Bodies**

If the federal decision bodies **cannot reach an agreement** on a key determination under section 7 of the Act:

- **If no other decision bodies** (territorial or Indigenous) are involved in the project:
  - The **lead federal decision body** determines the matter independently.

- **If one or more other decision bodies** (e.g., Yukon territorial government or First Nations) are involved:
  - The lead federal decision body determines the **position of the federal government** and proposes it to the other decision bodies for consideration.

> This provides a clear mechanism for resolving deadlocks and ensures that the federal government can still make a final determination, even in the absence of consensus.

#### **8. Entry into Force**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the government of Canada. This means they are immediately effective upon official publication.

### **Key Principles and Impacts**

| Principle | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timeliness** | Clear deadlines ensure efficient project assessment and reduce delays in approvals or rejections. |
| **Indigenous Inclusion** | Mandatory consultation with First Nations is not just procedural — it is embedded in timelines and coordination mechanisms. |
| **Accountability** | Decision bodies are required to act within defined timeframes, promoting transparency and public trust. |
| **Coordination** | Prevents overlap, confusion, or conflict when multiple agencies are involved. |
| **Flexibility** | Allows for adjustments (e.g., consultation extensions) without undermining the overall process. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Decision Body Time Periods and Consultation Regulations* provide a **comprehensive, structured, and rights-based framework** for managing environmental and socio-economic assessments in Yukon. By setting precise timelines, mandating Indigenous consultation, and establishing clear roles for lead decision bodies, the regulations ensure that:

- Projects are assessed fairly and efficiently,
- Indigenous communities are meaningfully involved,
- Federal and territorial agencies operate in coordination,
- Legal and procedural obligations are met,
- Public confidence in the decision-making process is maintained.

These regulations reflect a commitment to **environmental responsibility, Indigenous rights, and procedural fairness** — all central to the Yukon’s governance and development framework.
