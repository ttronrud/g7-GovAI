**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Regulations Prescribing Exclusions from Certain Definitions of the Criminal Code (International Sporting Competition Handguns)*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Made under the authority of the *Criminal Code* of Canada, specifically:  
- Subsection 84(1), which defines "prohibited firearm"  
- Subsection 117.15(1)a, which defines "prohibited device"  
**Issued by:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice  

**Regulatory Purpose:**  
This regulation establishes specific exclusions from the definitions of "prohibited firearm" and "prohibited device" in the *Criminal Code* for certain handguns used in international sporting competitions. The goal is to permit the lawful possession, use, and transport of these specific firearms in the context of competitive shooting events, without classifying them as illegal under the Code.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Exclusion from "Prohibited Firearm" (Section 84(1)(a)):**  
   - Handguns listed in the *Schedule* attached to the regulation are **excluded** from paragraph (a) of the definition of "prohibited firearm" under subsection 84(1) of the *Criminal Code*.  
   - This means that these specific handguns are **not considered prohibited firearms**, even though they are otherwise classified as handguns.  
   - The exclusion applies only to those firearms that are explicitly listed in the Schedule and are used in the context of international sporting competitions.

2. **Exclusion from "Prohibited Device" (Section 84(1)(b)):**  
   - A **handgun barrel** that is a component or part of a handgun referred to in *Section 1* (i.e., one of the handguns listed in the Schedule) is **excluded** from paragraph (b) of the definition of "prohibited device" under subsection 84(1) of the *Criminal Code*.  
   - This provision ensures that the individual barrel components of these sporting competition handguns are not treated as illegal devices under the Code, even if they are parts of a firearm.

---

### Scope and Application:

- The exclusions are **limited and specific** to firearms used in international sporting competitions.  
- The list of excluded handguns is detailed in the *Schedule* to the regulation, which includes models and types approved for use in such events (e.g., certain .22 caliber competition handguns).  
- The regulation does **not** extend to other types of firearms or to non-competitive uses.  
- The exclusions apply only to the **possession, use, and transport** of these firearms and components in the context of authorized sporting events.

---

### Legal Effect:

- By excluding these handguns and their barrels from the definitions of "prohibited firearm" and "prohibited device," the regulation effectively **removes criminal liability** for individuals who lawfully possess, use, or transport these specific firearms for the purpose of international sporting competition.  
- This aligns with broader policy goals of supporting legitimate sporting activities and international participation in shooting sports, while maintaining strict controls over firearms for general public use.

---

### Effective Date:

- These regulations **come into force on December 1, 1998**.  
- All provisions apply from that date forward, with no retroactive effect.

---

### Important Notes:

- The regulation is **not a general exemption** for all handguns. It applies only to those explicitly listed in the Schedule and used in international sporting competition.  
- The exclusion is conditional and tied to the **authorized use** in sporting events. Unauthorized possession or use of these firearms outside of such events may still constitute a criminal offence.  
- The regulation reflects a balance between public safety and the need to allow legitimate sporting activities, particularly those involving international participation.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a targeted legal exemption to allow international shooting sports competitors to possess and use specific competition handguns and their barrels without violating the *Criminal Code*. It demonstrates how Canadian law can accommodate legitimate, non-violent, and regulated uses of firearms in a structured and lawful manner.
