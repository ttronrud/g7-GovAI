The reference "[Repealed, SI/2016-40]" indicates that the regulation in question has been formally repealed by a statutory instrument (SI) dated 2016-40. However, no specific regulation is named or described in your query, only the fact that it is listed as repealed under that statutory instrument.

To provide a detailed summary, we would need the actual name or content of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2016-40. Without that, a precise summary cannot be constructed.

That said, here is a general explanation of what this designation means:

**Summary of "[Repealed, SI/2016-40]"**:

- **Repealed**: This means the regulation is no longer in force. It has been officially canceled or replaced by a new law or regulation.
- **SI/2016-40**: This refers to the Statutory Instrument numbered 40 of 2016. Statutory Instruments are a form of secondary (or delegated) legislation in the United Kingdom (and some other jurisdictions) used to implement or amend primary legislation.
- The repeal of a regulation by SI/2016-40 typically occurs when a new law renders the previous regulation obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent with current policy or legal standards.
- The repeal may be part of a broader legislative review or reform initiative (e.g., streamlining administrative procedures, improving clarity, or aligning with EU or domestic policy changes).

**Example Context (Hypothetical)**:
If SI/2016-40 repealed a regulation on "Permitted Use of Agricultural Land," the summary might state:
> "The regulation on permitted use of agricultural land, previously issued under the Agricultural Land Act 1985, was repealed by Statutory Instrument 2016 No. 40. This action was taken to modernize land use planning in response to new environmental protection standards and to align with updated rural development policies. The repeal means that the previous rules on land use are no longer enforceable, and any future land use decisions will be governed by the current planning framework or new legislation introduced in 2016."

**Important Note**:
To provide an accurate, detailed, and specific summary, the original regulation being repealed must be identified. Without that, the statement "[Repealed, SI/2016-40]" only confirms that the regulation is no longer valid and was formally removed by a UK statutory instrument from 2016.

👉 **Recommendation**: Please provide the full title or subject matter of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2016-40 (e.g., "Regulation on Vehicle Emissions," "Rules for School Safety," etc.) so that a detailed, accurate summary can be prepared.
