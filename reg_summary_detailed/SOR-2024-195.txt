**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) Order*

### **Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under **subsection 58(4)** and **paragraph 58(5)(a)** of the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, S.C. 2002, c. 29, and is governed by the provisions of **subsection 58(1)** and **58(2)** of the Act.

---

### **Background and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The **Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus)** is a native fish species listed as **endangered** in **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This listing means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and is protected under federal law.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat:**  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for the Spotted Gar was developed and is **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the **critical habitat** required for the species’ survival and recovery. Critical habitat is defined as the specific areas that are essential for the survival or recovery of a listed species.

3. **Exclusion of Certain Critical Habitat Under SARA:**  
   - Section **58(2)** of SARA identifies certain places (such as lands or waters under federal jurisdiction or managed by federal agencies) where critical habitat may be **excluded** from designation.  
   - The regulation specifically refers to a **portion of the critical habitat** that lies within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.  
   - Under **subsection 58(5)** of SARA, such a portion **must be excluded** from any designated critical habitat order.

4. **Consultation Requirement:**  
   - The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) is required, under **subsection 58(5)**, to **consult with the Minister responsible for Parks Canada Agency**, which is the **Minister of the Environment**, before issuing a critical habitat order.  
   - This consultation ensures that federal land and resource management decisions are coordinated with environmental and conservation interests.

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Application of SARA Section 58(1):**  
   - The provisions of **subsection 58(1)** apply to the **critical habitat** of the Spotted Gar, **except** for the portion that falls within the place referred to in **subsection 58(2)** of SARA.  
   - This means that the **designated critical habitat** will **exclude** the area that is subject to exclusion under subsection 58(2)(b).

2. **Repeal of Prior Order:**  
   - The previous **Critical Habitat of the Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) Order** (SOR/2017-264) is **repealed**.  
   - This indicates a **revision or update** to the critical habitat designation, reflecting new legal, scientific, or administrative considerations.

3. **New Designation Scope:**  
   - The new Order designates the **critical habitat** of the Spotted Gar, **excluding** the portion that lies in the place referenced in subsection 58(2)(b).  
   - This exclusion is legally required under SARA and ensures compliance with the Act’s provisions on federal land use and conservation.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   - The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).  
   - This ensures immediate legal effect once officially published and recognized.

### **Purpose and Implications:**

- **Conservation Objective:**  
  The regulation aims to protect the essential areas needed for the survival and recovery of the endangered Spotted Gar by legally designating critical habitat, while respecting federal land management responsibilities.

- **Legal Compliance:**  
  The Order ensures full compliance with SARA, particularly in:
  - Protecting species at risk,
  - Excluding areas where federal jurisdiction or management may conflict with conservation goals,
  - Following required consultation procedures with the Minister of the Environment.

- **Management and Protection:**  
  Once designated, the critical habitat will be protected from activities that could degrade or destroy it, unless such activities are authorized under specific exemptions or environmental assessments.

---

### **Key Dates and Significance:**

- **Issued:** September 20, 2024  
- **Repeals:** SOR/2017-264 (prior critical habitat order)  
- **Effective Upon Registration** (immediately after publication)

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a **revised and legally compliant designation** of the critical habitat for the endangered Spotted Gar. It reflects the ongoing efforts by the Government of Canada to implement the Species at Risk Act effectively by:

- Recognizing scientifically identified habitat needs,
- Excluding areas under federal jurisdiction where such designation may conflict with land use,
- Ensuring inter-ministerial consultation,
- Updating outdated designations to reflect current legal and ecological understanding.

The Order strengthens the conservation of the Spotted Gar and contributes to broader biodiversity protection goals under Canadian environmental law.
