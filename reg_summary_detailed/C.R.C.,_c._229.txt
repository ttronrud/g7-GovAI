**Detailed Summary of the *Prince Edward Island Hog Marketing Levies Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Prince Edward Island Hog Marketing Levies Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes a framework for the collection of marketing levies on hogs produced in Prince Edward Island (PEI), in accordance with the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act* (Act).

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the regulation of agricultural commodity marketing, including hogs. This Act authorizes the creation of marketing boards and plans to stabilize prices and ensure fair market outcomes.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Prince Edward Island Hog Commodity Marketing Board* (also referred to as "Office de commercialisation" in French). This body is established under the Act to manage the hog marketing system, including setting prices, administering the Hog Price Stabilization Plan, and collecting levies.

- **Hog**: Defined as any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) that is produced within the Province of Prince Edward Island. This definition ensures that only locally raised hogs are subject to the levy system.

- **Plan**: Refers to the *Prince Edward Island Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the structure, pricing mechanisms, and operational procedures for hog marketing, including the levy system.

- **Producer**: A person engaged in the actual production (raising and breeding) of hogs in PEI. Importantly, producers must **not** have been excluded from the Hog Price Stabilization Plan by the Commodity Board through regulatory action. This ensures that only active, compliant producers are subject to the levy.

### **3. Levy Requirements**

- **Mandatory Payment**: Every producer must pay an additional **marketing levy** to the Commodity Board, **in addition to service charges** already paid under the Hog Marketing Plan.

- **Levy Structure**:
  - The levy amount is determined by a schedule (attached to the Order), with specific amounts set out in **Column II**.
  - The levy is applied **per hog sold or delivered**.
  - The base price for the hog at which the levy applies is defined in **Column I** of the schedule. This means the levy is triggered when hogs are sold or delivered at or above a specified weekly base price.

- **Exemption Clause**:  
  No levy is payable on hogs that are **graded below Canada Index 67**.  
  This provision protects lower-quality hogs from contributing to the levy system, which may help prevent overburdening producers of substandard livestock or discourage the sale of low-grade animals.

### **4. Obligations of Hog Buyers (Processors)**

Any individual or entity that purchases hogs from a producer for processing (e.g., slaughter, rendering, or meat production) has two key responsibilities:

1. **Deduction from Purchase Price**:  
   The buyer must **deduct the full amount of levies** that were payable by the producer on the hogs being purchased. This ensures that the levy is not passed on to the processor but is instead collected directly by the Commodity Board.

2. **Payment to the Commodity Board**:  
   The deducted levies must be **paid to the Commodity Board** at its office in **Charlottetown, PEI**, **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the hogs were purchased**.  
   For example, if hogs were bought in March, the levy must be paid by April 15.

### **5. Reporting Requirements for Buyers**

Buyers are required to provide documentation to the Commodity Board to verify the levy deductions:

- **Copy of Grade Certificates**:  
  Buyers must supply copies of **grade certificates** issued by a certified grader under the *Hog Carcass Grading Regulations*. These certificates must include:
  - The purchase price of the hogs.
  - Any deductions made from that price (e.g., due to lower grade or weight).

- **Alternative Reporting Method**:  
  A buyer may **choose not to provide physical copies** of the grade certificates. Instead, they may submit the required information using **any data processing method approved by the Commodity Board**. This allows for modernization and efficiency in reporting, such as electronic data submissions or digital databases.

### **6. Purpose and Implications**

This regulation serves several key economic and regulatory functions:

- **Revenue Generation**: The levies generate funds for the Commodity Board to support market stability, price support mechanisms, and marketing initiatives.
- **Price Stabilization**: By collecting levies tied to base prices, the system helps manage price volatility in the hog market.
- **Quality-Based Exemption**: Exempting hogs below Canada Index 67 prevents the levy from being applied to lower-quality animals, protecting producers who may not meet higher standards.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The requirement to provide grade certificates or digital records ensures transparency in the transaction and helps the Board monitor market quality and pricing trends.
- **Efficiency and Modernization**: The option for digital reporting allows for faster, more scalable compliance, especially as the industry grows and adopts technology.

---

### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The Commodity Board has the authority to enforce compliance with the levy requirements.
- Failure to pay levies or to provide required documentation may result in penalties or legal action, though specific penalties are not detailed in this Order.
- The Board may update the approved data processing methods over time to reflect technological advancements.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prince Edward Island Hog Marketing Levies Order* creates a structured, transparent, and quality-sensitive system for collecting marketing levies on hogs produced in PEI. It ensures that producers contribute to market stability through a levy tied to base prices, while protecting lower-grade hogs from unnecessary fees. Buyers are required to deduct and remit these levies, with clear reporting obligations to maintain accountability. The inclusion of digital reporting options reflects a forward-looking approach to compliance in a modern agricultural market.

This regulation is a key component of the broader *Prince Edward Island Natural Products Marketing Act*, designed to support sustainable hog production, stabilize market prices, and promote equitable participation among producers.
