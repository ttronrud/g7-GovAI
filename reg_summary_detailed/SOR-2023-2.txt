**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Sri Lanka) Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

The **Special Economic Measures (Sri Lanka) Regulations** are a set of legal instruments enacted under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**, specifically in response to concerns over **gross and systematic human rights violations** in Sri Lanka. 

The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) has determined that such violations — including widespread abuses of power, suppression of dissent, targeting of political opponents, and violations of civil liberties — have occurred in Sri Lanka. As a result, Canada has imposed targeted economic sanctions to pressure the Sri Lankan government and associated individuals or entities to cease these violations and uphold international human rights standards.

These regulations are designed to **restrict financial and economic interactions** with individuals and entities linked to the Sri Lankan government or those who have participated in or supported human rights abuses.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulations derive their authority from several provisions of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**:

- **Section 4(1)(a)** – Allows the Governor in Council to impose measures on individuals or entities involved in gross and systematic human rights violations.
- **Section 4(1.1)(b)** – Enables measures targeting persons who are current or former senior officials of the government.
- **Section 4(2)(c)** – Provides for measures against persons associated with those identified as violating human rights.
- **Section 4(3)** – Grants authority to target entities owned or controlled by such individuals or the state.

The regulations are issued under **S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(1)** and **(2)**, and are supported by earlier statutory frameworks including **S.C. 2017, c. 21, s. 17(2)** and **S.C. 1992, c. 17** (the original SEMA framework).
