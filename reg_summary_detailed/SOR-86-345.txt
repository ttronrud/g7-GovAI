### **Detailed Summary of the Technical Data Control Regulations**

---

#### **Overview**

The **Technical Data Control Regulations** (TDCR) are a set of administrative rules issued under **Section 26 of the Defence Production Act**, by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Supply and Services. These regulations establish a formal framework for the **control, access, and use of unclassified technical data** that disclose **critical technology**—particularly in contexts involving national security and defence industrial capabilities.

The primary objective is to **protect Canada’s critical defence-related technologies** from unauthorized disclosure, especially to foreign entities, while allowing legitimate commercial and governmental use by qualified Canadian contractors.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Array of design or manufacturing know-how** | Technical information (e.g., design data, specifications, processes, testing techniques) required to develop, produce, or utilize a product or system. |
| **Canadian contractor** | A person who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, located in Canada, or a corporation incorporated under Canadian law. |
| **Canadian government agency** | Departments, departmental corporations, or Crown corporations listed in **Schedule I** (e.g., Department of National Defence, Industry Canada). |

## **Certification Process for Canadian Contractors**

### 1. **Eligibility**
- Only **certified contractors** are eligible to obtain unclassified technical data.

### 2. **Application Requirements**
A Canadian contractor must apply to the **Joint Certification Office (JCO)** using a standardized form and certify the following:

#### a) Custodian of Data
- The person acting as custodian of unclassified technical data must be a **Canadian citizen or permanent resident**.

#### b) Purpose of Data Request
- The data must be needed for:
  - Bidding or performing on contracts with:
    - A Canadian government agency,
    - The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), or
    - Another Canadian or U.S. government agency.
  - Or for **other legitimate business activities** the contractor is engaged in or plans to engage in.

#### c) Compliance with Export Controls
- Acknowledges responsibility under **Canadian export control laws**.
- Agrees **not to disseminate** data in a way that violates Canadian export control laws.

#### d) Access Restrictions
- No employee or agent with access to data may:
  - Be debarred or suspended from government contracts;
  - Have violated U.S. export control laws;
  - Be convicted of violating Canadian export control laws;
  - Have had their certification revoked under this regulation or Directive 5230.25.

#### e) Contractor’s Own Eligibility
- The contractor must affirm it:
  - Is not debarred or suspended from government contracts;
  - Has not violated U.S. or Canadian export control laws;
  - Has not had certification revoked.

### 3. **Disclosure of Business Activities**
- Contractors must **disclose all relevant business activities** where they plan to use the data. This allows the JCO to evaluate whether the data request is properly related to legitimate operations.

### 4. **Extenuating Circumstances**
- If a contractor cannot truthfully certify under (e) or (f), it may submit **written extenuating circumstances** to request acceptance of the application.

### 5. **Truthfulness and Accuracy**
- The contractor must **attest that all information provided is true, complete, accurate, and given in good faith**.

### 6. **Additional Information Requests**
- If the JCO requires further details, the contractor must provide them.

## **Review and Decision Process**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | JCO receives application and may accept it directly. |
| **Step 2** | If the JCO refers the application to a designated officer of the **Department of Supply and Services**, the officer reviews and decides to accept or reject it. |
| **Step 3** | If rejected, the contractor has **20 working days** to request a **review by the Deputy Minister of Supply and Services**. The Deputy Minister may accept or confirm rejection. |
| **Step 4** | If accepted, the contractor is certified for a **five-year period**, unless revoked earlier. |

> This process ensures due diligence and transparency in certification decisions.

---

## **Suspension of Certification**

The Minister may **suspend** a certified contractor’s eligibility to obtain technical data if credible information shows that the contractor:

- Has violated any provision of these regulations;
- Has contravened Canadian export control laws;
- Failed to comply with any certification statements;
- Omitted or misrepresented material facts in the application;
- Made false certifications in bad faith.

### Key Points:
- A **notice of suspension** must state the reason in sufficient detail for the contractor to make representations.
- The contractor may **make written representations** to the Minister to challenge the suspension.
  - If the Minister determines that:
    - The reason no longer exists, or
    - The decision was incorrect,
    then the suspension is **removed**.
- If the contractor **fails to respond within 20 working days**, the Minister may **revoke** the certification.

---

## **Revocation of Certification**

- If the Minister revokes certification (due to violation, misrepresentation, or failure to comply), they must provide **written notice**.
- Within **30 days**, the contractor may submit **new or additional information** to request reconsideration.
- The Minister will **reconsider the revocation** and issue a written decision on whether to **restore certification**.

> This provides a meaningful appeal mechanism and protects legitimate contractors from unjust revocation.

---

## **Requesting and Receiving Technical Data**

### 1. **How to Request**
- A certified contractor submits a **written request** to the Canadian government agency that administers and controls the data.

### 2. **Request Must Include**
- A clear statement of **intended use** of the unclassified technical data.

### 3. **Conditions for Release**
A Canadian government agency may **refuse to release** data if:

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Certification is suspended | Contractor is under suspension. |
| Data not properly related to disclosed business activity | The use does not align with the contractor’s certified activities. |
| Purpose threatens Canada’s military advantage | The use may jeopardize Canada’s technological or operational military capabilities. |

> If the agency is uncertain about whether a purpose violates this rule, it may:
- Request **additional information** on the intended use; or
- Ask the contractor to submit a **new certification application** under Section 6.

### 4. **Agency Authority to Restrict Use**
- The agency may:
  - **Refuse release** for national security reasons;
  - **Authorize release with restrictions or limitations** (e.g., time-bound, geographic, or recipient limitations);
  - Require the contractor to enter into a **use agreement** outlining:
    - Payment obligations;
    - Rights and responsibilities of both parties;
    - Safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.

> This ensures that even when data is released, it is used responsibly and securely.

---

## **Use and Disclosure of Data**

### 1. **Prohibited Use**
- A certified contractor **must use the data only for purposes** disclosed in the certification application.

### 2. **Prohibited Disclosure**
- The contractor **shall not disclose** the data to any person **other than another certified contractor** involved in a related business activity.

> This prevents leakage to unqualified or foreign parties.
