**Detailed Summary of the Railway Running-Trades Employees Hours of Work Regulations**

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Railway Running-Trades Employees Hours of Work Regulations*. It may be cited as such and serves to establish specific provisions regarding the working hours of certain railway employees in Canada.

---

**2. Reference to the "Act"**  
The term *"Act"* in these Regulations refers to *Part III of the Canada Labour Code*. This part governs workplace conditions, including the hours of work, rest periods, and working time limits for employees in various sectors. The Regulations are designed to apply within the framework of this legislation, with specific exemptions for certain railway personnel.

**3. Exempted Employee Classes**  
The following classes of railway employees are explicitly **exempted** from the application of **Sections 169 and 171 of the Canada Labour Code**:

- Yardmasters  
- Assistant yardmasters  
- Locomotive engineers  
- Locomotive firemen (helpers)  
- Hostlers  
- Train conductors  
- Train baggagemen  
- Brakemen  
- Yard foremen  
- Yardmen  
- Switch tenders  
- Car retarder operators  

**Important Note**: This exemption applies only to employees working in railroads that fall within the **legislative authority of Parliament**. This means that the regulations do not extend to railway operations governed by provincial labor laws or those under provincial jurisdiction.

**4. Application of Section 173 of the Canada Labour Code**  
Section 173 of the Canada Labour Code generally requires that work hours be scheduled and worked in accordance with the maximum daily and weekly working time limits (e.g., 12 hours per day, 48 hours per week, with rest periods). However, these Regulations **specifically provide that hours of work may be scheduled and actually worked without regard to Section 173**.

This means that for the exempted railway employees listed above, railway operators may:

- Schedule work shifts that exceed standard working hour limits under Section 173;  
- Work longer hours (e.g., extended shifts, night shifts, or overtime) without being subject to the daily or weekly cap;  
- Deviate from standard rest and break requirements as outlined in Section 173, provided such deviations are justified by operational necessity and safety requirements.

This exemption is intended to accommodate the unique demands of railway operations—such as 24/7 service, safety-critical scheduling, and the need for continuous operations—where strict adherence to general working hour limits may compromise operational efficiency or safety.

---

**5. Purpose and Context**  
The primary purpose of these Regulations is to recognize the specialized and often demanding nature of railway operations. The exemption allows rail operators to maintain operational continuity and flexibility in scheduling while still complying with broader labor standards, provided that the exemptions are limited to the specified roles and railroads under federal jurisdiction.

The exemption does not imply a waiver of all labor protections. It only removes the specific application of Sections 169 (which relates to maximum daily working hours) and 171 (which relates to weekly working hours) for these employees. Other provisions of the Canada Labour Code (such as minimum wage, rest periods, or leave entitlements) may still apply unless otherwise specified.

---

**6. Limitations and Scope**  
- The exemption applies **only** to employees in the listed classes.  
- It applies **only** to railroads operating under the authority of Parliament (i.e., federally regulated railroads, such as those under Transport Canada).  
- The exemption does **not** extend to employees in non-railway or non-operational roles (e.g., clerical staff, maintenance workers not in running trades).  
- The exemption does **not** relieve rail operators of their duty to ensure safe working conditions or to provide reasonable rest periods, especially in cases of fatigue or safety risks.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Railway Running-Trades Employees Hours of Work Regulations* provide a targeted exemption from key working hour restrictions in the Canada Labour Code for a defined group of railway operational staff. By exempting these employees from Sections 169 and 171 and allowing work schedules to be set without regard to Section 173, the regulations support the operational demands of the rail industry. However, such flexibility is limited in scope and jurisdiction, and is intended to balance labor standards with the practical realities of railway operations under federal oversight.
