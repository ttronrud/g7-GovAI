### **Background and Context**

This proclamation is a formal legal instrument issued under the authority of the *Government Corporations Operation Act (GCOA)*, which governs the structure, operations, and financial accountability of government-owned corporations in Canada. The key purpose of this proclamation is to **declare that the Government Corporations Operation Act applies to Project Deliver I Ltd.**, thereby subjecting the corporation to the regulatory, governance, and financial provisions of the Act.

### **Key Provisions and Reasons for the Proclamation**

1. **Legal Basis: Section 6 of the Government Corporations Operation Act**  
   - Section 6 of the GCOA stipulates that the Act only applies to a corporation *from the date of issue of a proclamation* by the Governor in Council declaring its applicability.  
   - This proclamation fulfills that requirement for Project Deliver I Ltd.

2. **Order in Council P.C. 2018-0681 (June 1, 2018)**  
   - On June 1, 2018, the Governor in Council issued Order in Council P.C. 2018-0681, which directed that a proclamation be issued declaring the GCOA applicable to the corporation known as **10804126 CANADA INC.**  
   - This order serves as the administrative and legal foundation for the subsequent proclamation.

3. **Corporate Name Change**  
   - On June 12, 2018, the corporate name of 10804126 CANADA INC. was officially changed to **Project Deliver I Ltd.**  
   - This name change is a procedural update to reflect the entity’s purpose and branding, but it does not alter the legal identity or ownership of the corporation.

4. **Legal Status and Ownership**  
   - Project Deliver I Ltd. is a corporation incorporated under the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (CBCA).  
   - It is a **wholly-owned subsidiary** of the **Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDIC)**.  
   - Under **Section 3 of the Government Corporations Operation Act**, the CDIC is designated as an **agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.  
   - As a result, all issued shares of Project Deliver I Ltd. are legally **owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada**—meaning the corporation is effectively a government-owned entity.

5. **Application of the Government Corporations Operation Act**  
   - By this proclamation, the Governor in Council **formally declares** that the *Government Corporations Operation Act* applies to **Project Deliver I Ltd.**  
   - This declaration brings the corporation under the Act’s framework, which includes:
     - Governance requirements (e.g., board structure, accountability)
     - Financial reporting and transparency
     - Compliance with public accountability standards
     - Oversight by the federal government and its institutions

---

### **Legal and Political Significance**

- **Government Accountability:** The proclamation ensures that Project Deliver I Ltd. operates under clear, transparent, and accountable governance structures, consistent with Canada’s public sector accountability standards.
- **Fiscal and Administrative Integration:** By applying the GCOA, the corporation is integrated into the broader federal government’s corporate governance framework, allowing for centralized oversight and financial control.
- **Public Interest Justification:** The corporation is likely involved in strategic public investment or infrastructure projects (as suggested by the name "Project Deliver I"), and its formal status under the GCOA supports public trust and transparency.

---

### **Legal Effect**

- This proclamation is **binding on all persons** who are affected by or involved with Project Deliver I Ltd.  
- It establishes that the corporation is a **government corporation** for all legal and administrative purposes, including:
  - Financial reporting to the federal government
  - Compliance with audit and disclosure requirements
  - Accountability to Parliament and public oversight bodies
- It also triggers the application of the GCOA’s provisions, including those related to:
  - Board appointments
  - Shareholder rights (in this case, the Crown as the sole shareholder)
  - Financial management and expenditure controls

---

### **Conclusion**

This proclamation is a formal and legally binding declaration that **Project Deliver I Ltd.**, formerly known as 10804126 CANADA INC., is now a government corporation subject to the *Government Corporations Operation Act*. It reflects the federal government’s intent to ensure that strategic investment entities operate with transparency, accountability, and alignment with public interest principles. The proclamation is grounded in statutory authority, administrative procedures, and the legal status of the Canada Development Investment Corporation as a Crown agent.

---

**Note:**  
The proclamation does not alter the corporation’s operational activities or mandate specific project outcomes. It only establishes the legal framework under which the corporation must operate—particularly in terms of governance, financial oversight, and accountability to the Crown and the public.

---

**Final Statement:**  
*All persons affected by this proclamation are required to take notice and govern themselves accordingly.*  

This is a standard form of legal notification in Canadian administrative law, ensuring that stakeholders, including employees, contractors, regulators, and the public, are aware of the corporation’s new legal status and obligations.
