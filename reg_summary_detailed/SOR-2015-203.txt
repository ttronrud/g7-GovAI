**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Judicial Council Inquiries and Investigations By-laws, 2015**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Judicial Council Inquiries and Investigations By-laws, 2015* (the "By-laws") were adopted by the **Canadian Judicial Council (CJC)** on **July 28, 2015**, pursuant to **subsection 61(3) of the Judges Act (R.S., c. J-1)**. These by-laws establish a formal, structured, and transparent process for handling complaints or allegations against judges of superior courts in Canada. The goal is to ensure that such matters are investigated fairly, independently, and with due regard to public interest, judicial integrity, and the rule of law.

The By-laws govern the procedures for:
- Establishing a **Judicial Conduct Review Panel** when a complaint may warrant judicial removal;
- Forming an **Inquiry Committee** to conduct a full investigation;
- Conducting the inquiry itself;
- Reviewing the findings and deciding whether to recommend removal of a judge from office;
- Ensuring procedural fairness, transparency, and accountability throughout the process.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Judges Act*, which provides the legal framework for the appointment, conduct, and removal of judges.

2. **"Senior Member"**  
   Defined as:
   - The longest-serving **eligible member of the Judicial Conduct Committee** who has not previously considered the matter; or
   - If no member of the Judicial Conduct Committee is available, then the longest-serving **member of the Council** who has not previously considered the matter.  
   This role is central to appointment decisions and ensures continuity and seniority-based fairness.

## **Step-by-Step Process for Handling Complaints or Allegations**

### **1. Initial Assessment by the Judicial Conduct Committee**

- The **Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson of the Judicial Conduct Committee** may determine that a complaint or allegation is serious enough to potentially warrant the **removal of a judge**.
- If so, they may establish a **Judicial Conduct Review Panel** to assess whether an **Inquiry Committee** should be formed.

> This step acts as a gatekeeping mechanism to prevent unnecessary or frivolous inquiries.

---

### **2. Composition of the Judicial Conduct Review Panel**

- The **Senior Member** designates the members of the panel.
- The panel consists of **five individuals**:
  - **Three members of the Canadian Judicial Council** (CJC);
  - **One puisne judge** (a judge not serving as a Chief Justice or acting in a leadership role);
  - **One non-judge, non-bar member** (i.e., someone not part of the legal profession or provincial bar).

> This composition ensures balance between judicial independence, legal expertise, and public accountability.

---

### **3. Decision by the Judicial Conduct Review Panel**

- The panel may decide:
  - **To constitute an Inquiry Committee** only if it determines the matter is serious enough to warrant the **possible removal** of the judge.
  - **To reject the formation of an Inquiry Committee**, in which case the matter is returned to the Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson of the Judicial Conduct Committee for further action (e.g., internal review, informal resolution, or dismissal).

> This ensures that only serious allegations proceed to a full investigation.

---

### **4. Notification and Documentation**

If the panel decides to proceed with an Inquiry Committee:
- The **Council’s Executive Director** must send a formal letter to the **complainant**, if any.
- The panel must prepare:
  - **Written reasons** for its decision;
  - A **statement of issues** to guide the Inquiry Committee’s inquiry.

These documents are then sent to:
- The **judge**;
- The **judge’s Chief Justice**;
- The **Minister of Justice**;
- The **Inquiry Committee** (once constituted).

Additionally, the Executive Director sends a **notice to the Minister** requesting that they designate members of the provincial bar to join the Inquiry Committee.

---

### **5. Formation of the Inquiry Committee**

- The Inquiry Committee is composed of an **odd number of members**, designated by the **Senior Member**.
- The **majority of members must be from the Council**, ensuring that the process remains within the oversight structure of the CJC.
- If the **Minister fails to designate any bar members within 60 days** of receiving the notice:
  - The **Senior Member may designate additional Council members** to complete the committee.

> This safeguards against delays in forming a fully representative committee.

---

### **6. Eligibility Restrictions for Inquiry Committee Members**

The following individuals are **excluded** from serving on the Inquiry Committee:
- The **Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson** of the Judicial Conduct Committee who referred the matter;
- A **member of the same court** as the judge under inquiry;
- A **member of the Judicial Conduct Review Panel** who participated in the decision to form the Inquiry Committee.

> These restrictions prevent conflicts of interest and ensure impartiality.

---

### **7. Powers and Procedures of the Inquiry Committee**

- **Engagement of legal counsel and advisors** is permitted to assist in the inquiry.
- The Committee may consider **any complaint or allegation** brought to its attention.
- It must **take into account** the written reasons and statement of issues from the Judicial Conduct Review Panel.

  - **Inform the judge** of all complaints or allegations;
  - Provide the judge with **sufficient time to respond** fully;
  - Set a **reasonable time limit** for responses, notify the judge of it, and consider any comments received within that time.

> This ensures due process and the judge’s right to be heard.

---

### **8. Public Hearings and Confidentiality**

- Hearings are **public by default**, unless the Inquiry Committee determines that:
  - The **public interest** and **due administration of justice** require that part or all of the hearing be conducted in private.

> This balances transparency with the need to protect sensitive information or privacy.

- The Committee may:
  - **Prohibit publication** of documents or information if it determines publication would harm the public interest;
  - Take **measures to protect identities**, including individuals who have given confidentiality assurances.

> This protects privacy and prevents reputational harm while preserving accountability.

---

### **9. Principles of Fairness**

- The Inquiry Committee must conduct its inquiry in accordance with the **principle of fairness** — ensuring equal treatment, procedural justice, and respect for all parties.

---

### **10. Submission of the Report**

- After completing the inquiry, the Inquiry Committee must submit a **detailed report** to the Council containing:
  - Its **findings**;
  - Its **conclusions** regarding whether to recommend the **removal of the judge** from office.

> This report becomes the foundation for the Council’s final decision.

- The Executive Director must:
  - Provide a copy of the report to:
    - The **judge**;
    - Any other persons or bodies with standing in the hearing;
    - The **complainant**, if any;
  - If the hearing was public, the report must be **made available to the public** and provided to the complainant.

---

### **11. Judge’s Right to Respond**

- Within **30 days** of receiving the report, the judge may submit a **written response** to the Council.
- If the judge requests an extension, the Council may grant it **if it determines that the extension is in the public interest**.

> This ensures the judge has a meaningful opportunity to respond to the findings.

---

### **12. Council Deliberations on Removal**

- The **Senior Member** chairs any Council meetings related to the **removal of a judge**.
- A **quorum of 17 members** is required for such deliberations.
- If a member dies, resigns, becomes incapacitated, or retires during deliberations, the **remaining members constitute a quorum**.

> This ensures that decisions are made by a sufficiently large and representative body.

- During deliberations:
  - The **chairperson may vote only in the event of a tie**.
  - Meetings may be held via **audio or video conference**, allowing flexibility and accessibility.

---

### **13. Council’s Consideration of the Report**
