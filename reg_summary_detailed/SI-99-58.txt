**Regulatory Summary: Designation of Ministers under the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Implementation Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under **Section 5 of the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Implementation Act (S.C. 1997, c. 33)**. This provision empowers the Governor General to designate specific Ministers of the Crown to act as responsible authorities for administering and enforcing the provisions of the Act.

The Act is part of Canada’s implementation of the **1997 Ottawa Convention (also known as the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention)**, an international treaty aimed at eliminating the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel mines—explosive devices designed to injure or kill personnel.

**2. Key Designations and Responsibilities**

The regulation designates three different Ministers to oversee specific sections of the Act, based on the nature and scope of those provisions:

**a) Minister of Foreign Affairs**  
- **Designated for**: All provisions of the Act **except** Sections 8, 9, 10, and 22.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Oversees Canada’s international obligations and diplomatic engagement related to the Convention.  
  - Manages Canada’s participation in international negotiations, reporting, and compliance with the Ottawa Convention.  
  - Responsible for foreign policy aspects such as treaty ratification, cooperation with other states, and implementation of international standards.  
  - Ensures that Canada fulfills its commitments under the Convention in a multilateral context.

> *Note: This Minister is not responsible for domestic implementation of mine clearance or safety regulations, which fall under other departments.*

**b) Minister of National Defence**  
- **Designated for**: Sections 8, 9, 10, and 18 of the Act.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Oversees the military’s role in the implementation of the Convention.  
  - Manages the use, storage, disposal, and destruction of anti-personnel mines within Canadian defence operations or military stockpiles.  
  - Ensures compliance with the Convention in relation to military activities, including the use of mines in training or operations (where applicable).  
  - Responsible for implementing the provisions related to the prohibition of the use of anti-personnel mines by the Canadian Armed Forces.  
  - Specifically covers the obligations under Sections 8 (prohibition of use), 9 (prohibition of stockpiling), 10 (prohibition of transfer), and 18 (reporting and monitoring requirements).

> *Note: This designation applies to military and defence-related activities only.*

**c) Minister of Public Works and Government Services**  
- **Designated for**: Sections 18 and 22 of the Act.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Manages the administrative and operational aspects of the Convention’s implementation at the federal level.  
  - Oversees the coordination of federal government activities related to mine clearance, reporting, and compliance.  
  - Responsible for the implementation of Section 18, which involves reporting requirements and monitoring of compliance with the Convention.  
  - Responsible for Section 22, which relates to the destruction of stockpiled anti-personnel mines and the management of disposal processes.  
  - Coordinates with other departments to ensure that federal government assets and infrastructure are free from mine hazards and that compliance is properly documented and reported.

> *Note: This Minister plays a key role in the internal administrative and logistical execution of the Convention.*

---

**3. Rationale and Significance**  
The division of responsibilities among the Ministers reflects the distinct domains of each department:  
- **Foreign Affairs** handles international diplomacy and treaty obligations.  
- **National Defence** manages military compliance and operational restrictions.  
- **Public Works and Government Services** manages federal administrative compliance, reporting, and disposal.  

This structure ensures that each aspect of the Convention’s implementation is handled by the appropriate department with relevant expertise and authority.

---

**4. Exclusions and Limitations**  
- Sections 8, 9, 10, and 22 are **not** assigned to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. These are specifically assigned to either the Minister of National Defence or the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, as appropriate.  
- The designation is **specific to the purposes of the Act** and does not confer broader powers beyond those defined by the Act.  
- The designation is **temporary and procedural**, serving to clarify administrative responsibility under the law, not to create new legal rights or obligations.

---

**5. Conclusion**  
This regulation establishes a clear and functional framework for the implementation of Canada’s obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention. By assigning specific Ministers to key sections of the Act, it ensures accountability, efficiency, and alignment with the respective mandates of each department. It supports Canada’s commitment to global disarmament and the protection of civilians from the dangers posed by anti-personnel mines.
