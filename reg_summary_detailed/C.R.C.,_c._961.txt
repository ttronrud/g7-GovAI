**Detailed Summary of the Indian Timber Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the *Indian Timber Regulations* and may be cited as such. It governs the cutting, harvesting, measurement, payment of dues, and management of timber on **surrendered lands** and **reserve lands** held by Indigenous bands in Canada.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The following terms are defined within the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Indian Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the governance of Indigenous reserves and related rights.
- **Department**: The *Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development* (now known as Indigenous Services Canada), responsible for administering the regulations.
- **Dues**: Charges (stumpage or royalty) imposed for the right to cut or harvest timber.
- **Licence (or Permit)**: A formal written authorization issued by the Minister allowing a band, individual member, or group to cut timber on reserve or surrendered lands.
- **Limit**: The geographic area covered by a licence or permit.
- **Minister**: The head of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
- **Person**: Includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, firms, or syndicates.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to the **cutting of timber on surrendered lands and reserve lands**.
- They **do not apply** where the *Indian Timber Harvesting Regulations* (a separate set of rules) are in force.

---

### **4. Licensing Requirements**
No person may legally cut timber on reserve or surrendered lands **without a valid licence or permit**.

#### **Types of Permits/Licences**
- **Permits for Free Use (No Dues)**:
  - Can be issued by the Minister to:
    - A band for **band purposes**, or
    - A member or group of members for **personal use** (e.g., fuel wood).
  - These permits are free of dues.

- **Permits for Sale (With Dues)**:
  - Require **consent from the band council**.
  - Allow cutting of timber for **commercial sale**.
  - Dues are charged at prevailing rates and may be reduced to **half** for individual holdings of Indigenous persons.

> *Note: The provision on dues being reduced to half was repealed by SOR/94-690, s.1.*

---

### **5. Measurement and Payment of Dues**
- All timber cut under a permit or licence must be **measured** by:
  - A **licensed scaler**, or
  - A competent person appointed by the Minister.
- Measurement must occur:
  - At the **place of cutting**, or
  - At a **concentration point adjacent** to it.
  - In **British Columbia**, measurement may also occur at a point **between the cutting site and the mill**.

#### **Restrictions on Timber Movement**
- Timber **cannot be manufactured or removed** from the cutting site or concentration point **until**:
  - It has been measured, and
  - Dues have been paid.
- **Exception**: In British Columbia, this restriction applies only if the timber is not being transported to a mill.

> *Note: This restriction was previously linked to a revoked section (SOR/93-244, s.2), which may indicate outdated or superseded provisions.*

---

### **6. Duration of Permits and Licences**
- **Permits** expire on **April 30** of the year following the year of issue.
- **Licences** expire on **April 30** of the year following the year of grant, **unless otherwise specified**.

#### **Renewal Requirements**
- Applications for renewal must be submitted **during the term** of the licence.
- If not submitted within **30 days of expiry**, the licence **automatically terminates**.
- If the licensee fails to operate during the licence year, they must provide a **sworn statement** explaining the reasons.
- Renewal is **only granted** if the Minister is satisfied with the explanation.

---

### **7. Ground Rent (Annual Fee)**
- A **ground rent** is payable annually at:
  - **$10 per square mile** (for most provinces), **except British Columbia**, where it is:
    - **$0.20 per acre**.
- **Minimum annual rent**: **$40** (regardless of actual area or size).
- *Note: This provision was previously revoked by SOR/93-244, s.2 — suggesting it may no longer be in effect.*

---

### **8. Security Deposit**
- Every licence includes a **security deposit** equal to **15% of the estimated dues** under the licence.
- This deposit:
  - Is held by the Minister.
  - Can be **applied to unpaid dues in arrears**.
  - Must be **restored to full value** before the licence can be renewed.
- If the licensee fails to comply with licence terms or operations are unsatisfactory, the **deposit may be forfeited to the Crown** (i.e., the federal government) for the benefit of the band.

---

### **9. Timber Management and Environmental Considerations**
- The Minister may, with consent of the licensee, **vary** the licence to:
  - Change parts of the licensed area, or
  - Alter types, sizes, or species of timber allowed.
- For **forest management, watershed protection, fire prevention, or landscape preservation**, the Minister may:
  - Order specific trees to be **left standing or cut**.
  - Require the licensee to **pay for marking** such trees.

> *Note: This provision was revoked by SOR/93-244, s.2 — indicating it may no longer be active.*

---

### **10. Compliance with Provincial Laws**
- Licensees must operate in accordance with:
  - Provincial laws on **slash disposal**, **fire hazard prevention**, and **timber operations**.

---

### **11. Seizure and Detention of Timber**
The Minister has the authority to **seize and detain** timber or products derived from it if there is **reasonable grounds** to believe that:

1. The timber was **not measured** by a scaler as required;
2. Charges (dues) are **in default**;
3. The timber was **not cut under a valid licence or permit**.

#### **Seizure Procedures**
- Timber may be seized by **posting a notice** beside it.
- If timber is mixed with other timber (e.g., in a crib, dam, or raft), the **entire batch may be seized** until separated and verified.
- The Minister may **direct the carrier** to transport the seized timber to a designated location.
- The Department may **cover transportation and other costs**, which are **included in the seizure costs**.
- **No lien** is lost for the carrier during seizure.

#### **Forfeiture**
- If no claim is made within **30 days** of seizure, the timber is **forfeited to the Crown**.

#### **Legal Claims and Court Proceedings**
- A person claiming ownership may:
  - Apply to a **court of competent jurisdiction** with **at least four days’ notice**.
  - Submit a **bond** (with two sureties) equal to the market value of the timber and costs of seizure.
  - The bond is forfeited if the judge determines the claimant is **not the rightful owner**.
- The judge may:
  - Order release and delivery of the timber to the claimant **free of dues**, or
  - Order delivery **subject to payment of dues**.
  - Declare the claimant **not the owner**, in which case the bond is forfeited.
- The Minister or claimant may request a **seven-day notice** for a final determination of ownership.

#### **Costs**
- The judge determines **all costs** of the proceedings and seizure.

#### **Disposal of Non-Claimed Timber**
- If ownership is not established, the Minister may dispose of the timber as they see fit.

### **12. Penalties for Violations**
Any person who violates these regulations is guilty of an **offence** and may be:
- **Fined up to $100**, or
- **Imprisoned for up to 3 months**, or
- **Both fined and imprisoned**.

---

### **13. Key Provisions That Have Been Repealed or Revoked**
Several sections have been **revoked** through statutory orders, indicating they are no longer in force:

| Section | Revocation | Reason |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Assistant Deputy Minister | SOR/93-244, s.2 | Position abolished |
| Ground Rent (rent rate) | SOR/93-244, s.2 | Removed from regulations |
| Tree marking orders | SOR/93-244, s.2 | Removed from regulations |
| Security deposit forfeiture (specific conditions) | SOR/93-244, s.2 | Possibly outdated or replaced |

> These revocations suggest that the **current version of the Indian Timber Regulations is outdated or partially superseded** by newer legislation or policy. The original intent of these regulations—protecting Indigenous land rights, ensuring fair timber harvesting, and promoting environmental stewardship—has likely been addressed through updated frameworks.
