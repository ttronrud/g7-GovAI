The regulation you provided is a formal government announcement issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, and it relates to the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)** in Canada.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Text:**
> "Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, hereby acknowledges receipt of the assessments done pursuant to subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) with respect to the species set out in the annexed Schedule. S.C. 2002, c. 29"

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Legal Authority**:
   - The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, which is the formal mechanism by which federal government ministers (in this case, the Minister of the Environment) can make decisions on behalf of the Crown.
   - It operates under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which was enacted in 2002 (as referenced by S.C. 2002, c. 29 — the Statutory Instrument number).

2. **Purpose**:
   - The regulation serves to **formally acknowledge receipt** of scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**.
   - These assessments are critical in determining the **status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern)** of wildlife species in Canada.

3. **Legal Basis**:
   - The assessments are required under **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act**.
     - Subsection 23(1) mandates that COSEWIC must assess the status of wildlife species at risk and provide a scientific report to the Minister of the Environment.
     - The Minister is then required to consider these assessments when making decisions about species protection under SARA.

4. **Scope**:
   - The regulation specifically refers to **species listed in the annexed Schedule** (a formal list of species included in the assessment).
   - These species are subject to formal evaluation by COSEWIC and are now officially recognized by the federal government as having been assessed under the legal framework of SARA.

5. **Significance**:
   - This acknowledgment is a **formal step in the SARA process**.
   - It confirms that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific findings from COSEWIC.
   - This step is a prerequisite for the Minister to proceed with potential **protection measures**, such as listing a species as endangered or threatened, or developing recovery strategies.

6. **Implications**:
   - Once a species is formally assessed and acknowledged, it may be eligible for:
     - Official listing under SARA.
     - Protection under federal laws.
     - Development of recovery plans.
     - Funding and policy interventions to prevent extinction.

### Context within SARA:

- **COSEWIC** is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada.
- Its assessments are **not binding**, but they are **mandatory** under SARA and serve as the foundation for federal decisions.
- The Governor General’s acknowledgment ensures that the government recognizes the scientific basis for any proposed actions.

### Conclusion:

This regulation is a procedural and administrative instrument that **formally recognizes the completion and submission of COSEWIC assessments** for specific species under the Species at Risk Act. It marks a key milestone in the species protection process by confirming that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific evaluations, enabling the Minister to proceed with legal and policy actions, such as species listing or recovery planning. It underscores the importance of science-based decision-making in Canadian environmental policy.

> **Note**: This regulation (S.C. 2002, c. 29) is part of the implementation of SARA and reflects the government’s commitment to using scientific data in protecting biodiversity.
