- These types of orders are used to amend, update, or repeal existing regulations under federal statutes.

#### 3. **Purpose of the Repeal**
- Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They conflict with newer legislation.
  - They are redundant or duplicated in other regulations.
  - They have been superseded by more modern, comprehensive, or better-designed rules.
- The exact reason for the repeal of the regulation in question is not included in the provided text, but such repeals are typically part of a broader effort to **streamline regulatory frameworks**, improve clarity, or align with current policy goals.
