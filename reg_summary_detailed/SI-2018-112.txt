The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically from the *Statutes of Canada, 2002, c. 29*. Here is a detailed and accurate summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the Species at Risk Act

**Date of Issuance:**  
2002 (as part of S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment

**Purpose:**  
This regulation serves to formally acknowledge that the Government of Canada has received and accepted the scientific assessments of species at risk prepared by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**, as required under subsection **23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA).

---

**Key Provisions and Context:**

1. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act*, which mandates that the Minister of the Environment must, upon the recommendation of COSEWIC, receive and consider scientific assessments of species that are at risk of extinction. These assessments are critical for determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under SARA.

2. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent, scientific committee composed of experts in wildlife biology, ecology, and conservation. It evaluates the status of wildlife species in Canada and provides scientific assessments based on the best available data. These assessments are the foundation for federal policy decisions under SARA.

3. **Content of the Regulation:**  
   The regulation explicitly acknowledges the receipt of COSEWIC’s assessments for a specific list of species—listed in an **annexed schedule** (not included in the text provided). This schedule identifies species that have been evaluated by COSEWIC and are subject to formal review under SARA.

4. **Effect of the Order:**  
   - The formal acceptance of these assessments by the federal government initiates the next step in the SARA process: the potential listing of species under one of the three protection categories (endangered, threatened, or special concern).  
   - It signals that the government has reviewed the scientific evidence and is now prepared to act based on COSEWIC’s findings.  
   - It may trigger further actions such as the development of recovery strategies, the designation of critical habitats, or the implementation of protection measures.

5. **Timeline and Process:**  
   The order is made "on the making of this Order," meaning that the government formally recognizes the assessments at the moment the regulation is published in the *Canada Gazette*. This is a procedural step that begins the legal and administrative pathway for species protection under SARA.

---

**Significance:**

- This regulation is a key component of Canada’s legal framework for biodiversity conservation.  
- It ensures that scientific assessments are formally recognized and integrated into federal policy.  
- It demonstrates the government’s commitment to evidence-based decision-making in species conservation.  
- It sets the stage for subsequent regulatory actions, such as listing decisions, recovery planning, and the development of conservation measures.

---

**Limitations and Notes:**

- The regulation itself does not list the species or provide details about their status. The actual species and their assessments are contained in the **annexed schedule**, which is not included in the excerpt.  
- The formal listing of species under SARA is not automatic; it requires further ministerial decision-making based on the COSEWIC assessments, public consultation, and other considerations.  
- This order is procedural and does not impose direct conservation obligations—those arise only after a species is officially listed.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a procedural and administrative step in Canada’s species at risk protection process. It confirms that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific evaluations of certain wildlife species by COSEWIC, as required by law. This formal acknowledgment is a necessary precursor to any official listing or protective measures under the *Species at Risk Act*. It reflects Canada’s commitment to using science to guide conservation policy and protect biodiversity.
