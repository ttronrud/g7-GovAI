---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 29(1)(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to authorize federal employees to acquire interests in territorial lands within the Northwest Territories.

The order is formally titled:  
**"Order Authorizing Federal Employees to Acquire Interests in Certain Lands in the Northwest Territories" (Order No. 2, 1998)**.

It was issued on **August 26, 1998**, and came into force on that date.

**2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **authorize specific employees of the Government of Canada to acquire legal interests in certain parcels of land located in the Northwest Territories**. These acquisitions are intended to support the employee's personal use, particularly in connection with work-related or lifestyle-related activities such as hunting, fishing, or residential purposes.

The Order is not intended for commercial development or large-scale land use but rather for individual, non-commercial, and personal use by federal government personnel.

**3. Scope of Authorization**

- The Order authorizes **one named federal employee** to acquire an interest in a specific parcel of land.
- The employee is **Norman Lee McCowan**, who holds the position of **Resource Management Officer** within the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
- The land in question is located in the **Town of Hay River**, Northwest Territories.
- The parcel is **un-surveyed** and has an approximate area of **0.54 hectares** (about 1.33 acres).
- The location is near **km. 4.4 of Highway No. 1**.
- The exact boundaries of the parcel are defined on a **sketch plan** titled **File 33-1-12**, held in the **Land and Water Management Division** of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in Ottawa. The parcel is shown in **red outline** on this plan.

**4. Nature of the Land Interest**

The authorization is for a **lease** of the land, not a full purchase or ownership transfer. Specifically:

- The land is to be **leased** to Mr. McCowan for the purpose of **hunting and fishing**.
- The lease includes the **right to use the land** for recreational and subsistence activities.
- The lease does **not include** any rights to:
  - Mines or mineral rights (including solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, or minerals).
  - The right to work or extract any minerals from the land.
- All **mineral rights** (including hydrocarbons) are **explicitly saved and reserved** by the government.

This means that while Mr. McCowan may use the land for personal recreation, he has **no rights to extract or develop natural resources** from it.

**5. Legal and Administrative Implications**

- The Order operates under the framework of the **Territorial Lands Act**, which governs land tenure, use, and management in the Northwest Territories.
- The designation of the land as "un-surveyed" indicates that formal boundary demarcation has not yet been completed, but the land is identified and described in the official government records.
- The inclusion of a sketch plan in the departmental files ensures that the land’s location and boundaries are documented and verifiable for administrative and legal purposes.
- The reservation of mineral rights underscores that the federal government retains control over natural resources, which is consistent with Canadian land tenure principles and the Crown's inherent rights over subsurface resources.

---

**6. Significance and Context**

- This Order reflects a policy of allowing federal employees—particularly those working in natural resource or Indigenous affairs—to have access to land for personal, professional, or cultural purposes.
- Given Mr. McCowan’s role as a Resource Management Officer, the lease may support his work in monitoring or managing land use, especially in relation to Indigenous communities or environmental stewardship.
- The small size and recreational nature of the land use align with the principle of **limited, non-commercial land access** for government employees.

**Conclusion**

This regulation is a narrow, specific, and administrative instrument designed to facilitate the personal use of a small, un-surveyed parcel of land by a federal employee in the Northwest Territories. It balances the need for employee access to land for work-related or recreational purposes with the protection of Crown mineral rights and the broader regulatory framework governing territorial land use. It exemplifies how federal land policies can accommodate individual needs while preserving public and environmental interests.
