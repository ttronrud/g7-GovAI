**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida) Quebec Populations Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
July 3, 2018  
**Issuing Authority:**  
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is made under **Section 58** of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29, specifically subsections **58(4)** and **58(5)**. These provisions empower the Minister to designate and establish the critical habitat for a listed wildlife species, provided certain conditions are met.

### **Background and Context:**

1. **Species at Risk Status:**  
   The **Eastern Sand Darter (*Ammocrypta pellucida*)** — specifically the **Quebec populations** — is legally recognized as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification means the species is at risk of becoming extinct in the wild and is entitled to legal protection under the Act.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification:**  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for the Eastern Sand Darter was developed and officially adopted. This strategy includes a detailed identification of the **critical habitat** — the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.  
   This recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is the official government database of species at risk and their associated recovery plans and designations.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas:**  
   A key condition for the designation of critical habitat under SARA is that the designated area must **not** fall within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of the Act.  
   Subsection 58(2)(b) prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are:
   - Protected under other federal or provincial laws (e.g., Indigenous lands, national parks, or areas with existing conservation designations),  
   - Or areas where the designation would conflict with other legal or policy objectives (such as land use or development plans).  

   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion** of the critical habitat identified in this Order falls within such a prohibited category. This confirms that the designation is lawful and does not conflict with existing legal protections or land-use designations.

### **Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and legally recognize** the critical habitat of the Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida) in Quebec. This designation serves several key functions:

- **Legal Protection:** Once designated, the critical habitat is protected under SARA. No federal or provincial activity (such as construction, mining, or habitat alteration) may occur within the designated area without the Minister’s written consent or a valid exemption.
- **Recovery Support:** By identifying and protecting essential habitat, the Order supports the species’ recovery by ensuring the conditions necessary for its survival and reproduction are maintained.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The Order is publicly accessible and is part of the Species at Risk Public Registry, ensuring transparency and public awareness of conservation efforts.

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

- **Applicability of Section 58(1):**  
  Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida) Quebec populations. This means that any activity that may result in the destruction, degradation, or significant alteration of the designated critical habitat is prohibited unless authorized under SARA or exempted under specific conditions.

- **Designation of Critical Habitat:**  
  The actual geographic boundaries and features of the critical habitat are specified in the **annexed Order** (not included in this summary). These areas are typically defined based on ecological and biological criteria such as water quality, substrate type, flow conditions, and temperature — all of which are essential for the darter’s life cycle.

- **Effective Date:**  
  The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette). This ensures immediate legal effect upon formalization.

### **Significance and Implications:**

- **Conservation Action:** This Order represents a concrete step in the conservation of a rare and vulnerable species. The Eastern Sand Darter is a sensitive benthic fish species that depends on specific aquatic conditions, making its habitat particularly fragile.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the Public Registry ensures that scientists, Indigenous communities, environmental groups, and government agencies have access to the information needed to support recovery efforts.
- **Compliance and Enforcement:** The designation triggers enforcement mechanisms under SARA. Any unauthorized activity in the critical habitat may result in penalties or legal action.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation formally establishes and protects the critical habitat of the Eastern Sand Darter (*Ammocrypta pellucida*) in Quebec under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific recovery planning, complies with legal safeguards against prohibited areas, and ensures that the species' essential habitat is preserved for its long-term survival. The Order reflects Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the implementation of the Species at Risk Act in a transparent, science-based, and legally sound manner.
