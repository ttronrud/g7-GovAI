**Detailed Summary of the Total Assets for Supervisability and Public Holding Requirements (Insurance Companies and Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulations are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. This authority is derived from **section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**.

- **Section 1021a of the ICA** empowers the federal government to establish rules related to the supervision of insurance companies and insurance holding companies, specifically concerning the definition and measurement of "total assets" for regulatory purposes.
- The regulations are thus a **legally binding instrument** designed to clarify and operationalize the definition of "total assets" in specific sections of the Insurance Companies Act.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define what constitutes "total assets"** for a company or an insurance holding company at a given point in time. This definition is critical for compliance with several key provisions of the Insurance Companies Act, including:

- **Section 59.1** – Relating to the supervisability of insurance companies.
- **Section 412** – Addressing capital adequacy and financial strength requirements.
- **Section 939** – Concerning the public holding requirements for insurance companies and holding companies.

By providing a clear and consistent definition of total assets, the regulations ensure that regulatory assessments—such as capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and public ownership thresholds—are based on a standardized, transparent, and accountable financial measurement.

### **3. Definition of "Total Assets"**

According to the regulations:

> *Total assets, in respect of a company or an insurance holding company, at a particular time, means the total value of the assets that would be reported on its balance sheet, prepared as at that time in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications of the Superintendent referred to in subsection 331(4) or 887(4) of the Insurance Companies Act, as the case may be.*

#### Key Elements of the Definition:

- **Balance Sheet Reporting**: The total assets are defined as the value of assets reflected on the company’s balance sheet.
- **Timing**: The value is determined as of a specific date (e.g., the end of a reporting period).
- **Accounting Standards**: The balance sheet must be prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** (or the relevant Superintendent under subsections 331(4) or 887(4) of the ICA).

#### Explanation of Subsections 331(4) and 887(4):

- **Subsection 331(4)**: Applies to **insurance companies** and refers to the accounting standards issued by the Superintendent for the preparation of financial statements under the ICA.
- **Subsection 887(4)**: Applies to **insurance holding companies** and refers to the same accounting standards, but tailored to the structure and reporting needs of holding companies.

> This ensures that both types of entities are evaluated using a consistent, authoritative, and transparent accounting framework.

### **4. Regulatory Effect and Implementation**

- The regulations **come into force on the date when subsection 2(1) of the Insurance Companies Act is enacted** by **section 345 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (FCACA)**.
- This enactment occurred on **October 24, 2001** (as noted in the [Note] section).
- Therefore, these regulations became effective on **October 24, 2001**.

> This alignment ensures that the definition of total assets is synchronized with broader reforms in the regulatory framework, particularly those aimed at enhancing consumer protection and financial oversight.

### **5. Repeal Clause**

The regulations include a **repeal provision**, indicating that they are intended to be temporary or transitional in nature. However, the specific details of the repeal are not fully elaborated in the provided text. Given the context, it is likely that these regulations were issued to **replace or clarify** earlier, potentially outdated, definitions of total assets, and may have been superseded by subsequent amendments or more comprehensive reforms.

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- **Enhanced Regulatory Supervision**: A clear definition of total assets enables regulators to assess the financial health and risk profile of insurance companies and holding companies more accurately.
- **Consistency and Transparency**: By mandating the use of the Superintendent’s prescribed accounting standards, the regulations promote consistency across insurers and reduce ambiguity in financial reporting.
- **Public Holding Requirements**: The definition supports the determination of whether an insurance company or holding company is considered publicly held, which affects disclosure obligations, shareholder rights, and regulatory oversight.
- **Capital and Risk-Based Supervision**: The concept of "total assets" is foundational for risk-based capital calculations, which determine how much capital a company must hold to cover potential losses.
