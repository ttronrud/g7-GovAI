## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Regulatory Framework and Legal Basis**
- These regulations were **approved under Section 44 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**.
- They were issued by the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** on May 31, 2000.
- The regulations apply specifically to **Class I nuclear facilities**, which are defined as the most sensitive and high-risk category of nuclear installations due to their potential impact on public safety, environmental protection, and national security.

> ✅ *Legal Authority*: The NSCA provides the overarching legal framework for nuclear safety, control, and regulation in Canada. These regulations implement specific requirements for licensing, operations, safety, and environmental protection for Class I facilities.

| **Hazardous Substance/Waste** | Non-nuclear substances or wastes that may pose risks to health or the environment during licensed activities. |
| **IAEA** | International Atomic Energy Agency |
| **IAEA Agreement** | The 1972 Agreement between Canada and the IAEA for safeguards under the NPT (INFCIRC/164). |
| **Safeguards** | Verification systems established under safeguards agreements to ensure nuclear materials are not diverted for weapons purposes. |
| **Safeguards Agreement** | Includes the IAEA Agreement and any bilateral or multilateral agreements Canada has entered into for verification of nuclear substances, equipment, or information. |
| **Sealed Source** | A radioactive substance contained in a sealed capsule or bonded cover that prevents contact or dispersion under designed conditions. |
| **Worker** | A person performing work authorized under a licence. |

> ⚠️ **Jurisdiction** is broadly defined to include federal, provincial, territorial, Indigenous, and international entities involved in environmental assessments or regulatory oversight of Class I facilities.

> 🔍 **Note**: These definitions are critical for determining regulatory scope, compliance obligations, and stakeholder responsibilities.

### 🔹 **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations **apply exclusively to Class I nuclear facilities**.
- They **do not apply to Class IB nuclear facilities** — meaning Class IB facilities are governed by different rules (e.g., under *Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations* or other lower-tier regulations).
- The regulations govern the **entire lifecycle** of a Class I facility: site preparation, construction, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment.
