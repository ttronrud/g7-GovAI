**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by the Governor General in Council of Canada, outlines Canada’s formal participation in a multinational military operation in Somalia under the authority of the United Nations Security Council.

### **Background and Legal Basis**

1. **United Nations Security Council Resolution 794 (1992):**
   - The resolution recognized that the ongoing conflict in Somalia had led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread suffering and death among the civilian population.
   - It emphasized that the obstruction of humanitarian aid distribution—due to the conflict and lack of security—constituted a threat to international peace and security.
   - Under **Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter**, the Council authorized member states to take **military action** to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations.
   - The resolution called upon all member states to contribute military forces and to use all necessary means to ensure the safety and effectiveness of humanitarian aid.

2. **Canada’s Commitment:**
   - The regulation acknowledges that Canada has a responsibility to act in accordance with the UN resolution and international obligations.
   - It is deemed advisable that Canada participate in this multinational military effort to support humanitarian operations in Somalia.

### **Legal Authority for Canada’s Action**

- The Governor General in Council (the head of state, acting on the advice of the Minister of National Defence) invokes **paragraph 31(1)(b) of the National Defence Act**.
- This provision grants the government the authority to **place Canadian Armed Forces personnel on active service** in support of international operations, including those authorized under the United Nations Charter.
- The use of this clause allows Canada to deploy military personnel in a foreign conflict without requiring a separate domestic legislative act, as long as the operation is in response to a UN mandate.

### **Scope of Deployment**

The regulation authorizes the deployment of the following personnel:

- **Regular Force** of the Canadian Forces:
  - Officers and non-commissioned members (NCOs) who are part of, or serving in immediate support of, the multinational military effort in Somalia.

- **Reserve Force** of the Canadian Forces:
  - Officers and NCOs who are part of, or serving in immediate support of, the multinational military effort in and around Somalia.

> The key phrase "beyond Canada" indicates that these personnel are being deployed **outside Canada’s borders**, specifically to Somalia, in support of the UN-mandated humanitarian mission.

### **Purpose of the Deployment**

The primary objective of the deployment is to:
- **Establish and maintain a secure environment** in Somalia.
- **Enable the safe and effective delivery of humanitarian assistance** to civilians affected by the conflict.
- Support the broader international effort to prevent further human suffering and stabilize the region.

This is not a combat operation in the traditional sense, but rather a **humanitarian security mission**—focused on protecting civilians and ensuring that aid can reach those in need.

---

### **Key Legal and Diplomatic Implications**

- The deployment is **authorized under international law** via the UN Charter (Chapter VII), which allows for the use of force in cases of threats to international peace and security.
- Canada’s participation is **multinational in nature**, meaning it is part of a broader international coalition.
- The action reflects Canada’s commitment to **humanitarian intervention** and **collective security**, consistent with its foreign policy principles and obligations under the UN Charter.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally authorizes Canada to deploy military personnel—both from the regular and reserve components of the Canadian Armed Forces—into Somalia to support the United Nations’ humanitarian mission. The action is legally justified under the National Defence Act and grounded in UN Security Council Resolution 794, which identified the humanitarian crisis in Somalia as a threat to international peace and security. The deployment is intended to ensure the safe delivery of aid, not to engage in offensive military operations, and underscores Canada’s role in upholding international peace and humanitarian principles.

**Note:** This regulation is a **temporary, operation-specific deployment** and would typically be subject to review, renewal, or termination based on the evolving situation in Somalia and the outcomes of the UN mission.
