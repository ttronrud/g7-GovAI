**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Hog Charges (Interprovincial and Export) Order (SOR/86-240, SOR/79-418)**  
*Effective Date: September 12, 1996*  
*Issued by: The Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board*  

---

### **1. Purpose of the Order**
This regulation establishes a **mandatory charge system** for producers in Ontario who market **weanling hogs** (hogs under 56 kg) and **other hogs** (those intended for slaughter) in **interprovincial or export trade**. The charges are collected by the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board") to support the marketing, promotion, and stabilization of Ontario pork in the broader market.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Commodity Board** | The Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board, established under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario. Responsible for administering the marketing and pricing of pork products. |
| **Hogs** | Hogs produced in Ontario. This includes both weanling hogs and hogs intended for slaughter. |
| **Producer** | Any individual or entity engaged in the production of hogs in Ontario. |
| **Weanling Hogs** | Hogs weighing less than 56 kilograms (approximately 124 pounds), typically raised for future growth or sale as young stock. |

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- **Applies to**:  
  - The **marketing of weanling hogs** in interprovincial or export trade, **provided these hogs are not marketed for slaughter**.  
  - The **marketing of all other hogs** (i.e., hogs intended for slaughter) in interprovincial or export trade.

- **Exclusions**:  
  - The Order **does not apply** to producers located in the **County of Haliburton** or in the **Territorial Districts of Ontario** (except for the **Cochrane** and **Timiskaming** Territorial Districts).  
  - This exclusion was later **repealed** by *SOR/2013-86, section 3*, meaning it no longer applies as of that date.  

> ⚠️ **Note**: The exclusion clause is now obsolete due to repeal. As of 2013, the Order applies to all Ontario producers unless otherwise specified.

### **4. Charges Imposed on Producers**

Each producer must pay the following fees per hog marketed:

| Type of Hog | Charge |
|------------|--------|
| **Weanling hog** (under 56 kg) | **$0.20** |
| **All other hogs** (intended for slaughter) | **$0.95** |

These charges are **mandatory** and must be paid by the producer or their agent when hogs are marketed.

---

### **5. Payment Mechanism**

There are **two pathways** for payment of the charge:

#### **(a) Direct Deduction (Preferred Method)**  
If the hogs are marketed **through the Commodity Board**, the Board shall **deduct the applicable charge directly** from the payment it makes to the producer for the sale of the hogs.  
- Example: If a producer sells 10 weanling hogs through the Commodity Board, the Board deducts $2.00 ($0.20 × 10) from the sale proceeds before remitting the balance to the producer.

#### **(b) Producer Remittance (Fallback Method)**  
If the charge is **not deducted** by the Commodity Board, the producer must **remit the charge directly** to the Commodity Board.  
- **Where to send payment**:  
  Office of the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board  
  15 Waulron Street, Etobicoke, Ontario  
- **Deadline**:  
  No later than the **15th day of the month following the month in which the hogs were marketed**.  
  - Example: If hogs were marketed in August 1996, the charge must be paid by **September 15, 1996**.

> ⚠️ Late payments are not permitted. Failure to remit the charge on time may result in penalties or administrative action.

---

### **6. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

- The Order is made under **sections 3a and 4a of the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order**, which grant the Commodity Board the authority to establish charges, rules, and procedures related to the marketing of hogs.
- These sections empower the Board to ensure fair, transparent, and equitable pricing and distribution practices in the interprovincial and export markets.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on September 12, 1996**.  
- This means all provisions apply from that date onward, with the first charges due in the subsequent month (e.g., September 15, 1996, for hogs marketed in August 1996).

---

### **8. Key Observations and Implications**

- **Economic Incentive**: The higher charge for hogs intended for slaughter ($0.95 vs. $0.20) reflects the greater market value and risk associated with slaughter-ready animals.
- **Market Stability**: The charge system helps fund marketing initiatives such as branding, promotion, and export support, which benefit the entire Ontario pork industry.
- **Producer Accountability**: Producers are directly responsible for ensuring charges are paid, either through direct deduction or by remitting payments.
- **Historical Context**: The Order was part of a broader regulatory framework designed to stabilize Ontario’s pork market in the 1980s and 1990s. It has since been modernized or replaced, with the repeal of the Haliburton exclusion in 2013 indicating evolving regional policy.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Hog Charges (Interprovincial and Export) Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that ensures **fair and consistent pricing** for hogs marketed outside Ontario. It establishes clear, enforceable charges based on hog type and market channel, with a structured payment mechanism to ensure revenue collection for the Commodity Board. While the original scope excluded certain regions, that exclusion has been formally repealed, making the Order applicable to all Ontario producers. The Order remains a key tool in supporting Ontario’s pork industry through sustainable marketing and market access.

> 📌 **Note**: This Order is now part of a broader, evolving regulatory environment. As of 2023, the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board has transitioned to more modern governance and pricing models, and this specific Order may have been superseded or amended by newer legislation. However, it remains historically significant and illustrative of early regulatory frameworks in Ontario’s agricultural sector.
