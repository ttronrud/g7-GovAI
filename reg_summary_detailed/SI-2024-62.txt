**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
Privacy Act Heads of Government Institutions Designation Order

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under subsection 3.1(2)a of the *Privacy Act* (R.S., c. P-21), and is made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. This authority allows for the formal designation of individuals as heads of government institutions for the purposes of privacy law compliance.

**Statutory Reference:**  
- Primary legislation: *Privacy Act*, S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 182  
- Current version of the Act: *Regulations of the Privacy Act*, R.S., c. P-21  
- Supporting statutory instrument: SI/83-114 (the prior designation order)

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to formally designate specific individuals as the "head of a government institution" under the *Privacy Act*. This designation is critical because, under the Act, the head of an institution is responsible for ensuring compliance with privacy obligations, including the protection of personal information, the implementation of privacy policies, and the enforcement of privacy rights.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Designation of Individuals:**  
   The Order designates individuals who hold specific positions (listed in Column 2 of the attached Schedule) as the head of the respective government institution (listed in Column 1 of the Schedule).  
   - For example, if a person holds the position of "Director of Public Health," they are formally recognized as the head of the "Ministry of Health" under the Privacy Act.  
   - This designation is not merely administrative; it confers legal responsibility under the Privacy Act for the institution’s privacy practices.

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The designation applies specifically to the purposes of the *Privacy Act*. This includes:
   - Oversight of personal information handling within the institution.
   - Compliance with privacy principles (e.g., purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, security).
   - Accountability for privacy breaches or failures.
   - Implementation of privacy policies and procedures.

3. **Repeal of Prior Order:**  
   The previous *Privacy Act Heads of Government Institutions Designation Order* (SI/83-114) is formally repealed by this Order. This indicates a revision or update to the current list of heads, reflecting changes in organizational structure, leadership appointments, or policy developments.

4. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **30th day after the day it is made**.  
   - This delay allows for administrative processing, public notice, and potential challenges or consultations, ensuring that the designation is implemented in a timely and transparent manner.

**Implications and Significance:**

- **Accountability:** By formally naming the head of each institution, the government ensures that privacy responsibilities are clearly assigned and accountable.
- **Transparency:** The Schedule provides a public record of who is responsible for privacy governance in each institution, enhancing transparency and public trust.
- **Legal Compliance:** The designation supports the government’s obligation under the *Privacy Act* to maintain effective privacy management across all public institutions.
- **Organizational Alignment:** The Order reflects current leadership structures, ensuring that privacy governance aligns with the actual organizational hierarchy.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a formal, legally binding update to the designation of heads of government institutions under the *Privacy Act*. It replaces an outdated or previously issued order (SI/83-114), ensures current leadership is recognized for privacy responsibilities, and establishes a clear chain of accountability for the protection of personal information within public institutions. The Order is a key administrative tool for upholding privacy standards in the Canadian public sector.
