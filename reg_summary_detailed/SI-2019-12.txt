The regulation you have provided is a formal government instrument issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), S.C. 2002, c. 29

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Date of Issuance:**  
This Order was made on the day it came into force, following the completion of assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Governor General in Council formally acknowledges receipt of the scientific assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*. These assessments evaluate the conservation status of various species in Canada and determine whether they are at risk of extinction.

2. **Scope of the Assessment:**  
   The assessments apply specifically to the species listed in the annexed schedule (a list of species included in the Order). These species are evaluated based on criteria such as population size, distribution, trends, threats, and ecological requirements.

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The provision is grounded in subsection 23(1) of SARA, which empowers COSEWIC to conduct scientific assessments of wildlife species and to recommend their status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern, etc.). The Governor General in Council, on the advice of the Minister of the Environment, then formally recognizes and accepts these assessments as part of the regulatory process.

4. **Purpose and Significance:**  
   This Order serves as a critical step in the legal and administrative process under SARA. By acknowledging the COSEWIC assessments, the Government of Canada formally recognizes the scientific basis for determining the status of the listed species. This recognition is essential for triggering further regulatory actions, such as the designation of species as "endangered" or "threatened," which may lead to the development of recovery strategies, protection measures, and legal safeguards.

5. **Implementation and Next Steps:**  
   Following this acknowledgment, the Minister of the Environment may proceed with the implementation of SARA provisions, including:
   - Designating species as "endangered" or "threatened" (if warranted by the assessment),
   - Developing recovery strategies and action plans,
   - Designating critical habitat,
   - Enforcing prohibitions on activities that harm listed species or their habitat.

6. **Transparency and Public Access:**  
   The annexed schedule of species is publicly available, ensuring transparency in the regulatory process. This allows stakeholders—including scientists, Indigenous communities, environmental groups, and the general public—to understand which species are under review or at risk.

**Context within SARA:**

- The *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) was enacted in 2002 to protect wildlife species at risk of extinction in Canada.
- COSEWIC is an independent scientific committee responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species and providing recommendations to the Government.
- This Order is part of the "status assessment" phase of SARA, which precedes any formal listing or protection measures.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a foundational administrative step in Canada’s species conservation framework. By formally recognizing COSEWIC’s scientific assessments, the Government of Canada validates the scientific basis for determining which species are at risk and initiates a process that may lead to legal protections and conservation actions. It reflects a commitment to science-based decision-making in environmental policy and underscores the importance of biodiversity conservation in Canada.

**Note:**  
This Order is part of a broader series of regulatory actions under SARA. The final listing of species as "endangered" or "threatened" may occur only after further review and consultation, and the specific outcomes for each species in the annexed schedule would be detailed in subsequent Orders or official designations.

This summary is based on the language and structure of the regulation as provided, and aligns with the established procedures under the *Species at Risk Act*.
