**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister), implements a transfer of administrative control and supervision within the Canadian public service under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Legal Authority**:
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision enables the federal government to reorganize public service responsibilities by transferring control of specific public service functions or units between departments or offices, subject to appropriate legislative and procedural frameworks.

2. **Departments Involved**:
   - **Source Department**: Department of the Environment  
     This department previously held oversight responsibilities for the Crown Corporation Secretariat, specifically in relation to three Crown corporations.
   - **Receiving Office**: Office of Infrastructure of Canada  
     The control and supervision of the relevant public service functions are being transferred to this office, which is responsible for infrastructure-related policy, planning, and oversight.

3. **Specific Unit Transferred**:
   - The **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the Department of the Environment.
   - This unit is responsible for administrative and operational support functions related to the following three Crown corporations:
     - **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)**  
     - **Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC)**  
     - **Queens Quay West Land Corporation (QQWLC)**

4. **Nature of the Transfer**:
   - The transfer involves **control and supervision** of the public service functions associated with the Crown Corporation Secretariat.
   - This includes administrative, policy, staffing, and operational support activities that facilitate the functioning of the three Crown corporations.
   - The transfer does **not** involve ownership or financial control of the corporations themselves—only the public service functions that support them.

5. **Purpose and Implication**:
   - The realignment reflects a broader government strategy to streamline public service operations and improve accountability and efficiency in infrastructure-related Crown corporations.
   - By placing the administrative oversight of these entities under the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada**, the government aims to:
     - Enhance coordination between infrastructure policy and corporate operations.
     - Improve strategic alignment with national infrastructure goals.
     - Strengthen oversight and governance of land and housing-related Crown corporations.

6. **Effect on the Crown Corporations**:
   - The three Crown corporations (CMHC, CLC, QQWLC) remain legally and financially independent entities.
   - Their day-to-day operations, governance, and financial management continue to be conducted under the authority of their respective boards and management structures.
   - However, the **public service support functions** (e.g., policy advice, human resources, administrative coordination) are now managed under the Office of Infrastructure.

7. **Implementation**:
   - The transfer is effective immediately upon publication of the regulation.
   - It will require coordination between the Department of the Environment and the Office of Infrastructure to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities, staff assignments, and reporting lines.

**Conclusion**:

This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the federal public service. It shifts administrative oversight of the Crown Corporation Secretariat—specifically related to CMHC, CLC, and QQWLC—from the Department of the Environment to the Office of Infrastructure of Canada. The move is intended to improve governance, alignment with infrastructure priorities, and operational efficiency. It underscores the government’s focus on integrating public service functions with strategic infrastructure development, while maintaining the autonomy of the Crown corporations themselves.
