**Detailed Summary of the Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 14 (CSIS)**

---

**1. Purpose and Authority of the Order**

This regulation, officially titled *The Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 14 (CSIS)*, is issued under the authority of the **Privacy Act (Canada)**. Specifically, it is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of two key federal officials:

- The **Solicitor General of Canada**  
- The **President of the Treasury Board**

This action is authorized under **subsection 18(1) of the Privacy Act**, which permits the designation of certain personal information banks as "exempt" from the full scope of privacy protections contained in the Act.

---

**2. Designated Exempt Personal Information Bank**

The Order designates the following personal information bank as an **exempt personal information bank**:

- **Name of the Bank**: *Canadian Security Intelligence Service Investigational Records*  
- **Treasury Board Secretariat Registration Number**: 002872  

This bank is under the administrative control of the **Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)** and contains records related to investigations conducted by CSIS.

---

**3. Legal Basis for Exemption**

The designation is grounded in specific provisions of the **Privacy Act**:

- **Section 21** of the Privacy Act: This section allows for the exemption of personal information banks that contain sensitive information related to national security or intelligence operations, provided that the exemption is justified by law and public interest.

- **Paragraphs 22(1)(a) and (22)(b)** of the Privacy Act: These paragraphs define the types of personal information that may be exempt from the privacy protections of the Act. Specifically:
  - **22(1)(a)**: Personal information that is "in respect of an individual who is or may be a subject of an investigation" by a security agency.
  - **22(1)(b)**: Personal information related to national security, foreign intelligence, or the prevention of terrorism or threats to public safety.

The exemption applies because the records in question relate to individuals who are or may be subjects of investigations by CSIS, and the information is central to national security functions.

**4. Application of Paragraph 18(3)(b) of the Privacy Act**

Under **paragraph 18(3)(b)** of the Privacy Act, when personal information is held in an exempt bank, the applicable laws governing the use, access, and disclosure of that information are not the Privacy Act itself, but rather **other specific legislation** that is relevant to the nature of the records.

For records in this exempt bank that consist **predominantly** of personal information described in **subparagraph 22(1)(a)(ii)** — which refers to personal information about individuals who are or may be subjects of investigations involving **foreign interference or threats to national security** — the applicable laws are:

1. **The Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act (FISIA)**  
2. **The Security Offences Act (SOA)**

These laws provide the legal framework for how CSIS may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the context of foreign interference, threats to national security, and related intelligence activities.

**5. Key Implications of the Exemption**

- **Privacy Protections Are Limited**: Individuals whose personal information is held in this exempt bank are not entitled to the same access rights, disclosure rights, or privacy protections under the Privacy Act as they would be in other personal information banks.

- **Use of Information is Governed by Security Laws**: The handling, use, and disclosure of personal information in this bank are subject to the stricter, more specialized rules of FISIA and SOA, which prioritize national security over individual privacy.

- **Public Accountability and Oversight**: While the exemption removes certain privacy safeguards, the operation of CSIS and the use of such records remain subject to oversight by the **Office of the Auditor General**, **Parliamentary committees**, and **the Privacy Commissioner of Canada** (to the extent permitted by law).

- **Scope of Exemption**: The exemption applies only to records that fall within the defined categories — particularly those involving foreign interference or national security threats — and only to the extent that they are part of CSIS investigations.

It is intended to be referenced and applied in accordance with the Privacy Act and related legislation.

**Conclusion**

This Order establishes a formal exemption under Canadian privacy law for a critical component of CSIS’s operations — its investigational records. By designating the CSIS Investigational Records (Registration No. 002872) as an exempt personal information bank, the Government acknowledges the necessity of maintaining access to sensitive intelligence data for the protection of national security, particularly in the face of foreign interference and threats to critical infrastructure.

However, this exemption comes with important legal and ethical considerations. It underscores a balancing act between individual privacy rights and the state’s responsibility to safeguard national security. The exemption is not absolute and remains subject to judicial review and parliamentary scrutiny, ensuring that the use of such information remains lawful, transparent, and accountable.

**Note**: This Order reflects the ongoing tension in Canadian law between privacy and security, and serves as a key example of how the Privacy Act can be interpreted to accommodate the needs of intelligence agencies while maintaining a framework for accountability.
