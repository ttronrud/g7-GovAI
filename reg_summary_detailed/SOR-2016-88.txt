## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Regulations**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources**.
- It is enacted under:
  - **Section 7(1)**: Requires consultation with the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)**.
  - **Section 24**: Governs liability for nuclear incidents.
  - **Section 78**: Provides for the making of regulations to implement the Act.
- This regulation is a **detailed implementation of the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act**, establishing definitions, classifications, and financial liability limits for nuclear facilities in Canada.

> ✅ *Purpose*: To define what constitutes a nuclear installation, classify them by risk, and establish clear, tiered liability limits for operators in the event of a nuclear incident.

- Title documents registered in the **Bruce Land Registry (NO. 3)**.

#### 🏗️ Facilities at the Site (by Station)

| Station | Facilities Present |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Station A** | - 4-unit power reactor<br> - Facility for storage of irradiated fuel |
| **Station B** | - 4-unit power reactor<br> - Facility for storage of irradiated fuel<br> - 4-unit power reactor<br> - Facility for storage of irradiated fuel<br> - Nuclear fuel waste management facility |
| **Retired Power Reactor (under surveillance)** | - Placed in storage under surveillance |

### 🔹 **4. Risk Ranking of Facilities (for Regulatory Purposes)**

Facilities are ranked from **highest to lowest risk** as follows:

1. **Power Reactor**  
2. **Reactor of over 7 MW**  
3. **Nuclear Fuel Waste Processing Facility**  
4. **Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Facility**  
5. **Nuclear Fuel Conversion Facility**  
6. **Nuclear Fuel Production Facility**  
7. **Reactor of 1 MW to 7 MW**  
8. **Radioactive Waste Management Facility**  
9. **Reactor of less than 1 MW**

> 🔍 *Purpose*: This ranking determines the **class of nuclear installation** and, consequently, the **liability cap** for operators.

---

### 🔹 **5. Classes of Nuclear Installations & Liability Limits**

Each class is defined by the **highest-risk facility** present. The **operator** of the installation is liable for damages from nuclear incidents, but **only up to the prescribed maximum amount**.

| Class | Highest-Risk Facility | Maximum Liability (CAD) |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Power Reactor Class** | Power reactor | $180 million |
| **Reactor of over 7 MW Class** | Reactor >7 MW (non-power) | $40 million |
| **Nuclear Fuel Waste Processing Facility Class** | Fuel waste processing facility | $13 million |
| **Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Facility Class** | Fuel waste management facility | $3.3 million |
| **Nuclear Fuel Conversion Facility Class** | Fuel conversion facility | $2.3 million |
| **Nuclear Fuel Production Facility Class** | Fuel production facility | $1.3 million |
| **Reactor of 1 MW to 7 MW Class** | Reactor 1–7 MW | $1 million |
| **Radioactive Waste Management Facility Class** | Radioactive waste management facility | $0.5 million |
| **Reactor of less than 1 MW Class** | Reactor <1 MW | $0 million (i.e., **no liability cap**) |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:  
> - The **Reactor of less than 1 MW Class** has a **$0.5 million** liability cap — *not zero*.  
> - The **Reactor of less than 1 MW Class** is the **lowest-risk** category and thus has the **lowest financial exposure**.  
> - The **Power Reactor Class** has the **highest liability cap** at **$180 million**, reflecting the potential for large-scale consequences in a commercial power reactor accident.

> 💡 *Implication*: This tiered liability system ensures that **operators of higher-risk facilities bear greater financial responsibility**, while lower-risk facilities (e.g., small research reactors or waste storage) face minimal exposure.
