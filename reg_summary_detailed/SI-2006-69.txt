**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the *Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development*. This action is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act** (now part of the broader framework of Canadian land administration in the Northwest Territories). This provision empowers the federal government to modify land grants by including specific portions of land—particularly those adjacent to water bodies—within a designated grant, often with respect to Indigenous rights, land use, or administrative clarity.

**Scope of the Order:**

The regulation specifies that **any portion of lands described in the annexed schedule**—which is not publicly visible in the provided text—must be **included within the grant of land** if those portions lie within **30.48 meters (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of **Hay River**, in the **Northwest Territories**.

This inclusion is significant because it defines a specific buffer zone along the riverbank, which may have implications for:

- Land use rights (e.g., access, development, or conservation),
- Indigenous title or rights (particularly in areas adjacent to traditional territories),
- Environmental protection,
- Boundary clarity and administrative management of land parcels.

**Specific Land Designation:**

In addition to the general inclusion of shoreline areas, the regulation explicitly refers to **Lot 626, Group 814**, located in the **Town of Hay River**, Northwest Territories.

This lot is defined based on a **plan of survey of record number 55497**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** held at Ottawa. A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in **Yellowknife**, under reference number **497**.

This ensures that the legal description of the lot is officially documented and accessible for land title and boundary purposes.

**Key Implications:**

1. **Legal Boundary Adjustment:**  
   The order effectively expands or modifies the boundaries of the land grant by incorporating shoreline land within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark. This may result in a change to the legal description of the land parcel, affecting ownership, use, and potential claims.

2. **Environmental and Cultural Significance:**  
   The inclusion of land within the ordinary high water mark may reflect recognition of ecological zones, floodplain areas, or culturally significant sites associated with Indigenous communities, especially given the context of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development’s involvement.

3. **Administrative Clarity:**  
   The regulation provides a clear, legally binding directive for land registration authorities to update land titles and records to reflect the expanded grant, ensuring consistency in land administration.

4. **Jurisdiction and Record-Keeping:**  
   The reference to the Canada Lands Surveys Records and the Land Titles Office in Yellowknife underscores the federal oversight and formal record-keeping system in place for land in the Northwest Territories.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally extends the grant of land in the Town of Hay River by including any shoreline land within 100 feet (30.48 meters) of the ordinary high water mark of Hay River, as defined in the annexed schedule. It specifically references Lot 626, Group 814, using a surveyed plan of record to establish the precise legal boundaries. The action is grounded in statutory authority and serves to clarify land ownership, support land use planning, and potentially recognize environmental or cultural interests tied to the river’s shoreline. The regulation is binding and must be implemented in official land records to ensure legal consistency and enforceability.
