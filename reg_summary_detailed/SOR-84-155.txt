This regulation, known as the *Program Registration Fees Order*, was issued on **February 6, 1984**, by the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** of Canada. It is authorized under:

- **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which grants the Minister the power to make regulations concerning fees and charges related to government programs.
- **Order in Council P.C. 1984-398**, dated February 2, 1984, which provides the legal framework enabling the Minister to establish specific fees for registration under programs established under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*.

The Order is officially cited as **Program Registration Fees Order, SI/84-38**, and was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, page 961*, on February 6, 1984.

**Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish and prescribe the fees** that individuals or entities must pay to register in specific programs administered under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. These programs are designed to ensure the safety, quality, and compliance of urea-formaldehyde (UF) insulation products used in construction.

The two key registration programs referenced are:

1. **Field Sampling Program**  
2. **Analytical Program**

These programs support regulatory oversight by enabling government monitoring of UF insulation materials through independent testing and sampling.

**Fees Prescribed Under the Order**

| Program | Fee Amount | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Field Sampling Program** | **$250** | A one-time fee payable by a person applying to register for participation in a field sampling program. This program involves the collection of physical samples of UF insulation from construction sites to assess product quality and compliance with safety standards. |
| **Analytical Program** | **$250 per laboratory** | A one-time registration fee payable by each laboratory that wishes to participate in the analytical program. This program involves laboratory testing of UF insulation samples to verify chemical composition, formaldehyde content, and other safety-related parameters. The fee is charged **per laboratory**, meaning that each laboratory must pay $250 independently, regardless of the number of samples or tests conducted. |

> Note: The fee structure is consistent across both programs — a flat rate of $250 applies to each registration, whether in field sampling or analytical testing.

---

**Scope and Applicability**  
- The fees apply to **any person** who applies to register in either the **Field Sampling Program** or the **Analytical Program** established under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*.
- The programs are specifically designed to ensure that UF insulation products meet national safety and environmental standards, particularly regarding formaldehyde emissions, which can pose health risks.
- Registration under these programs is a requirement for laboratories and field inspectors involved in quality control and compliance monitoring.

**Key Implications and Objectives**  
1. **Revenue Generation for Regulatory Oversight**: The fees provide a stable source of funding to support the administrative and operational costs of running the sampling and testing programs.
2. **Quality Assurance and Compliance**: By requiring registration and charging fees, the government ensures that only qualified and accountable entities participate in testing and sampling, enhancing the credibility and reliability of the data collected.
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: The clear, fixed fee structure promotes transparency in the registration process and helps prevent unauthorized or unqualified participation.
4. **Support for Industry Standards**: The programs help enforce product safety standards, protecting consumers and workers from potentially hazardous materials.

**Legal and Administrative Notes**  
- This Order is a **statutory instrument** (SI), meaning it is a regulation made under existing legislation and requires approval through the appropriate legal process.
- The fees are not subject to further adjustment without a subsequent Order in Council or legislative amendment.
- The Order remains in force until amended or repealed by a subsequent regulation or legislation.

**Conclusion**  
The *Program Registration Fees Order* establishes a clear, standardized fee structure of **$250** for registration in either the **Field Sampling Program** or the **Analytical Program** under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. This regulation ensures that the government can maintain effective oversight of UF insulation product safety through a transparent, accountable, and financially sustainable registration process. It reflects a balance between regulatory enforcement and practical implementation, supporting public health and environmental protection in the construction industry.
