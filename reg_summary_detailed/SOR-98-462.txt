## 🔍 **Regulatory Summary: Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and Other Weapons as Prohibited or Restricted**

### 📌 **Legal Authority and Purpose**
This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, pursuant to specific definitions in the **Criminal Code of Canada**:

- Subsection **84(1)** – Definitions of "prohibited firearm," "restricted firearm," "prohibited weapon," "prohibited device," and "prohibited ammunition"
- Subsection **117.15(1)a** – Additional definitions related to prohibited items

**Purpose**:  
To **prohibit or restrict** certain firearms, weapons, components, accessories, cartridge magazines, ammunition, and projectiles based on their design, function, or potential for misuse. These restrictions are intended to enhance public safety by banning high-risk, semi-automatic, assault-style, or otherwise dangerous weapons.

### 📚 **Key Definitions Used in the Regulation**

#### 1. **"Semi-automatic" (in respect of a firearm)**  
> A firearm equipped with a mechanism that, after discharging a cartridge, **automatically operates to complete any part of the reloading cycle** necessary to prepare for the discharge of the next cartridge.

- This definition is critical because it distinguishes semi-automatic firearms (which fire one round per trigger pull) from purely manual or bolt-action weapons.
- The regulation applies this definition when classifying weapons as **prohibited or restricted**.
