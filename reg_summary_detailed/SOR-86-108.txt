**Detailed Summary of the Tax Rebate Discounting Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 53, s. 3)**

---

**Regulatory Framework and Authority**  
The *Tax Rebate Discounting Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*. These regulations were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. The authority to create these regulations is derived specifically from **Section 10** of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*, which empowers the government to prescribe the format and content of required documents related to discounting transactions involving tax rebates.

The regulations are formally titled the **Tax Rebate Discounting Regulations** and may be cited as such.

---

**Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure transparency, accountability, and clarity in the process of tax rebate discounting. They establish standardized requirements for two key documents:

1. A **statement describing the discounting transaction**  
2. A **notice of the actual amount of the refund of tax received by the discounter**

These requirements are designed to inform both the discounter (the entity or individual receiving the discounted tax rebate) and the relevant tax authorities about the nature, terms, and financial implications of the transaction.

**1. Statement Describing the Discounting Transaction**  
*Legal Basis:* Required under **subparagraph 4(1)(b)(i)** of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*.

*Regulatory Provision:*  
The statement must be in the exact form prescribed in **Schedule I** of the regulations.

*Key Elements of the Statement (as per Schedule I):*  
While the full text of Schedule I is not provided in the excerpt, based on the context and typical regulatory structure, the statement is expected to include the following elements:

- Identification of the parties involved (e.g., the discounter, the original taxpayer, the financial institution or entity facilitating the transaction)
- A clear description of the discounting transaction (e.g., the amount of tax rebate being discounted, the date of the transaction)
- The terms and conditions of the discounting arrangement (e.g., interest rate, repayment schedule, duration)
- The amount of the original tax rebate and the amount discounted
- The date the transaction was entered into
- Any applicable fees or charges
- A reference to the applicable provisions of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*

This statement serves as a formal record of the transaction and ensures that all stakeholders—especially the discounter and the tax authority—have a clear understanding of the financial and legal terms of the arrangement.

**2. Notice of the Actual Amount of the Refund of Tax Received by the Discounter**  
*Legal Basis:* Required under **paragraph 5(b)** of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*.

*Regulatory Provision:*  
The notice must be in the exact form prescribed in **Schedule II** of the regulations.

*Key Elements of the Notice (as per Schedule II):*  
Again, the full text is not included, but based on standard regulatory practice and the nature of the requirement, the notice is likely to include:

- The name and address of the discounter
- The date of the refund
- The actual amount of tax that was refunded to the discounter (not the original rebate, but the net amount received after discounting)
- A reference to the original tax rebate and the portion that was discounted
- A statement confirming that the refund is in accordance with the terms of the discounting agreement
- A statement of compliance with the provisions of the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*

This notice is critical for ensuring that the discounter is fully informed of the exact financial outcome of the transaction and that the tax authorities can verify the accuracy of the refund.

---

**General Observations and Context**  
- The regulations are **prescriptive**, meaning they define the exact format, content, and structure of the required statements and notices. This ensures consistency and reduces ambiguity in administrative processing.
- The requirement for these documents supports **tax compliance**, **auditability**, and **public accountability**.
- The regulations were originally introduced in 1985 (S.C. 1985, c. 53, s. 3) and have since been referenced in subsequent official publications (e.g., SOR/96-405, s. 1), indicating that they have been updated or reaffirmed in later administrative notices.
- The absence of the actual graphics or schedules (as noted in the text: "GRAPHIC IS NOT DISPLAYED") means that the full content of Schedules I and II must be consulted in the official government publications (such as the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* or *SOR/96-405*) for complete details.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Tax Rebate Discounting Regulations* provide a clear, standardized framework for documenting and reporting tax rebate discounting transactions. By mandating specific forms for both the transaction statement and the refund notice, the regulations enhance transparency, ensure compliance with the *Tax Rebate Discounting Act*, and support effective oversight by tax authorities. These provisions are essential for protecting the interests of both taxpayers and financial intermediaries involved in the discounting process.

For full compliance, all parties involved in such transactions—particularly discounters and financial institutions—must adhere strictly to the prescribed formats in Schedules I and II, which are available in the official government publications referenced in the regulation.
