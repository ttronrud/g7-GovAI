**Detailed Summary of the Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1986, No. 2**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**
The Order is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This reflects a formal governmental process where the federal government, through its minister responsible for Indigenous affairs and northern development, recommends a regulatory action, which is then approved by the Governor General on behalf of the Crown.

The Order is made **pursuant to paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, a key piece of federal legislation governing land ownership, use, and rights in the Northwest Territories (NWT). Specifically, paragraph 9(b) establishes a **reservation to the Crown**—a legal principle that reserves certain lands for the Crown (i.e., the federal government) for purposes such as public use, future development, or Indigenous land rights.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**
This Order **waives the reservation to the Crown** with respect to a specific parcel of territorial land in the Northwest Territories. In other words, the Crown’s legal claim or restriction over this land is being formally removed, allowing for a transfer or grant of ownership or use rights to another party—typically a private individual, corporation, or Indigenous community—without the Crown’s reservation applying.

**3. Scope of the Waiver:**
The waiver applies **only to a specific parcel of land** described in the **Schedule** attached to the Order. The Schedule provides a precise legal description of the land involved.

**4. Specific Land Description:**
The land in question is:
- **Lot 278**
- Located in the **Hamlet of Eskimo Point**, Northwest Territories
- As shown on a **plan of survey of record number 66305** in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** at Ottawa
- A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under file number **1341**

This precise legal description ensures that the waiver is clearly defined and tied to a verifiable survey and land record, which is essential for legal clarity and enforceability.

**5. Legal Significance:**
By waiving the reservation to the Crown, the federal government is:
- Removing a statutory barrier to land transfer or development
- Enabling the grant of the land to a third party (e.g., for development, agriculture, or private ownership)
- Potentially facilitating economic development, infrastructure projects, or land use planning in the region

**6. Citation and Reference:**
The Order is officially cited as:
> **Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1986, No. 2**

This citation allows for easy reference in legal, administrative, and land records contexts.

**7. Context and Implications:**
- This type of waiver is often used in land administration to facilitate private or Indigenous land use, especially in areas where the Crown traditionally holds reservations.
- The fact that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development recommended the Order suggests that this decision may have had relevance to Indigenous land rights or northern development policy, though the specific Indigenous group or entity receiving the land is not mentioned in the text.
- The Order does not alter the underlying ownership or title of the land; it only removes the Crown’s reservation, thereby allowing for a more flexible land use framework.

**Conclusion:**
The *Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1986, No. 2* is a legally binding instrument that removes the Crown’s reservation to a specific parcel of land—Lot 278 in Eskimo Point, NWT—enabling its potential transfer or use without the restriction imposed by paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act. It reflects a formal step in federal land management and may support broader land use, economic, or community development objectives in the Northwest Territories. The Order is grounded in clear legal documentation and administrative procedure, ensuring transparency and enforceability.
