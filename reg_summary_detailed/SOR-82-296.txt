**Detailed Summary of the Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**

The *Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations* are formally approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. These regulations establish specific spatial and elevation controls around **Norman Wells Airport** in the Northwest Territories to ensure aviation safety by managing land use and structures near the airport.

These regulations are officially titled:  
**"The Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
and may be cited as such.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Norman Wells Airport, located in the vicinity of Norman Wells, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precisely defined point used as a central reference for all zoning measurements. Located at the intersection of the centerline of runway 08–26 with the westerly boundary of Lot 11, Group 1158, Plan 57303 (C.L.S.R.) 750 (L.T.O.), and then extended easterly along the runway centerline for 2,436.14 meters. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 08 and 26). It rises at a slope of **1:50** (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal distance) to a horizontal line 300 meters above the end of the strip, extending 15,000 meters horizontally from the end, with outer ends 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP elevation (72.54 m A.S.L.)**, i.e., 117.54 meters above sea level. However, if this elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or unsafe surface assumptions. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, specifically the **runway 08–26**, which is **300 meters wide** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,948.8 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a slope of **1:7** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal distance), until it intersects the outer surface. This ensures a smooth transition between the strip and the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: The elevation of the Airport Reference Point is **72.54 meters above sea level (A.S.L.)**, which serves as the baseline for all elevation calculations.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—that are:

- **Within** the designated airport zone; **or**
- **Directly beneath** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This includes both developed and undeveloped land adjacent to the airport.

---

### **4. Prohibited Construction and Development**

No person may:

- **Erect or construct** any new building, structure, or object; or
- **Add to an existing building, structure, or object**

on any land covered by these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- The **approach surface** (for runway 08 and 26),
- The **outer surface**, or
- The **transitional surface**.

This restriction ensures that no obstruction—such as towers, trees, or buildings—will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to:

- Remove or trim the excessive growth.

This provision helps prevent natural obstructions from becoming hazards during flight operations.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Waste Attractive to Birds**

No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may:

- Allow the land or any part of it to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This is a critical safety measure to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can be catastrophic for aircraft.

---

### **7. Geographical and Plan-Based Descriptions**

All surfaces are defined and illustrated on the **Department of Transport Norman Wells Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1562**. Key features include:

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Defined as a specific point on the runway centerline, 2,436.14 meters east from the starting point.
- Also defines a **circular area of 4,000 meters radius**, centered at the ARP. All land within this circle is subject to the zoning rules.

#### **Approach Surfaces**
- Two surfaces: one for **runway approach 08**, one for **runway approach 26**.
- Each is a **1:50 slope** inclined plane rising to a horizontal line:
  - 300 meters above the end of the strip (in elevation),
  - 15,000 meters horizontally from the end,
  - With outer ends 2,400 meters from the runway centerline.

#### **Outer Surface**
- Horizontal plane at **45 meters above ARP elevation (117.54 m A.S.L.)**.
- Falls back to **9 meters above ground** if the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, to avoid unrealistic or unsafe assumptions.

#### **Strip**
- Runway 08–26:
  - Length: **1,948.8 meters**
  - Width: **300 meters** (150 meters on each side of centerline)

#### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter up per 7 meters out) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces.
- Extend upward and outward until they intersect the outer surface.

### **8. Regulatory Objectives and Safety Implications**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

- **To ensure aviation safety** by preventing visual obstructions during critical flight phases (takeoff, landing, approach).
- **To minimize bird strike risks** by prohibiting the disposal of food or waste that attracts birds.
- **To maintain consistent, predictable airspace boundaries** using clearly defined geometric surfaces based on scientific and engineering standards.

These zoning boundaries are designed to comply with international aviation safety standards, particularly those related to **approach and departure zones**, **obstruction limits**, and **surface designations**.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to issue **directions** (formal orders) to owners or occupiers to remove excessive vegetation or to stop waste disposal.
- Compliance is mandatory; failure to comply may result in enforcement actions, including fines or legal proceedings.
- The regulations are enforceable through the **Aeronautics Act**, which grants the Minister broad authority to regulate airport operations and surrounding areas.

### **Conclusion**

The *Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations* provide a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use and development near a remote Arctic airport. By defining precise elevation limits (approach, outer, transitional surfaces), establishing a central reference point, and prohibiting structures and waste that could endanger aircraft, the regulations serve as a vital tool in maintaining safe and efficient air operations in one of Canada’s most challenging and remote environments.

These rules reflect a balance between **aviation safety**, **environmental stewardship**, and **practical land use**, tailored to the unique geographical and operational context of the Northwest Territories.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Norman Wells Airport Zoning Regulations establish strict elevation and land-use controls around the airport to prevent obstructions and bird hazards, ensuring safe aircraft operations through clearly defined approach, transitional, and outer surfaces based on a central reference point.
