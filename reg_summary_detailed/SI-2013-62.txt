The regulation you have referenced — listed multiple times as "[Repealed, SI/2016-29, s. 5]" — has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2016-29**, specifically under **section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  - **Statutory Instrument 2016-29** (SI/2016-29)  
  - This is a UK statutory instrument, typically used to amend or repeal existing laws or regulations.  
  - The repeal is specified in **Section 5** of SI/2016-29.

- **Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal took effect on the date specified in SI/2016-29. While the exact date is not provided in your query, such instruments typically come into force on a specified day (e.g., 1st April 2016 or 6th May 2016), and can be found in the official UK legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk).

- **Nature of the Regulation (Prior to Repeal)**:  
  Although the specific content of the repealed regulation is not included in your input, the repeated references suggest that it was a **specific rule or provision** (possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures) that was previously in force.  
  Without the original text, we cannot determine the exact subject matter — for example, it may have governed aspects of:
  - Workplace safety,
  - Environmental protection,
  - Licensing of certain activities,
  - Compliance procedures, or
  - Reporting obligations.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or redundant,
  - They are superseded by new legislation,
  - They conflict with current law,
  - They are no longer necessary or effective,
  - Or they are part of a broader legislative modernization effort.

- **Implications of Repeal**:  
  - Any legal obligations or administrative requirements previously set out in the regulation are now **no longer enforceable**.
  - Authorities or individuals who previously relied on the regulation must now refer to the current, updated legal framework.
  - The repeal does not automatically create a new rule — it simply removes the old one.

### How to Find the Original Regulation:
To determine the exact content of the repealed regulation, you should consult:
- [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)  
  Search for **SI 2016/29** and review **Section 5**, which explicitly lists the repealed provisions.
- The full text of SI 2016/29 will include a schedule or list of the regulations being repealed, which may reference the original regulation by title or number.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **repealed** and **no longer applies**. It was removed by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2016/29**, which came into force on a date specified in the instrument. The specific subject matter of the repealed regulation cannot be determined from the provided information, but it was likely a technical or administrative rule that has been replaced or withdrawn due to legislative updates or redundancy.
