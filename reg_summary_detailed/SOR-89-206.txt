**1. Issuance and Legal Basis**  
The Privacy Act Extension Order, No. 2 is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. This action is authorized under **subsection 12(3) of the Privacy Act**, which empowers the Governor General to make orders extending or modifying certain rights and obligations under the Act, particularly in relation to access to personal information.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **extend the right to access personal information**—a fundamental privacy right under the Privacy Act—to **all individuals who are present in Canada**, regardless of their immigration status, citizenship, or residency background. Prior to this Order, this right may have been limited or not available to certain categories of individuals, such as temporary residents, foreign visitors, or non-citizens.

**3. Scope of the Extension**  
The extension specifically applies to **subsection 12(1)** of the Privacy Act, which grants individuals the right to request access to personal information held by federal institutions. Under this Order, that right is now **extended to all individuals currently present in Canada** who have not previously been granted access to such information.

This means that:
- Any person residing in Canada—whether a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, temporary resident, visitor, student, worker, or other category of individual—now has the legal right to access personal information held by federal government departments and agencies.
- The extension applies to all federal personal information systems, including those maintained by departments such as Health Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency, and others.

- The right to access personal information is now **universally available** to all individuals present in Canada.
- The Order does **not require individuals to meet specific residency or legal status thresholds** to exercise this right.
- The extension is **not limited to specific types of information**; it applies to all personal information held by federal institutions as defined under the Privacy Act.
- The Order ensures **equal access** to personal information regardless of nationality, immigration status, or duration of stay in Canada.

**5. Citation and Reference**  
The Order is officially titled:  
**Privacy Act Extension Order, No. 2**  
It may be cited as such in legal, administrative, and public records.

**6. Implications and Significance**  
- **Enhanced Privacy Protections**: This Order strengthens individual privacy rights by ensuring that even temporary or non-resident individuals can assert their right to access personal information held by the federal government.
- **Greater Transparency and Accountability**: It promotes openness in government operations by allowing individuals to verify the accuracy of information held about them and to challenge any inaccuracies.
- **Alignment with Canadian Privacy Principles**: The extension supports Canada’s commitment to privacy and transparency, consistent with international standards and the broader values enshrined in the Privacy Act.
- **Practical Impact**: Individuals can now file access requests with federal agencies without fear of being denied access due to their immigration status or temporary presence.

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The Order does **not extend the right to access personal information held by provincial or municipal governments**, which are governed by different privacy laws.
- It does **not apply to information protected under other statutes** (e.g., national security, law enforcement, or health confidentiality) where such access is restricted by law.
- The right to access information is still subject to **reasonable limits** and **procedural requirements** under the Privacy Act, including the obligation to provide a reasonable explanation for the request and the agency’s duty to respond within prescribed timelines.

**8. Effective Date and Implementation**  
While the specific effective date is not included in the provided text, such orders are typically published in the Canada Gazette and take effect upon publication. Implementation is managed by federal agencies responsible for receiving and processing access requests under the Privacy Act.
