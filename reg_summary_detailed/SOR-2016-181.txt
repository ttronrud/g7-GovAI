**Detailed Summary of the Kettles Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Kettles Regulations*, made under Section 37 of the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* (CCPSA), were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. These regulations establish specific safety standards for household kettles in Canada to protect consumers from exposure to lead in boiling water.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **prevent the release of lead into drinking water** during the boiling process, which can pose serious health risks—particularly to children and pregnant women—due to lead's toxic effects on the nervous system and other bodily functions.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **"Kettle"** is defined as a kettle intended for household use that has the potential to release lead into the water when boiled.  
  This includes standard electric or gas kettles commonly found in homes, but excludes industrial or commercial kettles not used in domestic settings.

---

### **Core Safety Standard**

- A kettle **must not release more than 0.01 parts per million (ppm) of lead** (by weight per weight, w/w) when tested according to the prescribed method outlined in the schedule.

> **Note:**  
> - 0.01 ppm is equivalent to 10 micrograms of lead per liter of water.  
> - This threshold is set at a level considered safe for consumer exposure based on scientific assessments of lead toxicity and health risks.

### **Testing Methodology**

To determine whether a kettle complies with the regulation, the following standardized procedure must be followed:

1. **Prepare the kettle for use**  
   - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparation (e.g., cleaning, drying, or preheating) to ensure the kettle is in a typical household condition.

2. **Fill with distilled and deionized water**  
   - Use exactly **1 liter** of distilled and deionized water.  
   - This water is used because it contains no minerals or impurities that could interfere with lead leaching or alter test results.

3. **Boil the water**  
   - Heat and boil the water in the kettle for a **total of 15 minutes**.  
   - This duration simulates a realistic household use scenario where water is boiled for a typical period.

4. **Cool the water to room temperature**  
   - After boiling, allow the water to cool to ambient (room) temperature before testing.

5. **Measure lead concentration**  
   - Analyze the cooled water sample to determine the **quantity of lead present**, expressed in **parts per million (ppm) by weight (w/w)**.  
   - The measurement is calculated **based on 1 liter of water**.

> The result must be **less than or equal to 0.01 ppm** to meet regulatory compliance.

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
  This means they become legally enforceable immediately upon publication, ensuring prompt implementation to protect public health.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

- The regulations include a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior or conflicting regulations related to lead in kettles are hereby superseded.  
  This ensures legal clarity and alignment with current safety standards.

---

### **Regulatory Purpose and Public Health Impact**

- The regulation addresses a known public health concern: **lead leaching from certain types of kettles**, particularly those with lead-based solder or glaze in their internal components.  
- By setting a strict limit of 0.01 ppm, the government ensures that even after prolonged boiling, the amount of lead entering the water remains at a level deemed safe by health authorities.  
- This standard is consistent with international best practices and aligns with the *World Health Organization (WHO)* and *Health Canada* guidelines on lead exposure.

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of kettles must ensure that all products sold in Canada comply with these regulations.  
- The Minister of Health may conduct inspections, require product recalls, or take enforcement action if non-compliant kettles are found in the market.  
- Consumers are encouraged to look for compliance information or certification when purchasing kettles, especially those from foreign manufacturers.

### **Conclusion**

The *Kettles Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) represent a targeted, science-based intervention to reduce lead exposure in Canadian households. By establishing a clear, measurable limit on lead leaching and prescribing a standardized testing method, the regulations provide a robust framework for ensuring consumer safety. They reflect Canada’s commitment to protecting public health through effective, evidence-based consumer product safety standards.

**Final Note:** These regulations remain in force as of the latest updates and are part of Health Canada’s broader efforts to monitor and regulate lead in consumer products.
