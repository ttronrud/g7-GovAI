**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Designation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development as the Minister referred to in the Canadian High Arctic Research Station Act

**Authority:**  
The designation is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, pursuant to **Section 3 of the Canadian High Arctic Research Station Act**.

**Key Provision:**  
Section 145 of the Act formally designates the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** as the "Minister referred to in that Act."

**Purpose and Context:**  
The Canadian High Arctic Research Station Act establishes the legal framework for the establishment, operation, and management of the Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS), located in the Canadian High Arctic (specifically in Nunavut). The Act assigns certain responsibilities, including administrative, financial, and policy-related duties, to a designated Minister of the Crown.

Section 3 of the Act provides that the Minister responsible for the administration and oversight of the station must be appointed by the Governor General in Council. This provision allows for flexibility in ministerial assignment, depending on the government's priorities and the political structure at the time.

By this regulation, the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** is formally named as the designated Minister under the Act. This choice reflects the department's central role in managing affairs in the North, including Indigenous relations, infrastructure development, and support for northern communities—factors that are directly relevant to the operation of a research station in the Arctic.

**Implications:**  
- The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development becomes the primary point of contact and accountability for all matters related to the CHARS, including funding, policy development, community engagement, and coordination with Inuit and northern stakeholders.  
- This designation ensures continuity and alignment between federal Arctic policy and the governance of scientific research in the region.  
- It underscores the importance of Indigenous and northern priorities in Arctic research and development.

**Effective Date and Legal Status:**  
This regulation is part of the **2014 enactment of the Canadian High Arctic Research Station Act** and is binding under Canadian federal law. It became effective upon its publication in the *Canada Gazette* and is enforceable as part of the Act’s operational framework.

**Note on Evolution:**  
It is important to note that ministerial designations under such acts can change over time due to cabinet realignments or changes in government. However, this regulation establishes a formal, legally recognized assignment as of 2014.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally assigns the responsibility for the Canadian High Arctic Research Station to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, ensuring that the station operates within a governmental structure that recognizes the unique cultural, geographic, and political context of the Canadian Arctic. It strengthens the connection between scientific research and northern development, emphasizing the role of Indigenous governance and northern policy in Arctic affairs.
