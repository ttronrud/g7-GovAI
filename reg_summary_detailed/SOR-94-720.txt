## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Repeal of the Quebec Milk Order 1989 and Introduction of the Quebec Milk Order 1991**

### 📌 **1. Background and Purpose**
This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. Its primary purpose was to:

- **Repeal** the outdated *Quebec Milk Order 1989* (Order in Council P.C. 1989-1588), which had governed the marketing of milk in Quebec since 1989.
- **Replace** it with a new, modernized framework that enables **regulation of interprovincial and export milk trade** from Quebec.

This change was intended to align Quebec’s milk marketing rules with evolving market conditions, improve efficiency, and ensure fair and sustainable practices in both domestic and cross-border trade.

---

### 📌 **2. Legal Authority**
- The regulation is based on **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the federal government to make orders for regulating agricultural product marketing.
- It operates within the broader legislative framework of:
  - The **Act respecting the marketing of agricultural, food and fish products** (Quebec).
  - The **Dairy Products and Dairy Products Substitutes Act of Quebec** (Lois).

These Acts provide the foundational legal basis for the regulation of milk marketing in Quebec.

---

### 📌 **3. Key Entities Involved**
| Entity | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Board** (Régie des marchés agricoles et alimentaires du Québec) | The provincial regulatory body responsible for overseeing agricultural and food market regulation. It has broad authority to regulate milk marketing in interprovincial and export trade. |
| **Commodity Board** (Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec) | A producer association representing dairy farmers. It is granted specific powers to levy charges and manage financial reserves on behalf of producers. |

> These two bodies are jointly empowered to regulate milk marketing under the new framework.

---

### 📌 **4. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Milk**: Defined as milk and cream from cows, produced for consumer use in liquid form in Canada.
- **Plan**: Refers to the *Quebec Milk Producers’ Joint Plan (1980)*, which serves as a foundational policy document guiding pricing, quotas, and market stability.
- **Acts**: Refers to Quebec’s key agricultural and dairy marketing legislation.

---

### 📌 **5. Scope of Application**
The Order applies to:
- Milk **produced in the Province of Quebec**.
- Milk **referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b)** — i.e., milk produced in **Ontario** — that is being traded or shipped to Quebec.

> This means the regulation governs both Quebec-origin milk and certain Ontario-origin milk that is being exported to Quebec.

---

### 📌 **6. Regulatory Powers Granted to the Board and Commodity Board**

#### ✅ **General Authority to Regulate Interprovincial Trade**
Under subsection (2), both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are authorized to:

- Exercise **all or any powers** that the Board and Commodity Board previously had in regulating milk **within Quebec**, including:
  - Setting prices.
  - Establishing quotas.
  - Managing supply and demand.
  - Imposing restrictions or conditions on trade.

> This authority is **limited** to:
> - Persons and property **within Quebec**.

>     - The **Milk Commission of Ontario**
>     - The **Ontario Milk Marketing Board**
>     - The **Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Board**
>     - In accordance with the **Ontario Milk Order**
>   - Persons in **Ontario** who ship milk **from Ontario to Quebec**, **only if** they have been granted a milk quota under this new Order.

> ⚠️ Important: This regulation **does not override** or duplicate powers exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in interprovincial trade.

### 📌 **7. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted specific financial and operational powers:

#### 🔹 (a) Levying and Collecting Charges
- Can **fix and impose levies or charges** on:
  - Milk or its components (e.g., cream, fat).
  - Persons involved in **production or marketing** of milk.
- May **classify producers into different groups** (e.g., by size, type, or region).
- Set **different levies or charges** for different groups.

> Example: A large dairy farm might pay a higher levy than a small-scale producer.

#### 🔹 (b) Use of Levies and Charges
Funds collected may be used for:
- Creation of **reserves** (to stabilize markets during downturns).
- Payment of **operational expenses** and **losses** from milk sales.
- **Equalization or adjustment** of revenues among producers.
  - This ensures that producers who experience lower sales or prices can receive compensation.
  - Helps maintain equity among members.

> The Commodity Board may determine the **time periods** (e.g., monthly, quarterly) during which these adjustments apply.

---

### 📌 **8. Exclusions and Limitations**
- The new Order **does not give authority** to regulate interprovincial trade in the same way as the Canadian Dairy Commission.
- It does **not apply** to milk marketed in Ontario under Ontario’s own milk quota systems.
- It **does not extend** to milk produced in Ontario and shipped to Quebec unless the shipper has a quota under this Order.

> This ensures that Ontario retains control over its own milk marketing through its established boards and systems.

### 📌 **9. Timeline and Status**
| Event | Date |
|------|------|
| Original Order issued | August 24, 1989 (P.C. 1989-1588) |
| Replaced by new Order | 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2) |
| Repealed | April 16, 2001 (SOR/2001-16, s. 41) |

> ✅ **The regulation is now repealed**.  
> The Quebec Milk Order 1991 was **replaced by more modern legislation** (likely the *Quebec Milk Marketing Regulation* or similar updated framework), reflecting changes in the dairy industry and federal-provincial cooperation.

---

### 📌 **10. Key Implications and Significance**
- **Modernization**: Replaced a 1989 order with a more flexible, producer-focused, and financially sustainable model.
- **Provincial Autonomy**: Empowered Quebec to manage its own milk marketing, especially in interprovincial trade, while respecting Ontario’s regulatory framework.
- **Producer Equity**: The levy system promotes financial stability and fairness among producers through reserve creation and revenue equalization.
- **Market Efficiency**: Enabled better price discovery, supply management, and coordination in a complex national market.

---

### 📌 **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant step in Quebec’s evolution of dairy market governance. By repealing the 1989 Order and introducing a more responsive and equitable framework, it:

- Strengthened the role of producer associations (like the Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec).
- Improved financial resilience for dairy farmers.
- Maintained a balance between provincial control and interprovincial cooperation.

However, since the regulation was **repealed in 2001**, it is now **historical** and **no longer in force**. Its principles likely influenced later versions of Quebec’s milk marketing rules, especially in areas of producer support, interprovincial trade, and financial equalization.
