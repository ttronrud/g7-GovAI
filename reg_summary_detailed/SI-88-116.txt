Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Legal Authority and Context:**

- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in the **Industrial and Regional Development Act** (IRDA), specifically referencing **Section 2**, which defines the term *"Minister"*.
- The purpose of this amendment is to **update and clarify the designation of the Minister responsible for overseeing certain federal programs** under the IRDA, particularly those related to regional economic development in specific provinces.

---

**2. Nature of the Amendment:**

- The regulation amends **Order in Council P.C. 1987-1155**, originally issued on **June 5, 1987**, and subsequently amended by **P.C. 1987-1616** on **August 4, 1987**.
- The amendment involves the **revocation of paragraph (c)** from the original Order and its **substitution with a new paragraph**.

---

**3. Key Change:**

- **Revocation of Old Paragraph (c):**  
  The previous paragraph (c) in the Order in Council was removed. This likely referenced a different minister or a broader or outdated designation of responsibility.

- **Substitution with New Paragraph (c):**  
  The new paragraph (c) designates:
  > *"The Minister of Western Economic Diversification, a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, as the Minister for the purposes of that Act, except section 3 thereof, in relation to the Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan with respect to grants, contributions, loans and guarantees in those Provinces that are made in relation to a project the eligible capital costs of which do not exceed twenty million dollars."*

---

**4. Interpretation and Scope of the New Provision:**

- **Designated Minister:**  
  The **Minister of Western Economic Diversification (WED)** is now the official minister responsible for administering the provisions of the **Industrial and Regional Development Act** (with certain exceptions) in relation to the provinces of:
  - Manitoba  
  - British Columbia  
  - Alberta  
  - Saskatchewan  

- **Exclusions:**  
  The designation **does not apply to Section 3 of the Act**. This means that Section 3 — which may contain specific provisions (e.g., regarding eligibility criteria, funding thresholds, or regional policy) — remains under the jurisdiction of a different minister or authority. This exclusion suggests that Section 3 may have a distinct administrative or policy framework not subject to the WED Minister’s oversight.

- **Scope of Responsibility:**  
  The minister’s authority applies specifically to:
  - **Grants**  
  - **Contributions**  
  - **Loans**  
  - **Guarantees**  
  issued in the named provinces.

- **Project Threshold Limitation:**  
  The funding decisions are limited to projects where the **eligible capital costs do not exceed twenty million dollars (CAD)**.  
  - This implies that projects exceeding this threshold are outside the scope of this minister’s authority and may fall under different rules or be managed by other departments or ministers.

---

**5. Purpose and Implications:**

- **Strategic Realignment:**  
  The change reflects a shift in federal governance structure, centralizing responsibility for regional economic development in Western Canada under the **Ministry of Western Economic Diversification**. This ministry was established to support economic diversification in Western provinces, many of which face unique challenges (e.g., resource dependence, geographic isolation).

- **Targeted Funding:**  
  By limiting the funding authority to projects under **$20 million in eligible capital costs**, the government is likely aiming to:
  - Streamline decision-making processes.
  - Focus on smaller, more manageable projects.
  - Ensure fiscal responsibility and efficient use of public funds.

- **Geographic Focus:**  
  The inclusion of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan underscores the federal government’s strategic interest in developing and diversifying the economies of Western Canada — particularly in response to economic shifts, such as declining resource revenues or the need for innovation and infrastructure.

- **Administrative Clarity:**  
  The amendment provides clear attribution of responsibility, reducing ambiguity in who approves or administers funding decisions in these provinces.

---

**6. Significance:**

- This regulation enhances **accountability**, **transparency**, and **efficiency** in the delivery of federal development funding.
- It aligns with broader federal policies promoting **regional equity** and **economic diversification** in underdeveloped or resource-dependent regions.
- It reflects a modernization of federal funding structures, where specialized ministries are entrusted with managing programs tailored to specific regional needs.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation effectively **reassigns ministerial responsibility** for certain development funding programs in four Western Canadian provinces to the **Minister of Western Economic Diversification**, with clear limits on project size (up to $20 million in eligible capital costs) and an important exclusion of Section 3 of the Industrial and Regional Development Act. The change strengthens targeted, regionally focused economic development while maintaining fiscal discipline and administrative clarity.
