**Detailed Summary of the Optional Survivor Annuity Regulations (S.C. 2001, c. 7, s. 24)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Optional Survivor Annuity Regulations* were introduced under **subsection 44.2(4)a of the Judges Act**, by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. These regulations provide a legal framework allowing judges of the Supreme Court of Canada and other superior courts (including the Tax Court of Canada) to elect to establish an **optional survivor annuity**—a benefit paid to a spouse or common-law partner upon the judge’s death—while simultaneously reducing their own monthly annuity payments.

This regulation was enacted on **August 1, 2001**, and remains in force with amendments as of 2006 (see SI/2001-85 and 2006, c. 11, s. 36).

## **Process for Making an Election**

### **1. Notice of Election**
A judge must send a **signed, witnessed notice** (by the judge and a witness other than the spouse or common-law partner) to the Annuity Administrator via **registered mail**. The notice must include:

- The **percentage** of the judge’s annuity to be paid as a survivor annuity: **30%, 40%, or 50%**
- The **date of birth** of the spouse or common-law partner
- The **date of marriage** (if married) or the **date cohabitation began** in a conjugal relationship (if common-law partner)

> ⚠️ **Important**: The witness must not be the judge’s spouse or common-law partner.

---

### **2. Deadline for Making an Election**

The election must be made **not later than the latest of the following dates**:

- **One year after** the day these regulations come into force (August 1, 2001)
- **One year after** the judge’s marriage to the spouse
- **Two years after** the judge began cohabiting with the common-law partner

> This deadline ensures timely action and prevents undue delay in establishing survivor benefits.

---

### **3. Correction of Erroneous Information**

If the Annuity Administrator becomes aware of **erroneous or misleading information** (e.g., incorrect deadline, incorrect annuity amount, or misstatement of survivor benefit), the administrator must:

- Notify the judge **by registered mail** of the corrected information
- Allow the judge to **re-evaluate and make a new election within 90 days** of receiving the notice

> If the judge had previously decided *not* to make an election due to the error, they may now do so within 90 days.

---

### **4. Effective Date of Election**

An election takes effect on the **day the notice is received** by the Annuity Administrator.

---

## **Required Supporting Documents**

Within **90 days** of making the election, the judge must send to the Annuity Administrator:

1. **Proof of the spouse’s or common-law partner’s date of birth** (e.g., birth certificate)
2. **Proof of marriage** (marriage certificate) OR **proof of cohabitation start date** (for common-law partners)
3. **If names differ** between documents (e.g., birth certificate vs. marriage certificate), provide:
   - Additional documentation confirming the correct individual, or
   - A **statutory declaration** from the spouse or common-law partner confirming the documents pertain to them

> ⚠️ **Failure to submit required documents within 90 days** results in the election being **deemed not made**.

---

## **Proof of Age / Relationship (Requirements)**

### **Proof of Age of Spouse or Common-Law Partner**

- **Primary proof**: A **birth certificate** issued by a civil authority
- **If unavailable**:
  - A **statutory declaration** by the spouse/common-law partner stating their date of birth and reason for lack of certificate
  - **Plus** one of the following:
    - A document made **within 5 years** of birth showing name and date of birth/age
    - A document made **at least 20 years before** the election showing date of birth, accompanied by a **statutory declaration** from a third party (not judge or partner) confirming the date is accurate

> If the required documents cannot be obtained, the **statutory declaration alone** is sufficient.

---

### **Proof of Marriage**

- **Primary proof**: A **marriage certificate** issued by a civil authority
- **If unavailable**:
  - A **statutory declaration** by the judge or spouse attesting to the marriage date and reason for lack of certificate
  - A **document comparable to a marriage certificate** (e.g., wedding invitation, church record), or
  - A **statutory declaration** by a third party (not judge or spouse) who attended the ceremony, confirming knowledge of the marriage

---

### **Proof of Cohabitation in a Conjugal Relationship**

- Must be established via a **statutory declaration** in which **both the judge and the common-law partner** attest to the **date of commencement** of cohabitation

> No third-party documentation is required.

---

## **Impact on the Judge’s Annuity**

When a judge makes an election, the **monthly annuity payments are reduced** by the amount of the survivor annuity that would otherwise be paid.

> **Reduction amount** =  
> (Monthly instalments of the annuity granted immediately before the election)  
> − (Monthly instalments of the annuity described in subparagraph 9(b)(i))

> This reduction applies **only during the period of the marriage or cohabitation**.

---

## **Adjustment for Deferred Annuity Recipients**

If a judge initially received a **deferred annuity** and later elects to receive an **immediate annuity**, the reduction amount under section 7 must be **revised** to reflect the new duration of the reduced payments.

---

## **Calculation of the Optional Survivor Annuity**

The survivor annuity is derived from converting the judge’s pre-election benefits into a new structure:

### **Original Benefits (before election):**
- Annuity under Part I of the Judges Act
- Death benefit under subsection 51(3) of the Judges Act
- Supplementary Retirement Benefits Act (SRBA) benefits

### **New Benefits (after election):**
1. **Annuity for the judge** (during marriage/cohabitation):  
   - Monthly payments for the **duration of the marriage or cohabitation**, beginning on the **later of**:
     - The day the election takes effect
     - The day the original annuity becomes payable

2. **Annuity for the judge** (after relationship ends):  
   - Monthly payments equal to the original annuity amount, starting on the day the marriage or cohabitation ends

3. **Survivor annuity** (paid to the spouse/common-law partner):  
   - Equal to **30%, 40%, or 50%** of the monthly amount from (1) above  
   - Begins on the day the judge **dies**, **but only if the judge dies after the first year** following the election  
   - If the judge dies **within the first year**, the survivor receives:
     - The **monthly reduction amount** (as per section 7)
     - Plus **interest** as specified in subsection 44.2(3.1) of the Judges Act

> This ensures that the survivor receives a benefit only if the judge lives long enough to meet the one-year threshold.

## **Actuarial and Demographic Assumptions**

For calculating present values and determining annuity amounts, the following assumptions are used:

### **Mortality Rates**
- For judges:  
  Average mortality rates based on:
  - Judges receiving disability benefits vs. those not receiving disability benefits
  - Based on the most recent *Public Pensions Reporting Act* valuation report
  - Weighted according to the actual benefits paid
- For survivors (spouses):  
  Mortality rates from the same valuation report, specifically for spouses
- For divorce rates:  
  Based on Statistics Canada’s divorce statistics, as established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions

> **Special rule**: If the judge is **under 65 years old**, the mortality weights used are those applied to judges aged **65**, not the judge’s actual age group.

---

### **Interest Rates**

- **First 15 years** after election:
  - Interest rate = **real rate of return** on long-term Government of Canada real return bonds (Series B114018), as published in the **Bank of Canada’s Weekly
