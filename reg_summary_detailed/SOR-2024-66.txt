**Detailed Summary of the Approved Screening Devices Order**

---

**Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the *Approved Screening Devices Order*, is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 320.39(a)a of the Criminal Code of Canada** (R.S.C., c. C-46). Specifically, it provides a list of devices that are officially recognized and approved as *approved screening devices* for the purpose of detecting alcohol in a person’s blood.

The regulation is made by the **Attorney General of Canada**, reflecting the government’s role in enforcing legal standards related to alcohol impairment in transportation and public safety contexts—particularly in relation to driving under the influence (DUI).

**Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to define and list specific devices that are legally recognized as valid tools for determining whether a person has a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) above the legal limit. These devices are used in law enforcement and judicial settings to assist in the detection and prosecution of impaired driving offences.

Under **section 320.11 of the Criminal Code**, a “screening device” is defined as a device designed to ascertain the presence of alcohol in a person’s blood. This Order establishes which such devices are deemed *approved* for use in Canada under the legal framework of the Code.

**Repeal of Previous Orders**

This Order **repeals** two prior versions of the *Approved Screening Devices Order*:
- **SI/85-200** (Statutory Instrument 85-200, 1985)
- **SI/2023-1, s. 1** (Statutory Instrument 2023-1, Section 1)

This repeal signifies a **revision and modernization** of the approved device list. It ensures that only current, reliable, and compliant devices are recognized under Canadian law, removing outdated or obsolete equipment from legal consideration.

**Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means that once the Order is officially published and registered (typically after being published in the Gazette), it becomes legally effective immediately. This ensures timely implementation of updated standards in law enforcement and judicial practices.

**Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Legal Validity**: Devices on this list are legally recognized as valid for use in determining alcohol presence in a person’s breath, which is used to infer blood alcohol concentration. This supports the admissibility of breath test results in court.

2. **Standardization and Reliability**: By approving only specific, well-documented models, the government ensures that breath testing is conducted using devices that meet established scientific and technical standards.

3. **Enforcement and Accountability**: Police and legal authorities can rely on these devices to make accurate and legally defensible decisions in impaired driving investigations.

4. **Modernization**: The inclusion of newer models like the Alcotest 7000 and 6000 reflects ongoing improvements in breath testing technology and compliance with evolving standards.

5. **Public Safety**: Ensures that only proven, accurate devices are used in enforcement, thereby improving public confidence in the fairness and accuracy of impaired driving detection.

**Conclusion**

The *Approved Screening Devices Order* issued on **April 15, 2024**, is a critical regulatory update that formalizes the list of breath testing devices recognized under Canadian law for use in detecting alcohol in a person’s blood. It replaces outdated instruments with a current, reliable, and scientifically sound list of approved devices. This ensures that enforcement of impaired driving laws is consistent, accurate, and grounded in modern technology, thereby enhancing public safety and judicial integrity.
