Certainly. Below is a **detailed and accurate summary** of the provided regulation, structured for clarity and comprehensiveness:

### **Detailed Summary of the Exemption Regulations (Consumer Products)**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**
- These regulations are issued under **Section 38 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**.
- Section 38 empowers the Minister of Health to make regulations that exempt certain consumer products from specific provisions of the Act, provided they are laid before both Houses of Parliament (the House of Commons and the Senate) and no committee reports on them within a specified timeframe.
- The proposed regulations were **laid before the House of Commons on March 31, 2014**, and before the Senate on **April 1, 2014**.
- No appropriate committee from either House of Parliament submitted a report on the proposed regulations.
- As per **paragraph 38(4)(b)** of the CCPSA, a period of **90 calendar days** has elapsed since the proposed regulations were laid before each House.
- Therefore, under **subsection 37(1)** of the CCPSA, the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health) has **formally enacted** the Exemption Regulations (Consumer Products).

> This means the regulations are now legally binding and effective upon registration.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Donation"** is defined as:  
  > *A transfer of a consumer product made without consideration.*  
  This means the product is given freely—there is no payment, exchange, or compensation involved.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Exemption**
- The regulations **exempt retailers** from the application of **subparagraph 13(1)(a)(i)** of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act.
- Specifically, this exemption applies to consumer products that a retailer **obtained through donation**.
- This means that if a retailer receives a consumer product as a donation (e.g., from a nonprofit, individual, or charitable organization), they are **not required** to comply with the safety requirements under subparagraph 13(1)(a)(i), which typically relates to the responsibility of retailers to ensure that products meet safety standards before placing them on the market.

> **Important Note**: This exemption is **not absolute**.

---

#### **4. Conditions and Limitations on the Exemption**
- The exemption **does not apply** if the consumer product was donated by a person who:
  - Is, or was, engaged in **manufacturing**, **importing**, or **selling** such consumer products **in the course of business**.
- This means that if a product is donated by a business (such as a manufacturer or retailer) that operates in the commercial supply chain, the exemption does **not** apply.
- The rationale behind this limitation is to prevent the use of donations to circumvent safety obligations when the donor has a commercial interest in the product and may have failed to ensure its compliance with safety standards.

> In other words, the exemption protects retailers from liability when receiving donated goods from **non-commercial or charitable sources**, but not from **commercial entities** involved in the production or distribution of consumer products.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- This is standard practice for regulatory instruments under the CCPSA, ensuring immediate legal effect upon official publication.

### **Key Takeaways**
| Element | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Legal Authority** | Section 38 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act |
| **Enactment Reason** | No committee report within 90 days; regulations were laid before both Houses |
| **Exemption Applies To** | Retailers receiving consumer products by donation (without consideration) |
| **Exemption Excludes** | Donations from persons engaged in manufacturing, importing, or selling such products in business |
| **Purpose** | To provide relief to retailers who receive donated goods, without compromising product safety standards when the donor has a commercial interest |
| **Effective Date** | Upon registration in the Canada Gazette |

---

### **Implications and Practical Application**
- Retailers can accept donated consumer products (e.g., from charities, community groups, or individuals) without having to verify that those products meet the safety standards required under the CCPSA.
- However, retailers must still ensure that any donated product is **safe for its intended use** and **not hazardous**—this responsibility may fall to the retailer if the product is later sold or distributed.
- The exemption does **not** relieve the donor or the retailer of general safety obligations under other parts of the Act.
- The exclusion of commercial donors ensures that businesses cannot use donations to bypass safety compliance obligations.

---

### **Conclusion**
These Exemption Regulations (Consumer Products) provide a targeted and reasonable exemption for retailers who receive consumer products through charitable or non-commercial donations. They balance the practical realities of charitable giving with the need to maintain consumer safety by excluding donations from commercial actors who might have failed to meet safety standards. The regulations are a practical tool to support charitable distribution while preserving the integrity of the consumer product safety regime under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act.

*Note: The reference to "S.C. 2010, c. 21" appears to be a typographical or formatting error. The actual Statutory Code citation for the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act is S.C. 2010, c. 21, but this is likely a reference to the Act itself, not the regulations. The regulations are a separate instrument issued under it and do not belong to that chapter.*
