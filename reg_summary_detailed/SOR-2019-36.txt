**Detailed Summary of the Mexico Steel Goods Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Source**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **section 115a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision enables the government to make orders related to the remission (i.e., refund or cancellation) of certain surtaxes imposed on imported goods.

The specific legal basis for this order is rooted in:
- **S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)** – which authorizes remission of surtaxes under certain conditions.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – the foundational legislation governing the imposition of surtaxes on steel goods.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this **Mexico Steel Goods Remission Order** is to **grant remission (a refund or cancellation)** of the **surtax** imposed under the **Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods**, as it was in effect on **October 25, 2018**, specifically for steel goods originating in **Mexico**.

This remission applies to goods falling under **Classes 3 and 7** of the schedule to the Surtax Order.

> **Note**: The surtax was originally introduced to address concerns about the impact of imported steel on domestic industries, particularly in response to trade dynamics involving Mexico. This remission is a corrective or relief measure, likely intended to ease the financial burden on importers of Mexican-origin steel goods that meet specific criteria.

### **3. Conditions for Remission**

Remission of the surtax is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

#### **(a) Import Date Requirement**
- The goods must have been **imported into Canada on or after October 25, 2018**, and **before the day on which this Order comes into force**.
- This establishes a specific time window for eligibility (October 25, 2018 – February 2, 2019, or the registration date if later).

#### **(b) Valid Import Permit Requirement**
- An **import permit** must have been issued under the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)** for **item 82 of the Import Control List**.
- The permit must be **valid at the time the claim for remission is submitted**.
- This requirement ensures that the import was legally authorized and complies with Canadian trade control regulations.

#### **(c) Timely Claim Submission**
- The importer must submit a **written claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the responsible minister).
- The claim must be made **within 200 days beginning on October 25, 2018**.
- This deadline is strictly enforced to ensure timely processing and prevent prolonged disputes.

#### **(d) Supporting Evidence**
- The claim must be **supported by evidence** that:
  - The import permit issued for the goods is valid at the time of the claim.
  - The claim includes the **permit number** as part of the documentation.
- This ensures transparency, accountability, and verifiability in the remission process.

### **4. Effective Date of the Order**

- The Order **comes into force on February 2, 2019**.

| **Regulatory Compliance** | Requires strict adherence to EIPA requirements, ensuring that only legally permitted imports qualify. |
| **Burden on Importers** | Importers must proactively identify their eligibility and submit claims within the 200-day window, with full documentation. |
| **Policy Objective** | Likely intended to support trade stability, reduce compliance costs, or respond to geopolitical or economic shifts in steel trade between Canada and Mexico. |

### **6. Conclusion**

This Mexico Steel Goods Remission Order is a **targeted, time-limited, and conditionally based** regulatory measure designed to **refund the surtax** paid by Canadian importers of specific Mexican-origin steel goods (Classes 3 and 7) that were imported between October 25, 2018, and the Order’s effective date. It reflects a balance between trade policy, regulatory compliance, and administrative feasibility.

Importers must meet strict criteria—particularly regarding permit validity and timely claim submission—to qualify. The Order underscores the importance of compliance with import control regulations and the government’s ability to adjust tariff and surtax policies in response to evolving trade conditions.
