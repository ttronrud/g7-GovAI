### **2. Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to a range of tobacco products and accessories, including:

- **Cigarettes**: Defined as any roll or tubular construction containing tobacco and intended for smoking, **excluding** biddis, cigars, kreteks, or tobacco sticks.
- **Other tobacco products**: Biddis, kreteks, little cigars, tobacco sticks, cigarette tobacco, cigarette papers, tubes, and filters.

These products and their associated accessories are subject to strict prohibitions regarding the use of the terms **"light"** and **"mild"**.

---

### **3. Key Prohibitions**

The regulations prohibit the use of the terms **"light"** or **"mild"** in various forms and contexts, including:

#### **A. Variations and Modifications**
- The prohibitions extend to:
  - Any **spelling variations** (e.g., "mild", "milds", "mildness").
  - Any **grammatical forms** (e.g., "lighter", "lightest", "mildly").
  - Any **modifiers** such as "extra", "ultra", or "premium".
  - Any **abbreviations** of "light" or "mild" (e.g., "lt", "ml").

> This broad interpretation ensures that misleading or deceptive claims are not allowed, even in altered forms.

#### **B. Promotion of Tobacco Products**
A person **must not**:
- Promote a bidi, cigarette, kretek, little cigar, tobacco stick, or cigarette tobacco, papers, tubes, or filters **if**:
  - The product **displays** the term "light" or "mild".
  - The product has the term **affixed** to it.

#### **C. Packaging Restrictions**
- A person **must not**:
  - Package a tobacco product (or have it packaged by a third party) in a package that **displays** the term "light" or "mild".
  - Promote a tobacco product through packaging that includes "light" or "mild".

> This prevents misleading marketing by removing the term from packaging, which is a primary point of consumer exposure.

#### **D. Promotion via Accessories**
- A person **must not**:
  - Promote a tobacco product by attaching a **brand element** (such as a logo or name) to an accessory **if** the accessory displays "light" or "mild".
  - Promote a tobacco product **by affixing** a brand element to an accessory that displays "light" or "mild".

> This applies to items like lighters, ashtrays, pens, or cases that bear brand logos. The rule prevents indirect promotion through accessories that falsely suggest reduced harm.

#### **E. Advertising Restrictions**
- A person **must not** use the term "light" or "mild" in **advertisements** of tobacco products.

> This includes print, digital, radio, television, or social media ads.

#### **F. Retail Display Restrictions**
- A person **must not**:
  - Display a tobacco product at retail **if** it bears the term "light" or "mild".
  - Display an accessory at retail **if** it bears a brand element of a tobacco product and displays "light" or "mild".

> This ensures that consumers are not exposed to misleading product labels or promotional materials in physical retail settings.

#### **G. Sale of Accessories**
- A person **must not** sell an accessory that:
  - Displays a brand element of a tobacco product.
  - Also displays the term "light" or "mild".

> This prevents the sale of branded accessories that falsely imply reduced risk.

---

### **4. Enforcement and Effective Dates**

- The **entire set of regulations comes into force** on the day they are registered (i.e., the day of official publication).
- **Sections 6 and 7** (which likely cover specific provisions such as advertising and retail display) come into force **four months after registration**.

> This staggered enforcement allows time for businesses to adjust their marketing, packaging, and retail practices.

### **5. Purpose and Public Health Rationale**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **combat misleading marketing claims** that suggest tobacco products are less harmful.

- Terms like "light" and "mild" have historically been used to **mislead consumers** into believing that such products are safer or cause less harm than regular tobacco products.
- Scientific evidence shows that **even "light" or "mild" cigarettes** still produce harmful levels of carcinogens and contribute to smoking-related diseases.
- By banning these terms, the regulations aim to:
  - Protect public health.
  - Reduce tobacco consumption, especially among youth.
  - Prevent the normalization of false health claims.

---

### **6. Legal and Policy Significance**

- These regulations are part of a broader **public health strategy** to reduce tobacco use and its associated health risks.
- They align with international efforts (e.g., WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control) to ban misleading health claims in tobacco advertising and packaging.
- The inclusion of **accessories** reflects a recognition that marketing extends beyond direct products to related items.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Promotion of Tobacco Products and Accessories Regulations (Prohibited Terms)* are a comprehensive, science-based measure designed to eliminate deceptive claims about tobacco products. By strictly prohibiting the use of "light" and "mild" in all forms—on packaging, in advertising, in retail, and on accessories—the regulations aim to protect consumers from false information and reduce the appeal of tobacco products, particularly among vulnerable populations.

These rules represent a significant step in Canada’s ongoing efforts to reduce tobacco-related illness and death through effective regulation and public health messaging.
