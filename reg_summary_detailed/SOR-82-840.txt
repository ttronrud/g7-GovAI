### **Eligibility and Conditions for Temporary Importation**

A conveyance may be temporarily imported into Canada **only if** it meets **all of the following conditions**:

#### 1. **Purpose of Use in Canada**
- **General Rule**: The conveyance must be used **solely** for:
  - Transporting a resident and accompanying persons from the point of arrival in Canada **directly to a specified destination in Canada**, and then from that destination **to a destination outside Canada**.

- **For a Commuter**:
  - The conveyance must be used for:
    - Personal transportation of the commuter and accompanying persons from arrival in Canada to specified destinations in Canada, and from a Canadian destination to a destination in the **United States**.
    - Or, for personal transportation between the commuter’s residence in Canada and a point in the U.S., or for visiting clients in Canada on behalf of their employer.

- **For a Resident (non-commuter)**:
  - The conveyance may only be imported for:
    - Transporting household or personal effects into or out of Canada, **or**
    - Personal transportation due to an **emergency or unforeseen contingency**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The conveyance **cannot** be used in Canada for:
> - Touring or leisure activities  
> - Carrying passengers or goods for hire or reward  
> - Transporting goods for sale  
> - Soliciting sales or subscriptions on behalf of an employer operating a business in Canada  

This ensures the temporary importation remains strictly personal or business-related and not commercial.

#### 2. **Export Date Must Be Specified**
- At the time of importation, the **importing resident must provide the customs officer with a specific date** indicating when they intend to export the conveyance from Canada.

#### 3. **Export Must Occur Within a Time Limit**
- The conveyance must be exported from Canada **within the time limit specified in Section 5** of the regulations.

> ⚠️ *Note: The original version of this regulation (SOR/88-84) was repealed, suggesting that the current version supersedes older provisions.*

---

### **Maximum Time Period for Stay in Canada**

A conveyance may remain in Canada until **the earlier of**:
- The **intended date of exportation** specified by the resident at importation, **or**
- **30 days** from the date of importation.

> This 30-day default limit ensures that temporary imports do not become prolonged or indefinite.

---

### **Extensions (Exceptional Circumstances)**

If it is **impossible or impracticable** for a resident to comply with the requirements (e.g., due to unforeseen events such as illness, natural disasters, or travel disruptions), the **Minister of National Revenue may grant an extension**.

- The extension can be for **up to 60 days** from the date of importation.
- Extensions are discretionary and must be justified as being truly impractical or impossible to meet the original export deadline.

---

### **Security Requirement**

To ensure compliance and prevent misuse, the Minister may require **security** for the temporarily imported conveyance in the form of:

- **Cash** or  
- A **certified cheque**

The amount required **cannot exceed** the **duties that would have been payable** if **tariff item 9802.00.00** (which typically covers certain types of conveyances) had applied to the vehicle.

> This security mechanism acts as a financial safeguard, ensuring that the conveyance is not used for commercial purposes and that duties will be paid if the vehicle is not exported as intended.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Facilitate Cross-Border Work** | Enables Canadian residents (especially commuters) working in the U.S. to bring their vehicles into Canada without paying duties, supporting mobility and business continuity. |
| **Prevent Commercial Exploitation** | Strict prohibitions on commercial use (e.g., hiring, sales, tourism) prevent misuse and protect the integrity of the customs system. |
| **Ensure Accountability** | The requirement to specify an export date and the 30-day default limit promote transparency and accountability. |
| **Flexibility for Emergencies** | The 60-day extension provides practical relief in rare but real-life situations. |
| **Financial Safeguards** | The security requirement ensures that the government is protected against non-compliance or misuse. |

### **Important Notes and Limitations**

- **Exclusions**: Water-borne craft (boats, ships) are explicitly excluded from this regulation.
- **No Duty Payment**: The conveyance is imported **without paying duties**, as long as it meets the defined conditions.
- **No Recurring Use**: The conveyance cannot be used for regular or repeated trips; it is strictly temporary.
- **Customs Officer Role**: The customs officer must be informed of the intended export date and verify compliance with all conditions.
- **Compliance is Mandatory**: Violations (e.g., using the vehicle for commercial purposes or failing to export on time) may result in penalties, including duty assessments and enforcement actions.
