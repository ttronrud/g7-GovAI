### **Detailed Summary of the Old Crow Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Old Crow Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of official rules established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. These regulations define spatial constraints on construction and development activities near Old Crow Airport in the Yukon Territory to ensure aviation safety, particularly in relation to aircraft approach and takeoff paths.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

- **Authority**: The regulations were made pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I* on **July 31 and August 7, 1993**,
  - Two successive issues of *The Yukon News* on **September 22 and 24, 1993**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

> ✅ The process adheres to democratic and transparent regulatory procedures, ensuring stakeholder input before final implementation.

## **2. Regulatory Title and Scope**

- **Title**: The regulations may be cited as the **Old Crow Airport Zoning Regulations**.
- **Applicability**: They apply to **all land** — including public road allowances — that is:
  - Adjacent to or
  - In the vicinity of Old Crow Airport,
  - As specifically defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

> 📍 The zone includes not only the airport itself but also surrounding areas that could affect flight operations.

## **3. Key Definitions and Geographical References**

The regulations define several critical spatial elements used to establish safety boundaries:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Old Crow Airport, located near Old Crow, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point located on the centerline of runway 03–21, **762 meters from the threshold of runway 21**. Its elevation is **247.8 meters above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport associated with runway 03–21. It is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,644 meters long**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the strip (runway ends), designed to ensure aircraft can safely approach without obstruction. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, connecting them to the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the elevation of the ARP**, but **not below 9 meters above ground level**. |

> 🔍 These definitions are based on the **Old Crow Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3002**, dated March 8, 1993, which serves as the authoritative spatial reference document.

## **4. Spatial Boundaries and Safety Zones**

### **A. Approach Surfaces**
- Two inclined planes, one for each end of runway 03–21:
  - **Slope**: 1 meter vertically to 40 meters horizontally (a 1:40 gradient).
  - **Length**: Extends **3,000 meters horizontally** from each end of the strip.
  - **Horizontal extent**: Outer ends of the plane are **345 meters** from the centerline of the runway.
  - **Elevation**: The top of the inclined plane reaches an **imaginary horizontal line 75 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

> 🚨 These surfaces prevent obstructions (like buildings or trees) from interfering with aircraft during landing or takeoff approaches.

---

### **B. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 gradient** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend **from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Rise until they intersect with the **outer surface**.

> 🚨 These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway environment and the broader outer zone, ensuring no abrupt changes in terrain or structure height.

---

### **C. Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (247.8 m AGL)**.
- **Exception**: If this plane would fall below **9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground**.
- This ensures that even in low-lying areas, there is a minimum safe clearance.

> ⚠️ This defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object in the outer zone.

---

### **D. Outer Boundary of the Zone**
- The entire regulated area is bounded by a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

> 📏 This creates a large, clearly defined zone around the airport, protecting a significant area from vertical obstructions.

---

## **5. Prohibited Activities**

**No person may:**
- Erect or construct any building, structure, or object;
- Make any addition to an existing building, structure, or object;

**on any land subject to these regulations**, if the **highest point** of such structure or object would exceed:

1. The **approach surfaces**,
2. The **outer surface**, or
3. The **transitional surfaces**.

> ❌ This means that even small structures (e.g., towers, antennas, sheds, or trees) must not rise above these defined safety planes.

> 📌 The rule applies to **all structures**, regardless of size or type — including those on public roads or private land within the zone.

---

## **6. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstacles from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- **Maintain visual and physical clearance** for pilots, especially in remote and often challenging Arctic conditions.
- Provide **clear, measurable, and enforceable boundaries** based on established aeronautical standards.

> These measures are essential because Old Crow Airport serves as a critical transportation hub in a remote region of Canada, where weather conditions and terrain can significantly impact flight operations.

---

## **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement would typically involve:
- The **Minister of Transport** or designated aviation authority.
- **Inspections** and **compliance checks** by regional or federal aviation bodies.
- Potential penalties for violations, including fines or orders to remove or modify structures.

> Compliance is mandatory for all landowners and developers within the defined zone.

## **8. Summary Table of Key Parameters**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | 762 m from runway 21 threshold; 247.8 m above sea level |
| **Strip (Runway 03–21)** | 90 m wide, 1,644 m long |
| **Approach Surface Slope** | 1:40 (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal) |
| **Approach Surface Length** | 3,000 m from each end of the strip |
| **Transitional Surface Slope** | 1:7 |
| **Outer Surface Elevation** | 45 m above ARP (minimum 9 m above ground) |
| **Zone Boundary** | Circle of 4,000 m radius centered on ARP |

## **Conclusion**

The **Old Crow Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and scientifically grounded framework to protect aviation safety at one of Canada’s most remote and critical airports. By defining precise elevation and spatial boundaries — including approach, transitional, and outer surfaces — the regulations ensure that no structure poses a hazard to aircraft operations.

The regulations are rooted in public consultation, transparent legal processes, and technical aeronautical standards. They serve as a vital tool for balancing regional development with the need for safe and reliable air access in the Yukon Territory.

> ✅ This regulation is a model example of how federal aviation policy can be implemented in remote regions with respect for both safety and community interests.
