**Detailed Summary of the *Regional Development Incentives Designated Regions Order, 1974***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**"Regional Development Incentives Designated Regions Order, 1974"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as an official administrative instrument under the *Regional Development Incentives Act*.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
This Order designates specific geographic regions across Canada as **"designated regions"** for the purposes of the *Regional Development Incentives Act*. These regions are eligible to receive targeted economic development incentives, such as funding, tax breaks, or infrastructure support, aimed at stimulating growth, employment, and investment in underdeveloped or economically disadvantaged areas.

The designation is **temporary**, effective from the date of enactment until **December 31, 1984** — a period of ten years, which was common for such incentive-based policy frameworks at the time.
