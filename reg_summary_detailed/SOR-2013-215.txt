**Detailed Summary of the CEFTA Verification of Origin of Imported Goods Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

These regulations are a formal implementation of **Customs Notice 09-014**, issued on **June 29, 2009**, by the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency (now Revenue Canada). The notice outlines specific provisions for verifying the **origin of goods** eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the **Canada-EU Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)** — more specifically, the **Common External Tariff (CET) framework** under the **Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)**, though the reference here is to CEFTA (a predecessor or related framework).

The regulations are enacted under the authority of:

- **Section 164c** of the *Customs Act*  
- **Paragraph 167.1(b)a** of the *Customs Act*  

These provisions empower the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) to issue regulations that implement specific customs procedures, including those related to the verification of origin of imported goods.

### **2. Effective Date**

- The regulations **come into force on July 1, 2009**, as specified in **Customs Notice 09-014**.
- This date is explicitly stated in the regulation and is legally binding, meaning all provisions apply from that day forward.

> **Note**: Although the regulation is dated 2012 (S.C. 2012, c. 18, s. 30), this refers to the *statutory citation* or *renewal/referencing* of the regulation in the official gazette, not the date of enactment. The actual effective date remains July 1, 2009.

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation establishes two primary definitions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Act* (S.C. 1992, c. 28, s. 31(1); R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)) — the foundational legislation governing customs procedures in Canada. |
| **Goods** | Means goods for which **preferential tariff treatment under CEFTA is claimed**. This includes all products that are being imported into Canada with a claim to origin status under CEFTA rules. |

> These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in how "origin" is interpreted and applied in the context of preferential tariff treatment.

### **4. Origin Verification Process**

A core function of these regulations is the **verification of whether goods are "originating"** within the meaning of **Annex C of CEFTA**.

#### Key Provisions:

- Upon receiving an **opinion from a customs authority of an EFTA (European Free Trade Association) state of export** regarding whether the goods are originating (i.e., meet the origin criteria under CEFTA), a **Canadian customs officer must review** that opinion.
- The review must include:
  - The **opinion itself**,
  - The **rationale or reasoning** provided for the conclusion,
  - Any **relevant supporting documents** (e.g., certificates, invoices, production records, etc.).

> This ensures that the origin determination is not taken at face value but is subject to independent scrutiny by Canadian authorities to verify compliance with CEFTA’s origin rules.

#### Purpose of Review:
- To ensure that the goods actually meet the **origin criteria** (such as substantial transformation, production location, or use of non-originating materials).
- To prevent fraud, misrepresentation, or improper claims of origin that could result in unfair trade advantages.

### **5. Communication Requirements**

- The **request to the customs administration of the EFTA exporting country** (as required under **section 42.1(1.1)** of the *Customs Act*) must be sent using a method that **produces confirmation of receipt**.
- This means the request must be transmitted via a method that provides **proof of delivery**, such as:
  - Email with read receipt,
  - Certified mail,
  - Electronic transmission with a timestamp and delivery confirmation,
  - Or another method that ensures traceability and accountability.

> This provision enhances transparency and accountability in international communication between Canada and EFTA countries, ensuring that requests for origin opinions are properly documented and received.

### **6. Legal Authority and Purpose**

These regulations serve several key purposes:

- To **implement CEFTA origin rules** in a structured, transparent, and enforceable manner.
- To **protect Canadian trade interests** by ensuring that only genuinely originating goods receive preferential treatment.
- To **align Canadian customs procedures** with international trade agreements, particularly those involving the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the broader CEFTA framework.
