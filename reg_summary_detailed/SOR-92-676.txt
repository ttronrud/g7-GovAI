The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain provisions in a regulatory document, specifically:

> **"Repealed, SOR/2009-317, s. 104"**  
> and  
> **"Repealed, SOR/95-188, s. 3, 4, 6, 8"**

However, **no actual regulation, rule, or substantive content** is included in the text. Instead, it is a list of **repeal notices**, indicating that specific sections of former regulations have been formally removed from law.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Text**
This is **not a regulation** itself, but a **list of repeals** — that is, official notifications that certain legal provisions have been canceled or abolished. These repeals are typically issued by the Government of Canada through the *Statutory Instruments* (SOR – Statutory Orders) system.

#### 2. **Repeal Notices Explained**

- **SOR/2009-317, s. 104**:  
  This refers to a statutory instrument (SOR) published on **April 17, 2009**, titled *Regulations respecting the use of certain substances in the manufacture of tobacco products* (or similar, depending on context). Section 104 of this regulation was **repealed** — meaning it was formally canceled and no longer applies.  
  → The repeated references to this section indicate that **multiple provisions** (or subsections) under that section were either directly or indirectly repealed.

- **SOR/95-188, s. 3, 4, 6, 8**:  
  This refers to a **1995 Statutory Order** (SOR/95-188), which likely dealt with **regulations related to tobacco, health, or environmental protection**. Specific sections (3, 4, 6, and 8) were also **repealed** by later legislation or amendments.

#### 3. **Purpose of Repeal**
Repealing a regulation typically occurs when:
- The law is outdated or no longer relevant.
- A new, more effective, or comprehensive regulation has been introduced.
- There is a need to eliminate conflicting or overlapping provisions.
- Public health, safety, or administrative efficiency requires changes.

In this case, the repeal suggests that **the old rules governing the use, sale, or regulation of certain substances (likely tobacco-related)** were replaced by updated legislation.

#### 4. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- Any legal obligations, penalties, or requirements previously established under those repealed sections are **no longer enforceable**.
- Regulatory agencies (e.g., Health Canada) no longer apply or enforce those rules.
- Businesses or individuals who were operating under those rules must now comply with the **current, updated regulations**.

#### 5. **Why So Many Repeals?**
The repetition of "Repealed, SOR/2009-317, s. 104" and "SOR/95-188, s. 3, 4, 6, 8" suggests:
- A **comprehensive review and modernization** of tobacco or health-related regulations.
- The consolidation or replacement of fragmented rules into a single, coherent framework.
- Possible alignment with international standards or public health initiatives (e.g., tobacco control under the WHO Framework Convention).

### Conclusion

**There is no active regulation in this text.**  
Instead, the content is a **list of repealed provisions** from two prior regulatory instruments:

| Repealed Provision | Source Instrument | Date |
|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| Section 104 | SOR/2009-317 | 2009 |
| Sections 3, 4, 6, 8 | SOR/95-188 | 1995 |

👉 These sections have been **officially removed from law** and are no longer in force.  
👉 The repeal reflects a **modernization of tobacco or health-related regulations** in Canada, likely to improve clarity, effectiveness, and compliance.
