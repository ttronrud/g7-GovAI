### **Detailed Summary of the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Regulations***

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Regulations** and may be cited as such. It serves as a legal framework to prevent pollution in the Arctic waters of Canada and governs the handling, deposit, and liability associated with waste in these sensitive environments.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act* (Loi), which provides the legislative foundation for these rules.
  
- **Arctic Waters**: Defined in Section 3 of the Act. This includes waters within the Canadian Arctic, including the mainland and surrounding islands, and is central to the scope of the regulations.

- **Domestic Waste**: Waste generated from households or residential activities — *not* industrial in origin. Includes sewage and other household byproducts.

- **Industrial Operation**: Any commercial activity involving industry, manufacturing, trade, business, or exploration/exploitation of natural resources (e.g., oil, gas, mining).

- **Industrial Waste**: Waste produced as a byproduct of industrial operations.

- **Operator**: A person listed in paragraphs 6(1)(a) or (b) of the Act — typically entities or individuals responsible for managing or operating facilities that generate or handle waste.

- **Pollution Prevention Officer (PPO)**: A designated official responsible for monitoring and enforcing pollution prevention measures. Officers are located in **Whitehorse (Yukon)** and **Yellowknife (Northwest Territories)**.

- **Sewage Operation**: Any activity related to the collection, storage, transmission, treatment, or disposal of domestic or industrial waste.

- **Zone**: A designated area of Arctic waters established under subsection 11(1) of the Act for shipping safety control. These zones are subject to specific maritime pollution controls.

- **Gold Franc**: A unit of measurement based on 65.5 milligrams of gold with a fineness of 900. Used in financial liability calculations due to historical currency standards.

- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Transport**, responsible for overseeing compliance with financial responsibility requirements for ships.

- **Underwriter**: An insurer approved by the Minister who provides insurance coverage for pollution-related liabilities.

#### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **waste deposits in Arctic waters or on the mainland and islands of the Canadian Arctic**, under conditions where such waste or waste derived from it could enter the Arctic waters.

> ⚠️ **Exemption**: The regulations **do not apply to waste deposited by ships**. Ship-related pollution is governed by a separate Part of these regulations.

---

#### **4. Permitted Waste Deposition**

##### **(a) Domestic Waste**
- Any person may deposit domestic waste **if**:
  - The type and quantity are authorized under either:
    - The **Public Health Ordinance of the Northwest Territories**, or  
    - The **Public Health Ordinance of the Yukon Territory**  
  *(whichever applies)*

> This ensures that waste disposal complies with local public health standards.

##### **(b) Industrial Waste**
- Any person may deposit industrial waste **if**:
  - The type and quantity are authorized under one of the following:
    - *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act*
    - *Territorial Lands Act*
    - *Public Lands Grants Act*  
  *(whichever applies)*

> These laws provide regulatory oversight for industrial operations and waste management in the Arctic.

#### **5. Reporting Obligations (Mandatory Reporting of Violations or Accidents)**

Any individual or entity that:

1. **Deposits waste in violation of Section 4(1) of the Act**, or  
2. **Operates a facility** (on land or in Arctic waters) that is **at risk of causing a waste deposit** due to an accident or other incident,

**must immediately report** the event to a **Pollution Prevention Officer** in either:

- **Whitehorse (Yukon Territory)**, or  
- **Yellowknife (Northwest Territories)**

> Reporting methods:
> - Preferred: **Telecommunication** (phone, radio, etc.)
> - Alternative: **Fastest available means** (e.g., courier, satellite, aircraft) if telecommunication is unavailable.

> ⚠️ This requirement emphasizes rapid response to prevent environmental harm and ensures authorities can act swiftly.

---

#### **6. Maximum Liability for Operators (Under Section 6 of the Act)**

The maximum financial liability of an operator (person/entity) for each waste deposit is calculated differently depending on the type of operation:

| **Operation Type** | **Liability Formula** |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Sewage Operation** | ($500 × daily volume in cubic feet) ÷ 10,000 |
| **Pipeline Operation** | ($500 × volume in barrels between shut-off valves) ÷ 7 |
| **Storage of Solids in Bulk** | ($500 × total volume in cubic feet) ÷ 1,000 |
| **Storage of Liquids** | ($500 × total volume in gallons) ÷ 300 |
| **Impounding of Mill Tailings** | ($500 × total volume in cubic feet over 12 months) ÷ 1,000 |
| **Oil & Gas Exploration/Development** | **$40 million** (fixed cap) |

> These formulas establish a **risk-based liability model**, where larger volumes or more hazardous operations face higher potential penalties.

> 🔍 *Note*: The formula is designed to reflect the scale and risk of waste storage or transport, with a clear cap for high-risk oil and gas activities.

> 📌 **Revoked Clause**: A previous section (SOR/83-229, s.1) was revoked — indicating updates or replacements to liability provisions.

#### **7. Financial Responsibility for Ships in Arctic Zones**

This section applies **only to ships** navigating within designated **shipping safety control zones** (zones).

##### **(a) Requirements for Ship Owners**
To operate within a zone, the **ship owner must file** with the Minister:

1. A **declaration** stating the ship is insured by an approved underwriter for the proposed navigation.
2. A **duplicate copy of a special policy endorsement** for Arctic waters, certified by the underwriter, which must include:

   - The policy and endorsement remain in force **as long as the ship is in a zone**.
   - The policy **cannot be cancelled** by the underwriter without:
     - Providing **written notice to the Minister**.
     - The cancellation becoming effective **30 days after the Minister receives the notice**.

> This ensures long-term stability and accountability in insurance coverage.

##### **(b) Defences Available to Underwriters**
Despite the policy requirement, the special endorsement **may exclude liability** in the following cases:

- Waste deposit caused by:
  - War, hostilities, civil war, insurrection, or a natural phenomenon that is **exceptional, inevitable, and irresistible**.
- Waste caused by:
  - An act or omission by a third party (not the ship owner or agent) **intended to cause damage**.
- Waste caused by:
  - Negligence or wrongful act of a government or authority responsible for navigation aids (e.g., lighthouses).
- Waste caused by **wilful misconduct** by the ship owner.

> These defences limit the underwriter’s liability in cases of non-negligent or non-intentional harm.

##### **(c) Joint Liability Between Ship Owner and Cargo Owner**
- The **owner of cargo** carried on the ship is **jointly and severally liable** with the ship owner for:
  - Filing the declaration.
  - Ensuring its truthfulness.

> This means both parties are legally responsible if a pollution incident occurs and damages are caused.

##### **(d) Maximum Joint and Several Liability**
- The total liability (ship owner + cargo owners) for a single incident or series of incidents with the same origin is calculated as:

  > **2,000 gold francs × ship’s tonnage (in tons)**

- However, this **cannot exceed 210 million gold francs**.

> This establishes a **proportional liability system** based on the size of the vessel, with a strict cap to prevent excessive financial exposure.

##### **(e) Reduction of Liability for Remedial Actions**
- If the ship owner or underwriter takes **reasonable actions** to:
  - Repair damage caused by a waste deposit, or
  - Reduce or mitigate loss to life or property,

> Then the **liability cap is reduced** by the **costs and expenses** of such actions — **if proven to be reasonable and incurred in good faith**.

> This incentivizes prompt remediation and reduces financial penalties when effective action is taken.

##### **(f) Gold Franc Conversion**
- The values of **2,000 gold francs** and **210 million gold francs** are **not in current currency**.
- Their equivalent in modern Canadian dollars (CAD) is determined according to the **Canada Shipping Act Gold Franc Conversion Regulations**.

> This ensures that liability amounts remain meaningful and enforceable in today’s economic context.

##### **(g) Definition of Tonnage**
- If the ship is **registered in Canada**:
  - Tonnage = **Registered tonnage + engine room space allowance** (used to determine actual capacity).
- If the ship is **not registered in Canada**:
  - Tonnage is calculated as if it were registered in Canada (based on standard Canadian registration rules).

> This ensures consistent
