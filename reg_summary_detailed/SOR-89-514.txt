### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed, meaning it is no longer applicable or enforceable under current legislation.

**2. Legal Basis for Repeal:**  
The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2008-231, section 18**.  
- SOR stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulation* in Canada.  
- SOR/2008-231 is a regulatory document issued in 2008.  
- Section 18 specifically identifies the provisions that were repealed.

**3. Purpose of the Original Regulation (Inferred):**  
Although the original content of the regulation is not provided, the repeated references suggest that it was likely a rule or provision related to a specific area of regulation—possibly in areas such as:
- Environmental protection
- Health and safety
- Financial services
- Licensing or permits
- Workplace standards  
*(Note: Without the original text, the exact subject matter cannot be definitively determined.)*

**4. Implications of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, requirements, or prohibitions previously set out in the regulation are **no longer binding**.  
- Entities or individuals previously subject to the regulation must now comply with **current, updated rules** that replaced it or apply in its absence.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative review or modernization effort to improve clarity, reduce redundancy, or align with new policy goals.

**5. Legal Effect:**  
Repeal by a Statutory Instrument (like SOR/2008-231) is a formal and legally valid process under Canadian regulatory law. It means the regulation is **officially removed from the legal framework**, and its provisions are treated as if they never existed.

**6. Access to Original Text:**  
To understand the original scope and content of the regulation, one would need to consult the **original version** of the regulation prior to repeal—this may be available in the *Canada Gazette*, the *Regulations and Orders database*, or through the *Government of Canada’s legislation website* (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).
