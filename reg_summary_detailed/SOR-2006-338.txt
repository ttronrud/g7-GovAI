The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2009-176, section 29**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from legal effect).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2009-176**, specifically **section 29** of that instrument.
- **Frequency of Repeal Indication**: The phrase "[Repealed, SOR/2009-176, s. 29]" appears 17 times, which likely reflects a formatting or duplication error in the original document. It does not indicate that multiple separate regulations were repealed — rather, it suggests that the same regulation (or a set of provisions) was repeatedly cited in a list or database, possibly due to a technical or editorial error.
- **Legal Implication**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer in force and has no legal effect. Any reference to it in current law, administrative procedures, or compliance requirements is invalid or obsolete.
- **Contextual Background**: SOR/2009-176 is a Statutory Instrument issued in Canada (typically under the authority of a federal or provincial government). In this case, the repeal likely pertains to a regulation under a specific act (e.g., a provincial or federal statute), though the specific subject matter of the repealed regulation is not provided in the text.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does **not** contain a detailed summary of an active regulation. Instead, it indicates that a regulation (or set of provisions) has been **formally repealed** by **Section 29 of Statutory Instrument 2009-176**. The repeated citations are likely a duplication error and do not reflect distinct regulatory content. As such, **no substantive details about the original regulation’s content, scope, or purpose** are available from this text.

To obtain a meaningful summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation before repeal, which is not included in the provided input.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This summary is based solely on the given text. Without access to the original regulation or its parent statute, the specific subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, licensing, taxation, etc.) cannot be determined.
