The regulation you provided is a **proclamation under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. It serves to **reassign certain powers, duties, and functions** within the Canadian federal government’s emergency preparedness and public safety framework. Below is a detailed and structured summary of the regulation:

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- **Act**: *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*  
  - This is the enabling legislation that allows for the transfer of powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers within the public service.
- **Specific Provision**: Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Act  
  - This provision authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer powers, duties, and functions from one minister to another, particularly when such transfers are necessary for administrative efficiency, restructuring, or to align with broader government priorities.

---

### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
- **Powers, Duties, and Functions**:  
  These are specifically those under **Section 7 of the Emergency Management Act**.
- **Scope of Section 7 (Emergency Management Act)**:  
  Section 7 of the *Emergency Management Act* typically grants the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP) broad responsibilities related to:
  - The development and implementation of emergency management strategies.
  - Oversight of emergency preparedness programs.
  - Coordination of emergency response and recovery efforts.
  - Ensuring national readiness for emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, or acts of terrorism).
  - Establishing and maintaining emergency management frameworks and policy guidance.

---

### **3. Prior Transfer (Background)**
- The powers, duties, and functions under Section 7 of the *Emergency Management Act* were **previously transferred** to the **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)** via:
  - **Order in Council P.C. 2024-1183**, dated **November 8, 2024**.
- This earlier transfer was part of a reorganization to streamline emergency preparedness responsibilities and improve interdepartmental coordination.

---

### **4. Current Action (This Regulation)**
- This regulation **transfers the same powers, duties, and functions** from the **Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness)** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP)**.
- This is a **reversion or consolidation** of responsibilities, effectively placing emergency management oversight directly under the MPSEP, who is the senior minister responsible for public safety and emergency preparedness.

---

### **5. Purpose and Rationale**
- **Enhanced Oversight and Accountability**: By centralizing emergency management functions under the MPSEP, the government aims to strengthen coordination, improve policy coherence, and ensure that emergency preparedness is integrated into broader public safety objectives.
- **Streamlined Governance**: Eliminates potential duplication or fragmentation by removing the intermediate layer of the Minister of State.
- **Alignment with Government Priorities**: Reflects a broader government strategy to strengthen public safety and emergency response capabilities, especially in light of evolving risks (e.g., climate change, cyber threats, pandemics).

---

### **6. Legal and Procedural Significance**
- The transfer is **formalized through a statutory instrument** (SI/2024-58), which is a type of delegated regulation under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- It is **not a new legislative enactment**, but rather a procedural adjustment to existing responsibilities.
- The transfer is **not a creation of new powers**, but a reallocation of existing ones, ensuring continuity in emergency management operations.

---

### **7. Relevant Statutory References**
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**  
  - Original enabling provision under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- **R.S., c. P-34**  
  - Refers to the *Emergency Management Act* (the primary legislation governing emergency preparedness).

### **8. Key Implications**
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Reduces bureaucratic layers in emergency management.
- **Clearer Accountability**: The MPSEP now bears full responsibility for emergency preparedness policy and operations.
- **Continuity of Service**: No disruption to emergency preparedness programs or services; only a change in ministerial ownership.
- **Policy Integration**: Emergency preparedness is now more fully integrated into the broader public safety portfolio.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation constitutes a **restructuring of ministerial responsibilities** within Canada’s emergency management framework. By transferring the powers, duties, and functions under Section 7 of the *Emergency Management Act* from the Minister of State (Emergency Preparedness) to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the government strengthens central oversight, improves coordination, and ensures that emergency preparedness is managed under a single, accountable leadership structure. The move is consistent with modern public safety governance and reflects a strategic realignment to meet current and future national risks.
