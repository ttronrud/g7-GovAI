**Detailed Summary of the *Deceased or Former Members Dependents Payment Order***

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, known as the **Deceased or Former Members Dependents Payment Order**, establishes the rules for the distribution of a **gratuity or unpaid balance of a gratuity** upon the death or discharge of a member of the armed forces or a related service, specifically when dependants are involved. It is enacted under **subsection 5(2) of the War Service Grants Act** and provides a structured, equitable method for allocating the payment to eligible individuals, depending on their relationship to the deceased member and their eligibility status.

The Order ensures that dependants receive a fair share of the gratuity based on their prior entitlement to dependants’ allowance, with provisions for equitable division when multiple individuals qualify. It also includes a discretionary exception for cases where strict adherence to the rules might result in injustice.

### **Key Provisions and Structure**

The Order is organized into **four main scenarios**, each based on the number and type of individuals who qualify under different subparagraphs of **paragraph 5(1)** of the War Service Grants Act. These scenarios are:

---

#### **Scenario 1: One Person in Receipt of Dependents' Allowance (Paragraph 5(1)(a))**

- **Condition**:  
  There is **only one person** receiving dependants’ allowance on behalf of the deceased member immediately before death or discharge.  
  **No one** qualifies under paragraph 5(1)(b) (which refers to certain dependents such as spouses or children who are not receiving allowance).

- **Outcome**:  
  That **single person** receives the **entire gratuity or the unpaid balance thereof**, as applicable.

> *Example*: A widow was the only person receiving dependants’ allowance; no children or other dependents qualify under (b). She receives the full gratuity.

---

#### **Scenario 2: No One Receiving Allowance, But One Person Qualifies Under Paragraph 5(1)(b)**

- **Condition**:  
  No person was receiving dependants’ allowance immediately before death or discharge.  
  However, **only one person** qualifies under paragraph 5(1)(b) (e.g., a child or dependent not receiving allowance at the time of death).

- **Outcome**:  
  That **single person** receives the **entire gratuity or unpaid balance**.

> *Example*: The deceased had no dependents receiving allowance, but one child is eligible under (b). That child receives the full gratuity.

---

#### **Scenario 3: More Than One Person Qualifies (Combined from (a) and (b))**

- **Condition**:  
  The total number of persons receiving dependants’ allowance immediately before death **plus** the number of persons eligible under paragraph 5(1)(b) is **more than one**.

- **Outcome**:  
  The gratuity or unpaid balance is **divided among all qualifying persons** in **proportional shares** based on the **monthly dependants’ allowance** each person would have received at the time of death.

  - **Formula**:  
    Each person’s share =  
    (Monthly allowance payable to that person) ÷ (Total monthly allowance payable to all qualifying persons)

- **Exception if not all apply**:  
  If **not all qualifying persons apply** for the gratuity, only those who do apply receive a share **proportional to what they would have received if all had applied**.

> *Example*: Two children were receiving allowance, and one child qualifies under (b). Total allowance = $1,200/month (split between them). If only one child applies, they receive only their proportional share (e.g., 60% of the total) — not the full amount.

> *Purpose*: Ensures fairness and prevents overpayment to those who do not formally apply.

---

#### **Scenario 4: Qualification under Paragraph 5(1)(c)**

- **Condition**:  
  No person qualifies under (a), (b), or (c) — this section is actually a misstatement in the original text. Correction:  
  The correct structure is:

  > Where **no person qualifies under (a), (b), or (c)**, and  
  > there is **only one person** who qualifies under **paragraph 5(1)(c)**, that person receives the gratuity.  
  > If **more than one person** qualifies under (c), the gratuity is divided **proportionally** based on the **monthly pay assigned** to each person at the time of death.

- **Clarification of (c)**:  
  Paragraph 5(1)(c) likely refers to **persons entitled to certain benefits due to specific service-related circumstances** (e.g., dependents who are not covered under (a) or (b), such as certain disabled dependents or long-term care recipients).  
  The division is based on the **monthly amount of pay assigned** to each such person.

- **Proportional Division**:  
  Each person’s share =  
  (Monthly pay assigned to that person) ÷ (Total monthly pay assigned to all qualifying persons under (c))

- **Application Exception**:  
  If not all qualifying persons apply, only those who apply receive the **proportional share** they would have received had all applied.

> *Purpose*: Provides a mechanism for distributing benefits to dependents who fall into a different category of eligibility (e.g., non-standard dependents).

---

#### **Scenario 5: Qualification under Paragraph 5(1)(a) – Final Case**

- **Condition**:  
  No person qualifies under (a), (b), or (c).  
  However, **only one person** qualifies under **paragraph 5(1)(a)** (i.e., someone who is eligible for dependants’ allowance under general provisions).

- **Outcome**:  
  That person receives the **entire gratuity or unpaid balance**.

- **If more than one person qualifies under (a)**:  
  The gratuity is **divided proportionally** based on the **monthly dependants’ allowance** payable to each person at the time of death.

  - Formula:  
    Each person’s share =  
    (Monthly allowance payable to that person) ÷ (Total monthly allowance payable to all qualifying persons)

- **Application Exception**:  
  If not all persons apply, only those who apply receive the **portion they would have received had all applied**.

> *Note*: This scenario is essentially a repeat of Scenario 3 but applied to individuals under (a), which is the general dependants’ allowance category.

### **General Principles**

1. **Proportional Distribution**:  
   In all cases where more than one person qualifies, the gratuity is **divided in direct proportion** to the **monthly dependants’ allowance** (or pay) each person would have received at the time of death.

2. **Application Requirement**:  
   If not all eligible persons apply for the gratuity, **only those who do apply** receive a share — and only the **portion they would have received** had all applied. This prevents unjust enrichment or loss of benefits to non-applicants.

3. **Fairness and Equity**:  
   The rules aim to ensure that dependants are treated fairly based on their financial need and prior entitlement, not just on whether they formally applied.

### **Discretionary Exception**

> **"Notwithstanding this Order, where it appears in any particular case that injustice results from compliance with the foregoing provisions, the case may be disposed of otherwise, after all the facts of the case have been considered."**

- This clause provides **judicial discretion**.
- If applying the rules leads to an outcome that is **unfair or unjust** (e.g., a child with no income receiving a small share while a parent with greater need receives more), the authorities may **override the rules** and make a different determination.
- The decision must be based on a **full assessment of the facts** of the individual case.

> *Purpose*: Prevents rigid application from producing inequitable or harmful outcomes in rare, complex, or exceptional situations.

### **Practical Implications**

- **For claimants**: Must determine their eligibility under (a), (b), or (c) and whether they were receiving allowance at the time of death.
- **For administrators**: Must calculate the total monthly allowance of all qualifying dependants and divide the gratuity accordingly.
- **For fairness**: The rules prevent overpayment to those who did not apply, while ensuring that those with greater financial need (as reflected in allowance amounts) receive a larger share.

### **Conclusion**

The *Deceased or Former Members Dependents Payment Order* establishes a **clear, equitable, and structured framework** for distributing gratuities to dependants of deceased or discharged members. It balances **legal precision** with **practical fairness**, ensuring that payments reflect both eligibility and financial need. The inclusion of a discretionary clause allows for **exceptional cases** where strict application would lead to injustice
