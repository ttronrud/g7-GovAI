**Detailed Summary of the Lower St. Lawrence Region Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order**

### **Levies Imposed on Producers**

Producers are required to pay **three types of levies** when their wood is marketed in **interprovincial or export trade**. Each levy is calculated based on the **unit of measurement** used for the wood.

#### **1. General Administration Levy**  
A base fee to support the administrative operations of the Syndicate. The rate depends on how the wood is measured:

| Unit of Measurement | Levy Rate |
|--------------------|----------|
| **Cords of 128 apparent cubic feet** | $0.75 per cord |
| **Cubic feet** | $0.88 per 100 cubic feet |
| **Foot-board measures (fbm)** | $1.76 per 1,000 foot-board measure |
| **Cubic-foot tree lengths (cubic-foot tree length)** | $0.0088 per cubic-foot tree length |
| **Apparent cubic metres (m³)** | $0.21 per apparent cubic metre |
| **Solid cubic feet** | $0.32 per solid cubic foot |

> *Note:* These rates are designed to ensure consistent and fair collection regardless of the unit used in commerce.

#### **2. Research Levy**  
A fee dedicated to supporting **research activities** related to the forestry sector. The rate depends on the tree type:

| Tree Type | Levy Rate |
|----------|-----------|
| **Coniferous trees** (e.g., pine, spruce, fir) | $0.04 per apparent cubic metre |
| **Deciduous trees** (e.g., maple, birch, beech) | $0.02 per apparent cubic metre |

> This levy supports scientific studies and innovation in sustainable forest management and wood utilization.

#### **3. Working Fund Levy**  
A fee directed toward **production costs and operational support** for the pulp, paper, and chipboard industries. It applies only when wood is used in **pulp, paper, or chipboard production**.

| Type of Wood | Levy Rate |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Pulpwood from coniferous trees** or **debarked pulpwood from deciduous trees** | $0.62 per apparent cubic metre |
| **Undebarked pulpwood from deciduous trees** | $0.41 per apparent cubic metre |

> This levy is **not applicable** to all types of wood; it only applies to wood destined for industrial processing into pulp, paper, or chipboard.

---

### **Payment Requirements**

- **Payment Deadline**:  
  Producers must pay all levies (under Sections 1 and 2) to the Syndicate **within 30 days** after the marketing of the wood in interprovincial or export trade.

- **Payment Location**:  
  All levies must be paid to the **Syndicate’s headquarters in Rimouski, Quebec**.

---

### **Deduction and Collection Mechanisms**

#### **1. Syndicate as Market Agent**  
If the **Syndicate markets the wood on behalf of a producer**, it may **deduct the applicable levy directly** from any payment it makes to the producer.

> This ensures that producers are not burdened with direct payments when the Syndicate acts as a seller or exporter.

#### **2. Third-Party Marketers (Non-Syndicate Sellers)**  
If a producer **does not pay the levy directly** to the Syndicate, and the Syndicate has **not deducted the levy**, then **any person who markets the producer’s wood** in interprovincial or export trade must:

- **Deduct the full levy** from any payment made to the producer; and  
- **Pay over and account to the Syndicate** for the deducted amount **within 30 days** after the marketing event.

> This mechanism ensures that the levy is collected regardless of whether the producer pays directly or through a third party.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The levies serve several key objectives:

1. **Administrative Funding**:  
   The general administration levy funds the Syndicate’s operational costs, including marketing, record-keeping, and compliance.

2. **Research & Innovation**:  
   The research levy supports forestry science, sustainable practices, and long-term industry development.

3. **Industrial Support**:  
   The working fund levy helps finance the infrastructure and processes needed in the pulp, paper, and chipboard industries — particularly for wood destined for high-value industrial products.

4. **Fair and Transparent Collection**:  
   The multiple measurement units ensure that producers are not unfairly burdened based on the method of trade reporting.

5. **Ensuring Compliance**:  
   The deduction rules ensure that levies are collected even when producers do not pay directly, preventing evasion and ensuring equitable contribution from all producers.

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Geographic Scope** | Limits levy application to specific municipalities in the Lower St. Lawrence region, avoiding broader application. |
| **Measurement Flexibility** | Allows levies to be applied across various industry standards, making it practical for diverse trade practices. |
| **Industry-Specific Levies** | Differentiates between wood types and end uses (e.g., pulp vs. general timber), enabling targeted funding. |
| **Enforcement Mechanism** | Third-party deduction provisions create a strong compliance framework, even when producers fail to pay directly. |
| **Transparency** | Clear rates and rules make the levy system predictable and transparent for producers. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Lower St. Lawrence Region Wood Producers’ Levy (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* is a targeted, well-structured regulatory instrument designed to:

- Generate sustainable funding for administrative, research, and industrial development functions;
- Ensure equitable and consistent collection of levies across the region;
- Support the economic viability of the forestry sector in Quebec through targeted investment in research and production.

By clearly defining the scope, rates, payment obligations, and enforcement mechanisms, the Order promotes transparency, accountability, and fair participation among wood producers in the Lower St. Lawrence region engaged in interprovincial and export trade.

> **Note**: This regulation is part of a broader framework under the *Quebec Wood Order, 1983*, which aims to regulate the production, marketing, and financial responsibilities of wood producers in Quebec. It reflects a balance between producer burden and public interest in sustainable forest management and industry development.
