**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal **revocation and reauthorization** issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture** and the **Treasury Board**.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Legal Basis**:
   - The regulation is issued pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the authority to make or revoke orders related to the prescription of fees by federal ministers, particularly when such fees are required for administrative or service delivery purposes.

2. **Revocation**:
   - The regulation **revokes** the previous **Minister of Agriculture Authority to Prescribe Fees Order** issued by **Order in Council P.C. 1985-2271**, dated **July 24, 1985**. This means that the prior order, which had established a fee structure for rabies vaccinations, is no longer in effect.

3. **Reauthorization**:
   - The regulation **reauthorizes** the Minister of Agriculture to prescribe, by future order, the fee that will be charged to the **owner of a pet** for having the pet vaccinated against rabies by an employee of the **Department of Agriculture**.
   - This reauthorization allows the Minister to **set a new fee** based on current administrative, financial, or policy considerations, subject to the oversight and approval processes outlined in the Financial Administration Act.

4. **Scope of Application**:
   - The fee applies specifically to **rabies vaccinations** administered by **employees of the Department of Agriculture**.
   - The fee is payable by the **owner of the pet**, making it a direct cost borne by pet owners to access a public health service aimed at preventing rabies transmission.

5. **Purpose and Policy Rationale**:
   - The regulation reflects a shift in fee management, likely to ensure that rabies vaccination fees are:
     - Fair and equitable,
     - Reflect current operational costs,
     - Aligned with public health goals (such as disease prevention and animal welfare),
     - Responsibly managed through a formal, transparent process involving ministerial authority and financial accountability.

6. **Governance and Oversight**:
   - The process of setting the fee is now subject to the **Minister of Agriculture’s authority**, but the final decision is made through a formal **order in council**, ensuring transparency and accountability.
   - The Treasury Board’s involvement underscores that the fee is part of broader financial administration and must comply with federal financial regulations.

### Implications:

- **For Pet Owners**: The fee structure may change, potentially increasing or decreasing depending on the new order issued by the Minister. Owners will be required to pay the newly prescribed amount for rabies vaccinations.
- **For the Department of Agriculture**: The department now has the flexibility to adjust fees based on updated costs or policy priorities, while remaining within legal and financial frameworks.
- **For Public Health**: Maintaining a consistent and enforceable rabies vaccination program is supported by a stable, legally grounded fee system.

### Conclusion:

This regulation effectively **ends the previous 1985 fee structure** and **reinstates the authority of the Minister of Agriculture to set a current, up-to-date fee** for rabies vaccinations. It ensures that the fee-setting process remains legally sound, transparent, and responsive to both financial and public health needs, all under the framework of the Financial Administration Act.
