### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Department of Public Works Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context**
This regulation, formally titled the *Department of Public Works Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993*, establishes a temporary exclusion from the full application of the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** for certain short-term employees in specific groups within the **Department of Public Works**.

The primary objective is to allow flexibility in hiring temporary or short-term personnel—those engaged for periods of **less than three months**, with a total of **less than six months in any consecutive 12-month period**—without being subject to the comprehensive employment protections and requirements typically governed by the Public Service Employment Act.

This decision was made during a specific time frame: **April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.

---

#### **2. Scope of Exclusion (Who Is Excluded?)**

The exclusion applies to individuals appointed on or after **April 1, 1993**, for one or more specified short-term appointments that meet the following criteria:

- Each individual appointment is **less than three months** in duration.
- The **aggregate total** of all such appointments within any **consecutive 12-month period** does **not exceed six months**.

These appointments are restricted to the following **departments, groups, and categories** within the Department of Public Works:

---

##### **Administrative Support Category**
- Clerical and Regulatory Group  
- Secretarial, Stenographic, Typing Group  
- Data Processing Group  
- Office Equipment Group  

##### **Operational Category**
- General Labour and Trades Group  
- General Services Group  
- Heating, Power and Stationary Plant Operation Group  
- Ships’ Crews Group  

##### **Technical Category**
- Drafting and Illustration Group  
- General Technical Group  
- Engineering and Scientific Support Group  
- Electronics Group  
- Ships’ Officers Group  
- Social Science Support Group  

##### **Scientific and Professional Category**
- Architecture and Town Planning Group  
- Engineering and Land Survey Group  

> **Note**: This exclusion does *not* apply to other groups or departments outside the Department of Public Works.

#### **3. Legal Basis**

The regulation is grounded in two key provisions of the **Public Service Employment Act**:

- **Section 41(1)**: Allows the Public Service Commission to **exclude certain individuals** from the operation of the PSEA when it is determined to be **not practicable or in the best interest of the Public Service**.
- **Section 37(1)**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to **make regulations** respecting the employment of such individuals under specific conditions.

The Public Service Commission determined that applying the full scope of the PSEA to these short-term, low-duration appointments would:
- Be **operationally impractical**,
- Create **administrative burdens**,
- And not serve the **public interest** in terms of workforce flexibility and responsiveness.

#### **4. Key Provisions of the Order**

| Provision | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Exclusion Approval** | The Governor in Council formally **approves** the Public Service Commission’s decision to exclude the specified short-term employees from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act. |
| **Regulatory Creation** | The Governor in Council also **makes regulations** that define and govern the conditions under which these short-term appointments can be made, ensuring clarity and enforceability. |
| **Duration** | The exclusion and regulations are valid **only from April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**. This is a **limited, time-bound** measure. |
| **Definition of "Persons"** | In the Order, "persons" refers to individuals who are **not employed under the Public Service Employment Act** during this period. This clarifies that these employees are outside the Act’s jurisdiction. |

#### **5. Rationale and Justification**

The Public Service Commission concluded that:
- Short-term appointments are common in technical, operational, and support roles in public infrastructure and service delivery.
- These roles often require **flexible staffing** due to seasonal demands, project-based work, or emergency needs.
- Applying full employment standards (such as job security, collective bargaining rights, or benefits) to such short-term roles would:
  - Be **costly and administratively inefficient**,
  - **Hinder operational agility**,
  - And **undermine the ability of the Department to respond quickly** to changing needs.

Therefore, the exclusion was deemed both **practicable and in the public interest**.

---

#### **6. Legal and Administrative Implications**

- **No Employment Rights Under PSEA**: Employees covered by this exclusion are **not entitled** to the protections and obligations of the Public Service Employment Act (e.g., job security, grievance procedures, or certain leave entitlements).
- **Employment Terms Are Governed by Contract or Agency Rules**: Their terms of employment will be determined by **contractual agreements**, **departmental policies**, or **specific project requirements**, rather than public service employment standards.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: The regulation is subject to oversight by the Public Service Commission and the Secretary of State of Canada, ensuring that the exclusion is not abused and remains within its intended scope.

---

#### **7. Duration and Limitations**

- The exclusion and regulations are **temporary**, effective only from **April 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993**.
- It does **not extend beyond** this period.
- The exclusion is **not retroactive**—it only applies to appointments made on or after April 1, 1993.
- It is **not applicable to long-term or permanent appointments**.

---

#### **8. Citation and Reference**

- **Official Title**: *Department of Public Works Terms Under Three Months Exclusion Approval Order, 1993*
- **Reference in Law**: Section 41(1) and Section 37(1) of the Public Service Employment Act
- **Key Term**: "persons" is defined as individuals not employed under the Public Service Employment Act during the specified period.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **targeted, time-limited exemption** from the Public Service Employment Act to allow the Department of Public Works to manage **short-term, project-based, or seasonal staffing needs** efficiently and flexibly during a specific period in 1993.

It reflects a balance between:
- **Public service accountability** and
- **Operational practicality** in staffing.

By excluding short-term appointments (under six months total in any 12-month period) in specific functional groups, the government enabled greater responsiveness in public service delivery without compromising the broader integrity of public employment standards.

However, due to its **limited scope and duration**, this measure does not represent a long-term reform but rather a **temporary administrative solution** to a specific staffing challenge.
