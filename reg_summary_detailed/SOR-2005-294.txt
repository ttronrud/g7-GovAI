**Detailed Summary of the Eastport Marine Protected Areas Regulations**  
*Issued under the Oceans Act, S.C. 1996, c. 31*  
*Made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pursuant to subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act*

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope of the Regulations**

These regulations establish two designated **marine protected areas (MPAs)** within **Bonavista Bay**, Newfoundland and Labrador, specifically:

- The **Eastport – Duck Island Marine Protected Area**  
- The **Eastport – Round Island Marine Protected Area**

The primary purpose is to **protect and conserve marine ecosystems** by restricting activities that could disturb, damage, destroy, or remove living marine organisms or their habitats. The regulations are part of Canada’s broader framework for marine conservation under the *Oceans Act*, which aims to preserve biodiversity, support sustainable use of marine resources, and ensure the long-term health of ocean environments.

### **2. Key Definitions and Technical Provisions**

#### **Definition of "Waters"**
- The term *“waters”* includes:
  - The surface waters of the sea, as well as
  - The **seabed and subsoil** extending down to a depth of **two metres**.
- This ensures that both surface and near-bottom ecosystems are protected.

#### **Geodetic Reference System**
- All geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) in the regulations are expressed using the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)**.
- This standard ensures accuracy and consistency in mapping and boundary delineation across Canada.

#### **Boundary Representation**
- In **Schedule 1**, the boundaries of the Duck Island MPA are defined using **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing).
  - Rhumb lines are straight lines on a map when plotted on a Mercator projection, making them useful for navigation and boundary drawing.
  - The outer boundary is a closed loop connecting five points:
    - 48°45′06″N, 53°41′18″W  
    - 48°44′30″N, 53°40′42″W  
    - 48°43′54″N, 53°41′18″W  
    - 48°44′30″N, 53°42′06″W  
    - Back to the starting point.
  - The **inner limit** of this area is the **low-water line** of the islands within the outer boundary.

- In **Schedule 2**, the boundary of the Round Island MPA is defined as:
  - A buffer zone **198.12 metres (650 feet)** from the **nearest point of the low-water line** of Round Island.
  - The **inner limit** is again the **low-water line** of Round Island.
  - This creates a protective corridor around the island, safeguarding adjacent marine habitats.

### **3. Prohibited Activities in Marine Protected Areas**

No person may:
- **Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove** any:
  - Living marine organism (e.g., fish, invertebrates, marine mammals)
  - Any part of its **habitat** (e.g., coral reefs, seagrass beds, sediment layers)
- **Deposit, discharge, or dump** any substance (including pollutants, waste, or materials) into the area if such action is likely to result in:
  - Disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal of marine life or habitat.

> This prohibition applies throughout the entire designated area, including the seabed and subsoil to a depth of two metres.

---

### **4. Exceptions to Prohibited Activities**

Despite the general ban, the following activities are **permitted**:

#### **(a) Aboriginal Communal Fishing**
- Fishing activities carried out under the **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations** are allowed.
- This recognizes the rights and traditional practices of Indigenous communities and ensures that cultural and subsistence fishing is not prohibited.

#### **(b) Public Safety, National Defence, National Security, or Law Enforcement**
- Activities related to:
  - Emergency response (e.g., search and rescue)
  - National defence or security operations
  - Law enforcement (e.g., marine patrols)
- These are considered essential and justified under public interest.

---

### **5. Scientific and Educational Activities – Approval Process**

Any person proposing to conduct a **scientific or educational activity** in a marine protected area must submit a **detailed plan** to the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** at least **60 days before** the activity begins.

#### **Required Elements of the Plan:**
1. **Contact Information**: Name, address, phone number, fax, and email of a responsible contact person.
2. **Activity Description**:
   - Purpose of the activity
   - Duration(s) of the activity
   - Map showing the exact location
   - Types of data to be collected and sampling methods
3. **Equipment Details**:
   - Types of equipment (e.g., drones, underwater cameras, sampling gear)
   - Whether equipment will be anchored or moored, and if so, the method
4. **Vessel Information**:
   - Full details of every vessel used (as defined under Section 2 of the *Canada Shipping Act*)
5. **Substances to be Deposited/Discharged**:
   - Any materials that may be introduced into the area (e.g., fuel, chemicals)
6. **Environmental Impact Assessment**:
   - A formal assessment of the likely environmental effects of the activity on marine life and habitats.
7. **Licences, Permits, and Authorizations**:
   - A list of all existing or applied-for permits related to the activity.

#### **Minister’s Approval Criteria**

The Minister will approve the plan **within 30 days** of receipt **only if**:

- The proposed activity is **not likely to damage or destroy** the habitat of living marine organisms.
- **For scientific activities**:
  - The activity must be for the purpose of:
    - Managing the marine protected area, or
    - Monitoring the effectiveness of conservation measures already in place.
- **For educational activities**:
  - The activity must aim to:
    - Increase public awareness of the MPA
    - Provide information about conservation measures in place.

> **Critical Exception**:  
> The Minister **shall not approve** any plan if the **cumulative environmental effects** — including past and current activities — are likely to result in habitat damage or destruction.  
> This emphasizes a **cumulative impact assessment**, recognizing that even small, repeated activities can degrade ecosystems over time.

### **6. Reporting Requirements for Accidents**

Any person involved in an **accident** that could result in:
- Disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal of protected marine organisms or habitats  
**must report the incident to the Canadian Coast Guard within two hours** of its occurrence.

> This rapid reporting mechanism enables prompt response and mitigation to prevent irreversible environmental harm.
