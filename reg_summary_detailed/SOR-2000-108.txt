The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **SOR/2013-88, section 24**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2013-88, section 24**, where "SOR" stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Province of Ontario*.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **June 2013**, as SOR/2013-88 was published in that year.
- **Nature of the Provision**: While the specific content of the repealed regulation is not included in your query, the repeated references suggest that the regulation previously governed a specific area—possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—before being removed from legal force.
- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed to:
  - Reflect changes in policy or law,
  - Avoid redundancy or inconsistency,
  - Improve clarity in the regulatory framework,
  - Be superseded by a more modern or comprehensive regulation,
  - Or due to a legislative review or amendment.

### Important Notes:
- Since the actual text of the regulation is not included in your input, a detailed summary of its **substance, scope, or application** cannot be provided.
- The repeated lines "[Repealed, SOR/2013-88, s. 24]" indicate that this is a **reference to a repealed section**, not a current active regulation.
- To understand what the original regulation governed, one would need to consult the **full text of the prior regulation** (which may have been part of a larger statute such as the *Ontario Environmental Protection Act* or another relevant statute) and cross-reference it with the official version of SOR/2013-88.

### Conclusion:
This entry is **not a current regulation** but a **notification of repeal**. It confirms that a specific regulatory provision was officially removed from the legal framework of Ontario on or around June 2013 through **Statutory Instrument 2013-88, section 24**. Without the original text of the provision, a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or impact cannot be offered.

👉 **Recommendation**: To obtain the original content and context of the repealed regulation, consult the official Ontario government database (e.g., *Ontario Laws* or *CanLII*) and search for **SOR/2013-88** or the specific section referenced in the repeal.
