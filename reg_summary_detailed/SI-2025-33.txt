### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers from the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada to the Minister of Industry**

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), as referenced in the *Royal Statute* (R.S., c. P-34).

**Key Provision:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) transfers **the powers, duties, and functions** of the **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada** specifically **in relation to the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA)** to the **Minister of Industry**.

### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Background Context:**
   - The President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada is a senior constitutional office, traditionally held by the Prime Minister, and serves as the head of the federal government’s executive branch.
   - Historically, the President of the Privy Council has had certain ceremonial and administrative responsibilities, including oversight of key federal agencies.
   - The Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDA) is a federal agency established to promote economic development in the Pacific region of Canada — particularly in British Columbia, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories.

2. **Nature of the Transfer:**
   - This is not a transfer of all powers of the President of the Privy Council, but **only those powers, duties, and functions related to PEDA**.
   - The transfer is **specific and targeted**, ensuring that the Minister of Industry assumes responsibility for PEDA’s operations, policy direction, and administrative oversight.

3. **Effective Change:**
   - The transfer takes effect immediately upon publication of the regulation.
   - It represents a **restructuring of government responsibilities** to improve coordination between the Department of Industry and regional economic development initiatives.

4. **Implications:**
   - The **Minister of Industry** now has direct authority over PEDA’s strategic planning, budgeting, program delivery, and reporting to Parliament.
   - This aligns PEDA more closely with the broader mandate of the Department of Industry, which includes promoting innovation, trade, and regional economic growth.
   - It may enhance accountability and responsiveness in regional economic development, particularly in remote and coastal areas of Canada.

5. **Legal Basis:**
   - The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* provides the legislative framework for transferring duties between federal departments and offices.
   - Paragraph 2(a)(a) of this Act allows for such transfers when they are in the public interest and necessary for administrative efficiency or policy coherence.

6. **Constitutional and Administrative Considerations:**
   - The transfer does not alter the constitutional role of the President of the Privy Council, who continues to serve in their official capacity.
   - It is a **functional transfer**, not a change in office or title.
   - The transfer is made under the authority of the Governor General in Council, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, reflecting the standard process for administrative realignments in Canada.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively **reassigns the operational and policy responsibilities of the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada related to the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada to the Minister of Industry**. This move strengthens the integration of regional economic development within the Department of Industry, promotes more focused governance of PEDA, and supports Canada’s economic development strategy in the Pacific region.

It is a practical example of how federal government structures can be reorganized to improve efficiency and responsiveness without altering constitutional roles or creating new offices.
