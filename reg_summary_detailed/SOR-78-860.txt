**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order (SOR/77-239)**

---

### **Overview**

On April 13, 1977, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, revoked the previous *Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1977-652, dated March 17, 1977), and replaced it with a new, updated Order. This new regulation is titled the **Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order**, and it came into force as **SOR/77-239**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, Volume 111, No. 7*.

The purpose of this Order is to **establish a modern, structured framework for regulating the marketing of vegetables produced in Ontario and intended for processing**, ensuring fair practices, equitable distribution of market benefits, and financial stability among producers.

### **Key Provisions and Definitions**

#### **1. Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario*, which provides the legal foundation for regulating agricultural marketing, including vegetables.
  
- **Board**: The *Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario*, a provincial body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of farm products.

- **Commodity Board**: The *Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing Board*, a specialized body created under the Act to manage the specific marketing of vegetables for processing.

- **Plan**: A formal marketing plan developed under the Act, which outlines how vegetables will be marketed, distributed, and priced. Any supporting regulations made to implement the Plan are also included.

- **Processing** (defined broadly): Includes:
  - Canning, dehydrating, drying, freezing, pickling, or treating vegetables with chemicals (e.g., sugar, sulfur dioxide, or heat).
  - Combining or mixing vegetables with other vegetables.
  - Entering into contracts to purchase vegetables for processing.

> *Note: The term "processing" is intentionally broad to cover both physical transformation and contractual arrangements involving future processing.*

- **Producer**: Any individual or entity engaged in the actual cultivation and production of vegetables in Ontario.

- **Vegetable**: Specifically includes the following crops grown in Ontario and used for processing:
  - Green and wax beans  
  - Lima beans  
  - Red beets  
  - Cabbage  
  - Carrots  
  - Cauliflower  
  - Sweet corn  
  - Cucumbers

### **Core Regulatory Authority**

#### **1. Jurisdiction Over Marketing**

The **Commodity Board** and the **Board** are each granted authority to regulate the marketing of vegetables in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside Canada)

This authority mirrors their existing powers to regulate local marketing within Ontario, meaning they can apply the same rules, standards, and oversight mechanisms to out-of-province and international markets.

#### **2. Powers to Regulate Marketing Activities**

With respect to persons and property located within Ontario, both the Commodity Board and the Board may exercise **all or any powers** that they have under the Act and the marketing Plan when managing local marketing activities. This includes:

- Setting prices
- Establishing marketing agreements
- Controlling supply and demand
- Enforcing quality standards
- Managing market access

This ensures consistency and continuity in policy across local and broader markets.

### **Levies and Charges – Key Financial Mechanism**

One of the most significant features of the Order is the power to impose **levies or charges** on those involved in the marketing of vegetables.

#### **Key Elements of Levies and Charges**:

- **Who is subject?** Persons engaged in marketing vegetables (e.g., processors, wholesalers, exporters, buyers).
- **Classification of Marketers**: The Board or Commodity Board may classify these persons into different groups (e.g., small vs. large processors, regional groups).
- **Variable Levies**: Different levies or charges can be set for different groups, depending on size, volume, or type of activity.
- **Purpose of Levies**:
  - Creation of **reserves** (funds set aside for future use)
  - Payment of **operating expenses** and **losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of vegetables
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of income among producers to ensure fairness in revenue distribution
    - For example, if some producers benefit from high sales prices, funds may be redistributed to those who suffered lower returns

> This mechanism helps stabilize the market and protects producers from price volatility or unfair competition.

---

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- The Order is enacted under **Section 2 of the Farm Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations for the marketing of agricultural products.
- The authority is derived from the **established structure of the Farm Products Marketing Board** and its subsidiary body, the **Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing Board**.
- The Order is designed to be **flexible and responsive**, allowing adjustments to market conditions through periodic review and revision of the marketing plan and levies.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of this Order are:

1. **Stability in the vegetable processing market** – To prevent price fluctuations and ensure consistent supply.
2. **Fairness to producers** – To ensure that all producers, regardless of scale, receive equitable benefits from market sales.
3. **Efficient use of market-generated revenues** – To channel profits into reserves and loss compensation, improving long-term sustainability.
4. **Support for processing industries** – To provide a stable, predictable environment for processors and exporters.
5. **Promotion of Ontario’s agricultural competitiveness** – By ensuring that processed vegetables meet quality and market access standards.

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Replaced outdated regulation**: The 1977 Order supersedes an older framework (P.C. 1977-652), which may have been outdated or insufficient in addressing modern market dynamics.
- **Modernized regulatory approach**: Introduces a more structured, equitable, and financially sustainable model for managing vegetable marketing.
- **Enhanced producer protection**: Through equalization and reserve funds, producers are shielded from market shocks.
- **Facilitates export growth**: By providing clear rules and financial tools, the Order supports Ontario’s participation in international vegetable markets.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Vegetable Growers’ Marketing-for-Processing Order* (SOR/77-239) is a comprehensive and forward-thinking regulatory instrument that strengthens the framework for managing the marketing of processed vegetables in Ontario. It provides clear definitions, broad regulatory powers, and a robust financial mechanism (levies and equalization) to ensure market stability, fairness, and long-term viability for vegetable producers and processors alike.

This Order remains a foundational piece of agricultural policy in Ontario, reflecting the government’s commitment to supporting farmers and ensuring sustainable growth in the processing sector.
