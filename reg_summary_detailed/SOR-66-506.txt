**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Claims (Bulgaria) Settlement Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Foreign Claims (Bulgaria) Settlement Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and the Minister of Finance. These regulations implement a bilateral agreement between Canada and the People’s Republic of Bulgaria to settle financial claims arising from Bulgarian nationalization, expropriation, or similar measures that occurred before June 30, 1966.

The regulations establish a structured and transparent process for compensating Canadian citizens, juridical persons (such as corporations), and the Government of Canada for losses incurred due to such government actions in Bulgaria. All payments are to be made from the **Foreign Claims Fund**, a special account in the Consolidated Revenue Fund established under the Appropriation Act No. 7, 1966 (Vote 22a).

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Settlement Amount and Obligation Fulfillment**
- The **Government of Bulgaria agrees to pay Canada $40,000** under Articles I and II of the Agreement.
- This payment constitutes **full satisfaction** of Bulgaria’s obligations to Canada and to Canadian claimants under the Agreement regarding claims arising from pre-June 30, 1966 nationalization or expropriation measures.

> ⚠️ Important Note: While the $40,000 is a fixed sum, it is not necessarily a per-claim amount. Instead, it represents the total amount Bulgaria commits to pay to Canada as a whole. The actual distribution of this amount among individual Canadian claimants is determined under the regulations.

#### **2. Eligibility for Payment to Canadian Claimants**
The Ministers may make payments from the Foreign Claims Fund to a Canadian claimant **only if**:
- The claimant **notified the Government of Canada of their claim before June 30, 1966**, and  
- The claimant **demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Ministers** that they are entitled to compensation under **Articles I and III** of the Agreement.

> This establishes a clear eligibility threshold: claims must have been formally reported to Canada prior to the agreement date and must meet the legal and factual criteria set out in the Agreement.

#### **3. Death of a Claimant After June 30, 1966**
If a Canadian claimant dies **on or after June 30, 1966**, the Ministers may:
- Pay the amount that would have been paid to the claimant **if they had survived**,  
- To the claimant’s **personal representative** (e.g., spouse, children, executor), or  
- To **any other person** the Ministers determine is entitled to the claimant’s assets.

> This provision ensures that claims do not lapse due to the death of the claimant after the agreement was signed, providing continuity of compensation.

#### **4. Final Payment and Satisfaction of Claims**
- Any payment designated by the Ministers as a **"final payment"** under Articles I and III of the Agreement is considered **full and final satisfaction** of all claims related to that individual claimant under those Articles.
- Once a final payment is made, no further claims or compensation can be sought under the Agreement for that claimant.

> This provision closes the door on future litigation or claims related to the same incident, promoting finality and legal certainty.

#### **5. Release of Claimant**
- Before making a final payment, the Ministers must obtain a **release** from the claimant (or their personal representative in the case of death).
- The release must be in a form that the Ministers consider **satisfactory**.
- This release serves as a legal acknowledgment that the claimant has received full compensation and waives further rights under the Agreement.

> This ensures that the government is not exposed to future legal challenges and provides a binding closure to the claim process.

#### **6. Role of the Adviser on Claims under the Agreement**
To assist in the administration of the regulations, the Ministers may appoint an **Adviser on Claims under the Agreement**, approved by the Treasury Board.

**Powers and Responsibilities of the Adviser:**
- Can be requested by the Ministers to:
  - Investigate the **validity of claims** by Canadian claimants;
  - Determine the **amount** to which a claimant is entitled under Articles I and II of the Agreement;
  - Recommend how the total funds should be **divided among Canadian claimants**;
  - Address **any other matter** arising from the administration of these regulations.

> ⚠️ **Important Limitation**: The Ministers are **not bound** by the findings or recommendations of the Adviser. The Adviser provides expert advice, but the final decisions rest with the Ministers.

#### **7. Remuneration and Funding of the Adviser**
The **Treasury Board** has the authority to:
- Set the **remuneration** (salary and fees) of the Adviser;
- Determine whether the Adviser’s **remuneration and expenses** will be:
  - Paid from the **Foreign Claims Fund**,
  - Paid from **funds provided by Parliament**, or
  - **Apportioned** between the two sources as the Treasury Board deems appropriate.

> This ensures fiscal accountability and flexibility in managing the costs of administering the claims process.

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

1. **Settlement of Historical Injustice**:  
   Addresses economic losses suffered by Canadians due to Bulgaria’s nationalization of property and assets before 1966 — a period when many Canadian-owned businesses or assets were seized without fair compensation.

2. **Legal Clarity and Finality**:  
   Provides a clear, structured, and legally binding process for claimants to receive compensation, ending open-ended litigation or disputes.

3. **Financial Responsibility and Accountability**:  
   Ensures that all payments are made from a dedicated fund (the Foreign Claims Fund), with oversight and transparency through the advisory mechanism.

4. **Bilateral Diplomatic Resolution**:  
   Reflects a cooperative approach between Canada and Bulgaria to resolve historical disputes without prolonged legal battles or political tensions.

5. **Protection of Canadian Interests**:  
   Establishes eligibility criteria (e.g., prior notification) to ensure that only legitimate, documented claims are processed, reducing fraud or abuse.

The *Foreign Claims (Bulgaria) Settlement Regulations* represent a well-structured, legally grounded, and administratively sound framework for resolving financial claims stemming from pre-1966 Bulgarian nationalization actions.

By establishing clear eligibility criteria, a formal process for claim review, and a mechanism for final settlement, the regulations ensure that:
- Canadian claimants receive fair compensation,
- The government operates within budgetary and legal constraints,
- The dispute is resolved in a timely and transparent manner,

These regulations remain a model for how Canada manages foreign claims under international agreements, particularly in cases involving historical economic disruptions.
