#### **C. Lease to a Peace Officer – Exceptional Provision**
A separate, distinct provision in the Order authorizes a **lease** of the same parcel to a specific individual, not an acquisition by the employee.

- **Recipient**: **Frank Albert Tsetso**, a **Peace Officer** (Royal Canadian Mounted Police – RCMP) from the Village of Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories.
- **Purpose of Lease**: To use the land as a **trapper’s cabin**.
- **Nature of the Agreement**: A lease is granted for the **whole of the parcel**.
- **Exclusions and Reservations**:
  - All **mines, minerals, and hydrocarbons** (including oil, gas, and solid minerals) are **excluded** from the lease.
  - The government **reserves the right to work** such resources, meaning the federal government retains ownership rights and the ability to explore, extract, or develop any minerals beneath or within the land.

### **4. Significance and Implications**

- **Government Employee Land Use**: This Order reflects a formal process to allow federal employees to secure land for personal or operational use, consistent with federal land policies and administrative procedures.
- **Public Service and Indigenous Context**: The inclusion of a Peace Officer from Fort Simpson (a community with significant Indigenous population) suggests a potential alignment with local needs, such as remote community services or enforcement operations.
- **Resource Rights Protection**: The reservation of mineral rights (including hydrocarbons) is critical — it ensures that the federal government maintains control over natural resources, which are often subject to national interest, economic development, and environmental considerations.
- **Legal Clarity**: By referencing a specific file and sketch plan, the Order provides a clear, documented basis for land boundaries and legal description, reducing ambiguity in land administration.

---

### **5. Scope and Limitations**
- The Order is **limited in scope** to the named employee and the specific parcel described.
- It does **not** authorize the employee to develop or exploit minerals — only to acquire a land interest.
- The lease to Frank Tsetso is **distinct** from the acquisition and is granted under different legal terms.
- The land is not sold or transferred permanently; the employee may acquire a right to use or hold the land, and the lease provides temporary use rights for a trapper’s cabin.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
The *Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1995, No. 3* is a targeted, legally grounded instrument that:
- Authorizes a federal government employee to acquire a land interest in the Northwest Territories,
- Provides a lease to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer for a trapper’s cabin,
- Explicitly reserves all mineral rights (including hydrocarbons) for the government.

This Order demonstrates the federal government’s balance between enabling operational needs (e.g., for peace officers in remote areas) and preserving sovereign control over natural resources, consistent with broader land and resource management policies in Canada’s territories.

**Note**: This Order is a non-territorial, administrative instrument and does not create new land ownership rights beyond those authorized under existing legislation. It must be interpreted in conjunction with the *Territorial Lands Act* and relevant land administration practices.
