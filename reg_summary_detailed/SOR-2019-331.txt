**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Critical Habitat of the Salamander Mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, enacted in Canada as **S.C. 2002, c. 29**. SARA is a federal law designed to prevent the extinction of wildlife species at risk and to promote their recovery through the identification and protection of critical habitat.

The **Salamander Mussel (*Simpsonaias ambigua*)** is a rare and endangered freshwater bivalve species native to Canada. It is officially listed as an **endangered species** in **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA, which means it is legally protected under the Act and requires specific conservation measures.

**2. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**

A formal **recovery strategy** for the Salamander Mussel was developed to guide conservation efforts. This strategy includes a detailed assessment of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.

- The recovery strategy has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a government database that makes information about at-risk species and their protections publicly accessible.
- This inclusion ensures transparency and accountability in the conservation process and allows stakeholders, scientists, and the public to access and review the data.

**3. Key Legal Provisions Invoked**

The regulation is issued pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*:

- **Section 58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate critical habitat for a listed species when the recovery strategy identifies such habitat.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requires that the designation be made only if the critical habitat is not located in a place that is subject to a prohibition under subsection 58(2)(b) of the Act.

> **Subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are subject to a **provincial or territorial regulation** that would restrict or prohibit development or use of the land (e.g., land use planning restrictions or protected areas under provincial law). 

The regulation explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat identified in this Order falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)**. This means the designated habitat is not located in a provincially or territorially protected area or under a land-use restriction that would prevent federal action.

**4. Purpose and Scope of the Order**

This **Critical Habitat of the Salamander Mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) Order**:

- Formally **designates specific geographic areas** as critical habitat for the Salamander Mussel.
- These areas are essential for the species’ **survival, reproduction, and recovery**.
- The designation is based on the scientific findings in the recovery strategy and is now legally binding under SARA.

By designating critical habitat, the federal government:

- **Provides legal protection** to these areas from activities that could harm or degrade the environment.
- **Requires that any proposed development or activity** in or near these areas must undergo a review to ensure it does not adversely affect the species.
- **Promotes conservation efforts** by ensuring that the necessary environmental conditions are preserved.

---

**5. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- Once registered, the designated critical habitat becomes a **legally protected area** under SARA.
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** has the authority to enforce the Order through regulatory measures, including issuing permits or directives to prevent harmful activities.

---

**6. Public Access and Transparency**

- The Order is published in the *Canada Gazette*, ensuring public access to the legal designation.
- The critical habitat is also publicly available through the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, promoting transparency and enabling public participation in conservation decisions.

---

**7. Significance of the Regulation**

This Order represents a key step in the recovery of the Salamander Mussel, which is one of Canada’s most threatened freshwater invertebrates. By formally protecting its critical habitat:

- It supports biodiversity conservation.
- It strengthens legal accountability in environmental decision-making.
- It ensures that future land-use planning, infrastructure development, or resource extraction projects consider the ecological needs of this endangered species.

---

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Salamander Mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua) Order* is a legally binding instrument issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under the *Species at Risk Act*. It designates specific areas as essential for the survival of the species, based on a scientifically sound recovery strategy. The Order is valid because it does not conflict with provincial land-use restrictions, and it comes into force upon registration. This step is vital for the long-term conservation and recovery of the Salamander Mussel, an endangered species of significant ecological value.
