**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 17)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Special Economic Measures (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Regulations* (S.C. 1992, c. 17) are a set of Canadian economic sanctions enacted under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**. These regulations were introduced in response to the Canadian Government’s assessment that the **Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)** — commonly known as North Korea — poses a **grave breach of international peace and security**, with a risk of triggering a serious international crisis.

The regulations impose a comprehensive suite of economic restrictions on trade, investment, financial services, technical data transfers, and transportation involving the DPRK. They are designed to pressure the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and to promote greater compliance with international norms and obligations.

These measures were made by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **subsections 4(1) to (3) of the Special Economic Measures Act**, which empower the government to impose sanctions on foreign states or entities deemed to threaten international peace and security.

     - Agencies and departments of the DPRK and its political subdivisions.

2. **Pension**

## **Legal Basis and Policy Rationale**

- **Legal Authority**:  
  Enacted under **Section 4(1)–(3) of the Special Economic Measures Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to impose sanctions when a foreign state is found to be:
  - Breaching international peace and security.
  - Engaging in activities that threaten global stability (e.g., nuclear weapons development, human rights violations).

- **Policy Objectives**:
  - Isolate the DPRK economically.
  - Prevent the flow of technology, capital, and goods that could support its weapons programs.
  - Encourage diplomatic engagement and compliance with international norms.
  - Protect Canadian interests and uphold international law.

- **Alignment with UN Resolutions**:  
  The regulations are consistent with and reinforce **United Nations Security Council Resolutions** targeting North Korea (e.g., on nuclear proliferation, ballistic missile programs). The exemptions for humanitarian and diplomatic activities reflect a balance between sanctions and international obligations.

## **Key Implications**

1. **Economic Isolation**: The DPRK is effectively cut off from Canadian markets, investment, and technology transfer.
2. **Deterrence**: The measures serve as a deterrent against further nuclear or missile development.
3. **Humanitarian Safeguards**: Critical exceptions ensure that life-saving aid can still reach vulnerable populations.
