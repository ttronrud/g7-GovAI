## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Title of the Regulation**
**Order Declaring that the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in Alberta, 2025**

---

### **Legal Basis**
The regulation is issued under **subsection 10(3)** of the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999** (S.C. 1999, c. 33), as amended by **S.C. 2023, c. 12**.

- **CEPA, 1999** is the primary federal environmental legislation in Canada, providing the framework for regulating toxic substances and protecting the environment and human health.
- **Subsection 10(3)** allows the Minister of the Environment to declare that certain federal regulations do **not apply** in a particular province **if equivalent or similar provincial regulations are already in force**.

---

### **Background and Context**

#### 1. **Proposal and Public Consultation (July 5, 2025)**
- On **July 5, 2025**, the Minister of the Environment published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* a **proposed Order** declaring that the federal **Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector)** do **not apply in Alberta**.
- This proposal was made under **subsection 332(1)a** of CEPA, which governs the process for declaring that federal regulations do not apply in provinces where equivalent measures exist.
- The public was given an opportunity to:
  - File **comments** on the proposed order, or
  - File a **notice of objection**, requesting that a **board of review** be established to assess the objection and determine whether the federal regulations should apply.

#### 2. **Agreement Between Federal and Provincial Governments (September 26, 2025)**
- On **September 26, 2025**, the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Government of Alberta** entered into a **written agreement** under **subsection 10(3)** of CEPA.
- The agreement confirms that:
  - **Alberta has in force by or under its own laws** provisions that are **equivalent** to the federal regulations under **subsection 93(1)d** of CEPA (which mandates reductions in methane and certain volatile organic compounds from upstream oil and gas operations).
  - Alberta also has **provisions similar to sections 17 to 20 of CEPA** that govern the **investigation of alleged environmental offences** under Alberta’s environmental legislation.

> This equivalence means that Alberta’s existing environmental laws provide **substantially the same environmental protection** as the federal regulations in question.

#### 3. **Public Notice of Agreement (July 5, 2025)**
- Under **subsection 10(4)** and **(5)** of CEPA, the Minister published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **July 5, 2025** the **availability of the agreement**.
- This allowed the public to:
  - Submit **comments** on the agreement, or
  - File a **notice of objection**, requesting a board of review to examine the agreement’s validity.

#### 4. **Public Summary of Comments (September 27, 2025)**
- On **September 27, 2025**, the Minister published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* a **report summarizing** how all comments and objections received were reviewed and addressed.
- This ensures **transparency and accountability** in the decision-making process.

### **Final Decision and the Order**

#### **Governor in Council Decision**
- Based on the agreement between the federal and provincial governments and the public consultation process, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, issued the **final Order** on **September 27, 2025** (implied by the date of publication).

#### **Key Provision of the Order**
> **"Except with respect to a federal work or undertaking, the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) do not apply in Alberta."**

- This means that **federal regulations** aimed at reducing methane and certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from upstream oil and gas operations **are not enforceable in Alberta**.
- The exception applies only to **federal works or undertakings** (e.g., federal infrastructure projects or operations), where federal jurisdiction remains.

#### **Termination Clause**
- The Order **ceases to have effect** on the day the **agreement between the federal and Alberta governments terminates** or is terminated under **subsection 10(8)** of CEPA.
- This ensures that the exemption is **temporary and conditional**, and reverts to federal application if the agreement ends.

#### **Repeal of the Order**
- The **Order Declaring that the Provisions of the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) Do Not Apply in Alberta** is **repealed** once the exemption is no longer in force.
- This ensures that the Order does not remain in legal effect beyond its intended duration.

#### **Coming into Force**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially recorded in the Canada Gazette), which typically occurs shortly after publication.

### **Legal and Environmental Significance**

| Aspect | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Provincial Regulatory Autonomy** | Alberta is allowed to manage methane and VOC emissions under its own environmental laws, reflecting the principle of **regulatory equivalence** and **federal-provincial cooperation**. |
| **Environmental Protection** | The agreement confirms that Alberta’s existing laws provide **adequate environmental protection** equivalent to federal standards, avoiding regulatory duplication. |
| **Federal-Provincial Cooperation** | Demonstrates a successful model of **collaborative environmental governance**, where both levels of government align on environmental outcomes. |
| **Transparency and Public Participation** | The process included public consultation, comment periods, and a report on objections — upholding democratic accountability. |
| **Flexibility and Adaptability** | The exemption is **not permanent** and ends when the agreement terminates, allowing for future review and potential reapplication of federal regulations if needed. |

### **Implications**

1. **For Alberta’s Oil and Gas Industry**:
   - Companies operating in Alberta are **not required to comply** with federal methane and VOC reduction standards.
   - Alberta’s own regulations (e.g., under the *Alberta Environmental Protection Act*) will govern emissions controls.

2. **For Federal Environmental Policy**:
   - The federal government maintains **flexibility** to apply its regulations only where necessary or where provincial laws are not equivalent.
   - It reinforces the **principle of regulatory equivalence** as a tool for efficient environmental governance.

3. **For Climate and Air Quality Goals**:
   - The outcome supports Alberta’s ability to **tailor environmental policies** to local conditions and economic realities.
   - However, critics may argue that **federal standards** are more rigorous or science-based, and that **regional exemptions could undermine national climate goals**.

4. **For Public and Stakeholder Confidence**:
   - The transparent process (public comment, review, reporting) builds trust in the decision-making process.
   - It provides clarity for businesses, environmental groups, and regulators.
