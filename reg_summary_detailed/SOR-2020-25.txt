### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **subsection 58(4) and (5)**, which empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and define the **critical habitat** of a wildlife species listed as endangered under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA.

Key background elements include:

1. **Species at Risk Status**:  
   The *Paxton Lake Benthic Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)* is officially listed as an **endangered species** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Species at Risk Act. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**:  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for this species has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**. This strategy identifies the specific areas (i.e., the critical habitat) essential for the survival and recovery of the species. The critical habitat is defined as the areas that are necessary for the species’ survival and recovery, including places where the species currently occurs and where it may need to occur in the future.

3. **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2)b)**:  
   The regulation explicitly states that **no portion** of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas where a **provincial or territorial government** has established a "provincial or territorial wildlife area" or a "protected area" under a land use or conservation regime that would otherwise restrict federal action. By confirming that the critical habitat is not in such a prohibited area, the regulation avoids legal conflict and ensures compliance with SARA’s procedural safeguards.

4. **Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards**:  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has determined that the proposed critical habitat designation affects an area where a **wildlife management board (WMB)** is authorized under a **land claims agreement** to carry out wildlife-related functions.  
   Under **subsection 58(8)** of SARA, the Minister is required to **consult** with such a board before making a critical habitat designation.  
   This consultation has been completed, and the WMB has been adequately informed and involved in the process, ensuring that Indigenous rights and traditional land management responsibilities are respected.

### **Purpose and Scope of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and define the critical habitat** of the *Paxton Lake Benthic Threespine Stickleback* as identified in its recovery strategy.

- The critical habitat is described in an annex to the Order, which outlines the precise geographic boundaries, ecological features, and environmental conditions necessary for the species’ survival.
- These areas are recognized as essential for the species’ ability to reproduce, feed, and maintain viable populations.
- The designation serves as a legal tool to ensure that:
  - Development, infrastructure projects, or other human activities are not carried out in these areas without proper assessment and mitigation.
  - Federal and provincial governments are required to consider the protection of this habitat in planning and decision-making processes.

---

### **Legal and Procedural Significance**

- **Subsection 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of this species, confirming that the designation is legally binding and enforceable.
- The Order is not merely descriptive—it creates a **legal boundary** that triggers regulatory obligations under SARA, including:
  - The requirement for federal projects to assess potential impacts on critical habitat.
  - The obligation to avoid or mitigate adverse effects on the species and its habitat.
- The Order is **final and enforceable** upon registration and publication in the *Canada Gazette*.

### **Key Outcomes and Implications**

1. **Conservation Protection**:  
   The formal designation provides a clear, legally recognized framework for protecting the Paxton Lake Benthic Threespine Stickleback from habitat degradation, pollution, or development.

2. **Inter-Governmental and Indigenous Engagement**:  
   The inclusion of consultation with a wildlife management board under a land claims agreement demonstrates a commitment to **Indigenous partnership**, respecting Indigenous governance and stewardship of traditional territories.

3. **Compliance with SARA Requirements**:  
   The Order fulfills all procedural requirements under SARA, including:
   - Designation based on a recovery strategy.
   - Avoidance of areas prohibited under subsection 58(2)b.
   - Consultation with relevant Indigenous wildlife management bodies.

4. **Foundation for Recovery Efforts**:  
   This critical habitat designation supports future recovery planning, including habitat restoration, monitoring, and research initiatives aimed at stabilizing and increasing the population of this endangered species.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding, science-based, and procedurally sound designation of the critical habitat for the *Paxton Lake Benthic Threespine Stickleback*. It reflects the Canadian government’s commitment to conserving endangered species under the Species at Risk Act, while respecting Indigenous rights and ensuring transparent, inclusive decision-making. By formally protecting the species’ essential habitat, the Order plays a vital role in the long-term recovery and survival of this unique and vulnerable fish species.
