**Detailed Summary of the *Chlorine Tank Car Unloading Facilities Regulations***

---

### **Overview**
The *Chlorine Tank Car Unloading Facilities Regulations* are a set of safety and operational standards established under the authority of the **Canadian Transport Commission (Commission)** to regulate the location, design, construction, and operation of chlorine tank car unloading facilities located on railway right-of-way. These regulations aim to ensure public safety, protect workers, and prevent environmental or fire hazards associated with the handling of chlorine—a highly hazardous chemical.

The regulations apply specifically to **chlorine in liquid or gaseous form**, with a maximum of **150 parts per million (ppm) of water**, and govern all aspects of unloading operations involving **approved chlorine tank cars**.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Chlorine** | The chemical element Cl₂ in liquid or gaseous form, containing not more than 150 ppm of water. |
| **Commission** | The Canadian Transport Commission, responsible for regulating dangerous commodities by rail. |
| **Dangerous Commodity** | Any substance subject to the *Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Commodities by Rail* or other Commission orders. |
| **Main Track** | A track used for scheduled train operations, controlled by timetable, signals, or train orders. |
| **Owning or Operating Company** | The entity responsible for owning or operating the chlorine unloading facility. |
| **Railway Right-of-Way** | Land owned or leased by a railway, contiguous to its tracks, under Commission jurisdiction. |
| **Railway Station** | A location where trains stop according to the timetable. |
| **Railway Station-Dwelling** | A station building partially used as residential housing. |
| **Serving Track** | The track on which chlorine tank cars are parked for unloading. |
| **Shall** | Indicates mandatory (required) provisions. |
| **Should** | Indicates recommendatory (advisory) provisions. |
| **Tank Car** | A rail tank car approved by the Commission for chlorine service; excludes multi-unit cars (e.g., ICC 106A500-X). |

## **Scope and Applicability**

- Applies to **chlorine tank car unloading facilities** located on railway right-of-way owned or leased by a railway company under Commission jurisdiction.
- **Excludes** chlorine **stationary bulk storage facilities**—their construction on railway right-of-way is **prohibited**.
- Facilities approved by the Commission **before July 31, 1965**, must comply with these regulations **except** for provisions related to **location, construction, and design**, which are not required to be followed unless otherwise ordered.

---

## **Location Approval Requirements**

1. **Pre-construction Approval Required**  
   - No new chlorine unloading facility or part thereof may be constructed without **Commission approval** of the proposed location via an order.
   - **Exception**: If the proposed facility fully complies with Parts II, III, IV, and V of the regulations, **approval is not required before construction**, but **must be obtained before the facility is used**.

2. **Application Submission**  
   - Applications must be submitted by the **railway company** to the **Secretary of the Commission**.
   - Must include **four copies of drawings** meeting specific requirements.

3. **Drawing Requirements**  
   - **Plan of Facility**: Minimum scale of **1 inch to 50 feet**; shows:
     - Location of unloading rack and tank car in unloading position.
     - Proximity to buildings, structures, boundaries, fire hydrants, rail lines, roads, and other key features.
   - **Plot Plan**: Minimum scale of **1 inch to 200 feet**; shows location in relation to off-site structures.
   - **Section Drawing**: Minimum scale of **1 inch to 20 feet**; shows elevation relative to other structures and tracks within 50 feet.
   - All drawings must be:
     - Dated
     - Identified with a unique number
     - Signed by the Chief Engineer or authorized official of the applicant or consulting firm.

4. **Mandatory Elements in Drawing Notes/Legend**  
   - Evidence that the **local fire authority** (provincial fire marshal, commissioner, or local fire department) has **no objection** to the facility.
   - Statement confirming compliance with all regulations, or listing exceptions.
   - Details on size, type, and purpose of all buildings, tanks, and structures on site.
   - Reference to railway company, subdivision, mileage, and nearest town/city.
   - Direction of prevailing winds.
   - Location of:
     - Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)
     - Emergency tank car repair kit
   - If no buildings exist within restricted distances, this must be explicitly stated.

5. **Retention of Drawings**  
   - A copy of each required drawing must be kept by the railway company **for the life of the facility** and **retained for at least two years after decommissioning**.

6. **Wind Considerations**  
   - Facilities should be located **downwind** of occupied buildings where practicable, to minimize exposure to chlorine vapors.

## **Minimum Horizontal Distances from Structures and Tracks**

| Distance Requirement | Details |
|---------------------|--------|
| **From other storage/transfer facilities** (combustible or dangerous commodities) | Minimum **75 feet** between center of unloading rack/tank car and nearest point of such facility. |
| **From occupied buildings** | - **≥2,000 feet** from schools, hospitals, hotels, churches, multi-storey office buildings, shopping centres, apartments, department stores, or similar high-occupancy buildings.<br>- **≥1,000 feet** from single-family dwellings, railway stations, one-storey offices, restaurants, or low-occupancy buildings.<br>- **≥500 feet** from factories, workshops, or maintenance buildings. |
| **From adjoining property** | Minimum **50 feet** from the boundary line of any adjacent property (whether currently built upon or planned). |
| **From serving track** | Distance between **gauge side of unloading rack** and nearest rail must meet requirements in **Schedule I**. |
| **From main tracks or main roads** | - **≥50 feet** from main tracks or curb lines of main roads.<br>- **≥20 feet** from passing tracks or non-main tracks. |

> **Exception**: The Commission may authorize **lesser distances** for structures **on the same site** and used **exclusively** by the facility owner/operator.

## **Piping System Requirements**

1. **Materials**  
   - Only **steel pipe, fittings, and valves** may be used.
   - Minimum **3/4 inch nominal diameter**.
