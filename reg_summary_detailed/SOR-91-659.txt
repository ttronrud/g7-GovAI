### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from legal force). This means it no longer exists in current Canadian law and is not enforceable.

**Repeal Instrument:**  
- **SOR/2007-86** is a Statutory Instrument (S.I.) issued in 2007 by the Government of Canada.  
- Section 204 of this instrument specifically contains the provision that repeals the prior regulation.  
- The repealing section is likely part of a broader legislative update, possibly to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated rules.

**Nature of the Repealed Regulation:**  
While the exact content of the original regulation is not provided in your query, the repeated references suggest that the regulation previously governed a specific area—possibly related to employment standards, workplace safety, licensing, or another sector—before being replaced or superseded.

**Legal Implications of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, duties, or definitions previously set out in the regulation are no longer applicable.  
- Any enforcement actions, compliance requirements, or administrative procedures based on the regulation are now invalid.  
- The repeal may have been enacted to align with new legislation, improve clarity, or reflect changes in policy or administrative practice.

**Contextual Note:**  
Statutory Instruments like SOR/2007-86 are used in Canada to implement or amend laws without requiring a full act of Parliament. The repeal of a regulation via such a mechanism is a common administrative tool for legislative modernization.

As such, it is **no longer in force** and does not apply to current legal or regulatory frameworks. There is no active content or enforceable provisions from this regulation at this time.
