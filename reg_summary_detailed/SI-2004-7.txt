**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, outlines a formal transfer of administrative control and supervision within the Canadian public service. Specifically, it details the relocation of certain responsibilities from the **Department of Transport** to the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)**.

### Key Elements of the Regulation:

1. **Issuing Authority**:
   - The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Prime Minister**.
   - This indicates that the decision is part of a government-wide administrative restructuring, approved at the highest level of federal governance.

2. **Legal Basis**:
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.
   - This provision allows the federal government to reorganize public service functions by transferring control of specific departments or units between agencies, provided such transfers are in the public interest and consistent with administrative efficiency and service delivery.

3. **Scope of the Transfer**:
   - The transfer involves the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the Department of Transport.
   - Specifically, it includes the portion of this secretariat responsible for:
     - **The Royal Canadian Mint**
     - **Canada Post Corporation**
   - These are two major Crown corporations in Canada, each with distinct roles in national economic and cultural infrastructure.

4. **Nature of the Transfer**:
   - The transfer covers **control and supervision** of the public service functions related to these two entities.
   - This means that the CCRA will now be responsible for:
     - Oversight of administrative operations
     - Policy implementation
     - Human resource management
     - Financial and operational governance
     - Reporting and compliance functions
   - Importantly, the transfer does not imply a change in the ownership or operational autonomy of the Crown corporations themselves—only a shift in the administrative oversight body.

5. **Effective Date**:
   - The transfer takes effect at **00:00:02, January 24, 2004**.
   - This precise timestamp reflects the formal implementation of the regulation, ensuring a clear and legally binding start date.

6. **Implications and Context**:
   - **Strategic Realignment**: The move reflects a broader government effort to streamline public service operations and align administrative oversight with the functional nature of the entities being managed.
   - **Royal Canadian Mint**: As a key institution responsible for national currency and heritage, its oversight by CCRA may enhance coordination with customs, financial regulation, and anti-counterfeiting efforts.
   - **Canada Post Corporation**: As a national postal service, its administrative oversight under CCRA may improve integration with revenue and customs functions, particularly in areas like mail security, international postal regulations, and revenue collection.
   - This reorganization may also support more efficient coordination between postal services and customs enforcement, especially in border control and the prevention of illicit activities.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. By transferring the control and supervision of the Crown Corporation Secretariat—specifically related to the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Post Corporation—from the Department of Transport to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the government aims to enhance operational efficiency, align oversight with functional responsibilities, and strengthen coordination between key national institutions involved in currency, postal services, and revenue enforcement.

The transfer is legally grounded, formally implemented, and designed to improve the governance and accountability of these vital Crown corporations within the broader framework of federal public service management.
