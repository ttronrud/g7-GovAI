The regulation you provided is **partially incomplete**, as it ends abruptly at the definition of "emergency brake" and does not include the full definition or the rest of the regulation. Additionally, several definitions have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or replaced), as indicated by the note "[Repealed, SOR/xxxx-xxx, s. 1]" at the end of many entries.

Below is a **detailed, accurate, and comprehensive summary** of the **remaining, non-repealed definitions** in the regulation, interpreted in context and organized for clarity. This summary reflects only the **active, current definitions** that are still in force and relevant to the regulation, as of the date of the repeal notices cited (with the most recent being SOR/2020-22).

## 🔍 Detailed Summary of Active Definitions in the Regulation

> **Note**: This summary is based on the *current active definitions* from the regulation, excluding all definitions marked "[Repealed]" — these have been removed from the current legal text. The regulation appears to be part of **Canada’s Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations** (specifically under the *Motor Vehicle Safety Act*), and the definitions are used to establish precise meanings for terms used in safety standards, testing, and compliance.

### 🚗 Core Definitions of Key Terms

| Term | Definition & Context |
|------|------------------------|
| **AATCC** | The American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists. Used in textile and material testing standards, particularly in relation to fabric resistance and durability in vehicle interiors. |
| **Act** | Refers to the *Motor Vehicle Safety Act* (Loi sur la sécurité des véhicules), which provides the legal framework for setting and enforcing safety standards for motor vehicles in Canada. |
| **Adjacent seat** | A seating position where at least 38.1 cm (15 inches) of its occupant space is within 25.4 cm (10 inches) of an emergency exit, measured horizontally. This ensures accessibility and egress safety during emergencies. |
| **Adjustment hardware** | Components that allow the user to adjust the size or fit of a seat belt (e.g., buckles, retractor mechanisms). Must be designed to accommodate different body sizes and ensure proper fit. |
| **All-terrain vehicle (ATV)** | A wheeled or tracked vehicle (not a snowmobile or work vehicle) designed primarily for recreational use or transporting equipment on undeveloped, unprepared surfaces (e.g., forests, fields). Excludes commercial or work-use vehicles. |
| **Ambient temperature** | The air temperature measured at a distance from the vehicle to avoid thermal influence from the engine or interior. Used in testing for thermal performance and safety. |
| **American compliance label** | A label applied by a manufacturer to certify that a vehicle complies with U.S. federal safety standards at the time of manufacture. Used in international trade and compliance assessments. |
| **ANSI** | The American National Standards Institute. Standards developed under ANSI are referenced for safety, performance, and design benchmarks. |
| **ANSI Z26 Safety Standard — 1996** | The current standard for safety glazing materials in motor vehicles. Specifies requirements for windshield strength, impact resistance, and safety performance. Replaces older 1990 version. |
| **Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD)** | A human-shaped device (e.g., crash dummies) used in crash testing to simulate human responses to vehicle impacts. Used to evaluate safety performance under controlled test conditions. |
| **Antilock Brake System (ABS)** | A brake system that detects wheel slip during braking and automatically modulates brake pressure to prevent skidding. Improves control during emergency stops. |
| **Antique reproduction vehicle** | A scaled reproduction of an antique vehicle with a motor producing ≤8 kW (10.73 bhp). Must be used only in parades, exhibitions, or demonstrations and must carry a conspicuous label stating it is not for public transport. |
| **Antique vehicle** | A vehicle over 30 years old that retains original design features or uses original components. Restoration must preserve historical integrity. |
| **Approved** | A term meaning "approved by the Minister of Transport" — used to indicate that a component, design, or system meets regulatory safety standards. |
| **ASTM** | The American Society for Testing and Materials. Standards referenced for material testing (e.g., strength, durability, flammability). |
| **Attachment hardware** | Hardware that secures the seat belt webbing to the vehicle structure. Must be durable and properly integrated. |
| **Automatic-locking retractor** | A retractor with a self-locking mechanism that maintains seat belt tension and resists forces during impact. Prevents belt slippage during sudden deceleration. |
| **Automatic occupant protection system** | A system that activates automatically when an occupant enters or exits the vehicle (e.g., seat belt, airbag). Requires no deliberate action from the occupant. |
| **Auto transporter** | A truck-trailer combination designed to transport other vehicles. The truck carries cargo only via the trailer, not at the fifth wheel. |
| **Back door** | A door on the rear of a vehicle used for passenger entry/exit or cargo loading. Excludes trunk lids and glazing-only doors with direct glazing latches. |
| **Backup system** | A secondary brake power source (e.g., a pump) that activates automatically if the primary brake system fails. Ensures vehicle can still be stopped safely. |
| **Battery charging indicator** | A device that shows whether the vehicle battery is being charged or discharged (e.g., a light or display). |
| **Battery charging tell-tale** | A warning signal (e.g., a light) that indicates the battery is *not* being charged — used to alert drivers to potential failure. |
| **Body type** | The general shape and configuration of a vehicle (e.g., sedan, hatchback, SUV) defined by number of doors, roofline, cargo features, or other design elements. |
| **Brake power assist unit** | A device in a hydraulic brake system that reduces the driver’s muscular effort required to stop the vehicle. Must allow full braking capability even if the assist fails. |
| **Brake power unit** | A device that provides the energy to actuate brakes, either directly or via auxiliary systems. The driver only modulates the force level. |
| **Braking interval** | The distance between the start of one brake application and the start of the next. Used in evaluating braking performance and response. |
| **Buckle** | A quick-release connector that secures a person in a seat belt or built-in restraint system. Must be easy to use and reliable. |
| **Built-in booster seat** | An integral part of a vehicle seat designed to support a person with a mass of at least 18 kg. Ensures proper fit and safety for children or adults with limited mobility. |
| **Built-in restraint system** | An integral part of a vehicle seat designed to restrain only persons with a mass between 10 kg and 41 kg. Used for children or small adults. |
