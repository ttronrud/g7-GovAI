**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Fixing the Day for the Purposes of Section 144 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 1

**Legal Authority:**  
The Order is made under **Section 144 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11** (as referenced in the text), and is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Labour**.

This means that the Governor General, acting on behalf of the Crown, formally enacts the Order based on a recommendation from the Minister of Labour, which is authorized by the specific provisions of the Act.

**Key Provision:**  
The Order **designates June 1, 2019**, as the specific day for the purposes of **Section 144** of the *Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11*.

Section 144 of the Act is likely intended to establish a deadline or trigger point for certain economic or administrative actions—such as the implementation of measures related to employment, economic stimulus, or financial policy—thereby providing a clear and fixed date for compliance, reporting, or operational changes.

---

**Effective Date of the Order:**  
The Order comes into force on **the first day on which Sections 111, 139, and 140 of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act, No. 11 are all in force**.  

- This ensures that the Order only takes effect when the necessary enabling provisions of the Act are fully operational.  
- It provides a safeguard to prevent premature application of the Order before the required legislative conditions are met.

**Alternative Effective Date:**  
If the Order is **registered (officially published or adopted) after** the day when Sections 111, 139, and 140 are all in force, then it will instead come into force on **the day of its registration**.

This provision ensures that the Order is not retroactively applied and that its implementation is tied to the official legal timeline of the Act.

---

**Note on Enforcement and Status:**  
- The Order is **in force as of February 11, 2015**, as noted in the reference to **SI/2015-5 and SI/2015-6** (Statutory Instruments of 2015).  
- This indicates that although the Order was made in 2014 (S.C. 2014, c. 20), it was formally registered and came into effect in 2015, likely due to procedural or legislative timing requirements.

**Purpose and Context:**  
The *Economic Action Plan 2014 Act* was designed to implement economic policies aimed at stimulating growth, managing fiscal responsibility, and supporting employment. Section 144 likely governs a specific action or deadline tied to the economic plan, such as the launch of a program, a reporting requirement, or a policy transition.

By fixing June 1, 2019, as the designated day, the Order provides a **clear, unambiguous deadline** for stakeholders (e.g., government departments, businesses, or regulatory bodies) to comply with the requirements under Section 144. This enhances accountability and ensures timely implementation of economic policy.

**Summary in Plain Language:**  
This government order sets **June 1, 2019**, as the official date for a key provision (Section 144) of the Economic Action Plan 2014 Act. The order only becomes active when three specific sections of the Act are in force. If it is registered after that point, it takes effect on the day it is officially published. The order was formally in effect from **February 11, 2015**, due to registration and legal procedures.
