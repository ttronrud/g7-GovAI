**Detailed Summary of the Marine Safety Management System Regulations (S.C. 2023, c. 26, s. 360)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Marine Safety Management System Regulations* are a comprehensive regulatory framework established under the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, to ensure the safe and environmentally responsible operation of Canadian and foreign vessels operating in Canadian waters. These regulations implement the **International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code)**, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and adapt its requirements to the Canadian context.

The regulations apply to a tiered classification system of vessels—**Class 1 through Class 5**—based on size, function, and operational risk. Each class has specific requirements for the development, implementation, and maintenance of a **documented Safety Management System (SMS)**, which governs both shore-based and on-board operations.

---

## **1. Legislative Basis**

These regulations are made under several provisions of the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*, including:
- Paragraphs 35(1)(b), (d)a, (e)b
- 35.1(1)(d) to (i)c and (k)c
- 120(1)(d) to (g)d, (i), (k), and (m)
- 150(1)(a)
- 190(1)(b)
- 244(f)e to (h)f

These provisions authorize the Minister of Transport to establish safety management requirements for vessels, particularly those subject to international safety standards like the ISM Code and SOLAS (International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea).
