Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

---

### **Regulatory Summary: Revocation and De-Amalgamation of Government Departments under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(b)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.  
This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to **revoke or reverse** prior departmental amalgamations or reorganizations, and to **de-amalgamate** departments that were previously merged.

Additionally, the regulation invokes **paragraph 2(a)** of the same Act to **transfer specific powers, duties, and functions** from the Secretary of State of Canada to other ministers.

---

#### **2. Key Action: De-Amalgamation**
The regulation **revokes paragraph (b)** of **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489**, dated June 25, 1993.  
This Order had previously **amalgamated three departments** into a single entity:

- The **Department of the Secretary of State of Canada**  
- The **Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship**  
- The **Department of Communications**

By revoking this paragraph, the government formally **undoes the amalgamation** and **restores the three departments as separate entities**.  
This is referred to as a **"de-amalgamation"**, meaning the departments are once again administratively and structurally independent.

> **Purpose**: This action likely reflects a shift in government priorities, administrative efficiency, or policy focus—such as a desire to strengthen the independence of departments dealing with communications or multiculturalism, or to improve accountability and decision-making.

#### **3. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions (under paragraph 2(a))**
Under paragraph 2(a) of the Act, specific powers, duties, and functions are transferred from the **Secretary of State of Canada** to two other ministers:

##### a. **Transfer to the Minister of Communications**
Powers, duties, and functions previously held by the Secretary of State of Canada are transferred to the **Minister of Communications** under:
- **Clause (a)(ii)(A)**  
- **Clause (a)(ii)(C)** of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489

> These clauses likely relate to functions such as:
> - Regulation and oversight of telecommunications and broadcasting
> - Policy development and implementation related to communications infrastructure
> - Management of federal communications policy or services

This transfer ensures that communications-related responsibilities are now under the direct authority of the Minister of Communications, enhancing coordination and policy focus in that area.

##### b. **Transfer to the Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship**
Powers, duties, and functions are transferred to the **Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship** under:
- **Clause (a)(ii)(B)** of Order in Council P.C. 1993-1489

> This clause likely covers:
> - Promoting multiculturalism and citizenship education
> - Supporting language and cultural diversity policies
> - Managing programs related to immigrant integration, cultural rights, and community engagement

This reallocation strengthens the minister’s role in advancing multicultural policy and integration initiatives.

#### **4. Significance and Implications**
- **Administrative Reorganization**: The move reflects a strategic reconfiguration of federal government structure to improve governance and policy effectiveness.
- **Clearer Accountability**: By separating responsibilities, each minister now has clearer jurisdiction over their portfolio, which may improve performance and accountability.
- **Policy Continuity**: While departments are de-amalgamated, the core functions and responsibilities are preserved and reassigned—ensuring no loss of policy or service delivery.
- **Historical Context**: The 1993 Order in Council (P.C. 1993-1489) was part of a broader government restructuring effort during that period. This reversal may indicate a shift in political or administrative priorities.

---

#### **5. Official Publication**
The regulation is published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II**, on **March 3235, 1993** (note: likely a typographical error—should be page 3235, not "p. 3235" in a non-standard format).  
This publication ensures transparency and legal validity of the order.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a **reversal of a 1993 departmental merger** under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. It:
- **De-amalgamates** three departments: the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada, the Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship, and the Department of Communications.
- **Transfers specific functions** from the Secretary of State to:
  - The **Minister of Communications** (for clauses (a)(ii)(A) and (C))
  - The **Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship** (for clause (a)(ii)(B))

This reorganization enhances ministerial responsibility, aligns departmental mandates with current policy goals, and ensures that key functions are managed by the most appropriate ministerial office.

> **Note**: The regulation is dated 1993 and may be part of a broader historical restructuring of Canadian federal ministries. It does not reflect current departmental structures, which may have evolved further since then.
