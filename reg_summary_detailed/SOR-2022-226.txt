## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Haiti) Regulations**

### 📌 **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

The *Special Economic Measures (Haiti) Regulations* are a set of Canadian economic sanctions enacted under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**. These measures were introduced by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, in response to the **grave breach of international peace and security** in the **Republic of Haiti**.

The primary justification is that the situation in Haiti—characterized by political instability, violence, and systematic human rights abuses—has resulted in or is likely to result in a **serious international crisis**. As such, Canada has taken targeted economic actions to:

- Isolate individuals and entities involved in undermining Haiti’s peace, security, and stability;
- Hold accountable those responsible for gross and systematic human rights violations;
- Prevent financial support or facilitation of activities that threaten Haiti’s stability.
