**Detailed Summary of the CCOFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *CCOFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This legislative action falls under the framework of the **Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CCOFTA)**, which aims to promote trade by establishing rules that determine the origin of goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment.

These regulations are formally enacted under **Statutes of Canada, 2011, Chapter 4 (S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1))**, and are referenced in the broader context of **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which likely provides the foundational statutory authority for implementing trade agreements.

### **Definition of Key Term: "Casual Goods"**

- **Casual goods** are defined as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or similar purpose**.
- This category contrasts with **commercial or industrial goods**, which are imported with a clear commercial or functional intent (e.g., for resale, manufacturing, or use in business operations).
- The term "casual" implies that the goods are typically **personal, incidental, or non-commercial in nature** — such as goods brought into Canada for personal use, private consumption, or as gifts.

### **Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Colombia**

For casual goods acquired in **Colombia**, the following conditions determine whether they are considered to **originate in Colombia** and thus qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CCOFTA):

#### **Condition 1: Marking Compliance**
- The goods must bear a **marking in accordance with Colombia’s marking laws**.
- The marking must **clearly indicate** that the goods are the product of **either Colombia or Canada**.
- This marking requirement ensures transparency and traceability of origin, helping to prevent fraud or misrepresentation.

#### **Condition 2: Absence of Marking or Non-Indication**
- If the goods **do not bear any mark**, or if the marking **does not indicate** that the goods are the product of Colombia or Canada, they are **still considered to originate in Colombia** — **provided** that there is **no indication** that the goods are not of Colombian origin.
- This provision is significant because it creates a **presumption of origin** in Colombia for goods that lack visible marking, as long as there is no evidence suggesting otherwise.

> In essence, the rules establish a **"presumption of origin"** in Colombia for casual goods that are unmarked or lack clear indications of non-Colombian origin.

### **Effective Date of the Regulations**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 30 of the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 4 of the Statutes of Canada, 2010) comes into force.
- However, if the regulations are **registered (i.e., officially published and recognized) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the rules are implemented in alignment with the broader timeline of the CCOFTA Implementation Act, while allowing for flexibility in administrative processes.

### **Note on Enforcement and Applicability**

- These regulations were **in force as of August 15, 2011**, as noted in **SI/2011-55** (Supplementary Information, 2011, No. 55), indicating that they were formally published and adopted by that date.
- The rules apply specifically to **casual goods** imported into Canada from Colombia and are part of the **origin determination framework** under CCOFTA.
- They are designed to **simplify origin determination** for goods that are not part of commercial transactions, thereby reducing administrative burdens while ensuring compliance with trade agreement obligations.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Promotes fair trade**: By establishing clear rules for origin, the regulations ensure that goods from Colombia receive preferential treatment only when legitimately originating from Colombia.
- **Supports informal or personal trade**: The rules accommodate personal or incidental imports (e.g., family members bringing goods into Canada), which are not subject to the same commercial origin rules.
- **Reduces compliance complexity**: By providing clear, accessible criteria (especially the presumption of origin for unmarked goods), the rules help importers and customs officials determine eligibility for tariff benefits efficiently.

### **Conclusion**

The *CCOFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a **clear, accessible, and practical framework** for determining the origin of personal or non-commercial goods imported from Colombia into Canada. By focusing on **marking compliance** and establishing a **presumption of origin** for unmarked goods, the regulations balance trade facilitation with the need to maintain the integrity of the free trade agreement. These rules are essential for ensuring that the benefits of the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement are fairly and consistently applied to casual imports.
