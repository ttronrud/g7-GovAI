### **Detailed Summary of the Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987 (C.R.C., c. 381)**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose of the Regulation**

The **Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987** were introduced by the **Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** on **January 9, 1987**, replacing and repealing the previous version of the *Television Broadcasting Regulations* (C.R.C., c. 381), which had been in effect since 1968.

This action followed a **public consultation process**:
- A proposed version of the regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **August 9, 1986**.
- This provided a reasonable opportunity for **licensees, broadcasters, industry stakeholders, and the public** to submit written representations and comments.
- Based on these inputs and recommendations from the **Executive Committee**, the CRTC formally revoked outdated sections and adopted a revised regulatory framework to modernize television broadcasting standards in Canada.

The new regulations were implemented in **two phases**:
- **Sections 5 to 7 and 9 to 24, and Schedules I and II** were **revoked effective January 9, 1987**.
- **Sections 1 to 4 and 8** were **revoked effective October 1, 1987**.
- The **annexed regulations (the 1987 version)** became effective **January 9, 1987**.

These regulations reflect a shift toward **greater accountability, diversity, and public interest** in Canadian television content, particularly in relation to **Canadian programming, ethnic programming, advertising standards, and transparency in programming records**.
