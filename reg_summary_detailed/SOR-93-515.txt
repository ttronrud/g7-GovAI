> [Repealed, SOR/2006-236, s. 18]

### Detailed Summary:

This entry indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 18 of the Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/2006-236)**.

- **SOR/2006-236** refers to the *Statutory Rules of Ontario, 2006, No. 236*, which is a publication containing various amendments, repeals, or new rules issued by the provincial government.
- **Section 18** of this regulation (SOR/2006-236) is the specific provision that was repealed.
- The repeated occurrence of the same phrase suggests that the repeal applies to one or more sections or provisions, possibly due to a formatting or indexing error in the original document.

### Key Points:
- The regulation or section in question is **no longer in force** as of the date specified in SOR/2006-236.
- The repeal means that any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by that section are **no longer applicable**.
- The repeal likely occurred to correct an outdated provision, align with updated policy, or eliminate redundancy or inconsistency.
- Because the original content of the section is not included in the provided text, the summary is limited to the **status** of the regulation (i.e., it has been repealed), not its substance.

### Conclusion:
This entry serves as a **legal notice of repeal** — it confirms that a specific section of a regulation (section 18 of SOR/2006-236) has been formally removed from the legal framework. As such, it is not a summary of the regulation’s content, but rather a record of its **termination**. To understand the original content of the repealed section, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2006-236 prior to its repeal.

> ⚠️ Note: Since the original regulation or section has been repealed, it is no longer enforceable or relevant under current Ontario law. Any reference to it in legal or administrative contexts must be treated as obsolete.
