### **Regulatory Authority**

#### **1. General Regulatory Powers**
Both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are authorized to regulate the **marketing of fresh potatoes** in:
- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces),
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada).

For this purpose, they may exercise **all or any powers** that they currently have under the Act and the *Plan* when it comes to regulating fresh potato marketing **within Ontario**. This means their powers are extended beyond provincial borders to ensure consistent standards, pricing, and market stability.

> This includes powers such as setting prices, establishing quality standards, regulating supply, and managing market access.

#### **2. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board has **additional, targeted powers** specifically related to the financial and economic management of fresh potato marketing in interprovincial and export trade:

##### **(a) Fixing and Collecting Levies or Charges**
- The Commodity Board may:
  - **Issue orders** to **fix and impose levies or charges** on individuals or businesses engaged in:
    - The **production** of fresh potatoes,
    - The **marketing** (sale, distribution) of fresh potatoes.
  - **Classify** these producers into different groups (e.g., small farms, large growers, processors, exporters).
  - Set **different levies or charges** for each group based on size, volume, or type of operation.

> Example: A small farm might pay a lower levy than a large cooperative or exporter.

##### **(b) Use of Collected Levies**
Funds collected through these levies may be used for:
- **Creating reserves** (to cushion against market downturns),
- **Covering operational expenses** (e.g., marketing, logistics, inspections),
- **Recovering losses** incurred from the sale or disposal of potatoes (e.g., due to poor market conditions or spoilage),
- **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among producers.

> This ensures that producers who benefit from higher sales prices (e.g., during good market years) can contribute to a pool that supports those who suffer losses during downturns.

This mechanism helps **stabilize income** for producers and promotes **fairness and equity** across the industry.
