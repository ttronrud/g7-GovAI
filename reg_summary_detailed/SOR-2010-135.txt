**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–5**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry.
- **Legal Authority**: The Order is made under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act** (R.S.C., c. R-2), which allows for temporary exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.
- **Reference to Statutes**: The Order is grounded in the *Radiocommunication Act* (S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 34; R.S., c. R-2; S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2).

### **2. Purpose of the Exemption**
The Order provides a **temporary exemption** from two key provisions of the Radiocommunication Act:
- **Subsection 4(1)**: Prohibits the installation, operation, or possession of radio apparatus intended to interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications.
- **Paragraph 9(1)(b)**: Prohibits interference with or obstruction of radiocommunications.

**Exemption Purpose**: To allow the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** — acting on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada — to conduct **authorized interference or obstruction of radiocommunications** for the purposes of:
- **Security**
- **Safety**
- **International relations**

This is a **limited, time-bound, and geographically restricted** exemption.

---

### **3. Scope and Duration**
- **Effective Period**: From **June 23, 2010, to June 25, 2010** (a period of 2 days).
- **Geographic Limitation**: The exemption applies only within a defined quadrilateral area in **Ontario and Quebec**, bounded by the following geographic coordinates:
  1. **45° 36′ N, 76° 00′ W**
  2. **45° 30′ N, 75° 36′ W**
  3. **45° 17′ N, 75° 42′ W**
  4. **45° 22′ N, 75° 32′ W**

> This area is located in central Ontario and southern Quebec, near the border region, and appears to be centered around the area of **Kamloops or the Ottawa–Gatineau corridor**, though precise identification depends on mapping. It is a narrow zone intended to limit the impact of interference to a specific operational need.

---

### **4. Conditions for Exemption Application**
The exemption applies **only if**:
- The radio apparatus used is installed, operated, or possessed **specifically to interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication** in accordance with **subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The interference or obstruction is **for one of the following purposes**:
  - **Security**
  - **Safety**
  - **International relations**

This ensures that the exemption is not used for general or unrelated interference, and that any action is justified by a legitimate public interest.

---

### **5. Proportionality and Minimization Requirements**
To ensure responsible use and minimize unintended consequences, the Order mandates that:
- Every **reasonable effort** must be made to:
  - **Confinement to the smallest physical area** possible
  - **Limit to the fewest number of frequencies**
  - **Restrict to the minimum duration** required to achieve the intended objective

This reflects a principle of **proportionality** and **necessity**, ensuring that interference is not excessive or broadly applied beyond what is strictly required.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Accountability**
- The exemption is **not a blanket permission** to interfere with communications.
- The RCMP is responsible for **ensuring compliance** with the conditions of the Order.
- Any use of the exemption must be **justified, documented, and limited** to the stated objectives.

---

### **7. Coming into Force**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Statutes of Canada (i.e., upon official publication and legal registration), which typically occurs shortly after approval.

### **Significance and Context**
This Order is a **temporary, targeted, and narrowly defined** use of emergency authority under Canadian telecommunications law. It reflects the government’s ability to respond to urgent national security or safety concerns by temporarily overriding normal regulatory restrictions on radio interference — a power that must be exercised with strict oversight and accountability.

Such exemptions are rare and typically invoked only in exceptional circumstances involving threats to public safety, national security, or critical international operations (e.g., counter-terrorism, border security, or crisis management).

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2010–5* is a **short-term, geographically limited, and purpose-specific exemption** allowing the RCMP to interfere with radio communications in a defined area for national security, safety, or international relations purposes. It emphasizes **proportionality, necessity, and minimal impact**, ensuring that the power to disrupt communications is used only when absolutely required and under strict legal and operational controls.
