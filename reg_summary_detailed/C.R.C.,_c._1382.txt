The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated references to the same repeal notice:

> **[Repealed, SOR/2016-319, s. 1]**

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules Order 2016-319** (SOR/2016-319), which was published by the Government of Canada.

- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Rules Order 2016-319* (SOR/2016-319)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of that Order
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect upon the coming into force of SOR/2016-319, which was published in the Canada Gazette on or around April 15, 2016 (the exact date depends on publication schedule).

### What This Means in Practice:

- The specific regulation referenced (which is not fully provided in your input) is **no longer in force**.
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in that regulation are **no longer applicable**.
- Legal or regulatory bodies, government departments, or private entities must now refer to **current, active regulations** instead of the repealed one.
- The repeal does not imply that the subject matter was unimportant — rather, it reflects a change in legal or administrative priorities.

### Important Notes:

- Since the actual text of the regulation being repealed is not included in your query, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice.
- To fully understand the scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original regulation (which may be archived in the *Canada Gazette*, the *Regulations and Orders database*, or through the *Canada Gazette, Part I* or *Federal Regulations* portal).
