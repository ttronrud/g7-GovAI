### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific provision (or section) of a prior regulation has been **repealed** (officially cancelled or removed) by **Statutory Instrument SI/2013-126**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

#### Key Points:

1. **Repeal Status**:  
   The referenced regulation or section is no longer in force. It has been formally abolished by legislation enacted through SI/2013-126.

2. **Statutory Instrument (SI) SI/2013-126**:  
   This is a secondary piece of legislation introduced in 2013. While the full content of SI/2013-126 is not provided, such instruments typically amend or repeal existing laws to modernize, simplify, or align regulations with current policy or legal standards.

3. **Section 5 of SI/2013-126**:  
   This section specifically contains the provisions that result in the repeal of the referenced rule or section. The repeated mention of “s. 5” suggests that multiple provisions were repealed under this section, or that the same repeal applies to several parts of a regulation.

4. **Implication**:  
   Any legal obligation, rule, or requirement previously established under the repealed section is now invalid. Legal or administrative bodies must refer to the current, updated version of the regulation (if any) or to the new law that replaced it.

5. **No Content Provided**:  
   Since no actual text of the original regulation or the details of what was repealed are included in the input, a detailed summary of the *substance* of the repealed rule (e.g., what it regulated, who it applied to, or its impact) cannot be provided.
