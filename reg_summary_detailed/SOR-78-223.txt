**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Title:**  
By-law of the Canadian Human Rights Commission Limiting the Filing of Complaints Under Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act

**Date of Enactment:**  
March 1, 1978 (approved by the Commission)  
March 2, 1978 (approved by the Governor in Council)

**Legal Authority:**  
The by-law was enacted under **Section 64 of the Canadian Human Rights Act**, which empowers the Minister of Justice to make by-laws to regulate the operation of the Commission, including the timing and procedures for handling complaints.

**Purpose of the By-law:**  
To impose a **time limit on the filing of complaints** related to wage discrimination between male and female employees, as prohibited under **Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act**. Specifically, the by-law establishes that **no complaints concerning wage disparities between men and women will be accepted or considered by the Canadian Human Rights Commission after June 1, 1978**.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Scope of the Limitation:**  
   The restriction applies only to complaints that allege the **establishment or maintenance of differences in wages between male and female employees**, which is explicitly prohibited under Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.

2. **Effective Date of the Limitation:**  
   Complaints under this provision **will not be considered by the Commission after June 1, 1978**. This means that:
   - Any complaint filed **on or after June 1, 1978**, will be **rejected or not accepted**.
   - Complaints filed **before June 1, 1978** may still be processed, provided they meet all other requirements.

3. **Exclusion of Other Complaints:**  
   The by-law does **not affect** complaints related to other forms of discrimination (e.g., race, religion, disability, etc.), nor does it apply to complaints about other types of wage disparities (e.g., based on age, tenure, or job role), only those specifically concerning gender-based wage differences.

4. **Policy Rationale (Implied):**  
   The timing of this by-law—set for June 1, 1978—suggests a strategic policy decision, likely tied to:
   - A desire to **focus the Commission’s resources** on more urgent or pressing forms of discrimination.
   - A **transition period** to allow for the development of new policies or enforcement mechanisms in response to gender wage disparities.
   - Possible alignment with broader national efforts to address gender equity in employment, such as the implementation of the **Equal Pay Act** or other legislative or policy initiatives in the early 1970s.

5. **Administrative Process:**  
   The by-law was:
   - Drafted and approved by the **Canadian Human Rights Commission** on March 1, 1978.
   - Then formally adopted and enacted by the **Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal government on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice) on March 2, 1978.

**Significance and Historical Context:**

- This by-law reflects a **temporary and targeted regulatory measure** in the early stages of Canada’s human rights enforcement framework.
- It is notable because it **deliberately excludes gender wage discrimination from the Commission’s immediate enforcement capacity**, which may have been due to:
  - Limited legal or administrative capacity at the time.
  - A belief that wage equality issues were better addressed through legislative or economic policy rather than direct human rights enforcement.
  - A desire to avoid overburdening the Commission with a high volume of complaints in a specific area.

**Criticism and Implications:**

- The by-law has been widely interpreted as **a setback for gender equality**, as it effectively **prevents individuals from seeking redress for wage discrimination** after a specific date.
- Critics argue that such a restriction **undermines the principle of equal protection under the law** and may perpetuate gender-based wage gaps by removing a key enforcement mechanism.
- It also raises questions about the **consistency and fairness** of the Canadian Human Rights Act in addressing systemic issues like gender-based pay disparities.

**Conclusion:**  
This by-law represents a **temporary and narrowly focused administrative decision** to limit the Commission’s ability to process complaints about gender-based wage disparities after June 1, 1978. While it was enacted under legal authority and within the framework of the Canadian Human Rights Act, it has been criticized for potentially weakening protections for women in the workplace. It is important to note that this by-law is **no longer in effect**, as it was a short-term policy measure from the 1970s, and subsequent legislation and court decisions have reinforced the importance of addressing gender-based wage discrimination as a fundamental human rights issue.

**Note:** This by-law is historical and does not reflect current Canadian human rights enforcement practices. Modern Canadian law, including the *Canadian Human Rights Act* and the *Employment Equity Act*, continues to recognize and enforce gender-based wage equality as a protected right.
