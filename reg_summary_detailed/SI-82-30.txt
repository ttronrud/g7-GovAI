**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes the official designation and administrative transfer of specific public lands to the **Minister of the Environment** under the **Canada Wildlife Act**, with the purpose of supporting **wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation**. The decision was made by the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, pursuant to **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**.

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

- **Legal Authority**: The regulation is grounded in **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to assign public lands to the Minister of the Environment for the purpose of wildlife research, conservation, or interpretation.
- **Purpose**: The lands are designated specifically to support:
  - Scientific research on wildlife populations
  - Conservation efforts (e.g., habitat protection, species recovery)
  - Public interpretation and education (e.g., visitor programs, signage, interpretive trails)

This reflects a government commitment to protecting and managing natural resources for ecological sustainability and public benefit.

### **2. Geographic Scope and Designated Areas**

The regulation designates **two National Wildlife Areas (NWAs)** in Canada, located in different provinces:

---

#### **A. Sea Wolf Island National Wildlife Area – Province of Nova Scotia**

- **Location**: County of Inverness, on Sea Wolf (Margaree) Island.
- **Total Area**: Approximately **100 acres** (about 40,469 square meters or 40,000 square feet).
- **Description**:
  - The area comprises the entire **Sea Wolf Island**, which is a significant ecological site.
  - The land is described as "all that parcel of land" in the county, encompassing the island’s natural features.

> **Important Exception (Saving Clause)**:
> Two specific parcels of land are **excluded** from the transfer and remain under the direct administration of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada:
>
> - **Lot No. 1**:
>   - A 40,000 square foot parcel bounded by bearings relative to a new tower at the light station on Sea Wolf Island.
>   - Bearings are referenced to the **Magnetic Meridian of 1868**, indicating historical survey standards.
>   - The parcel is defined by a closed loop of four segments:
>     - Start at a point 85 feet S 20° W from the center of the light station tower.
>     - Proceed N 42° W for 200 feet
>     - Then N 48° W for 200 feet
>     - Then S 42° E for 200 feet
>     - Then S 48° W for 200 feet back to the starting point.
>
> - **Lot No. 21 (Right of Way)**:
>   - A **15-foot-wide strip** of land running along an existing right-of-way.
>   - This strip extends from the **southerly boundary** of the main parcel to a **public wharf** on the southern side of the island.
>   - This right-of-way is preserved for public access and infrastructure use (e.g., access to the wharf for visitors or emergency services).

> **Note**: The exclusion of these parcels ensures that critical infrastructure (light station, public wharf, and access roads) remains under federal jurisdiction and is not subject to changes in management or use that might affect public access or safety.

#### **B. Spiers Lake National Wildlife Area – Province of Alberta**

- **Location**: Township 34, Range 16, West of the Fourth Meridian.
- **Specific Parcel**:
  - The **northwest quarter of Section 17**.
  - Includes a portion of **Spiers Lake** within that quarter.
- **Area**: Approximately **64.7 hectares** (about **160 acres**), more or less.
- **Purpose**: This area is designated to support wildlife conservation and ecological monitoring, particularly involving aquatic and terrestrial species associated with the lake and surrounding wetlands.

---

### **3. Transfer of Authority**

- The **Governor General in Council** formally assigns to the **Minister of the Environment**:
  - **Administration**
  - **Management**
  - **Control** of the designated lands.
- This means the Minister now has the legal authority to:
  - Develop and implement conservation plans
  - Regulate access and use (e.g., for research, public education, or limited recreation)
  - Enforce environmental protection measures
  - Coordinate with Indigenous communities, researchers, and other stakeholders

This transfer enables more focused, science-based management tailored to the ecological needs of the area.

---

### **4. Key Provisions and Implications**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal Status** | These areas are now officially recognized as **National Wildlife Areas (NWAs)** under Canadian federal environmental policy. |
| **Management Responsibility** | Transferred to the federal **Minister of the Environment** (or its designated agency, such as Environment and Climate Change Canada). |
| **Exclusions** | Specific parcels (Lot 1 and Lot 21) remain under federal Crown control, preserving infrastructure and public access. |
| **Historical Reference** | Bearings are based on the **1868 Magnetic Meridian**, which is a legacy of older surveying practices and ensures legal precision in land description. |
| **Ecological Focus** | The designation supports biodiversity, habitat protection, and public engagement with nature. |

---

### **5. Broader Significance**

- This regulation exemplifies Canada’s approach to **ecologically sensitive land management**, where federal oversight ensures long-term protection of wildlife habitats.
- It balances **conservation goals** with **public access and infrastructure needs** by excluding essential infrastructure from management changes.
- The use of precise survey descriptions (including bearings and distances) ensures legal clarity and prevents future disputes over land boundaries.
- By designating these areas as NWAs, the government enhances the capacity for **scientific research**, **species recovery**, and **environmental education**.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally establishes two **National Wildlife Areas** — **Sea Wolf Island (Nova Scotia)** and **Spiers Lake (Alberta)** — under the direct management of the **Minister of the Environment**. It enables effective wildlife conservation, research, and public interpretation while preserving critical infrastructure through specific exclusions. The decision is legally sound, ecologically relevant, and operationally precise, reflecting Canada’s commitment to sustainable natural resource management.
