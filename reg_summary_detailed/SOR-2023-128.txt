**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Bringing Individual Agreements with First Nations into Effect under subsection 5(1) of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*

**Statutory Authority:**  
The regulation is made under **subsection 5(1)** of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act* (S.C. 2006, c. 10). This provision empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) to bring into effect individual agreements between the Government of Canada and specific First Nations regarding education jurisdiction.

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This Order formally recognizes and gives legal effect to three **individual agreements** between the Government of Canada and three distinct First Nations. These agreements establish the **jurisdiction of the First Nations** over education matters within their territories, in accordance with the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*. This is a significant step in advancing self-determination, sovereignty, and Indigenous control over education systems in British Columbia.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Recognition of Individual Agreements:**  
   The Order confirms that the following three individual agreements are now legally in effect for the purposes of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*:

   - **Canada–Canim Lake Band Education Jurisdiction Agreement**  
     Entered into on **March 10, 2023**

   - **Canada–Ditidaht First Nation Education Jurisdiction Agreement**  
     Entered into on **March 30, 2023**

   - **Canada–Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation) Education Jurisdiction Agreement**  
     Entered into on **March 30, 2023**

   Each agreement grants the respective First Nation the authority to govern, manage, and deliver education services within its community, including the establishment of schools, curriculum development, staffing, and funding, consistent with its cultural values and governance structures.

2. **Legal Effect:**  
   By bringing these agreements into effect, the Order ensures that the terms of the agreements are enforceable under the law and that the First Nations have formal, recognized jurisdiction over education within their territories. This aligns with broader principles of **Indigenous self-governance** and **education sovereignty** under Canadian law.

3. **Amendments and Effective Date:**  
   - The Order comes into force on **July 1, 2023**.  
   - If the Order is registered (i.e., officially published and recognized) **after July 1, 2023**, it will instead come into force on the **day of registration**.  
   This provision ensures that the effective date is not retroactive and provides flexibility in the legislative process.

**Context and Significance:**

- The *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act* (2006) provides a legal framework for First Nations to exercise jurisdiction over education, provided they enter into formal agreements with the Government of Canada.
- These agreements represent a **key milestone in Indigenous education policy**, allowing First Nations to:
  - Develop culturally relevant curricula
  - Retain control over school governance and operations
  - Reduce reliance on provincial or federal education systems
  - Promote language revitalization, traditional knowledge, and community-based learning
- The agreements are part of a broader effort to **reclaim Indigenous education systems** and support reconciliation through self-determination.

---

**Governance and Process:**  
- The Order was **recommended by the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations**, reflecting the collaborative nature of the process between the federal government and First Nations.
- The Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet) formally enacted the Order, demonstrating the federal government’s commitment to honoring and implementing Indigenous agreements.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally brings into legal effect three significant education jurisdiction agreements between Canada and three First Nations in British Columbia. It affirms the right of these communities to govern their own education systems, supports Indigenous self-determination, and advances reconciliation by recognizing and respecting the unique cultural and historical contexts of each First Nation. The effective date of July 1, 2023 (or the date of registration if later) ensures timely implementation while allowing for administrative flexibility.

**Note:** This regulation is a practical application of the *First Nations Jurisdiction over Education in British Columbia Act*, reinforcing the principle that Indigenous peoples have the right to manage education in their communities — a foundational element of Indigenous rights and reconciliation.
