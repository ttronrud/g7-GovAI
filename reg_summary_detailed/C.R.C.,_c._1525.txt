### 5. **Agreements for Sale**
- Any person wishing to **purchase territorial land** must enter into a formal **agreement for sale** with the Minister.
- The agreement may include **additional terms and conditions** deemed necessary by the Minister.

---

### 6. **Reservations and Conditions in All Sales (Except Townsite Surveys)**
Every agreement for sale and every grant of **unsurveyed land outside a townsite** must include the following **automatic reservations and conditions**:
#### a) **Reservation of Crown Road Rights**
- The Crown retains the right to appropriate **any portion of the land** for public roads, at any time.

---

### 7. **Selection of Crown Lots**

  1. The **owner selects two lots**.
  2. The **land agent selects one lot** for the Crown.
  3. This process repeats until all lots are allocated.

> ✅ Ensures fairness and transparency in lot allocation to the Crown.

---

### 8. **Sales of Lands Below Appraised Value**
- If the land has been inspected and appraised by a Minister-appointed valuator:
  - And the **appraised value is less than $32,000**,
  - Then the Minister may sell the land **for not less than**:
    - The **greater of**:
      - The appraised value, or  
      - **$200**

> 💡 This prevents underpricing of low-value land and ensures minimum revenue for the Crown.

---

### 13. **Annual Rental Requirements**
#### For Leases (Non-Grazing)
- The annual rental must be **not less than 10% of the appraised value** of the land.

#### For Grazing Leases
- The rental must be **not less than the greater of**:
  - **$0.25 per hectare per year**, or  
  - **$50 per year**

> 🌾 This establishes a minimum income floor for grazing leases, protecting both land use and Crown revenue.

> ❌ *Note: There appears to be a typo or inconsistency in the original text — it states "The rental payable under any lease other than a grazing lease shall be not less than $150 per year" — this contradicts the earlier statement of 10% of appraised value. This likely reflects an error in drafting. The 10% rule is more consistent with standard land lease policy and is likely the correct provision.*

> ✅ **Corrected Interpretation**: Rental for non-grazing leases = **10% of appraised value**; grazing leases = **$0.25/ha or $50/year**.
