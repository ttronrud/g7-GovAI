The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2015-72, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Regulation SOR/2015-72, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Title**: The specific regulation is not named in your input, as only the repealing reference is provided. However, the notation indicates that this regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2015-72, section 1**.
  
- **SOR/2015-72**: This stands for *Statutory Instrument 2015-72*, a regulatory document issued under the authority of the Government of Canada. It was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on May 18, 2015.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2015-72**: This section contains the **repeal clause** that formally cancels or removes a previous regulation. In this case, it repeals a prior regulation (the one in question), meaning that the content of that earlier regulation is no longer in force or applicable.

- **Status**: The regulation referenced is **no longer in effect**. It was formally removed from the legal framework by the repeal in SOR/2015-72, s. 1. Therefore, any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by it are **void** and **not enforceable**.

- **Reason for Repeal**: While the specific reason for repeal is not detailed in your input, such repeals typically occur when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It is superseded by a more comprehensive or updated rule.
  - It creates administrative or legal complexity.

- **Legal Impact**: Any reference to this repealed regulation in legal documents, compliance procedures, or administrative decisions must be treated as **invalid or obsolete**. Authorities and individuals must rely on current, active regulations instead.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Its removal was formalized under **SOR/2015-72, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument that invalidates the prior rule. As such, it should not be cited or applied in any current legal, regulatory, or operational context.
