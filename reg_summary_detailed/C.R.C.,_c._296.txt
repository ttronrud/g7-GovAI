**Detailed Summary of the Health of Animals Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Health of Animals Regulations* are a comprehensive set of rules established under the *Health of Animals Act* (the "Act") to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of animals entering, moving through, or being raised within Canada. These regulations govern the importation, movement, handling, processing, labeling, and distribution of animals, animal products, and veterinary biologics. They also define key terms and establish procedures for disease control, inspection, and compliance with food and animal health standards.

The regulations are administered by the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)**, which is responsible for enforcing animal health and food safety standards across Canada.

## **Key Regulatory Objectives and Functions**

### 1. **Disease Prevention and Control**
- The regulations aim to prevent the introduction and spread of **serious epizootic diseases** such as:
  - **Brucellosis**
  - **Tuberculosis**
  - **Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Fowl Plague)**
  - **Foot-and-Mouth Disease** (implied in disease control)
- The **country of origin** and **herd/flock of origin** are critical for disease tracking and risk assessment.
- Animals from high-risk areas may require **quarantine** or **additional testing**.

### 2. **Animal Movement and
