Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation, structured for clarity and understanding:

---

### **Regulatory Summary: Repeal and Designation of the Appropriate Minister for The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**, consists of two key components:  
1. The **repeal** of an earlier Order in Council.  
2. The **designation of the Minister of Transport** as the *appropriate Minister* for **The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited (FBCL)** following two successive amalgamations.

---

#### **1. Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2000-409**

- **Action**: The Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) **repeals** Order in Council P.C. 2000-409, dated March 23, 2000.
- **Legal Authority**: This repeal is authorized under:
  - Paragraph (d) of the definition of *appropriate Minister* in **Section 2** of the Financial Administration Act.
  - Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of *appropriate Minister* in **subsection 83(1)** of the same Act.
- **Effective Date**: The repeal takes effect on the **day of the amalgamation** referred to in paragraph (b) of the original Order in Council (P.C. 2000-409).  
  → This means the repeal does not take effect immediately but only after the specified amalgamation occurs.

> **Purpose**: This step removes the previous regulatory framework that governed the appointment of an appropriate Minister for FBCL, ensuring that the current structure (with the Minister of Transport) is now in place and legally recognized.

---

#### **2. Designation of the Minister of Transport as the Appropriate Minister**

This section contains **two designations**, both appointing the **Minister of Transport** as the *appropriate Minister* for The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited, but in relation to **two distinct amalgamations**.

---

##### **First Designation**  
- **Subject**: The Federal Bridge Corporation Limited (FBCL)  
- **Amalgamation**: FBCL is amalgamated with the **St. Mary’s River Bridge Company**.  
- **Designation**: The **Minister of Transport** is designated as the *appropriate Minister* for the resulting amalgamated corporation.  
- **Effective Date**: The designation takes effect on the **day of the amalgamation** with the St. Mary’s River Bridge Company.  
- **Cease Date**: The designation **ceases to have effect** on the day **before** the day on which the second designation (in paragraph (c)) takes effect.

> **Purpose**: This establishes the Minister of Transport as the responsible federal minister for oversight of the newly formed entity after the merger with the St. Mary’s River Bridge Company. However, this designation is **temporary** — it ends just before the next amalgamation occurs.

---

##### **Second Designation**  
- **Subject**: The amalgamated corporation resulting from the first amalgamation (FBCL + St. Mary’s River Bridge Company)  
- **Amalgamation**: This entity is then amalgamated with the **Blue Water Bridge Authority**.  
- **Designation**: The **Minister of Transport** is again designated as the *appropriate Minister* for the resulting, larger amalgamated corporation.  
- **Effective Date**: The designation takes effect on the **day of the amalgamation** with the Blue Water Bridge Authority.

> **Purpose**: This ensures continuity of federal oversight and accountability for the final, consolidated entity — the merged corporation formed from FBCL, St. Mary’s River Bridge Company, and Blue Water Bridge Authority — under the Minister of Transport.

### **Key Legal and Structural Implications**

- **Appropriate Minister Definition**: The Financial Administration Act defines the *appropriate Minister* as the minister responsible for overseeing a corporation that receives federal funding or is under federal jurisdiction. This designation ensures proper financial and administrative oversight.
- **Amalgamation Context**: The regulation reflects a **series of corporate consolidations** aimed at streamlining infrastructure management, reducing duplication, and improving efficiency in bridge operations across Canada.
- **Ministerial Responsibility**: The consistent designation of the **Minister of Transport** indicates that bridge infrastructure (a transportation asset) falls under the portfolio of transportation policy and infrastructure management.
- **Temporal Nature**: The temporary nature of the first designation (ending before the second amalgamation) shows a phased approach to governance during corporate restructuring.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation:
- **Revokes outdated provisions** (P.C. 2000-409) related to FBCL’s governance.
- **Establishes the Minister of Transport** as the appropriate Minister for FBCL **after two successive mergers**:
  1. With the St. Mary’s River Bridge Company (temporary designation).
  2. With the Blue Water Bridge Authority (permanent designation following the second merger).
- It ensures **clear, legally grounded ministerial oversight** of the newly amalgamated bridge corporation, aligning with federal financial and administrative standards under the Financial Administration Act.

This reflects a strategic move to centralize control of major bridge infrastructure under a single, coherent federal ministry — the **Ministry of Transport** — to improve accountability, coordination, and long-term planning.
