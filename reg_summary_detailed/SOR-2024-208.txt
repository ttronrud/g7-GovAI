### **4. Conditions for Legal Shipment by Post**

For a business to legally ship a **specified firearm or specified device** by post during an amnesty period, **all of the following conditions must be met**:

#### ✅ General Requirements (Applicable to All Cases):

1. **Agreement with Government for Destruction**  
   The business must have **entered into a formal agreement with the Government of Canada** to destroy the firearm or device in question.

2. **Eligible Recipient**  
   The recipient must be a person listed in the relevant amnesty order:
   - For **2020**: Paragraph 2(1)(g) – typically includes individuals who were victims of crime or those who received firearms through legitimate channels and are now seeking safe disposal.
   - For **2024 and 2025**: Paragraph 2(1)(e) – likely includes individuals who were previously involved in unlawful possession or transfer but are now compliant with legal standards.

3. **Secure Delivery Method**  
   The firearm or device must be shipped using the **most secure means of postal transmission**, which includes:
   - **Signature on delivery** required.
   - This ensures accountability and traceability of the shipment.

4. **Firearm/Device Must Be**:
   - **Unloaded**
   - **Rendered inoperable** using a **secure locking device** (e.g., a tamper-proof lock or mechanism that prevents operation)
   - **Packaged in a container** that:
     - Is made of **opaque material**
     - Is of **sufficient strength, construction, and design** to:
       - Prevent easy breaking or opening
       - Prevent accidental opening during transit
     - **Contains no ammunition or prohibited ammunition**
     - **Has no exterior markings** that could indicate:
       - It contains a weapon
       - A prohibited device
       - Ammunition

> This packaging requirement is critical to prevent misuse, theft, or accidental exposure.

#### ⚠️ Exclusions

- **Prohibited firearms listed in item 2-2 of *A Guide to Canada’s Export Control List*** (as published by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, and adapted under paragraph 3(2)(a) of the Defence Production Act) are **excluded** from this regulation.
- These items are subject to **export control laws** and are not considered "prohibited" under the domestic firearms framework in the same way as other weapons.

---

### **5. Exemption from Other Regulations**

- Despite **Section 15 of the Storage, Display and Transportation of Firearms and Other Weapons by Businesses Regulations**, which normally prohibits the storage and transportation of prohibited firearms/devices by businesses, **these regulations create an exemption** for the **entire period of transmission by post**.
- This exemption applies **only during the time the item is in transit** via postal service:
  - From the moment it is **posted**
  - Until it is **delivered to the addressee**
  - Or **returned to the sender**
- This means that the **Storage, Display and Transportation Regulations do not apply** during the postal journey — allowing the shipment to proceed without violating those rules.

---

### **6. Scope and Application**

- Applies to:
  - **Businesses** that fall under **paragraphs 2(1)(a) or (b)** of the relevant amnesty order (e.g., licensed dealers, manufacturers, or distributors).
- Applies to:
  - **Specified firearms** (as defined in the Order Declaring an Amnesty Period)
  - **Specified devices** (as defined in the schedule to the Firearms Regulations)

> The rules are **not retroactive** and only apply during the specific amnesty period set out in subsection 2(3) of the relevant amnesty order.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.

---

### **8. Key Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Amnesty Approach** | Provides a pathway for individuals or businesses to dispose of prohibited weapons without criminal penalties, promoting public safety and compliance. |
| **Security Focus** | Strict packaging and delivery requirements minimize risks of misuse or unauthorized access. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Clearly defines who can ship, to whom, and under what conditions — reducing ambiguity and potential legal challenges. |
| **Exclusion of Export-Controlled Items** | Ensures that high-risk or internationally controlled weapons (e.g., those used in military or dual-use applications) remain outside the scope of this amnesty. |

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **safe, secure, and legally compliant pathway** for certain businesses to ship prohibited firearms and prohibited devices to eligible individuals during specific amnesty periods. It balances **public safety concerns** with **justice and rehabilitation goals**, particularly for individuals who may have violated past laws due to lack of awareness or circumstances beyond their control.

By requiring **secure packaging, destruction agreements, and signature-on-delivery delivery**, the regulation ensures that the process does not lead to further harm or illegal use of weapons. At the same time, it **excludes high-risk or export-controlled items**, maintaining national security and compliance with international obligations.
