Certainly. Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Residential Schools Unit**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. It is grounded in **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which provides the legal authority to reassign or transfer control and supervision of specific public service components between federal departments and ministers.

**2. Subject of the Transfer:**  
The regulation transfers control and supervision of a specific unit within the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development — the **Residential Schools Unit** — to a new administrative entity.

**3. New Entity Name:**  
The Residential Schools Unit is reorganized and renamed as the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada**. This name reflects a shift from a functional unit to a dedicated office focused on addressing the legacy and impacts of residential schools.

**4. Recipient of Control and Supervision:**  
The transferred responsibilities are now under the authority of the **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State**. This placement signifies a high-level governmental commitment to the issue, placing it within the broader scope of national policy and accountability, rather than within the traditional jurisdiction of Indigenous affairs.

**5. Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **June 4, 2001**. This date marks the formal commencement of the new structure and responsibilities for the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada.

**6. Purpose and Implications:**  
- The creation of the Office signals a formal government recognition of the historical harm caused by the Canadian residential school system, which forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and communities.  
- The new office is tasked with leading the government’s efforts to address the legacy of residential schools, including:  
  - Conducting truth and reconciliation initiatives  
  - Providing compensation to survivors and affected families  
  - Supporting the development of healing programs and community-based responses  
  - Coordinating with Indigenous communities, survivors, and civil society  
- The transfer to the Deputy Prime Minister underscores the political priority of this issue at the national level, indicating that it is no longer treated as a purely administrative or Indigenous affairs matter, but as a central component of national reconciliation.

**7. Context and Significance:**  
This regulation was a pivotal step in Canada’s formal response to the residential school crisis. It preceded the later establishment of the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)** in 2006, and laid the institutional groundwork for a dedicated government office to oversee reconciliation efforts. The Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada served as a key mechanism for policy implementation and accountability in the years following its creation.

**8. Key Principles Embedded:**  
- Accountability: The transfer ensures that oversight of this sensitive and impactful issue is under a minister with high-level visibility and authority.  
- Reconciliation: The reorganization reflects a commitment to addressing historical wrongs and engaging in meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.  
- Institutional Clarity: It creates a clear, dedicated structure for managing the complex and ongoing process of addressing residential school impacts.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant governmental action in Canada’s journey toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. By transferring the Residential Schools Unit into a new, named office under the Deputy Prime Minister, the federal government formally acknowledged the gravity of the residential school legacy and committed to a structured, high-priority approach to addressing its impacts. Though the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada was later succeeded or restructured in subsequent years (particularly with the establishment of the TRC and ongoing reconciliation efforts), this 2001 transfer remains a foundational moment in Canada’s public policy response to residential schools.

*Note: While the regulation is dated June 4, 2001, the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada was later restructured or dissolved as part of broader policy shifts. However, its establishment in 2001 was a critical milestone in the national conversation on Indigenous rights and historical justice.*
