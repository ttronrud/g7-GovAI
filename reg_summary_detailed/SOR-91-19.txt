The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2006-230, s. 4]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 4 of the Statutory Rules Order 2006 (SOR/2006-230)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal became effective through **SOR/2006-230**, which was issued in 2006. While the exact date of repeal is not specified in the provided text, such orders typically take effect upon publication in the Canada Gazette or on the date specified in the order.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Statutory Rules Order (SOR)** system, which is used in Canada to formally amend or cancel existing regulations.
- **Section Referenced**: The repeal applies to **Section 4** of the regulation that was previously in effect. This means that the specific provisions of the regulation under Section 4 are no longer valid or applicable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they are outdated, redundant, inconsistent with newer legislation, or superseded by more current or comprehensive rules. The repeal of Section 4 likely reflects such a change in policy, administrative structure, or legal framework.

### Implications:
- Any legal or administrative action based on the repealed regulation is **no longer valid**.
- Entities (such as government agencies, businesses, or individuals) must now refer to the **current, active regulations** that replaced or succeeded the repealed one, if any.
- The repeal does not imply that the regulation was incorrect or ineffective—it simply means it is no longer in force.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the provided text has been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2006-230, section 4**. As such, it is **not currently applicable** and should not be used as a basis for legal or operational decisions.
