**Detailed Summary of the *Fishing Zones of Canada (Zone 6) Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **"Fishing Zones of Canada (Zone 6) Order"**.
- It is to be cited as such and serves as a legal instrument defining the boundaries and scope of **Fishing Zone 6** under Canadian maritime law.

---

### **2. Key Definitions Used in the Order**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **C.H.S. Chart** | Refers to the *Canadian Hydrographic Service Chart*, which is the official nautical chart used by Canadian authorities to map and define maritime boundaries, depths, and features. This chart provides the baseline for geographic reference in the zone. |
| **Geographical Coordinates** | Refers to specific latitudes and longitudes listed in the attached schedule. These coordinates define key points that form the outer boundary of Fishing Zone 6 via geodesic lines. |
| **NAD83** | Stands for the *North American Datum 1983*, the standard geodetic reference system used in Canada for mapping and positioning. All spatial measurements in the Order are based on this system to ensure accuracy and consistency. |

---

### **3. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally establish Fishing Zone 6** as an official fishing zone of Canada.
- It legally defines the spatial extent of this zone, which is designated for the regulation and management of fishing activities.

### **4. Geographic Boundaries of Fishing Zone 6**

Fishing Zone 6 is defined by a combination of **geodesic lines** and a **special boundary line**:

#### **A. Outer Perimeter (Main Boundary)**
- The outer boundary of Fishing Zone 6 is composed of:
  - **Geodesic lines** connecting specific points.
  - These points are determined by reference to the **geographical coordinates listed in the Schedule** (an annex to the Order).
- Geodesic lines are straight lines drawn on the Earth’s surface (accounting for curvature), ensuring precise and accurate representation of the zone’s shape on a spherical globe.

#### **B. Secondary Boundary Line (Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean, and Lincoln Sea)**
- A separate boundary line runs from:
  - **Start Point**: 72°57′56.050″ N latitude, 141° W longitude  
  - **End Point**: 86°18′45″ N latitude, 59°51′57″ W longitude
- This line is **not a straight line**, but rather a curved path that follows the **200-nautical-mile limit** from the **baseline** used to measure Canada’s territorial sea in the following regions:
  - Beaufort Sea  
  - Arctic Ocean  
  - Lincoln Sea
- **Key Point**: Every point along this line is **exactly 200 nautical miles** from the nearest point of the baseline that defines Canada’s territorial sea in those regions.

> This boundary reflects Canada’s commitment to the **200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)** principle under international law (UNCLOS), ensuring that fishing activities in this zone are governed under Canadian jurisdiction.

### **5. Exclusions from Fishing Zone 6**

- The zone **does not include**:
  - **Internal waters** (such as rivers, bays, and estuaries directly adjacent to the coast)
  - **Territorial sea** (the 12-nautical-mile zone adjacent to the coast, within which Canada has full sovereignty)
- Thus, fishing activities within internal waters or territorial seas are **not covered** by this zone and are subject to different legal and regulatory frameworks.

---

### **6. Legal and Regulatory Implications**

- By establishing Fishing Zone 6, Canada:
  - Asserts jurisdiction over fishing activities within the defined area.
  - Enables the implementation of fishing regulations, including:
    - Licensing requirements
    - Quota systems
    - Gear restrictions
    - Seasonal closures
    - Protection of sensitive marine ecosystems
- The zone supports sustainable fisheries management and helps prevent overfishing in Arctic waters.

---

### **7. Significance of the Zone**

- Fishing Zone 6 lies in the **Canadian Arctic**, extending from the Beaufort Sea through the central Arctic Ocean to the Lincoln Sea.
- It covers a vast and ecologically significant area, including regions of high biological productivity and critical habitat for Arctic species (e.g., cod, polar bears, seabirds).
- The zone is vital for:
  - Supporting Canadian fisheries
  - Ensuring equitable access to resources
  - Maintaining sovereignty in a region of growing international interest

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Fishing Zones of Canada (Zone 6) Order* formally and precisely defines a large, strategically important fishing zone in Canada’s Arctic region. It uses modern geodetic standards (NAD83), precise coordinates, and internationally recognized maritime boundaries (200 nautical miles from baseline) to establish clear jurisdictional limits. Importantly, it excludes internal waters and territorial seas, ensuring compliance with international maritime law. This Order is a key component of Canada’s broader strategy for sustainable and lawful fisheries management in the Arctic.
