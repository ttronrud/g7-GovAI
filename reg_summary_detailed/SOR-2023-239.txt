### **Detailed Summary of the Order Issuing Directions to the CRTC (Sustainable and Equitable Broadcasting Regulatory Framework)**

This regulation, issued under **subsection 7(1) of the Broadcasting Act (S.C. 1991, c. 11)** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, establishes a new **Sustainable and Equitable Broadcasting Regulatory Framework**. It provides comprehensive directions to the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)** on how to regulate and supervise the Canadian broadcasting system to ensure it is inclusive, equitable, accessible, and sustainable — with a strong emphasis on Indigenous peoples, equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups, persons with disabilities, and Canadian creators.

## **1. Background and Legal Authority**

- The Order was developed in accordance with:
  - **Subsection 7(6)** of the *Broadcasting Act*: requiring consultation with the CRTC.
  - **Paragraph 8(1)(a)**: requiring publication of the proposed Order in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **June 10, 2023**, with a public comment period that has now ended.
  - **Paragraph 8(1)(b)**: requiring the proposed Order to be laid before each House of Parliament.

This regulatory action reflects a shift toward a more **inclusive, outcome-based, and flexible** approach to broadcasting policy, aligning with modern media ecosystems and equity goals.

---

## **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Broadcasting Act*.
- **Social media creator**: A person who creates content primarily for online distribution through social media platforms as user-uploaded programs (e.g., podcasts, short-form videos). This definition explicitly excludes the regulation of such creators’ content by broadcasting undertakings.

---

## **3. Core Objectives and Directives to the CRTC**

### **A. Indigenous Peoples and the UNDRIP (United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples)**

The CRTC is directed to:
- **Support meaningful participation** of Indigenous persons in the Canadian broadcasting system.
- Promote their ability to:
  - Create and produce diverse programming;
  - Access such programming;
  - Own and control broadcasting undertakings.
- Ensure that regulatory actions **advance reconciliation**, recognizing historical injustices and colonial legacies.
- Engage with Indigenous peoples, partners, and governing bodies to:
  - Support Indigenous broadcasting undertakings;
  - Foster business models reflecting Indigenous perspectives;
  - Improve discoverability of Indigenous-created content;
  - Develop appropriate funding mechanisms (e.g., for Indigenous-led organizations);
  - Respect **narrative sovereignty** — the right of Indigenous communities to tell their own stories.

> This directive reflects a significant policy shift toward **Indigenous self-determination** in media and content creation.

---

### **B. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion of Other Groups**

The CRTC is directed to:
- Support programming by **members of equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups**, including **Black or other racialized communities**, recognizing systemic racism and language barriers.
- Ensure programming reflects the experiences and voices of these communities.
- Consider **demographic data** from various sources (e.g., broadcasting undertakings, industry organizations, Employment Equity Act reports) to assess participation levels.

> The Order mandates the development of **measurable targets** for the creation, availability, and discoverability of programming by these groups.

---

### **C. Official Language Minority Communities**

The CRTC must:
- Engage with **official language minority communities** (e.g., Francophones in English-speaking regions, Anglophones in French-speaking regions).
- Support access to programming by and for these communities.
- Consider funding, distribution, and discoverability mechanisms that address language-specific challenges.

> This ensures that both official languages are represented in programming, especially in underserved areas.

---

### **D. Accessibility for Persons with Disabilities**

The CRTC is directed to:
- Regulate the system to ensure **programming is accessible without barriers** to persons with disabilities.
- Promote features such as closed captioning, audio description, sign language interpretation, and other accessibility tools.

> This is a foundational commitment to **inclusive media access**.

---

### **E. Support for Community and Exceptional Broadcasters**

The CRTC is directed to:
- Foster **collaboration and innovation** among community broadcasters.
- Support broadcasting undertakings that are **exceptionally important** to achieving the national broadcasting policy (as set out in subsection 3(1) of the Act).
- Ensure sustainability of these vital services, particularly in rural and remote areas.

> Emphasis is placed on **sustainable funding** and **long-term viability** of community media.

---

### **F. Discoverability and Showcasing of Canadian Programming**

- The Commission must consider **both traditional and emerging methods** of discoverability (e.g., algorithms, metadata, metadata tagging, platform features).
- Prioritize **outcome-based regulations** that:
  - Minimize changes to computer algorithms;
  - Do not disrupt programming or audience choice;
  - Focus on results (e.g., viewership, engagement) rather than prescriptive technical rules.

> This avoids over-regulation of digital platforms and respects technological innovation.

---

### **G. Financial and Non-Financial Requirements for Broadcasting Undertakings**

- The CRTC must impose **equitable financial and non-financial requirements** on all broadcasting undertakings (including foreign ones).
- Requirements must be:
  - Proportional to the size and nature of the undertaking;
  - Fairly balanced between **Canadian and foreign online undertakings**;
  - Based on **outcomes**, not just compliance with rules.

> This ensures fairness and avoids disproportionate burdens on smaller or foreign entities.

---

### **H. Exemptions from Regulation**

The CRTC is **explicitly directed not to impose regulatory requirements on**:
1. **Online undertakings regarding programs by social media creators**, including podcasts.
   - This recognizes the decentralized, user-generated nature of social media content.
2. **Broadcasting undertakings regarding the transmission of video games**.
   - Video games are treated as a distinct category, not subject to traditional Canadian content rules.

> These exemptions reflect a pragmatic, modern understanding of digital media and platform dynamics.

---

### **I. Expenditure Requirements (Section 11.1 of the Act)**

The CRTC must:
- Regularly **review expenditure requirements** to ensure they are **proportional to clear objectives**.
- Recognize the **diversity of services** offered by broadcasters.
- Provide **flexibility** in meeting expenditure obligations based on business models.
- Prioritize expenditures that directly support:
  - Creation, production, and presentation of **Canadian programming**;
  - **French-language programming**, recognizing the minority status and challenges of producing original French content;
  - Programming by **Indigenous creators** and in **Indigenous languages**;
  - Programming by **equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups**;
  - Programming by **official language minority community creators**.

> The Order emphasizes **sustainable, predictable funding** for public interest groups and creators.

---

### **J. Determining What Constitutes “Canadian Programming”**

The CRTC must:
- Consult with Canadians, creators, producers, and other stakeholders.
- Support **Canadian ownership of intellectual property**.
- Recognize differences between:
  - Audio-only programs (e.g., radio);
  - Audio-visual programs (e.g., TV, film).
- Acknowledge that the Act applies to **foreign broadcasting undertakings** that provide programming to Canadians.
- Consider how its definition complements other Canadian content policies (e.g., **audio-visual tax credits**, government funding programs).

> This ensures consistency across policy areas and avoids duplication or gaps.

---

### **K. Engagement and Transparency**

The CRTC is required to:
- Engage regularly with:
  - Indigenous peoples and partners;
  - Equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups;
  - Official language minority communities;
  - Broadcasters, creators, industry organizations, and community members.
- Collaborate with relevant federal departments where possible.
- Ensure that all engagements are **accessible** (e.g., via remote participation, translation, accessible formats).
- Provide **periodic public reporting** on progress toward achieving the broadcasting policy objectives, including:
  - Inclusion of Indigenous persons;
  - Participation of equity-seeking and ethnocultural groups;
  - Access to programming by official language minorities.

> This enhances **accountability and public trust** in the regulatory process.

---

### **L. Regulatory Flexibility and Modernization**

The CRTC is directed to:
- Minimize regulatory burden;
- Avoid disruptions to programming not covered by the Act;
- Respect audience choice and expand options;
- Use **incentive-based tools** (e.g., funding, grants) rather than punitive measures;
- Leverage **digital tools and solutions** (e.g., data analytics, AI, open-source platforms);
- Consider foreign regulatory frameworks affecting online undertakings;
- Foster **collaboration between Canadian and foreign broadcasters**.

> This promotes a **dynamic, adaptive, and future-ready** regulatory environment.

---

### **M. Timeline for Implementation**

- The CRTC must **review and update its regulatory framework** within **two years** of the Order coming into force.
- Prioritization is required for implementing **Sections 13 to 16** (which cover Indigenous participation, equity, accessibility, and discoverability).
- Changes must be made **as soon as feasible** and on a **continual basis** during this period.

> This ensures a **timely, iterative, and responsive** rollout of the new framework.
