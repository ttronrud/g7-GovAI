## **Detailed Summary of the Integrated Circuit Topography Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**
- These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs** and the **Treasury Board**, pursuant to specific sections of the *Integrated Circuit Topography Act* (Sections 16, 18, 19, 21, and 27).
- The primary purpose is to **establish detailed procedures for the protection of integrated circuit topographies** — the physical layout or design of semiconductor chips — in Canada.
- The regulations provide rules governing **application procedures, filing requirements, communication protocols, confidentiality, registration, and enforcement** of rights related to topographies.

### **3. Rules for Receiving and Processing Correspondence**

- Electronic transmission: Permitted at any time, based on the Registrar’s published list in the Canadian Patent Office Record.

#### **General Rules for Correspondence**
- **Each communication must relate to only one application or registered topography** (to avoid confusion).
- Exceptions to this rule:
  - Transfers of interest or licences affecting a registered topography (Section 21(1)).
  - Changes in name/address of:
    - Owner with multiple registered topographies
    - Applicant for multiple topographies
    - Representative for service of multiple owners or applicants
- **All persons required to provide an address must give a complete postal address** (street name, number where applicable).
- An additional address (for mailing) may be provided voluntarily.

#### **Content of Correspondence**
- For **applications**, must include:
  - Application number (if assigned)
  - Name of applicant
  - Title(s) of the topography
- For **registered topographies**, must include:
  - Registration number
  - Name of owner
  - Title(s) of the topography

#### **Who Corresponds on Behalf of an Applicant**
- If only one applicant: correspondence is with that applicant.
- If multiple applicants:
  - With the applicant **authorized by others** to act on their behalf
  - Or, if no authorization exists: with the **first applicant named** in the application.
- Correspondence is **only valid** with the designated person or firm.

- If the agent fails to comply, the Registrar will **direct future correspondence to the applicant directly** until the appointment is filed.

#### **Representative for Service**
- An applicant or owner may appoint a representative in Canada to receive legal notices or service of process.
- A notice served on the representative has the **same legal effect** as if served directly on the applicant or owner.

### **4. Requirements for Applications**

#### **Language and Signature**
- Applications and amendments must be in **one of Canada’s official languages** (English or French).
- Must bear the **signature of the applicant or their agent**.

#### **One Application per Topography**
- A **separate application** must be submitted for each distinct topography.

#### **Mandatory Information and Material**
In addition to the requirements in Section 16(2)(a)–(d) of the Act, applications must include:

1. **Representative for Service**  
   - If the applicant has no office or place of business in Canada.

2. **Agent Information**  
   - Name and address of any appointed agent.

3. **Description of Material Filed**  
   - Number of layers (especially if confidential)
   - Reference to whether Section 15 or 16 was relied upon (for confidentiality)

4. **Nature or Function of the Topography**  
   - A brief explanation of what the topography does or how it functions.

#### **Required Visual Material (Overlay Sheets, Drawings, Photos)**
- A **complete set** of overlay sheets, drawings, or photographs must be filed.
- The material must be **sufficiently magnified** so that the design is clearly visible to the naked eye.
- If multiple sheets/drawings/photos:
  - Must be **numbered consecutively**.

#### **Confidentiality Provisions (Special Rules for Topographies with Confidential Information)**

##### **Option 1: Partial Disclosure (Up to 50% Blocked Out)**
- If a topography has **more than two layers** and contains **confidential information**, the applicant may file:
  - A **partial set** of sheets/drawings/photos (same total number as required), with **up to 50% of the total area blocked out**.
  - Conditions:
    - The selected sheets must be **clearly indicated** in the application.
    - The number of selected sheets **does not exceed 50%** of the total number.
    - If total number is odd, subtract one before applying the 50% limit.
