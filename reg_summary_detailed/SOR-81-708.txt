**Detailed Summary of the Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Background**

The **Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Regulations**, officially cited as *Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Regulations, C.R.C., c. 124*, were **approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**.

This action constitutes the **revocation of the previous zoning regulations** governing the Winnipeg International Airport and the **approval of new, updated regulations** in their place. The new regulations are designed to ensure the safety, efficiency, and operational integrity of the airport by controlling the physical environment around its runways and approach paths.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to the **Winnipeg International Airport** located within the **City of Winnipeg, Province of Manitoba**.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographical point used as a datum for elevation measurements. It is defined by a precise legal description:
  - Begins at the **Northeasterly corner of Lot 19 in the Outer Two Miles, Parish of Saint James**.
  - Proceeds **2,000 feet south** along the eastern boundary of Lot 19.
  - Then **1,000 feet west** at right angles.
  
  The **assigned elevation** of this point is **774 feet above sea level**.

- **Strip**: A rectangular area of the landing zone designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Each strip is associated with a runway or runway pair and includes the runway and its adjacent safety zones.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a strip. These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during landing and takeoff, minimizing obstacles.

- **Transitional Surface**: An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of a neighboring strip.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point**. However, if this would place the surface **below 30 feet above ground level**, the outer surface is instead set at **30 feet above ground** to avoid unrealistic or unsafe assumptions.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, specifically:

- Lands **within** the defined boundaries of the airport zone; and  
- Lands **directly under** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This ensures that even areas not directly adjacent to runways are subject to strict height restrictions if they fall within the influence zone of the airport’s operational safety zones.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including natural growth) on any land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- **Approach Surface**
- **Outer Surface**
- **Transitional Surface**

This restriction applies to **all structures**, including residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, and even **vegetation or trees**.

---

### **5. Management of Excessive Natural Growth**

If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision ensures that natural features do not pose a hazard to aircraft during approach or departure.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may **use such land for the disposal of waste** that is:

- **Edible by birds** or  
- **Attractive to birds**

This rule is crucial to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation safety risk. By banning such waste, the regulations aim to reduce bird populations near the airport and minimize the danger of collisions with aircraft.

---

### **7. Geographical Boundaries of the Airport Zone**

The airport zone is defined by a detailed legal description based on the **Special Survey of the City of Winnipeg**, and is shown in **Department of Transport Winnipeg International Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1540**.

The boundary is composed of a series of precise directional descriptions, including:

- Starting at the intersection of the **straight production northerly** of the west boundary of **Lot 2 (Outer Two Miles, Parish of Saint James)** with the **south boundary of Section 20, Township 11, Range 2 East**.
- Proceeding through a sequence of boundaries of sections, parts of sections, and road allowances.
- Including references to **specific lots, streets, railways (e.g., Canadian Pacific Railway Plan 374)**, and **avenues (Wellington, Strathcona, Ellice, Park Boulevard, Corydon, Portage, Cavalier, Saskatchewan)**.
- Ending at a point that returns to the starting point via a series of straight lines and productions.

All boundaries are **recorded in the Winnipeg Land Titles Office** and are visually identified as **yellow-shaded areas** on the official zoning plan.

### **8. Description of Approach Surfaces**

Approach surfaces are defined for each runway end and are designed to provide a safe clearance zone for aircraft during landing. They are described as:

- **Inclined planes** with a **1:50 vertical-to-horizontal ratio** (1 foot rise per 50 feet run).
- Rising to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
  - **1,000 feet above** the elevation at the end of the strip (for most runways).
  - **200 feet above** the end of the strip (for runways 18R and 25).
- The horizontal reach from the end of the strip is:
  - **50,000 feet** for most runways (extending 8,100 feet from the runway centerline).
  - **10,000 feet** for runways 25 and 18R (extending 1,600 or 2,000 feet from centerline).
- The outer ends of these horizontal lines are offset from the runway centerline to create a buffer zone.

The approach surfaces apply to the following runway ends:

- Runway 18L
- Runway 36R
- Runway 13R
- Runway 31L
- Runway 13L
- Runway 31R
- Runway 25
- Runway 18R

Each surface is clearly mapped on **Zoning Plan No. E.1540**.

### **9. Description of Strips**

Each strip is a defined rectangular area associated with a runway or runway pair. Dimensions are as follows:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 18L–36R | 1,200 ft | 13,600 ft |
| 13R–31L | 1,200 ft | 15,200 ft |
| 13L–31R | 1,000 ft | 13,700 ft |
| 07–25 | 1,200 ft | 5,600 ft |
| 18R–36L | 1,200 ft | 4,800 ft |

Each strip includes **600 feet on each side of the centerline** (except for 13L–31R, which has 500 feet on each side).

---

### **10. Description of Transitional Surfaces**

Each transitional surface is:

- An **inclined plane** with a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot rise per 7 feet run).
- Extending **from the lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces.
- Rising **upward and outward** until it intersects either:
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent strip.

This ensures that the vertical clearance is maintained between adjacent runways and their approach paths, preventing obstructions in the transition zone.

---

### **11. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** is responsible for:
  - Issuing directions regarding removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Monitoring compliance with height and waste disposal rules.
- Compliance is enforced through **legal authority** under the Aeronautics Act.
- Violations may result in penalties or enforcement actions by the Minister.

---

### **12. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Ensure aviation safety** by eliminating obstacles (natural or man-made) in the flight paths of aircraft during takeoff and landing.
2. **Prevent bird strikes** by restricting waste disposal that attracts birds.
3. **Maintain consistent and predictable flight corridors** through clearly defined geometric boundaries.
4. **Provide a legally enforceable framework** for land use around the airport to support long-term operational planning.
