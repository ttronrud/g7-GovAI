#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Income Tax Act* (the primary legislation governing income tax in Canada). |
| **Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement** | The foundational agreement signed on **September 6, 1993**, between the Government of Canada and the Sahtu Dene and Metis, represented by the Sahtu Tribal Council. This agreement addresses land claims and includes provisions for self-government and settlement. It may be amended over time. |
| **Sahtu Dene and Metis First Nation Government** | A new Indigenous government established under **Section 2.1 of Appendix B** of the Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. This government is created through the self-government process and has legal status and authority over certain matters. |
| **Self-Government Agreement** | Also defined in Section 2.1 of Appendix B of the Land Claim Agreement. This agreement grants the Sahtu Dene and Metis increased autonomy in governance, including the ability to establish a First Nation government. |
| **Settlement Corporation** | As defined in **Section 11.3.1** of the Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. This is a corporation established to manage and administer the financial settlement (e.g., revenue, assets) resulting from the land claim. |

#### **3. Scope of Remission**

The regulation grants **full remission** (i.e., forgiveness) of the following:

1. **Tax Payable**  
   - The income tax owed by the **settlement corporation** upon its **cessation of existence**.
   - This occurs when all of the corporation’s assets are transferred to the **Sahtu Dene and Metis First Nation Government** under the self-government agreement.

2. **Penalties**  
   - Any penalties imposed under the *Income Tax Act* in connection with the corporation ceasing to exist and its assets being transferred.

3. **Interest**  
   - Any interest payable on the tax and penalties associated with the transfer.

> ✅ In essence, **no tax, penalty, or interest** is owed by the settlement corporation or its successor (the First Nation Government) due to the transfer of assets, as long as the conditions are met.

---

#### **4. Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **not automatic**. It is granted **only if** the following conditions are satisfied:

- **No Prior Relief**:  
  The amount being remitted has **not already been**:
  - Rebated,
  - Credited,
  - Refunded, or
  - Remitted  
  to the person (individual or entity) under:
  - The *Income Tax Act*,
  - The *Financial Administration Act*, or
  - Any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

> This prevents double benefits or overlapping tax relief.

- **Application Requirement**:  
  The person (e.g., the First Nation Government or a designated entity) must **submit a written application** to the **Minister of National Revenue** for remission.

- **Deadline for Application**:  
  The application must be submitted **before the later of two dates**:
  1. **18 months after the date the Order is made** (i.e., the date the regulation is published and comes into force), and  
  2. **The filing-due date** of the person’s taxation year in which the transfer of assets occurred.

> ⚠️ If the application is not submitted by this deadline, the remission will not be granted.

#### **5. Key Implications and Objectives**

- **Supports Self-Government**:  
  This regulation recognizes the importance of Indigenous self-determination by removing financial barriers (such as tax liability) associated with the transfer of assets from a settlement corporation to a newly established First Nation government.

- **Promotes Fiscal Sustainability**:  
  It ensures that the new First Nation government is not burdened by tax obligations that would otherwise arise from the dissolution of the settlement corporation, allowing it to operate independently and effectively.

- **Public Interest Justification**:  
  The Governor General in Council acted on the basis of **public interest**, indicating that the policy serves broader societal goals—such as strengthening Indigenous governance, promoting reconciliation, and supporting equitable development.

- **Compliance with Legal Framework**:  
  The regulation is consistent with the *Financial Administration Act*, which allows for remissions in cases where public interest or special circumstances justify them.

#### **6. Practical Application Example**

Suppose:
- The Sahtu Dene and Metis Settlement Corporation dissolves.
- All its assets (e.g., land, infrastructure, revenue streams) are transferred to the newly formed **Sahtu Dene and Metis First Nation Government** under the self-government agreement.
- The transfer occurs in the 2023 taxation year.

Then:
- The First Nation Government must apply in writing to the Minister of National Revenue for remission of:
  - Any tax due on the corporation’s dissolution,
  - Any penalties,
  - Any interest.
- The application must be submitted **before the later of**:
  - 18 months after the Order is made (e.g., if the Order is made on January 1, 2024, the deadline is July 1, 2025),
  - The filing deadline for the 2023 taxation year (e.g., April 30, 2024).

If both conditions are met and no prior tax relief was granted, the remission will be approved.

#### **7. Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, principled policy tool** designed to:
- Facilitate the transition of assets from a federal settlement corporation to a self-governing Indigenous First Nation government,
- Remove financial obstacles to self-government,
- Align with the principles of Indigenous rights and self-determination under Canadian law,
- And ensure compliance with fiscal and administrative procedures through clear conditions and deadlines.

It reflects a balance between **fiscal responsibility** and **the public interest in advancing Indigenous self-governance**.

---

**Final Note**: This regulation is specific to the **Sahtu Dene and Metis** and is not intended to apply to other Indigenous groups or settlement arrangements. Its provisions are binding under Canadian law and must be followed by relevant parties when transferring assets under a self-government agreement.
