### **Background and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Privacy Act* (Canada), specifically **subsection 18(1)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Solicitor General and the President of the Treasury Board) to revoke or replace existing orders designating certain personal information banks as "exempt" under the Act.

The original **Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 13 (RCMP)**, made by Order in Council P.C. 1985-864 on March 14, 1985, had designated certain records held by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) as exempt from the general privacy protections of the *Privacy Act*. This exemption allows the RCMP to collect, use, and disclose personal information without the same level of public oversight or individual consent requirements that apply to other personal information banks.

This current regulation **revokes** the original Order and **replaces it** with a new, updated designation.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Designation of a New Exempt Personal Information Bank**
The regulation designates **Criminal Operational Intelligence Records, No. CMP/P-PU-015**, as an **exempt personal information bank** under the *Privacy Act*.

- **Jurisdiction:** The records are under the control of the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.
- **Nature of Records:** These are operational intelligence records used in criminal investigations and law enforcement activities.
- **Exemption Basis:** The designation is made pursuant to **section 22** of the *Privacy Act*, which allows personal information banks to be exempt from the Act’s general privacy protections if they are necessary for the prevention, detection, or investigation of crime.

#### 2. **Legal Authority for Exemption**
The exemption is justified under **section 22** of the *Privacy Act*, which provides that personal information banks containing information about individuals that are primarily related to criminal or security matters may be exempt if:
- The information is used in the context of criminal investigations or national security;
- The information is necessary for law enforcement operations;
- The exemption serves the public interest in maintaining effective law enforcement.

#### 3. **Applicable Laws Governing the Use of Information**
Under **paragraph 18(3)(b)** of the *Privacy Act*, when personal information in the exempt bank consists predominantly of information described in **subparagraph 22(1)(a)(ii)** — which refers to personal information relating to:
- **Criminal activity**, or
- **Security or public safety concerns** —  
the applicable laws governing the collection, use, and disclosure of that information are specified.

These laws include:
- **Criminal Code**  
- **Customs Act**  
- **Excise Act**  
- **Food and Drugs Act**  
- **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**  
- **Income Tax Act**  
- **Controlled Drugs and Substances Act**  
- **Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act**

This means that the RCMP may lawfully collect, access, and disclose information from the Criminal Operational Intelligence Records (CMP/P-PU-015) under the authority of these specific statutes, rather than under the general privacy provisions of the *Privacy Act*.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Ensure that the RCMP can effectively conduct criminal investigations by maintaining access to operational intelligence without being constrained by the general privacy protections that apply to most personal information.
- Maintain the balance between individual privacy rights and the legitimate needs of law enforcement in preventing and detecting crime.
- Provide legal clarity and consistency in the use of exempt personal information banks by clearly identifying which records are exempt and under which legal frameworks they may be used.

---

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Exemption from Privacy Act Protections:** Individuals whose personal information is held in this exempt bank are not entitled to the same rights under the *Privacy Act*, such as access requests or challenge of data use, unless otherwise required by law.
- **Accountability:** Despite the exemption, the RCMP remains accountable under the laws listed above (e.g., the *Criminal Code*) and must follow procedural rules and safeguards to ensure lawful and proportionate use of the information.
- **Transparency and Oversight:** While exempt from the full scope of the *Privacy Act*, the use of such records is still subject to oversight mechanisms under the broader framework of Canadian law and public accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a formal and legally binding exemption for **Criminal Operational Intelligence Records (CMP/P-PU-015)** maintained by the RCMP. It replaces an older exemption with a more targeted and legally grounded designation, ensuring that law enforcement operations can proceed efficiently while remaining within the bounds of Canadian law. The exemption is justified under section 22 of the *Privacy Act* and is limited to specific types of personal information relevant to criminal and security matters, governed by key federal statutes.

This Order underscores the government’s recognition that effective law enforcement requires flexibility in handling sensitive personal information, but also reaffirms the importance of legal accountability and the rule of law in its use.
