## 💰 **Fee Structure and Calculation Framework**

### ✅ **Part 1: Facilities and Waste Activities (Class I, Mines, Waste)**

#### 1. **Annual Fee Calculation**
- **Before each fiscal year**, the CNSC:
  - Prepares a **regulatory activity plan** for each applicant/licensee.
  - Calculates the **estimated annual fee** based on the full cost of the plan.
  - Notifies the applicant/licensee in writing.

#### 2. **Quarterly Invoicing**
- The CNSC sends an invoice **every quarter** for **25% of the estimated annual fee**.
- Payment must be made **within 30 days** of invoice.

#### 3. **Fee Adjustments**
- After the fiscal year ends:
  - The CNSC calculates the **actual full cost** (audited).
  - Computes a **fee adjustment** = (Actual Full Cost – Estimated Annual Fee)
- **If adjustment is negative** (actual cost < estimate):  
  → Refund the difference to the licensee.
- **If adjustment is positive** (actual cost > estimate):  
  → Invoice for the difference; payment due within 30 days.

#### 4. **Initial Application Deposit**
- **Class I facility**: $25,000 deposit
- **Waste nuclear substance activity**: $5,000 deposit
- Deposit is applied to the estimated annual fee over the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.
- After the fiscal year, the final fee is adjusted as per Section 6.

> This ensures upfront funding while allowing for cost recovery based on actual performance.

### ✅ **Part 2: Class II Facilities, Dosimetry, and Devices (Fee-Based Formula System)**

Fees are calculated using a **formula-based system** with four components:

| Component | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Base Hours** | Hours spent on: <br> - Assessing applications <br> - Verifying compliance |
| **Variable Hours** | Additional hours due to: <br> - Number of treatment rooms, bunkers, labs, locations with separate postal addresses <br> - Number of devices <br> - Number of device manufacturers <br> - Types of Class II prescribed equipment |
| **Compliance Coefficient** | Additional hours due to non-compliance with regulatory requirements |
| **Hourly Rate** | Total full cost ÷ Total direct regulatory hours |

#### 2.1 **Fee Publication**
- Before each fiscal year, the CNSC **publishes** the base hours, variable hours, compliance coefficient, and hourly rate for each type of licence or application (via electronic or public means).

#### 2.2 **Initial Licence Fees**
- **Assessment Fee**: Paid at application stage; calculated using a formula from **Schedule 1, Part 2** (based on formula number in column 2).
- **Annual Fee**: Paid annually; calculated using formula from **column 3** of Schedule 1.

> Example: For a diagnostic nuclear medicine facility, the fee depends on the number of treatment rooms, labs, and compliance history.

#### 2.3 **Withdrawal Rules**
- If application is **withdrawn before assessment begins**:
  - Both assessment and annual fees are **fully refunded**.
- If application is **withdrawn or rejected after assessment begins**:
  - **Assessment fee is not refunded**.
  - **Annual fee is refunded**.
- A **re-application** after rejection is treated as a **new initial application**.

#### 2.4 **Annual Invoicing**
- Each year before the **licence anniversary**, the CNSC issues an invoice for the annual fee.
- Payment due by **the later of**:  
  - 30 days after invoice date  
  - Licence anniversary date

#### 2.5 **Changes During Fee Period**
- Changes in the number of treatment rooms, labs, devices, or locations **do not affect** the fee for the current period.

#### 2.6 **Revocation After First Year**
- If a licence is **revoked within the first year**:
  - **No refund** of annual fee.
- If revoked **after first year**:
  - Annual fee is **reduced by 25% × number of full quarterly periods remaining**.
  - The reduced amount is **refunded** to the former licensee.

> This incentivizes compliance and accountability.

Applies to:

- Transport licences (excluding special arrangements)

- Class II prescribed equipment model certifications
- Exposure device operator certifications

#### Key Features:
- **Fixed fee structure** per application type (listed in Schedule 2).
- Fees are **paid with the application**.
- **No refund** if application is withdrawn **after assessment begins**.

> This ensures predictability and transparency for standard certification processes.

---

### ✅ **Part 4: Special Projects (Non-Standard Activities)**

Applies to:
- Special transport packaging (e.g., under paragraph 6(1)(d))
- Special form radioactive material design certifications
- Unlisted licences or certifications
- Non-standard information/products/services

#### Fee Structure:
- Fee = (Hourly rate × direct regulatory hours) + (Cost of contracted professional services)
