### **Detailed Summary of the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 9)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

The **Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations** were approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Natural Resources**, under **Section 44 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**. These regulations were established to ensure the safe, environmentally responsible, and secure development of uranium mining and milling activities in Canada.

They were originally issued on **May 31, 2000**, and remain in force as part of the NSCA framework, with certain definitions and requirements updated or clarified over time (e.g., the repeal of "effective dose" in 2007).

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define critical terms used throughout the framework:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA). |
| **Concentrate** | A product obtained through physical or chemical separation of uranium from ore. |
| **Equivalent Dose** | As defined in the *Radiation Protection Regulations*; measures radiation exposure to biological tissue. |
| **Excavation Site** | Underground area used to evaluate a potential orebody. |
| **Federal Authority** | Includes federal government bodies, Crown corporations, provincial governments, Indigenous self-governing bodies, and foreign/international entities with environmental assessment responsibilities. *Excludes* Indigenous bands, Export Development Canada, and certain not-for-profit entities. |
| **Hazardous Substance** | Any non-nuclear substance used or produced in licensed operations that may harm human health or the environment. |
| **Jurisdiction** | Entities with legal responsibility for assessing environmental impacts related to uranium mine/mill development, including federal, provincial, Indigenous, and international bodies. |
| **Licensed Activity** | Activities authorized under paragraph 26(e) of the NSCA related to uranium mines or mills. |
| **Licensee** | A person or entity granted a license to carry out a licensed activity. |
| **Mill** | A facility where ore is processed to recover uranium concentrate, including tailings and water treatment systems. |
| **Mine** | Includes both excavation sites and removal sites. |
| **Ore** | A mineral deposit containing uranium in sufficient quantity and quality to make mining economically viable. |
| **Removal Site** | A surface location where uranium is extracted to evaluate a potential orebody. |
| **Waste Management System** | A system for collecting, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of waste generated during operations. |
| **Worker** | Any individual performing work as defined in the license. |
| **Workers’ Representative** | A member of a safety committee, safety representative, collective bargaining agent, or individual worker if none of the above exist. |
| **Workplace** | Any area within a mine or mill where workers may reasonably be present during operations. |

> ⚠️ *Note: "Effective dose" was repealed in 2007 (SOR/2007-208, s.13) and replaced with "equivalent dose" as per Radiation Protection Regulations.*
