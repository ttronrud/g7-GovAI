### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for the duty remission, the following **three conditions must be met**:

1. **Use in Manufacturing Women’s Swimsuits**  
   The imported textile products must be **used exclusively** by Les Collections Shan Inc. in the **manufacture of women’s swimsuits** bearing the **Shan label**.

2. **Design Compatibility and Supplier Matching**  
   For textile products imported to make **co-ordinated beachwear and accessories** (e.g., dresses, handbags, wraps):  
   - The pattern and colour must be **similar or complementary** to those used in the company’s women’s swimsuits.  
   - The products must be made by the **same supplier** as the swimsuit textiles.  
   → This ensures design continuity and brand consistency, preventing the use of unrelated or mismatched materials.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date of importation.  
   → Failure to submit a claim within this timeframe will result in the loss of remission benefits.

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on **November 20, 1997**.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

This regulation serves several key economic and industrial objectives:

- **Support for Canadian Manufacturing**: Encourages domestic production of women’s swimwear and related apparel by reducing input costs.
- **Brand Consistency**: Ensures that coordinated beachwear and accessories maintain visual harmony with the core swimsuit line, preserving brand identity.
- **Supply Chain Stability**: By requiring the same supplier for coordinated products, it promotes reliable and consistent sourcing.
- **Targeted Incentive**: The remission is not general; it is **specifically tied to a single company and product line**, minimizing risk of misuse or overuse.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excludes solid black or white fabrics** from the definition of "textile products" — suggesting that these are not eligible for remission, even if used in swimwear.
- The remission is **not available to other companies** or for other types of apparel.
- The **annual quantity limits** prevent unlimited imports and ensure fiscal responsibility.

---

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is enacted under **section 101 of the Customs Tariff**, which allows the Governor in Council to make remissions of duties in specific cases to promote economic development, protect domestic industries, or support particular manufacturers.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Les Collections Shan Remission Order, 1997* is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally based customs duty exemption designed to support the production and brand consistency of women’s swimwear and coordinated beachwear by Les Collections Shan Inc. It reflects a policy of **industrial support through targeted fiscal incentives**, ensuring that the company can remain competitive while maintaining product quality and design coherence.

It is a practical example of how Canadian trade policy can be used to **strengthen niche domestic manufacturers** in the textile and apparel sector through strategic duty relief, while maintaining fiscal accountability and regulatory oversight.

**Final Note**: This Order is no longer in force as of 2024, as it was issued in 1997 and has likely been superseded by updated regulations or replaced by more modern trade policies. However, it remains a historically significant example of targeted customs remission in Canada.
