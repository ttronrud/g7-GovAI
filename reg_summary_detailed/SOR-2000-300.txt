### **6. Reporting Obligations for Peace Officers and Authorized Entities**

When a **peace officer** or a person acting under their direction transmits a copy of an order or authorization under:

- **Paragraph 487.071(2)(b)** of the *Criminal Code* (related to missing persons or human remains), or  
- **Paragraph 196.22(2)(b)** of the *National Defence Act* (related to military personnel),  

They must transmit the following **information** to the Commissioner:

#### Required Information:
1. **Written confirmation** that:
   - The peace officer has searched the **Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC)** records.
   - The **DNA profile of the convicted offender** is already in the DNA Data Bank (Convicted Offenders Index).
2. **Fingerprints of the offender**, along with the **name of the person who took them** — OR
3. A **written statement** that:
   - Fingerprints could not be taken or were unreasonable to take.
   - The means used to verify the offender’s identity.
   - The name of the person making the statement.

> 🎯 Purpose: To ensure transparency, accountability, and verification of identity before initiating DNA-related procedures.

### **7. Handling Inaccurate or Incomplete Information**

If the information submitted to the Commissioner is found to be **inaccurate or incomplete**, the Commissioner must:

1. **Notify the submitting agency** of the error.
2. **Request correction or supplementation** of the information.
3. **Alternatively**, if the agency fails to correct it, the Commissioner may:
   - **Execute the original order or authorization** under:
     - Subsection 487.071(3) of the *Criminal Code*, or
     - Subsection 196.22(3) of the *National Defence Act*.

> ⚖️ This ensures that legal processes are not stalled due to procedural errors and maintains the integrity of law enforcement actions.

### **8. Consent for Use of DNA Profiles in Specific Indexes**

For a person’s DNA profile to be added to one of the following indexes, they must provide **written consent** via a signed document that includes the following statements:

| Consent Clause | Explanation |
|---------------|-------------|
| The DNA profile and related information will be added to: | Relatives of missing persons index, voluntary donors index, or victims index (as applicable). |
| The DNA profile will be used for: | Criminal identification, finding missing persons, or identifying human remains. |
| The profile will be compared with: | DNA profiles in crime scene index, convicted offenders index, victims index, missing persons index, voluntary donors index, and human remains index. |
| The profile and related information may only be communicated and used: | In accordance with the *DNA Identification Act*. |
| Access to the profile will be removed: | After **five years** from the date of addition (as per Section 8.1 of the Act), unless otherwise extended. |
| Forensic analysis may result in incidental findings: | Including genetic relationships (e.g., familial links). |

> 🔍 This ensures informed consent and limits the potential for misuse or overreach in DNA data use.

### **9. Access Period and Removal of Access (Section 8.1 of the Act)**

- **Prescribed period for access**: **Five years** beginning on the date the DNA profile is added to:
  - Victims index
  - Missing persons index
  - Relatives of missing persons index
  - Voluntary donors index

#### Exceptions to Access Removal:
- If an **investigating authority considered appropriate by the Commissioner** advises the Commissioner that:
  - The matter (e.g., ongoing investigation) justifies continued access.
  - The profile remains relevant to an active investigation.
- Then, access will **not be removed** at the end of the five-year period.
- Instead, access will be **renewed** after **any subsequent five-year period** during which **no such advice is received**.

> 📌 This creates a "living" access mechanism — access is only removed if no further investigation is warranted.

---

### **10. Destruction of DNA Profile Information**

Under **subsection 8.1(5)** of the Act, when access to a DNA profile is removed, the information must be **permanently destroyed**.

#### Definition of "Destroy":
- For **non-electronic information**:
  - Shredding, burning, or other physical destruction.
- For **electronic information**:
  - Deletion, overwriting, or rendering permanently inaccessible (e.g., secure wiping).

> 🔐 This ensures that once access is terminated, the data cannot be retrieved or misused.

> ⚠️ **Repealed Provision**: The original destruction method (e.g., "to destroy" with specific examples) was **repealed by SOR/2018-42, s. 6**, indicating a potential update in data management standards or implementation protocols. However, the current destruction rules remain effective.
