### **Detailed Summary of the St. Catharines Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The *St. Catharines Airport Zoning Regulations* were formally approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6* of the Aeronautics Act**. This regulatory framework establishes specific zoning and elevation restrictions to ensure aviation safety at St. Catharines Airport.

These regulations are officially cited as the **St. Catharines Airport Zoning Regulations** and apply to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several key terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to St. Catharines Airport located in the **Regional Municipality of Niagara** and the **City of St. Catharines**, Province of Ontario.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed reference point used for elevation calculations. It is located **100 meters northwesterly at right angles** from a point **615 meters northeasterly along the runway centerline** from the **southwesterly end of runway 06–24**.  
  - **Assigned elevation**: **95 meters above sea level**.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip. These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during landing and takeoff, preventing obstacles from interfering with flight operations.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (i.e., 95 + 45 = 140 meters above sea level)**, except where this would be less than **9 meters above ground level**—in which case, the surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.

- **Strip**: The designated rectangular area (including runway) used for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Each strip has defined dimensions and is associated with a specific runway.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a **1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal)** until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip.

---

#### **3. Application Scope**
The regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) adjacent to or near the airport, as precisely described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. This includes both private and public properties within the designated boundary.

---

#### **4. Elevation Restrictions (Prohibited Structures)**
No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of such object exceeds any of the following surfaces:

- The **approach surface** of any runway strip;
- The **outer surface**;
- Any **transitional surface**.

This restriction ensures that no physical obstruction—such as trees, hills, towers, or buildings—interferes with aircraft during approach, departure, or landing.

> **Note**: The rules apply to **all structures**, including new constructions and modifications to existing ones.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above-mentioned surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision allows for proactive management of natural features that could pose a hazard to aircraft operations.

---

#### **6. Waste Disposal Prohibitions**
No owner or occupier may use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**. This is a critical measure to prevent bird strikes—common and dangerous aviation hazards.

> Example: Disposal of food scraps, poultry waste, or other organic materials that attract birds is strictly prohibited.

#### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Regulatory Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**
Each approach surface is tailored to the runway and follows a specific geometric design:

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **06 (Runway 06–24)** | Inclined plane at **1:50 slope** rising to a horizontal line **15,000 meters** from the end of the strip. The outer ends are **2,400 meters** from the centerline. The horizontal line is **300 meters above the end of the strip**. |
| **24 (Runway 06–24)** | Inclined plane at **1:50 slope**, diverging at **15% from each side**, rising to intersect the **Canada–United States International Boundary**. |
| **10 (Runway 10–28)** | 1:40 slope, rises to a horizontal line **2,500 meters** from the end, **280 meters from centerline**, **62.5 meters above the strip end**. |
| **28 (Runway 10–28)** | Same as 10: 1:40 slope, 2,500 m from end, 280 m from centerline, 62.5 m above strip end. |
| **01 (Runway 01–19)** | Same as 10 and 28: 1:40 slope, 2,500 m from end, 280 m from centerline, 62.5 m above strip end. |
| **19 (Runway 01–19)** | Same as above. |

> These surfaces are shown on **Sheets 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12** of *St. Catharines Airport Zoning Plan No. 26-047-81-67*, dated March 30, 1984.

##### **B. Outer Surface**
- Located at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (95 m ASL = 140 m ASL)**.
- Where this elevation would be **less than 9 meters above ground**, the surface is **set at 9 meters above ground**.
- Applies uniformly across the entire regulated area.

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any object in the broader airport vicinity.

##### **C. Strips (Runway Areas)**
Each strip is defined by width, length, and position:

| Runway | Width | Length | Description |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **06–24** | 300 meters (150 m each side) | 1,644.08 meters | Central runway; longest strip; primary runway. |
| **10–28** | 60 meters (30 m each side) | 667.10 meters | Shorter, narrower runway; secondary use. |
| **01–19** | 60 meters (30 m each side) | 822.22 meters | Longer than 10–28; used for different flight patterns. |

> All strips are shown on **Sheet 5** of the zoning plan.

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**
- Each transitional surface is a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) extending from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces.
- These surfaces rise until they meet either:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent runway strip.

> These surfaces ensure a smooth, unobstructed transition between the runway area and the outer zone, preventing obstructions in the flight path.

---

#### **8. Boundary of Regulated Land**
The outer boundary of all regulated lands is defined by a detailed **legal description** using survey coordinates and directional bearings. It traces a complex path through several townships and concessions in the **Township of Niagara and Grantham**, passing through key roads (e.g., Grantham Avenue, Carlton Street, Scott Street, Linwell Road, Read Road, Lakeshore Road) and ending at the **Lake Ontario shoreline**.

Key features of the boundary:
- Begins at the **southwesterly corner of Lot 181 in Township of Niagara**.
- Progresses through multiple **concession lines**, road allowances, and municipal boundaries.
- Crosses **municipal boundaries** between Niagara-on-the-Lake and St. Catharines.
- Ends at the **southeasterly corner of Lot 27 Corporation Plan No. 5**, and then proceeds **easterly along Lake Ontario** to the **eastern boundary of Lot 27**.
- Includes specific **azimuths and distances** (e.g., 224°10′36″, 4,800 m) for precision in surveying.

> This boundary ensures that only lands within a clearly defined, safe zone are subject to the elevation and waste restrictions.

#### **9. Purpose and Objectives**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: To prevent aircraft from encountering obstacles during takeoff, landing, or approach.
2. **Flight Path Integrity**: To maintain clear visibility and unobstructed flight paths
