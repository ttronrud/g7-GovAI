The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been repealed:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2012-286, s. 65]" — repeated five times.

### Detailed Summary:

This notation signifies that **a specific section of a regulatory instrument (presumably under the *Regulations of the Ontario Government*) was officially repealed** on the date specified in the statutory order **SOR/2012-286, section 65**.

- **SOR/2012-286** refers to the *Statutory Instrument of 2012, No. 286*, which is a formal document issued by the Government of Ontario to amend or repeal existing regulations.
- **Section 65** of that instrument explicitly identifies the provision being repealed.
- The repetition of the same line five times appears to be a formatting or typographical error — it does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed, nor does it suggest a legislative inconsistency. In official regulatory documents, such redundancy is uncommon and likely stems from a technical or editorial error in the source material.

### Key Implications:

1. **The regulation in question is no longer in force.**
2. Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by that regulation have been removed and are no longer applicable.
3. Legal or administrative entities relying on that regulation must now refer to current, active provisions.
4. The repeal was enacted in **2012**, meaning the regulation was active prior to that date and was formally canceled as of the publication date of SOR/2012-286.

### Conclusion:

The provided text does not describe an active regulation but rather **confirms the repeal of a specific section** (section 65 of SOR/2012-286). Since the regulation is now repealed, **there is no current legal content to summarize**. The only meaningful information is that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework by the Ontario government in 2012.

> ⚠️ Note: Without knowing the original name or subject matter of the repealed regulation (e.g., related to health, safety, environmental standards, etc.), a more detailed summary of its content cannot be provided. To obtain that, one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation before repeal or the explanatory notes in SOR/2012-286.

In short:  
**This entry confirms the repeal of a regulation under SOR/2012-286, section 65 — it is no longer in effect.**
