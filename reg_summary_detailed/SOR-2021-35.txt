Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, interpreted and contextualized for clarity and understanding:

### **Detailed Summary of the Canada Recovery Benefits Regulations (as referenced)**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development**.  
This authority is derived from specific provisions of the **Canada Recovery Benefits Act (CRBA)**:
- **Subsection 9(2)**: Enables the regulation to set rules regarding the eligibility and payment of Canada Recovery Benefits.
- **Subsection 16(2)**: Allows for the establishment of rules governing the calculation and administration of benefits under the Act.
- **Subsection 23(4)**: Provides the power to issue regulations that define the conditions under which benefits are payable, including time limits and eligibility criteria.

Thus, these regulations are a formal administrative instrument designed to implement and clarify the operation of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act during the pandemic-related economic support period.

#### **2. Key Provision: Limit on Number of Two-Week Benefit Periods**
> *"For the purpose of subsection 9(1) of the Act, the maximum number of two-week periods in respect of which a Canada recovery benefit is payable to a person is 27."*

**Meaning and Implications:**
- The Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) is typically paid in **two-week installments** (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).
- A beneficiary can receive the benefit for a **maximum of 27 two-week periods**.
- This translates to a **maximum of 13.5 months** of benefit payments (27 × 2 weeks = 54 weeks = 13.5 months).
- This limit applies to **individuals receiving the Canada Recovery Benefit**, which is a temporary financial support measure for those who lost income due to the pandemic.

**Purpose:**
- To ensure that benefits are **not indefinitely extended**, thereby preventing long-term dependency on government support.
- To provide a **clear and predictable time frame** for beneficiaries to transition back into the workforce or receive other forms of income.
- To allow the government to manage **fiscal responsibility** during a period of economic disruption.

> ⚠️ Note: This provision was **repealed in 2021** (by *S.C. 2021, c. 26, s. 19*).  
> This means that the **27-period limit no longer applies** in current law. The repeal indicates that the government revised its approach to benefit duration, likely to provide more flexibility during the transition period or in response to changing economic conditions.

#### **3. Definition of "Prescribed Income" for Specific Benefit Categories**
> *"For the purposes of subparagraphs 10(1)(g)(iv) and 17(1)(g)(iv) of the Act, the benefit set out in section 9.1 of the Act is prescribed income."*

**Explanation:**
- This provision defines what constitutes **"prescribed income"** in two specific contexts:
  - **Section 10(1)(g)(iv)**: Applies to individuals receiving **Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit** (CRSB).
  - **Section 17(1)(g)(iv)**: Applies to individuals receiving the **Canada Recovery Parental Benefit** (CRPB).
- "Prescribed income" refers to a type of income that is **treated as income for the purpose of determining eligibility or benefit amounts** under the Act.

**Significance:**
- The **Canada Recovery Benefit (section 9.1)** is now recognized as a **form of prescribed income** when calculating other benefits or determining eligibility for income-related programs.
- This means that when assessing whether someone qualifies for another benefit (e.g., due to reduced income or changes in employment status), the Canada Recovery Benefit **may be counted as income**.
- This helps ensure **consistency and fairness** in benefit calculations across different programs.

---

#### **4. Effective Date**
> *"These Regulations come into force on the day on which they are registered."*

**Interpretation:**
- The regulations become effective immediately upon **official publication in the Canada Gazette** (the official journal of the Government of Canada).
- This is standard administrative practice in Canadian legislation — regulations do not require a separate publication date or waiting period.
- The effective date ensures **timely implementation** of the rules, allowing for prompt application in benefit administration.

### **Overall Summary and Context**

These regulations were introduced to **implement key operational rules** under the Canada Recovery Benefits Act, which was enacted in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key takeaways:
- The **27 two-week period cap** was a temporary measure to limit the duration of benefits, but it has since been **repealed** (as of 2021), meaning beneficiaries are now not subject to this time limit.
- The **Canada Recovery Benefit is now classified as prescribed income** in specific benefit contexts, which affects how income is assessed for eligibility and benefit amounts.
- The regulations are **administrative in nature**, providing clarity and consistency in how benefits are delivered and managed.

---

### **Important Note on Current Status**
As of **2021**, the **27-period limit has been repealed**, and the regulations as written are **no longer in force**.  
This reflects a shift in policy to provide **greater flexibility** in benefit delivery during the transition from pandemic-related support to long-term economic recovery.

Therefore, while this regulation was historically significant, it is **no longer applicable** in current Canadian policy.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a key administrative step in the implementation of the Canada Recovery Benefits Act. While it introduced important limitations and definitions, its **repeal in 2021** indicates a move toward more adaptable and responsive benefit frameworks. For current benefit eligibility and duration, reference should be made to **up-to-date regulations and government announcements**.
