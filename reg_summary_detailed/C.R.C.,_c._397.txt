The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of various sections of statutory rules (SOR — Statutory Orders) under the **Supreme Court of Canada's regulatory framework**, specifically indicating that certain provisions have been officially **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by amendments to the regulations.

### Summary:

There is **no active regulation** being described in the text. Instead, the content is a list of **repeal notices** — that is, multiple references to specific sections of prior regulations that have been **officially removed or revoked**.

Each line in the list follows the format:
> [Repealed, SOR/XXXX-XX, s. X]

This means:
- **SOR/XXXX-XX** refers to a specific Statutory Order (a regulatory document issued under a federal statute).
- **s. X** refers to a particular section (or clause) within that order.
- The phrase "[Repealed]" indicates that the section has been **cancelled or replaced** by a subsequent amendment or legislation.

### Key Observations:

1. **Repealed Regulations**:
   - The repeated entries point to the repeal of multiple sections across different Statutory Orders:
     - SOR/89-281 (1989)
     - SOR/93-390 (1993)
     - SOR/93-520 (1993)
     - SOR/2007-131 (2007)
     - SOR/2013-19 (2013)

2. **Common Repeal Source**:
   - The most frequently cited repeal is **SOR/2013-19, s. 6**, which appears **13 times**. This suggests that **Section 6 of the Statutory Order issued in 2013 (SOR/2013-19)** was responsible for repealing multiple prior provisions.

3. **No Active Regulation**:
   - Since all listed sections have been repealed, **no current legal obligation or rule** is in effect from these provisions.
   - The list serves as a historical record of regulatory changes.

4. **Purpose of Repeal**:
   - Repeals typically occur when:
     - A regulation is outdated.
     - A new regulation supersedes it.
     - A provision is found to be inconsistent with current law or policy.
     - It causes confusion or duplication.

### Example Interpretation:

For instance:
> [Repealed, SOR/93-390, s. 2]  
→ Section 2 of the Statutory Order issued in 1993 (SOR/93-390) has been repealed, likely by a later amendment (e.g., SOR/2013-19 or another order).

Similarly:
> [Repealed, SOR/2013-19, s. 6]  
→ Section 6 of the 2013 Statutory Order repealed several prior sections, including those from SOR/89-281, SOR/93-390, and others.

### Conclusion:

✅ **This is not a summary of an active regulation**, but rather a **list of repealed provisions**.  
✅ The regulation itself **does not exist** in current form — all referenced sections have been **officially removed**.  
✅ The most significant repeal action appears to be **SOR/2013-19, s. 6**, which repealed multiple older sections across various years.  
✅ This list is useful for legal researchers or policy analysts to understand the **evolution and removal of outdated rules**.
