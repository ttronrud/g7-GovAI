**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order**

---

### **Background and Rationale**

This regulatory order was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, under **subsection 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* (R.S.C., 1970, c. R-10).

The primary justification for the Order stems from a report under **section 56** of the same Act, which indicates that the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund** is currently **substantially in excess** of the amount required to adequately cover projected future pension payments. This surplus suggests that the fund has sufficient financial resources to support benefit increases without compromising long-term sustainability.

Despite this surplus, the Order reflects a decision to enhance pension benefits for RCMP dependants—specifically widows and survivors—through targeted adjustments in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 plan years.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### 1. **Increase in Widow’s Pensions (Current and Prospective)**
- **Benefit Adjustment**: Pensions paid to current and prospective widows of RCMP members are to be increased by **1.2%**.
- **Effective Dates**: The increase takes effect on **April 1** of each of the following plan years:
  - 2014
  - 2015
  - 2016
- **Scope**: Applies to both existing widows and those who become widows in the future (i.e., prospective widows).

> *Purpose*: To provide financial support and stability to surviving spouses of RCMP members, ensuring their pension income keeps pace with inflation and economic conditions.

#### 2. **Increase in Lump Sum Benefits on Death of a Member**
- **Benefit Adjustment**: The lump sum benefit payable upon the death of an RCMP member is to be increased by **1.2%**.
- **Effective Dates**: Also effective on **April 1** of each of:
  - 2014
  - 2015
  - 2016
- **Scope**: Applies to all members who die during these plan years, with the lump sum paid to the designated beneficiary (typically the spouse or dependant).

> *Purpose*: To provide a one-time financial boost to dependants in the event of a member’s death, helping to offset the financial shock of loss.

#### 3. **Residual Amounts Payable to a Widow on Death of Member (Deemed Contribution Increases)**

This provision is more complex and introduces a **non-interest-bearing, deemed increase** in the member’s contributions, which directly affects the residual benefit paid to the widow after the death of the member.

- **Residual Benefit Calculation**:
  - The residual amount (the portion of the pension paid to a widow after the member’s death) is recalculated using a **deemed increase in the member’s contributions**.
  - This deemed increase is **not** accompanied by interest on the contributions—only the base contribution amount is adjusted.

- **Deemed Increase Rates by Plan Year**:
  | Plan Year | Deemed Increase in Contributions |
  |----------|----------------------------------|
  | 2015     | 1,240%                          |
  | 2016     | 1,256%                          |
  | 2017     | 1,272%                          |

> *Example*: If a member had a base contribution of $10,000, and the widow dies in the 2015 plan year, the contribution base is effectively increased to $12,400 (10,000 × 12.4), even though no actual interest or cash contribution was made. This results in a significantly larger residual benefit.

> *Purpose*: To ensure that widows receive a substantial and growing residual payment, reflecting the surplus in the pension fund. The increasing percentage (from 1,240% to 1,272%) over time suggests a progressive enhancement designed to grow the benefit as the plan years progress.

> *Note*: The use of such a high percentage (e.g., 1,240%) indicates a **non-standard, exceptional adjustment**—likely intended to compensate for long-term underfunding or to reflect a policy decision to strengthen survivor benefits in light of the fund’s surplus.

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into effect on **April 1, 2014**.
- The increases apply annually on April 1 of the specified plan years (2014, 2015, and 2016), with the residual benefit adjustments tied to the year of the widow’s death (2015, 2016, and 2017).

---

### **Legal Authority and Process**

- The Order is made under **subsection 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act*, which authorizes the Governor General in Council to increase pension benefits when recommended by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.
- The decision is based on a formal report under **section 56**, which assesses the financial health of the pension fund and confirms that it is in excess of the required level for future obligations.

---

### **Key Observations and Implications**

1. **Surplus-Based Benefit Enhancement**:
   - The Order leverages the fund’s surplus to improve dependant benefits, demonstrating a policy of using available financial strength to support service members’ families.

2. **Progressive Benefit Increases**:
   - The increasing deemed contribution percentages (1,240% → 1,256% → 1,272%) suggest a phased approach to benefit growth, possibly reflecting inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, or long-term financial planning.

3. **No Interest on Deemed Contributions**:
   - The absence of interest on the deemed contributions is notable. It means the increase is purely a base-level adjustment, not a return on investment. This may be intentional to avoid overvaluing the fund or to maintain transparency in the calculation.

4. **Focus on Survivor Benefits**:
   - The Order prioritizes dependants, especially widows, indicating a strong commitment to family support within the RCMP pension structure.

5. **Temporal Scope**:
   - The adjustments are limited to the 2014–2016 plan years, with the residual benefit adjustments extending into 2017. This suggests a short-term, targeted intervention rather than a permanent structural change.

### **Conclusion**

This Order represents a significant enhancement to the pension benefits available to widows and dependants of Royal Canadian Mounted Police members. By increasing pensions and lump sums by 1.2% annually and introducing a substantial, non-interest-bearing deemed increase in contributions (ranging from 1,240% to 1,272%), the government ensures that surviving spouses receive greater financial security. The decision is grounded in a financial assessment confirming the fund’s surplus and is implemented through a clear, time-bound structure.

It reflects both a pragmatic use of available resources and a compassionate policy aimed at supporting the families of public servants who serve with dedication and sacrifice.
