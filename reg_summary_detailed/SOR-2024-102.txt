**Regulation Title:**  
Order Exempting Kapisikama Lake, Located in Quebec, from the Application of Section 23 of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 24(1)a** of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNWA), which empowers the Governor in Council (the federal government) to exempt certain waters from the application of specific provisions of the Act, upon recommendation by the Minister of Transport and where the exemption is deemed to be in the public interest.

**Background and Rationale:**  
- The Minister of Transport received an application requesting an exemption for **Kapisikama Lake**, located in the province of **Quebec**.  
- The request was based on the need to allow specific activities—such as land use, development, or environmental management—on or near the lake that would otherwise be restricted under **Section 23 of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act**.  
- Section 23 of the CNWA generally applies to navigable waters and requires that any activity affecting such waters (e.g., construction, dredging, or alteration) must be authorized by the federal government.  
- The Governor in Council has reviewed the application and is **satisfied that granting the exemption is in the public interest**. This determination considers factors such as environmental protection, economic development, Indigenous rights, community needs, and the overall benefit to public welfare.

**Key Provisions of the Order:**  
1. **Exemption Scope:**  
   - **Kapisikama Lake** is specifically exempted from the application of **Section 23 of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act**.  
   - The lake's location and precise boundaries are defined in a **table attached to the regulation**, which provides detailed geographic and administrative information (e.g., municipality, region, coordinates, or other descriptors).

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   - The exemption is authorized under **subsection 24(1)a** of the CNWA.  
   - This provision allows the federal government to waive the requirements of Section 23 when the exemption serves the public interest and is supported by appropriate justification.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   - The Order comes into force on the **day it is published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.  
   - The regulation notes that it **came into force on June 5, 2024**, which is the date of publication in the official government gazette.

4. **Applicability:**  
   - The exemption applies only to **Kapisikama Lake** as described in the attached table.  
   - It does not extend to other lakes, rivers, or waters within Quebec or elsewhere.  
   - It also does not relieve the lake from other federal, provincial, or environmental regulations that may apply independently (e.g., environmental assessment requirements, Indigenous consultation obligations, or provincial land-use laws).

**Public Interest Justification:**  
The Governor in Council has determined that the exemption will:  
- Support sustainable development or land-use planning in the area;  
- Prevent unnecessary regulatory burdens on local communities or stakeholders;  
- Protect the integrity of the lake’s ecosystem in a way that balances development with conservation;  
- Promote regional economic activity (e.g., tourism, recreation, or infrastructure projects) without compromising navigability or environmental standards.

**Significance and Implications:**  
- This exemption reflects a flexible interpretation of the CNWA, allowing for localized decisions based on regional needs.  
- It underscores the federal government’s role in balancing navigability regulations with broader public interest considerations.  
- It may serve as a precedent for future exemptions in similar geographic or socio-economic contexts.

**Note on Legal Framework:**  
- The CNWA is a federal law that governs navigable waters in Canada and regulates activities that may affect them.  
- The exemption is not a blanket removal of all federal oversight but rather a specific, targeted relief under a defined legal provision.  
- The regulation remains subject to review and may be revoked or modified if new information or public interest concerns arise.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order formally removes the application of Section 23 of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* to Kapisikama Lake in Quebec, enabling certain activities that would otherwise require federal approval. It is grounded in a public interest determination and issued under the authority of the federal government. The exemption is limited in scope, geographically specific, and effective from June 5, 2024, upon publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*. It represents a practical and context-sensitive application of federal environmental and navigable waters legislation.
