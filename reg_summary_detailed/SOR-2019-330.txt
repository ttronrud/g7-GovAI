**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Rayed Bean (Villosa fabalis) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation, formally known as the *Critical Habitat of the Rayed Bean (Villosa fabalis) Order*, is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is the primary Canadian federal legislation designed to prevent species from becoming extinct and to promote their recovery.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The Order is made pursuant to **subsection 58(4)** and **58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act (S.C. 2002, c. 29)*. These provisions empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and protect critical habitat for species listed as endangered under SARA.

- **Species at Risk**:  
  The *Rayed Bean* (*Villosa fabalis*) is a species of marine bivalve mollusk (a type of clam) that is classified as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation action.

**2. Basis for Designation**

The Order is grounded in the following key facts:

- **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**:  
  A formal recovery strategy for the Rayed Bean has been developed and is publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*. This strategy includes a detailed assessment of the specific environmental conditions and geographic areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — these areas are defined as **critical habitat**.

- **Inclusion in Public Registry**:  
  The critical habitat identified in the recovery strategy has already been formally included in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, ensuring transparency and public access to the information.

- **Exclusion from Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2)b)**:  
  A key legal requirement under SARA is that critical habitat must not be located in areas that are specifically excluded by **subsection 58(2)b** of the Act. This provision protects certain areas (such as those designated as "prohibited" for development or activities that could harm species) from being designated as critical habitat.  
  Importantly, **no portion of the critical habitat specified in this Order falls within any area referred to in subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This means the designated habitat is not in a location where federal activities are legally restricted or where protection is already in place due to other environmental or land-use considerations.

**3. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- **Designation of Critical Habitat**:  
  The Order formally identifies and designates specific geographic areas as the **critical habitat** of the Rayed Bean (*Villosa fabalis*). These areas are essential for the species’ survival, including conditions such as substrate type, water temperature, salinity, depth, and other ecological factors necessary for reproduction, growth, and survival.

- **Legal Protection**:  
  Once designated, the critical habitat is legally protected under SARA. This means that **no federal government activity** (including development, mining, or infrastructure projects) may occur in or adversely affect the critical habitat without prior approval from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. This protection applies to both current and future federal actions.

- **Application of Subsection 58(1)**:  
  Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Rayed Bean. This means that the designated areas are subject to the full suite of regulatory protections and obligations under the Act, including the requirement that federal projects avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects on the habitat.

**4. Implementation and Enforcement**

- **Effective Date**:  
  The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** in the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal laws). This ensures legal enforceability upon formal notification.

- **Enforcement Mechanism**:  
  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for enforcing the Order. Any federal project or activity that would impact the designated critical habitat must undergo a **review process** to determine whether it would cause significant harm. If so, the project must be modified or approved with appropriate mitigation measures.

**5. Significance and Implications**

- **Conservation and Recovery**:  
  By formally designating critical habitat, this Order provides a clear, legally binding framework to support the recovery of the Rayed Bean, which is a species of ecological and biological importance in marine ecosystems.

- **Transparency and Public Access**:  
  The inclusion of the critical habitat in the *Species at Risk Public Registry* ensures that the public, scientists, Indigenous communities, and stakeholders can access and understand the areas that require protection.

- **Alignment with Recovery Strategy**:  
  The Order reflects the scientific findings and recommendations from the recovery strategy, ensuring that conservation efforts are based on sound ecological data.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Rayed Bean (Villosa fabalis) Order* is a legally binding instrument that formally protects the essential environmental conditions required for the survival of an endangered marine species. It is grounded in scientific assessment, complies with all legal requirements under SARA, and serves as a critical step in the recovery of the Rayed Bean. By designating and protecting its critical habitat, the federal government is fulfilling its legal and environmental responsibilities to conserve biodiversity and prevent extinction.
