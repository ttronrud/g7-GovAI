**Regulatory Summary: Designation and Personnel Authority for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women**

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
The regulation is issued under the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), specifically:

- **Subsection 7(9)** of the FAA defines "public service" to include entities that are part of the federal government’s public service structure.  
- **Section 7** of the FAA provides the framework for the designation of bodies as part of the public service, which in turn enables them to be subject to the same administrative and personnel rules as other public service institutions.

**2. Designation of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women as Part of the Public Service**  
The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Honourable Judy Erola) formally designates the **Advisory Council on the Status of Women (ACSW)** as a **portion of the public service of Canada**.  

This designation means that:
- The ACSW is now legally recognized as a component of the federal public service.
- It is subject to the governance, accountability, and administrative standards that apply to public service institutions under the Financial Administration Act.
- This recognition enhances the council’s legitimacy and integration into the broader federal administrative framework.

**3. Authorization of Treasury Board Powers**  
Pursuant to **subsection 7(3)** of the Financial Administration Act, the regulation authorizes the **President of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women** to:
- Exercise and perform **all the powers and functions of the Treasury Board** in relation to **personnel management** of the council.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Hiring, promoting, and transferring staff members;
- Setting salaries and compensation;
- Managing performance evaluations;
- Determining terms and conditions of employment;
- Approving leave and disciplinary actions;
- Overseeing human resources policies and practices.

**4. Conditions and Oversight**  
The powers granted to the President are:
- Subject to **directions from the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet or relevant ministerial authority).
- To be exercised in a manner consistent with the **public service values**, **federal employment policies**, and **the overall objectives of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women**.
- This ensures that while the President has significant personnel authority, such authority is not absolute and remains accountable to higher-level government oversight.

**5. Purpose and Implications**  
This regulation serves several key purposes:
- It strengthens the institutional capacity of the ACSW by integrating it fully into the federal public service structure.
- It provides the council with the necessary personnel management authority to operate effectively and efficiently, enabling it to fulfill its mandate of advising the government on gender equality and women’s issues.
- It ensures consistency in human resources practices with those of other federal agencies, promoting transparency, equity, and accountability.

**6. Key Takeaway**  
This regulation formally recognizes the Advisory Council on the Status of Women as a public service entity and grants its President the full personnel management powers of the Treasury Board—subject to federal oversight. This move enhances the council’s operational autonomy and effectiveness while maintaining accountability to the federal government.

**In summary:**  
The regulation designates the Advisory Council on the Status of Women as part of Canada’s public service and authorizes its President to manage personnel matters as if they were within the Treasury Board’s authority—ensuring the council can function effectively and in alignment with federal public service standards.
