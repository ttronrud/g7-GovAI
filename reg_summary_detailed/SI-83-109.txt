Certainly. Below is a detailed and accurate summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulatory Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1983-432 and Designation of Acting Ministers under the Privacy Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Context**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Privacy Act* (Canada), specifically pursuant to **section 3**, which defines the term *"Minister"* for the purposes of the Act. The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) revokes an earlier Order in Council, **P.C. 1983-432**, dated 17 February 1983, and replaces it with a new designation of individuals who will act as the "Minister" for various functions under the Act.

The purpose of this regulation is to clarify and update the designation of responsible government officials who serve as the "Minister" for the purposes of the *Privacy Act*, particularly in relation to the oversight and enforcement of privacy provisions involving the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by federal institutions.

**2. Revocation of Previous Order (P.C. 1983-432)**  
The regulation formally revokes **Order in Council P.C. 1983-432**, which had previously designated certain individuals as acting Ministers under the Privacy Act. This revocation indicates a change in administrative structure or policy, likely to reflect current government responsibilities, ministerial appointments, or a need for clearer accountability in privacy governance.

**3. New Designations of Acting Ministers**  
The new regulation designates two individuals to act as the "Minister" for different purposes under the *Privacy Act*, based on the specific provisions referenced:

**A. Minister of Justice – Designated for Specific Purposes**  
The **Minister of Justice** is designated to act as the Minister for the following specific provisions of the *Privacy Act*:  
- **Paragraph (b) of the definition head in section 3, subsection 12(3)**  
- **Paragraphs 77(1)(a), (d), (g), and (l)** of the Act  
- **Subsection 77(2)** of the Act  

These provisions relate to:  
- The definition of "Minister" in the context of the Act’s scope and applicability.  
- The authority of the Minister to issue directives, orders, or instructions related to the protection of personal information.  
- Oversight and enforcement of privacy rules, particularly in relation to the use of personal information by federal departments and agencies.  

Importantly, the Minister of Justice is designated to act in these specific areas, suggesting that the Minister of Justice has a central role in privacy policy, particularly in areas involving legal and regulatory frameworks, such as compliance with privacy laws, legal challenges, or administrative oversight.

**B. President of the Treasury Board – Designated for All Other Purposes**  
The **President of the Treasury Board** is designated to act as the Minister for **all other purposes** of the *Privacy Act* not specifically assigned to the Minister of Justice.  

This includes:  
- General administrative oversight of privacy practices across federal institutions.  
- Implementation of privacy policies and procedures.  
- Coordination of privacy-related activities and reporting.  
- Ensuring compliance with privacy obligations in day-to-day operations of government departments.  

The President of the Treasury Board is a senior figure in federal administration, responsible for managing the operations of the federal government, including budgeting, policy implementation, and interdepartmental coordination. This designation reflects the role of the Treasury Board in operational governance and administrative accountability.

**4. Significance and Implications**  
- **Clearer Accountability**: The regulation provides a clear, legally binding structure for identifying who is responsible for different aspects of privacy governance under the Act.  
- **Functional Specialization**: By assigning specific responsibilities to the Minister of Justice and the President of the Treasury Board, the government ensures that legal and policy matters are handled by the appropriate expert.  
- **Administrative Efficiency**: The designation streamlines the enforcement and oversight of privacy rules, reducing ambiguity in who is responsible for specific functions.  
- **Evolution of Privacy Governance**: This update reflects the evolving role of privacy in federal administration and the need for tailored ministerial oversight in different domains.

---

**5. Legal Basis and Effectiveness**  
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 3 of the Privacy Act**, which defines the term "Minister" and allows for the designation of individuals to act in that capacity.  
- It is effective from the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette*, Part II, and supersedes the prior Order in Council (P.C. 1983-432).  
- The designation is binding and applies to all federal departments and agencies subject to the Privacy Act.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation establishes a modern, functional framework for ministerial oversight under the *Privacy Act*. By designating the Minister of Justice for key legal and policy-related responsibilities and the President of the Treasury Board for general administrative and operational oversight, the government ensures that privacy protections are effectively implemented and enforced across federal institutions. It represents a key administrative step in strengthening the governance and accountability of personal information handling in Canada.
