**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Medical High Technology International Inc. Shares Acquisition Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically:

- **Section 91(6)**: Grants the Governor in Council (the federal government's executive authority) the power to approve transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of shares in Canadian corporations, particularly when such transactions are deemed to serve public interest or national policy objectives.
- **Paragraph 91(1)(b)**: Authorizes the Governor in Council to make orders for the acquisition or disposal of shares in a corporation, provided that the transaction is approved by the Minister of State (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs) and the Treasury Board.

This Order is therefore legally grounded in federal financial administration powers, allowing for the acquisition of foreign company shares under specific conditions.

**6. Implications and Context:**

- **Foreign Investment**: This is a cross-border transaction involving a Canadian corporation acquiring equity in a U.S. company, which may have strategic, technological, or commercial significance.
- **Privatization or Strategic Investment**: Given the involvement of the Minister of State for Privatization, the transaction may be part of a broader government initiative to promote private-sector innovation or to strengthen Canada’s presence in medical technology.
- **Limited Scale**: The cap of $250,000 suggests a small-scale, targeted investment rather than a large-scale takeover or full acquisition.
- **No Public Benefit Mandate**: The Order does not require the shares to be used for public service or to generate public returns; it is a private corporate action authorized under administrative provisions.

**7. Limitations and Exclusions:**

- The Order does **not** authorize any further acquisitions beyond the specified value or timeframe.
- It does **not** provide for the sale, transfer, or disposal of the shares unless explicitly permitted by subsequent orders.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding administrative order that authorizes a limited foreign share acquisition by a Canadian corporation. It reflects a government-sanctioned strategic move to support private-sector growth in the medical technology field, with clear parameters on value, timing, and ownership. The process underscores the federal government’s role in regulating and facilitating strategic investments—particularly those involving foreign entities—while maintaining oversight through established administrative channels.

The Order remains valid and enforceable until revoked or superseded by a subsequent directive, and it serves as a foundational document for any future financial or regulatory analysis related to Theratronics International Limited’s activities in the medical technology sector.
