**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Title of the Regulation**  
*Order Declaring that the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations Do Not Apply in Yukon*

---

### **Background and Context**

1. **Proposal and Public Comment Period**  
   On June 28, 2014, the Minister of the Environment published a *proposed order* in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the *Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations* (the "Wastewater Regulations") would not apply in the Yukon Territory. This proposal was made under the authority of the *Fisheries Act* and included an annexed draft of the order. The public was given a formal opportunity to submit written comments on the proposed regulation.

2. **Equivalency Agreement**  
   On October 29, 2014, the Minister of the Environment and the Government of Yukon entered into an *equivalency agreement* under **section 4.1a of the Fisheries Act**. This agreement established that Yukon’s existing environmental laws — specifically:  
   - The *Waters Act* (S.Y. 2003, c. 19; 2007, c. 6)  
   - The *Waters Regulation* (Yukon O.I.C. 2003/58)  
   — contain provisions that are **functionally equivalent** in effect to the provisions of the *Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations* (SOR/2012-139, made under section 36(5) of the Fisheries Act).

   This means that, despite the federal Wastewater Regulations being in force nationally, Yukon’s own provincial/territorial laws provide a comparable level of environmental protection and regulatory oversight for wastewater discharges.

### **Legal Authority**

- The Order is made under **subsection 4.2(1)a of the Fisheries Act** (R.S., c. F-14), which allows the Governor General in Council to declare that certain federal regulations do not apply in a specific jurisdiction when equivalent provincial or territorial laws exist.
- The declaration is based on the **equivalency agreement** between federal and Yukon authorities, confirming that Yukon’s existing laws provide equivalent protection to the federal Wastewater Regulations.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Non-Application of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations**  
   The *Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations* (SOR/2012-139) **do not apply** in Yukon with respect to any wastewater system that:
   - Would otherwise have been subject to those regulations, and  
   - Is instead governed by the *Waters Act* and the *Waters Regulation*.

2. **Definition of Key Terms**  
   For the purposes of this Order:
   - **Effluent**: As defined in *section 1* of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations.
   - **Final discharge point**: As defined in *section 1* of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations.
   - **Wastewater system**: As defined in *section 1* of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations.  
   → These definitions are retained to ensure consistency with federal standards when assessing compliance.

3. **Exemption from Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act**  
   Subsection **36(3)** of the *Fisheries Act* (which generally prohibits the discharge of effluent into waters that could harm fish or aquatic ecosystems) **does not apply** to any effluent discharged from the final discharge point of a wastewater system in Yukon if:
   - That effluent would otherwise have been regulated under the federal Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations.  
   → This exemption is granted because Yukon’s own laws already regulate such discharges, and the federal prohibition is deemed unnecessary or redundant.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

- The Order ensures that **wastewater discharges in Yukon are regulated under Yukon’s own environmental legislation**, which is considered to provide **equivalent protection** to the federal Wastewater Regulations.
- It avoids **duplicative or inconsistent regulation** by recognizing Yukon’s legal framework as sufficient and appropriate for managing wastewater impacts on aquatic environments.
- It supports **local governance and jurisdictional autonomy**, allowing Yukon to manage its water resources through its own legal and administrative systems.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette (i.e., the date of official publication).

---

### **Legal and Environmental Significance**

- This is a **jurisdictional exemption** under federal environmental law, based on a formal equivalency determination.
- It reflects a **principle of regulatory harmonization** — where a federal regulation does not apply in a jurisdiction where equivalent local laws exist.
- It strengthens the **cooperative relationship** between the federal government and Yukon in environmental management.
- It ensures that wastewater discharges in Yukon remain subject to meaningful environmental oversight, even without direct application of federal rules.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order formally removes the application of the federal *Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations* in Yukon, replacing them with Yukon’s own *Waters Act* and *Waters Regulation*. It is grounded in a legally binding equivalency agreement and is authorized under the *Fisheries Act*. The exemption applies to all wastewater systems in Yukon that fall under Yukon’s jurisdiction and are subject to its environmental laws, and it includes a key exemption from the federal prohibition on effluent discharge under section 36(3). The Order is effective upon registration and serves to promote effective, localized, and consistent environmental protection in the Yukon Territory.

✅ **Key Takeaway**:  
*Yukon is exempt from the federal Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations because its own laws provide equivalent environmental protection — a decision based on formal agreement and legal equivalence under the Fisheries Act.*
