**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific Northern Resident Population Order*

### **Date of Issuance:**  
December 11, 2018  
**Date of Coming Into Force:** December 13, 2018  
*(Note: The Order comes into force on the day the Southern Resident Population Order comes into force, or on the day of registration if it is registered later.)*

---

### **Legal Basis:**
This regulation is made under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*** (S.C. 2002, c. 29; amended by S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60).  

Specifically, it is issued pursuant to:
- **Section 58(4):** Authority to designate critical habitat for a listed species.
- **Section 58(5):** Requirement to ensure that the designation of critical habitat is based on a recovery strategy and does not contravene other legal obligations.

---

### **Species Involved:**
- **Killer Whale (Orcinus orca)** – specifically the **Northeast Pacific Northern Resident Population**.
- This population is legally recognized as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA**.

---

### **Background and Justification:**

1. **Recovery Strategy in Place:**  
   The Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) jointly developed and finalized a **recovery strategy** for the Northern Resident Killer Whale population. This strategy includes a scientifically based identification of the **critical habitat** required for the species’ survival and recovery.

2. **Critical Habitat in Public Registry:**  
   The identified critical habitat has been formally published and included in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the information.

3. **No Conflict with Subsection 58(2)b of SARA:**  
   The regulation explicitly confirms that **no portion of the designated critical habitat** falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA. This provision prohibits the designation of critical habitat in areas that are "protected under a land claims agreement" or where such protection is otherwise legally established. The absence of such overlap is a key legal safeguard.

4. **Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards:**  
   The Ministers recognize that the proposed critical habitat may fall within areas governed by **wildlife management boards** established under **land claims agreements**.  
   Therefore, pursuant to **subsection 58(8)** of SARA, they have **consulted with relevant wildlife management boards** to ensure that their interests and responsibilities are respected and that any potential impacts are addressed.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**
To **officially designate and legally define** the **critical habitat** of the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific Northern Resident Population.  

This designation serves several key purposes:
- To provide legal protection to areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery.
- To inform land-use planning, development decisions, and environmental assessments.
- To support the implementation of the recovery strategy by ensuring that activities that could degrade or destroy critical habitat are avoided or mitigated.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Designation of Critical Habitat:**  
   The Order formally identifies specific geographic areas (not detailed in this summary) that are essential for the survival and recovery of the Northern Resident Killer Whale population. These areas are based on scientific data from the recovery strategy and are protected under SARA.

2. **Legal Effect:**  
   Once designated, the critical habitat is **legally protected** under SARA. Any activity that could destroy or significantly degrade this habitat requires:
   - A **protection or mitigation plan**,
   - **Environmental assessment** (if applicable),
   - Or **prior approval** from the relevant federal minister.

3. **Timing of Enforcement:**  
   - The Order comes into force **on the same day** as the *Critical Habitat of the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Northeast Pacific Southern Resident Population Order* (which was also issued in 2018).  
   - If the Order is registered later than that date, it will come into force on the **date of registration**.

---

### **Significance and Implications:**

- This regulation is a **key step in the conservation of one of the most iconic and ecologically significant marine mammals** in Canada.
- It reflects a commitment to **science-based conservation**, with habitat protection grounded in ecological research.
- It demonstrates **inter-agency cooperation** between Parks Canada (Minister of the Environment) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (MFDO).
- It also underscores **respect for Indigenous rights and land claims**, through formal consultation with wildlife management boards.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This Order legally establishes and protects the critical habitat of the **Northeast Pacific Northern Resident Killer Whale population** under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is grounded in scientific evidence, complies with all legal requirements, and includes necessary consultation with Indigenous wildlife management bodies. By doing so, it contributes directly to the long-term recovery and survival of this threatened species, while respecting existing land-use and Indigenous governance arrangements.
