**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Prohibiting the Issuance of Interests at Lapierre House Historic Site in the Yukon Territory

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to subsection 10(1) of the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* (R.S., c. 36 (2nd Supp.)).

**Purpose of the Order:**  
To prohibit the issuance of any form of land interest (such as leases, grants, or other rights to use or possess land) on certain frontier lands that have been designated as a **Historic Site**. The primary rationale is to preserve the historical and cultural significance of the area by preventing development or land use activities that could compromise its integrity.

**Scope of the Prohibition:**  
The Order specifically prohibits the issuance of any "interests" (legal rights or claims to land) in respect of the following land parcel:

- **Lot 1004**, located in **Quad 116P/06**, within the Yukon Territory.  
- This lot is identified on a **plan of survey of record number 79766**, which is part of the Canada Lands Surveys Records held in Ottawa.  
- A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Yukon Territory Land Registration District in Whitehorse under reference number **97-106**.

**Geographic and Administrative Context:**  
The site is recognized as a **Historic Site**, which implies it holds significant historical value—likely related to early Canadian exploration, Indigenous history, or frontier settlement. The designation under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* reflects a broader regulatory approach to protecting heritage sites from exploitation or development, particularly in the context of resource exploration or land allocation.

**Effective Date:**  
The Order comes into force on **March 19, 1998**.

**Key Legal and Policy Implications:**  
1. **Preservation of Heritage:** The regulation serves as a protective measure to ensure that the Lapierre House Historic Site remains intact and accessible for historical, educational, and cultural purposes.  
2. **Restriction on Land Use:** No individual, corporation, or entity may acquire, lease, or otherwise obtain any legal interest (e.g., mineral rights, surface rights, or development rights) in the specified lot.  
3. **Exclusivity of Use:** The prohibition applies to all forms of "interests," which may include both surface and subsurface rights, aligning with the intent to prevent any commercial or developmental activity that could impact the site’s historical character.  
4. **Administrative Enforcement:** The Land Titles Office in Whitehorse is responsible for maintaining records of the restriction, ensuring transparency and legal accountability.  
5. **Legal Authority:** The use of the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to protect a historic site reflects a cross-sectoral application of legislation—originally focused on petroleum resources—extended to heritage conservation.

**Conclusion:**  
This Order is a legally binding directive that protects a specific parcel of land in the Yukon Territory by preventing any issuance of land interests. It underscores the importance of balancing resource development with heritage preservation, particularly in remote and historically significant regions. By designating the Lot 1004 area as a protected historic site, the Canadian government ensures that this land will remain preserved for future generations, free from commercial exploitation or unauthorized land use.

**Note:** This Order is part of a broader framework of heritage protection in Canada, where historic sites are often safeguarded under both federal and territorial laws, even when such protections are invoked through resource-related statutes.
