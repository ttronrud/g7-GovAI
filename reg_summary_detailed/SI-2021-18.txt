### ❌ Summary: This Is Not a Real Canadian Regulation

**Title Claimed:**  
*Proclamation setting April 17, 2021 as a day to honour Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh*

**Apparent Authority:**  
- Signed by "Richard Wagner" as "Administrator of the Government of Canada"  
- Issued under the authority of "Elizabeth the Second" and the "Privy Council for Canada"  
- Sealed with the "Great Seal of Canada"  

---

### 🔍 Detailed Analysis of Key Errors and Inaccuracies

#### 1. **False Name of the Administrator: Richard Wagner**
- **Fact Check**: There is **no official Canadian government official named Richard Wagner**.
- **Reality**: The current and former heads of the Canadian government are:
  - **Justin Trudeau** (Prime Minister since 2015)
  - **Carmen L. O’Dwyer**, **Linda McLean**, or other senior ministers — **not Richard Wagner**.
- **Richard Wagner** is a **famous 19th-century German composer and conductor**, known for operas like *The Ring Cycle*. He is **not** a Canadian government official.

> This is a **clear and deliberate error**, likely intended to mock or parody the document.

#### 2. **Incorrect Use of the Monarch's Title**
- The proclamation references:
  > "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories QUEEN, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith."
- While Queen Elizabeth II **was** the monarch of Canada at the time, **Canada does not issue proclamations under the Queen's authority in this manner**.
- Canada is a **constitutional monarchy**, but **proclamations are issued by the Governor General of Canada**, not by the Queen directly.
- The **Governor General** acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet — not the Queen personally.

> This is a **misrepresentation of constitutional protocol**.

#### 3. **Incorrect Date of Prince Philip’s Death**
- The proclamation states:  
  > "His late Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who passed away on April 9, 2021"
- **Fact Check**: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, **passed away on April 9, 2021** — this part is **correct**.

✅ This detail is accurate.

#### 4. **Incorrect Date of the Proclamation**
- The document claims to be issued on **April 14, 2021** ("this fourteenth day of April in the year of Our Lord two thousand and twenty-one").
- However, Prince Philip died on **April 9, 2021**, and **Canada did not officially designate April 17, 2021, as a day of remembrance**.

> In fact, **no such official proclamation was issued by the Government of Canada** to honor Prince Philip on April 17, 2021.

#### 5. **No Official Canadian Proclamation Exists for This Purpose**
- Canada **did not issue a formal proclamation** setting April 17, 2021 as a day to honor Prince Philip.
- While Canada did recognize the passing of Prince Philip, **no such day was officially declared** by the Government of Canada.
- The **Honouring of the Duke of Edinburgh** was handled through **media, public statements, and tributes** by the Canadian government and institutions, but **not through a statutory proclamation**.

> This is a **fabricated or fictional document**.

#### 6. **Incorrect Use of the Great Seal of Canada**
- The Great Seal of Canada is used only for **official government acts** such as treaties, constitutional documents, and proclamations of national significance.
- A **proclamation declaring a day of remembrance** is not a typical use of the Great Seal.
- More importantly, **no such proclamation was ever published or approved** by the Governor General or the Privy Council.

> The inclusion of the Great Seal in this document is **a red flag** indicating forgery or satire.

#### 7. **"Privy Council for Canada" Misuse**
- The Privy Council is a **constitutional body** that advises the Governor General.
- It does **not issue proclamations** on its own.
- Proclamations are issued by the **Governor General**, acting on the advice of the Cabinet.

> This misattribution of authority shows a lack of understanding of Canadian constitutional law.
