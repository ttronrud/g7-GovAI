**Detailed Summary of the *First Nations Oil and Gas Environmental Assessment Regulations* (S.C. 2005, c. 48)**

---

### **Overview**

The *First Nations Oil and Gas Environmental Assessment Regulations* (the "Regulations") were enacted under the **First Nations Oil and Gas and Moneys Management Act** (the "Act") to establish a structured, transparent, and culturally sensitive environmental assessment (EA) process for oil and gas projects proposed by or on behalf of First Nations. These regulations define the types of assessments required, the procedural steps involved, the roles of key stakeholders, and the environmental and community protection standards that must be applied.

The primary objective is to ensure that oil and gas development projects — particularly those involving exploration, exploitation, or related activities — are evaluated for their potential environmental and social impacts, with a strong emphasis on **environmental protection, human health, Indigenous rights, and the precautionary principle**.

## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Legislative Authority and Purpose**

- The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and the **Minister of the Environment**) issued these regulations under:
  - **Subsection 63(1)** of the Act: Authority to make environmental assessment regulations.
  - **Paragraph 63(2)(b)**: Authority to regulate environmental assessments in relation to First Nations oil and gas activities.

- The regulations apply specifically to **projects involving oil and gas exploration or exploitation** and are designed to ensure that such projects are assessed for environmental effects in a manner that respects Indigenous governance, knowledge systems, and environmental responsibility.

| **Record** | Any document, regardless of format (e.g., digital, paper). |
| **Registry** | A public record established by a First Nation under section 49. |
| **Screening** | Initial assessment under sections 13–14 to determine if a full assessment is needed. |
| **Test Drilling** | Drilling for geological/geophysical data, not for production. |

---

### **3. Core Principles in Environmental Assessment**

- **Environmental Protection & Human Health**: All decision-making must protect the environment and human health.
- **Precautionary Principle**: Where scientific uncertainty exists, decisions should err on the side of caution.
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Community knowledge and **Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK)** are recognized as valid and relevant inputs in assessments.

---

### **4. Decision-Making Authority and Consultation**

- The **decision-making authority** (e.g., federal or provincial agency) and the **First Nation Council** must act in ways that protect the environment and human health.
- If the **First Nation Council is not the decision-making authority**, it must **consult** with that authority before exercising powers related to project approval (e.g., under sections 8(b), 9, 10, 31, 34(1)(a), 35(2), 39(1)(a), 40(2)).

> This ensures that Indigenous governance is respected and that meaningful consultation occurs before decisions are made.

---

### **5. Scope of Environmental Assessment**

#### **Projects Covered**
- Any **proposed geophysical examination or test drilling** is automatically considered a "project" for environmental assessment purposes (under paragraph (b) of definition "project" in subsection 2(1) of the Act).

#### **Exemptions**
- A First Nation may **exempt certain classes of projects** from environmental assessment **only if**:
  - The exemption is listed in the **Exclusion List Regulations, 2007**.
  - The exemption does **not** apply to installations used for oil or gas exploration or exploitation (i.e., exceptions are limited to specific, non-exploitation activities).

> This ensures that core oil and gas operations are subject to scrutiny, while allowing flexibility for low-impact activities.

---

### **6. Environmental Assessment Process**

The process is tiered and progressive, depending on the project’s risk and complexity:

#### **Step 1: Screening**
- Conducted **early in the planning phase**.
- Must be completed and a **screening report** prepared.
- Scope of factors (e.g., environmental effects, cumulative impacts, public comments) is determined by the decision-making authority.
- Public participation is required:
  - A **description of the project scope and factors** must be posted online (on the registry site under section 49).
  - The public must be given **an opportunity to examine and comment** on the screening report and any records in the registry.
  - **No decision** under section 16(1) may be made before **15 days** after the public notice is posted.

> The screening determines whether a project is likely to cause **significant adverse environmental effects**.

#### **Step 2: Decision Based on Screening**
After reviewing the screening report and public comments, the decision-making authority makes one of the following decisions:

| Decision | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| **(a)** Project is not likely to cause significant adverse effects | Project may proceed with mitigation measures implemented. |
| **(b)** Significant effects but justified in circumstances | Project may proceed with mitigation. |
| **(c)** Significant effects and not justified | Project is denied. |
| **(d)** Uncertain | Referral to a mediator or review panel. |
| **(e)** Public concerns warrant referral | Referral to a mediator or review panel. |

> Mitigation measures considered must be **implementable** (either by the authority or by another party).

---

#### **Step 3: Comprehensive Study (if required)**

- Required when screening indicates potential significant environmental effects.
- Triggered when the **council of the First Nation** decides to refer the project to the decision-making authority for a comprehensive study (under section 22).
- The study must consider:
  - Project purpose and alternatives.
  - Environmental effects of alternatives.
  - Follow-up program requirements.
  - Impact on renewable resources (e.g., water, forests, biodiversity).

> Public consultation is mandatory before the study begins and after the study report is completed.

- The decision-making authority must:
  - Publish a **notice** of the report’s availability and comment deadline.
  - Allow **public comments** on the report (within 30 days of publication).
  - Make a decision under section 28 **only after 30 days** of posting key notices.

> Final decisions under section 28:
- **(a)** Not likely to cause significant adverse effects → project may proceed.
- **(b)** Effects justified → project may proceed.
- **(c)** Effects not justified → project denied.

> Again, mitigation measures must be implemented and a **follow-up program** designed if appropriate.

---

#### **Step 4: Mediation or Review Panel (if required)**

- Can be initiated by the **First Nation Council** at any time before a decision under section 16 or 22, if:
  - The project may cause significant adverse effects **even with mitigation**; or
  - Public concerns warrant it.

- **Mediation** (under sections 35–38):
  - Involves a **neutral mediator** appointed by the council or a designated body.
  - Must be based on **identified interested parties** (not frivolous or vexatious).
  - Scope of factors is determined by the council or agreement parties.
  - Mediator must be **unbiased, conflict-free**, and experienced.

- **Review Panel** (under sections 40–42):
  - An independent panel reviews the project’s environmental impacts.
  - Scope of factors is determined by the council or agreement parties.

> A **joint assessment** may involve both mediation and review panel components.

> The council may refer a specific issue from a review panel to mediation if it determines mediation is appropriate.

---

### **7. Follow-Up Program**

- Required for projects where significant environmental effects are anticipated.
- Purpose:
  - Verify that **mitigation measures were effective**.
  - Confirm that **environmental conditions have not deteriorated**.
  - Ensure long-term environmental accountability.

> This ensures that environmental protection is not just a one-time assessment but a **continuous process**.

---

### **8. Public Participation and Transparency**

- Public involvement is **mandatory** at every stage:
  - Screening: Public must be informed of project scope and factors.
  - Comprehensive Study: Public must be given an opportunity to participate and comment.
  - Final decisions: Public must be given a chance to comment on reports and decisions.

- All **records** (documents, data, reports) are to be **maintained in a public registry** (as per section 49), ensuring transparency and accessibility.
