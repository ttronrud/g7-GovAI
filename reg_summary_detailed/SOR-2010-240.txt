### **6. Delivery and Receipt of Electronic Documents**

#### **(a) When an Electronic Document Is Considered "Provided":**
An electronic document is deemed to have been **provided** to an addressee when:
1. It **leaves an information system** under the control of the originator or person acting for the originator; **or**
2. It is **posted on or made available through the secure website** of the originator.

> This establishes a clear threshold for when the obligation to deliver is fulfilled.

#### **(b) Delivery Under Section 9 of the Act**
- Section 9 of the Act requires certain notices to be sent to a specific address.
- If the originator has **reason to believe** the addressee may not have received the electronic document, they **must mail a paper copy** to the addressee’s recorded address.

> This ensures that **paper copies are not omitted** when there is a risk of non-receipt, maintaining compliance with the Act’s delivery requirements.

> ⚠️ This provision **does not affect** the timing of when the electronic document is considered provided under section 9.

#### **(c) When an Electronic Document Is Considered "Received":**
An electronic document is deemed to have been **received** when:
1. It **enters the information system** designated by the addressee;  
2. It is **posted on or made available through the secure website of the originator**; or  
3. The **notice in paragraph 4(1)(b)** (about availability) is received by the addressee.

> This defines the moment of receipt, which is critical for legal and compliance purposes (e.g., for recordkeeping or time-sensitive obligations).

- It must consist of **one or more letters, characters, numbers, or other symbols** in digital form that are:

| Feature | Practical Meaning |
|--------|-------------------|
