## 🔍 Key Definitions

### 1. **"Designated Entity"**
A designated entity is any of the following:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Entities under paragraph 390(1)(a) to (h)** of the CCAA | Entities specifically listed in the Act as subject to special regulatory oversight (e.g., financial institutions, credit unions, etc.). |
| **Entities with financial intermediary activities** | Any entity whose business includes one or more of the financial activities in **paragraph 390(2)(a)** of the CCAA and that engages in financial intermediary activities exposing it to **material market or credit risk**. Examples include: <br> - Factoring entities <br> - Finance entities <br> - Financial leasing entities |
| **Specialized financing entities (excluding exceptions)** | Entities engaged in specialized financing activities (e.g., equipment financing), **except** those in which an association is **permitted** to acquire or increase a substantial investment under **subparagraph 390(4)(c)(iii)** of the Act. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: This definition expands the scope of oversight to include financial intermediaries that carry credit or market risk — a key risk area for cooperative credit associations.

---

### 2. **"Value"**
Defined in two contexts:

| Context | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| **For shares, ownership interests, or loans** | The **book value** of the share/interest/loan as reported on the association’s balance sheet **as at a specific time**, prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** set out by the Superintendent under **subsection 292(4)** of the CCAA. |
| **For guarantees** | The **face value** of the guarantee (i.e., the amount the guarantor would be obligated to pay if the obligation is triggered). |

> This ensures that the value used for regulatory calculations is consistent with standard accounting practices and auditable records.

## 🚧 Core Regulatory Provision: Exemption from Subsection 390(4)

### 🔹 **General Rule: Subsection 390(4) of the CCAA Does NOT Apply**
- Normally, subsection 390(4) of the CCAA would restrict an association from holding **substantial investments** in designated entities — particularly when such investments exceed certain thresholds.
- However, **this restriction does not apply** in two specific scenarios:

#### ✅ Scenario 1: Investment in a Designated Entity Controlled by Another Association
> If an association acquires or increases a substantial investment in a designated entity **that is controlled by another association**, then **subsection 390(4)** does **not apply**.

> This allows cooperative associations to invest in subsidiaries or affiliated entities under common ownership without triggering immediate restrictions.

#### ✅ Scenario 2: Investment in a Designated Entity Referenced in Paragraph 390(1)(a) That is Controlled by a Group of Associations
> If the designated entity in paragraph 390(1)(a) is **controlled by a group of associations**, then the investment is **exempt** from subsection 390(4).

> This recognizes that cooperative groups may collectively own or control financial entities, and such investments are treated as part of a cooperative network.

## 📉 What Happens When Control is Lost?

If a designated entity **ceases to be controlled** by another association (or a group of associations), the association that holds a substantial investment must comply with specific conditions.

### 🔹 **Step 1: Assess the Total Value of Exposure**
The association must evaluate the **total value** of the following assets/liabilities **in designated entities over which it does not exercise control**:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Shares and ownership interests** | All shares and beneficial interests held directly or indirectly by the association or its controlled entities in designated entities where it has a substantial investment but no control. |
| **Loans** | All loans made by the association or its controlled entities to designated entities where it has a substantial investment but no control — **except** loans to: <br> - Non-foreign institutions <br> - That are deemed to be controlled by a group of associations |
| **Guarantees** | All outstanding guarantees given by the association or its controlled entities on behalf of such designated entities |

> ⚠️ **Exclusion**: Loans to non-foreign institutions that are deemed to be controlled by a group of associations are **not included** in this assessment.

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Determine Whether the Total Value Exceeds 50% of Regulatory Capital**

| Outcome | Action Required |
|--------|------------------|
| ✅ **Total value ≤ 50% of regulatory capital** | The association may **continue to hold** the investment without further action. |
| ❌ **Total value > 50% of regulatory capital** | The association must: <br> 1. **Immediately notify** the Superintendent of: <br> - The loss of control over the designated entity <br> - The fact that the total value exceeds 50% of its regulatory capital <br> 2. **Within two years** of the loss of control, take **all necessary steps** to ensure it no longer holds a substantial investment in that entity. |

> This creates a **risk-based trigger mechanism** — if exposure exceeds half of regulatory capital, the association must act to reduce or eliminate its investment to protect financial stability.

---

## 🔄 Special Rule: Deemed Control by a Group of Associations

A designated entity is **deemed to be controlled by a group of associations** if:

> The association mentioned in **subparagraphs 2(2)(a)(ii)** or **3(2)(a)(ii)**, **together with other associations**, beneficially own securities in the entity in such a number that, **if those associations were combined into one**, that combined entity would control the designated entity.

> This rule enables **cooperative group ownership** to be recognized as a form of control, even if no single association holds a majority stake.

## 📌 Additional Provisions on "Substantial Investment"

For the purposes of the above rules, a "substantial investment" **does NOT include**:

1. **Investments made under regulations made under paragraph 396(a) of the CCAA** — **except** these specific regulations.
2. **Investments made by an association that is a central cooperative credit society** and for which an order has been made under **subsection 473(1)** of the CCAA.
3. **Investments made by a specialized financing entity controlled by the association**.

> This ensures that certain types of investments (e.g., those made under specific emergency or group financing rules) are **exempt from the 50% capital threshold rule**.

---

## 📅 Effective Date

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the federal government.

> This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication.

## 🎯 Purpose and Regulatory Intent

This regulation serves several key objectives:

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Risk Mitigation** | Limits exposure of cooperative credit associations to financial risks from investments in entities that carry market or credit risk (e.g., lending, leasing, factoring). |
| **Control and Oversight** | Ensures that associations do not accumulate excessive exposure to non-controlled entities, which could compromise financial stability. |
| **Group Cooperation Recognition** | Allows cooperative groups to jointly own or control financial entities without triggering individual investment limits. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires timely reporting to the Superintendent when control is lost and exposure exceeds 50% of capital, promoting regulatory oversight. |
| **Exemption for Special Cases** | Provides flexibility for central cooperatives and specialized financing entities to operate under different rules. |

## 📚 Key Takeaways for Cooperatives and Regulators

| Point | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **Designated entities are high-risk** | Investments in factoring, finance, leasing, or specialized financing entities require careful monitoring. |
| **Loss of control triggers obligations** | If a cooperative loses control of a financial entity it previously invested in, it must assess exposure and act within two years if over 50% of capital is at risk. |
| **Group ownership is recognized** | A cooperative can participate in a group ownership structure without violating investment limits. |
| **Exemptions exist** | Central cooperatives and specialized financing entities have special treatment. |
| **Value is book-based** | Calculations rely on audited financial statements — not market values — ensuring consistency and transparency. |
