**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title and Context:**  
This regulation, formally known as the revocation of *Order in Council P.C. 1985-1740*, is a legislative instrument issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act**. It was enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Employment and Immigration** and the **Treasury Board**, to update the policy governing the cost of replacing a **Social Insurance Number (SIN) Card** in Canada.

**Background and Rationale:**  
Prior to this regulation, the cost of replacing a Social Insurance Number Card was generally borne by the cardholder. However, the Government of Canada had previously established a policy (under Order P.C. 1985-1740) that allowed for free replacement in certain specific circumstances—such as legal name changes, errors made by government officials, or due to natural disasters.  

The current regulation reflects a shift in policy: it **reaffirms and formalizes** the principle that **the holder of a SIN card is responsible for paying a fee** when replacing the card, **except in specific, limited circumstances**.

**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Revocation of Previous Order:**  
   The regulation explicitly **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1985-1740**, which had previously set out conditions under which replacement of a SIN card was free. This revocation removes the previous blanket exemption from fees.

2. **Authorization for Fee Setting:**  
   The **Minister of Employment and Immigration** is authorized to **prescribe a fee or charge** for the replacement of a Social Insurance Number Card. This means the Minister can set the amount of the fee through a new order (e.g., by regulation), based on administrative, financial, and operational considerations.

3. **Exemptions from Fees:**  
   The fee is **not required** to be paid in the following situations:
   - A **legal change in the holder’s name** (e.g., marriage, divorce, court order).
   - An **error made by a government official** in issuing or recording the SIN (e.g., a clerical mistake).
   - A **natural disaster** that renders the original card unusable or lost.

   These exemptions are preserved to ensure fairness and protect individuals from undue financial burden in cases involving administrative error or unforeseen events beyond their control.

4. **Legal Basis:**  
   The authority to issue this regulation is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to authorize fees for services provided by the federal government, including administrative services like card replacement.

**Purpose and Implications:**

- **Financial Sustainability:** The regulation enables the Government of Canada to recover administrative costs associated with issuing and replacing SIN cards, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Social Insurance Number system.
- **Clarity and Accountability:** By clearly defining when a fee applies and when it does not, the regulation provides transparency and predictability for cardholders.
- **Fairness and Equity:** Exemptions are maintained for legitimate, high-risk, or error-driven situations, protecting individuals from financial hardship due to government mistakes or natural events.
- **Administrative Flexibility:** The Minister is empowered to adjust the fee over time (e.g., in response to inflation or rising costs), providing adaptability to changing fiscal conditions.

**Effective Date and Legal Status:**  
The regulation was published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, on May 30, 1985**, and became effective upon publication. It is a binding order under federal law and applies to all individuals applying for or replacing a Social Insurance Number Card in Canada.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a modern, financially responsible framework for the replacement of Social Insurance Number cards. It shifts the financial responsibility from the government to the cardholder in most cases while preserving critical exemptions to ensure fairness, accountability, and public trust. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and the need to protect individuals from unjust financial burdens in exceptional circumstances.
