**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 25 (RCMP)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
This regulation, formally known as the **Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 25 (RCMP)**, is issued under the authority of **subsection 18(1) of the Privacy Act (Canada)**. It is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of two key federal officials:
- The **Solicitor General of Canada**
- The **President of the Treasury Board**

This authority allows the government to designate certain personal information banks as "exempt" from the general requirements of the Privacy Act, particularly when national security interests require it.

---

### **2. Designated Exempt Personal Information Bank**
The order designates a specific personal information bank as exempt:

- **Name of the Record**: *National Security Investigations Records, No. CMP/P-PU-025*
- **Controlling Agency**: The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**

This record is already recognized as a personal information bank under the Privacy Act, meaning it contains personal information collected and maintained by the RCMP for specific purposes.

---

### **3. Legal Basis for Exemption**
The designation is grounded in two key sections of the **Privacy Act**:
- **Section 21**: Allows for the exemption of personal information banks that are necessary for national security or law enforcement purposes.
- **Section 22**: Provides that personal information banks containing information about individuals that is subject to specific legal requirements (e.g., criminal investigations) may be exempt from certain privacy provisions if they are governed by applicable laws.

By invoking these sections, the government establishes that the records in question are exempt from the general privacy protections that apply to other personal information banks.

### **4. Scope of the Exemption**
The exemption applies specifically to:
- The **personal information contained within the National Security Investigations Records, No. CMP/P-PU-025**
- Records that **consist predominantly** of personal information described in **subparagraph 22(1)(a)(ii)** of the Privacy Act.

> **Subparagraph 22(1)(a)(ii)** refers to personal information that is:
> - "Personal information that is required by law to be collected or maintained for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting a criminal offence, or for the purpose of preventing or detecting a criminal offence."

Thus, the exemption covers information that is primarily used in criminal investigations involving national security threats or serious criminal activity.

### **5. Applicable Laws Governing the Exempt Bank**
For the purposes of **paragraph 18(3)(b)** of the Privacy Act, the exemption is not arbitrary—it is governed by specific laws that authorize the collection, use, and disclosure of such sensitive personal information. These laws are:
1. **Criminal Code** – Provides the legal framework for criminal investigations and prosecutions.
2. **Foreign Interference and Security of Information Act (FISIA)** – Addresses threats to national security from foreign interference and the protection of sensitive information.
3. **Security Offences Act** – Outlines offences related to threats to national security, including espionage, sabotage, and acts of terrorism.
4. **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act** – Governs the structure, powers, and operations of the RCMP, including its investigative functions.
5. **Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act (CSIS Act)** – Authorizes CSIS to conduct intelligence activities, including surveillance and investigations related to national security.

These laws collectively justify the necessity of handling the personal information in the exempt bank without being subject to the full scope of the Privacy Act’s disclosure and access requirements.

---

### **6. Implications of the Exemption**
- **Limited Public Access**: Individuals generally cannot access personal information in this exempt bank under the normal privacy provisions of the Privacy Act.
- **No Disclosure Requirements**: The RCMP may use, disclose, or retain the information without needing to comply with standard privacy rules, such as those requiring notice or individual access requests.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: While exempt from general privacy rules, the use of this information remains subject to oversight by the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada**, and the laws cited above provide the legal basis for accountability and justification of use.

---

### **7. Citation and Reference**
The order is officially cited as:
> **Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 25 (RCMP)**

This allows for easy identification and reference in legal, administrative, and policy contexts.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a formal, legally grounded exemption for a specific set of national security-related records held by the RCMP. It reflects the balance between protecting individual privacy and enabling law enforcement and national security agencies to respond effectively to threats to public safety and national integrity. The exemption is not broad or unconditional—it is narrowly tailored to records that fall under specific legal mandates and are essential for investigations involving serious criminal or security-related offences.

By designating these records as an exempt personal information bank, the government ensures that critical intelligence and investigative information can be processed and used without unnecessary delays or restrictions, while still maintaining accountability through statutory oversight and legal justification.
