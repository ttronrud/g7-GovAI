---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under two specific sections of the *Insurance Companies Act*:

- **Section 1021a** – Pertains to the use of names in securities-related transactions.
- **Section 1026a** – Addresses the conditions under which an insurance company or insurance holding company may permit the use of its name in connection with securities transactions.

This legislative action reflects the regulatory framework designed to ensure transparency, protect investors, and maintain integrity in financial communications involving insurance companies and their holding entities.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish clear conditions under which an insurance company or an insurance holding company may use its name** in various financial documents related to securities transactions. This includes:

- Prospectuses  
- Offering memorandums  
- Takeover bid circulars  
- Advertisements  
- Any other document associated with a securities-related transaction  

The rules are designed to prevent misleading or unauthorized use of company names, which could mislead investors or compromise the integrity of financial disclosures.

### **3. Permissible Use of a Company’s Name**

A person (such as an underwriter, broker, or promoter) may use the name of:

- An **insurance company**, or  
- An **insurance holding company**

in connection with a securities-related transaction **only if one of the following two conditions is met**:

#### **Condition 1: Required by Law**
The use of the name is **mandated by law**. This means that if a legal requirement (such as a statutory obligation under securities laws or regulatory rules) necessitates the inclusion of the company’s name in a document, such use is permitted.

#### **Condition 2: Written Permission from the Company**
The insurance company or insurance holding company must have **given written consent** for the use of its name in the document. This consent must be explicitly granted and documented in writing.

> 🔍 *Note:* The regulations do not allow the use of a company’s name without either legal necessity or prior written authorization. Any use outside these conditions would be prohibited.

### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to all documents used in connection with **securities-related transactions**, including but not limited to:

- Initial public offerings (IPOs)  
- Private placements  
- Mergers and acquisitions  
- Takeover bids  
- Shareholder communications  
- Advertising campaigns promoting securities transactions  

This ensures that even in promotional or informational materials, the use of an insurance company’s name is strictly controlled and accountable.

### **5. Effective Date and Implementation**

The regulations **come into force on the date that Section 1026 of the Insurance Companies Act becomes effective**. This section was enacted by **Section 465 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465)**.

> ✅ **Effective Date:** October 24, 2001  
> 📌 *Reference:* SI/2001-102 (Statutory Instrument 2001-102)

This means the rules were implemented on October 24, 2001, as part of broader reforms to strengthen investor protection and corporate governance in the insurance and securities sectors.

### **6. Repeal Note**

The regulations are **not retroactive** and are only in force from their effective date. There is no indication of a repeal or replacement in the current text provided. However, the note in the regulation states:

> [Repeal]  
> These Regulations come into force on the day on which section 1026 of the Insurance Companies Act comes into force.

This phrasing suggests that these regulations are **temporary or transitional** and are intended to operate only until the relevant statutory provisions are fully implemented. In practice, such regulations often serve as a bridge to more comprehensive reforms.

### **7. Key Implications and Significance**

- **Investor Protection:** Prevents misleading or deceptive use of corporate names, which could create confusion about ownership or responsibility.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Requires clear documentation (written permission) to ensure that all name usage is legitimate and properly authorized.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Provides a clear, enforceable standard for financial institutions and intermediaries to follow when communicating with investors.
- **Alignment with Broader Financial Regulation:** Part of a larger effort by the Canadian government to harmonize securities and insurance regulations under the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).

The use is permitted only if:

1. It is legally required, or
