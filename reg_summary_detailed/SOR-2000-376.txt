**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations Maintaining Certain Reciprocal Transfer Agreements"**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

This regulation is issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**. It is grounded in two key statutes:

1. **Section 40.3(3)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** – This provision authorizes the Treasury Board to make regulations that exclude certain reciprocal transfer agreements from specific provisions of the Act, particularly those that would otherwise require compliance with retirement or transfer rules.

2. **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** – This grants the Treasury Board the power to make regulations in relation to the administration of public service superannuation, including the maintenance or modification of reciprocal transfer agreements between the federal government and other employers.

These statutory authorities empower the Treasury Board to ensure that specific reciprocal transfer agreements—arrangements that allow public servants to transfer their pension rights to a foreign or private employer—remain in force without being subject to the automatic termination or restrictions imposed by subsection 40.3(2) of the PSSA.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **maintain and preserve the validity of certain reciprocal transfer agreements** between Her Majesty in right of Canada (the federal government) and specific private or public employers listed in the Schedule. These agreements are designed to facilitate the transfer of pension benefits across borders or between public and private sectors, particularly for individuals who work in international or cross-sectoral employment.

By excluding these specific agreements from the scope of subsection 40.3(2) of the PSSA, the regulation ensures that these arrangements **do not automatically terminate** upon the employee’s change in employment status or retirement, thereby preserving the continuity and stability of pension rights under these agreements.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Exclusion from Subsection 40.3(2) of the Public Service Superannuation Act:**
   - The regulation explicitly **excludes** the Reciprocal Transfer Agreement between Her Majesty in right of Canada and a named employer (as listed in the Schedule) from the application of subsection 40.3(2) of the PSSA.
   - Subsection 40.3(2) typically requires that certain reciprocal transfer agreements be terminated or suspended upon specific events (e.g., retirement, resignation, or change of employment).
   - By excluding these agreements, the regulation **prevents automatic termination** of pension rights under these arrangements, allowing employees to retain their pension benefits under the terms of the original agreement.

2. **Reference to the Schedule:**
   - The regulation references a **Schedule** that contains a list of specific reciprocal transfer agreements.
   - Each item in the Schedule includes:
     - The **name of the employer** (column 1).
     - The **date the agreement was made** (column 2).
   - The exclusion applies only to those agreements listed in the Schedule and made on the date specified.

3. **Effective Date:**
   - These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
   - This means the exclusion from subsection 40.3(2) becomes effective immediately upon official publication, providing timely and enforceable legal protection for the affected agreements.

**Significance and Impact:**

- **Continuity of Pension Rights:** Employees who are part of these reciprocal agreements can maintain their pension benefits even if they move to a private sector employer or retire, without losing entitlements due to automatic termination rules.
- **International and Cross-Sector Mobility:** These agreements often support public servants working abroad or in private organizations with international operations. The regulation supports the mobility of public servants while protecting their long-term financial security.
- **Stability in Public Service Retirement Planning:** It provides legal certainty for both employees and employers by ensuring that pension transfer rights are not disrupted by administrative or procedural changes under the PSSA.

---

**Legal Context and Background:**

- The Public Service Superannuation Act governs the retirement and pension benefits of federal public servants.
- Reciprocal transfer agreements are often entered into with other countries or private entities to ensure that public servants can maintain pension rights when working abroad or transitioning to private employment.
- Subsection 40.3(2) was originally designed to prevent pension rights from being "unfairly" transferred or retained in ways that could create financial imbalances or administrative burdens. However, in some cases, such as international agreements, these provisions may conflict with the intent of the reciprocal arrangement.
- This regulation serves as a **limited exception** to that rule, ensuring that specific, well-established agreements are preserved.

**Conclusion:**

These regulations are a targeted, legally sound mechanism to **preserve the integrity and effectiveness of specific reciprocal transfer agreements** between the federal government and designated employers. By excluding those agreements from the automatic termination provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act, the regulation ensures that public servants retain their pension rights under these arrangements, promoting fairness, mobility, and long-term financial planning. The regulation is effective upon registration and applies only to the agreements explicitly listed in the Schedule.
