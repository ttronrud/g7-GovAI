**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation establishes a formal transfer of administrative authority within the Canadian federal public service, specifically concerning the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority:**  
   The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council. This means it is a formal government decision made on the advice and recommendation of the Prime Minister, acting under the authority of the Crown and the legislative framework of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council to reassign control and supervision of specific public service departments or functions between ministers, typically to improve administrative efficiency, streamline governance, or reflect shifts in policy priorities.

3. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation transfers the **control and supervision** of a specific portion of the public service—the **Department of Human Resources and Skills Development**—from the **Minister of Human Resources Development** to the **Minister of State to be styled Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development**.

4. **Revised Title of the Minister:**  
   The receiving minister is styled as the **Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development**. This change in title reflects a reorganization intended to better align the department’s mandate with its core functions—human resources and skills development—thereby enhancing clarity and policy focus.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. From this date, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development assumes full responsibility for overseeing the operations, policy direction, and administrative functions of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development.

6. **Nature of the Change:**  
   This is not a transfer of personnel or budget, but rather a **restructuring of ministerial oversight**. The department continues to exist and operate under the same administrative structure, but now falls under a different ministerial portfolio. This change may reflect a broader government strategy to integrate human resources and skills development functions under a single, more cohesive leadership.

7. **Implications:**  
   - The new minister will be responsible for setting policy, allocating resources, and ensuring accountability within the department.  
   - The former Minister of Human Resources Development no longer has direct control or supervision over this department.  
   - The reorganization may signal a strategic shift toward emphasizing workforce development, skills training, and human capital management as central to national economic and social policy.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal reorganization of federal ministerial responsibilities under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. It transfers oversight of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development from the Minister of Human Resources Development to a newly designated Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, effective December 12, 2003. The change is designed to improve governance, clarify policy direction, and better align the department with its mission of supporting workforce development and human resource management in Canada.
