## **Regulations Respecting Applications for Ministerial Review — Miscarriages of Justice**  
*(S.C. 2002, c. 13, s. 71)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish the procedural framework for **applications for ministerial review** under **Part XXI.1 of the Criminal Code**, specifically in cases where there may be a **miscarriage of justice**.

---

### **5. Minister’s Process After Receiving the Application**

#### **Step 1: Acknowledgment and Preliminary Assessment**
- Upon receipt, the Minister must:
  - Send an **acknowledgment letter** to the applicant and, if applicable, to the person acting on their behalf
  - Conduct a **preliminary assessment** of the application to determine whether there is a **reasonable basis** to conclude that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred

#### **Step 2: Decision on Whether to Conduct an Investigation**
After the preliminary assessment, the Minister must decide whether to proceed with an investigation based on two scenarios:

| Scenario | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| **Investigation is warranted** | The Minister determines there is a **reasonable basis** to believe a miscarriage of justice likely occurred → **investigation proceeds** |
| **No investigation** | The Minister determines either: |
| | (a) There is a **reasonable basis** for a miscarriage of justice, **but** there is an **urgent need** for a decision under **paragraph 696.3(3)(a)** of the Code — for **humanitarian reasons** or to **avoid blatant continued prejudice** to the applicant; OR |
| | (b) There is **no reasonable basis** to conclude a miscarriage of justice occurred |

> In either case where no investigation is conducted, the Minister must **send a written notice** to the applicant and their representative indicating whether an investigation will be conducted.

---

### **6. Timeframes and Opportunity for Further Information**

#### **If No Investigation is Initiated (Reasons b(i) or b(ii))**
- The notice must state that the applicant may provide **further information** within **one year** of the notice being sent.
- If the applicant fails to provide such information within that period:
  - The Minister will **inform the applicant in writing** that **no investigation will be conducted**
- If further information is submitted **after** the one-year period:
  - The Minister must conduct a **new preliminary assessment** of the application under Section 3

---

### **7. Investigation Process (If Initiated)**

- After completing the investigation, the Minister must:
  - Prepare a **detailed investigation report**
  - Provide a **copy of the report** to the applicant and their representative
- The Minister must then notify the applicant that they may provide **further information** within **one year** of receiving the report

> If the applicant fails to respond or indicates no further information will be provided:
> - The Minister may proceed to make a **final decision** under **subsection 696.3(3)** of the Criminal Code

---

### **8. Final Decision and Notification**
- Once a decision is made under **subsection 696.3(3)** of the Code:
  - The Minister must **provide a copy of the decision** to the applicant and their representative

> This decision may result in:
> - A **renewal of the conviction**
> - A **reduction or dismissal of the conviction**
> - A **removal of the conviction**
> - Or other appropriate remedy depending on the findings

---

### **9. Annual Reporting Requirements**
The Minister must submit an **annual report** under **Section 696.5** of the Criminal Code, which must include:

- Number of applications made to the Minister
- Number of applications abandoned or deemed incomplete
- Number of applications at:
  - Preliminary assessment stage
  - Investigation stage
- Number of decisions made under **subsection 696.3(3)** of the Code
- Any other information the Minister deems appropriate

> This reporting ensures transparency and accountability in the operation of the ministerial review process.

---

### **10. Transitional Provisions and Continuity**

#### **A. Applications Before Commencement Date**
- If, **before the commencement day** (November 25, 2002), the Minister had already completed the preliminary assessment required under paragraph 3(b) of these regulations:
  - The **old scheme** continues to apply to that application
- If the Minister **had not completed** the preliminary assessment before the commencement date:
  - The application is **deemed not to have been made**
  - The applicant may now apply to the **Commission** under the **new scheme**

#### **B. Transfer of Applications to the Commission**
An application is deemed to have been made to the **Commission** (likely referring to the **Canadian Judicial Council** or a similar oversight body) **if**:
1. The applicant gives **written consent** to transfer the application **after the time limit** set by the Minister
2. The Minister **completed the preliminary assessment** under paragraph 3(b) **before the commencement day**
3. The consent is received **before** the Minister makes a decision under **subsection 696.3(3)** of the Code as it existed *immediately before* the commencement date

> This ensures that applications not fully processed under the old system can be transferred to the new review mechanism.

---

### **11. Repeal of the Regulations**
These Regulations **replace and repeal** the previous **Regulations Respecting Applications for Ministerial Review — Miscarriages of Justice**.  
They come into force on the day that **Section 71 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001 (S.C. 2002, c. 13)** comes into force — **November 25, 2002**.
