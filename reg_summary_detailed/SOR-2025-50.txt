### **Regulation Summary: Special Economic Measures Permit Authorization Order**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **subsection 4(4)a of the *Special Economic Measures Act*** (SEMA), which grants the Minister of Foreign Affairs the authority to issue permits when certain economic activities are restricted or prohibited.
- The authority is exercised **on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs** and by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, meaning it is a formal, statutory instrument approved at the highest level of government.

> - *S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(3)* (amending the Special Economic Measures Act)

#### **3. Key Powers of the Minister of Foreign Affairs**

The Minister may:

##### **A. Issue Specific Permits**
- Grant individual permits to **any person in Canada or abroad** to carry out:
  - A **specified activity or transaction**, or
  - A **class of activities or transactions**,  
  that would otherwise be **restricted or prohibited** under any regulation listed in the schedule.

> This allows for targeted exceptions—e.g., permitting a Canadian company to conduct a specific trade with a sanctioned country under strict conditions.

##### **B. Issue General Permits**
- Grant broad authorizations allowing **any person in Canada or abroad** to carry out:
  - A **specified activity or transaction**, or
  - A **class of activities or transactions**,

#### **4. Specific Exclusions (Syria Regulations Only)**
A critical limitation applies **only to the Special Economic Measures (Syria) Regulations**:

- The Minister **may not** issue permits for activities or classes of activities listed in **Section 3.4** of those regulations.
- This means that certain sensitive or high-risk activities (e.g., those directly linked to weapons, human rights abuses, or state support of terrorism) remain **explicitly prohibited** and are **not eligible for permit authorization**, even under this Order.

> This exclusion underscores the government’s intent to maintain strict controls on the most serious violations related to Syria.

| **Balancing Security and Economic Needs** | Permits provide a mechanism to balance national security and economic interests, enabling legitimate business or diplomatic activity without fully lifting sanctions. |
| **Strict Exclusions** | The exclusion of Section 3.4 of the Syria Regulations shows that certain activities (likely involving human rights abuses or weapons) are off-limits, reinforcing Canada’s commitment to accountability. |
| **Geopolitical Scope** | The inclusion of countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela reflects Canada’s engagement with global economic and security challenges. |
| **Human Rights and Security Focus** | Regulations related to Hamas, settler violence, and Sudan highlight Canada’s emphasis on addressing terrorism, racial violence, and conflict zones. |

### **Conclusion**

This **Special Economic Measures Permit Authorization Order** is a powerful tool under Canada’s sanctions framework. It enables the Minister of Foreign Affairs to **grant specific or general authorizations** for economic activities that are otherwise restricted or prohibited under a wide range of international sanctions regimes—covering major global actors and conflict zones.

However, it operates within **clear boundaries**, especially in Syria, where certain activities remain **explicitly prohibited**. The Order demonstrates Canada’s ability to apply targeted, flexible, and context-sensitive economic measures while maintaining strong commitments to human rights, international law, and national security.
