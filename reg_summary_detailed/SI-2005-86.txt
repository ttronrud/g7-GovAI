**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson (September 22, 2005)**

---

### **1. Legal Context and Purpose**

This document is an **official proclamation** issued by the **Governor General of Canada**, Adrienne Clarkson, on **September 22, 2005**, pursuant to **Section 6 of the Act to Implement Conventions for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Income Tax** (commonly referred to as the *Tax Conventions Implementation Act*).

The primary purpose of this proclamation is to **formally notify the public and relevant stakeholders** of two key dates related to the **tax treaty between Canada and Belgium**:

- The **date on which the new tax convention came into force**.
- The **date on which the previous version of the treaty ceased to be effective**.

This notice is required under statutory authority and must be published in the *Canada Gazette*, the official journal of the Government of Canada.

### **2. Background of the Treaty and Legislative Framework**

#### **The Legal Basis: Section 6 of the Tax Conventions Implementation Act**
- Section 6 of the Act mandates that the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the advice of the Privy Council) must issue a **proclamation in the Canada Gazette** when:
  - A tax treaty between Canada and another country comes into force.
  - A treaty ceases to be effective.

This ensures transparency and legal certainty for individuals, businesses, and tax authorities regarding the application of tax rules across borders.

#### **The Treaty in Question**
The treaty in question is the:
> **Convention between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital**

This treaty was originally established to prevent double taxation and tax evasion in relation to income and capital gains, ensuring that individuals and companies are not taxed twice on the same income or capital gains in both Canada and Belgium.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### **(a) The New Treaty Comes Into Force on October 6, 2004**
- The **revised version** of the Canada–Belgium tax treaty (as amended by **subsection 8(1) of the Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 2002**) officially **came into force on October 6, 2004**.
- This date marks the beginning of the new treaty’s legal application, meaning that from this date onward, the rules governing taxation of income and capital between Canada and Belgium are governed by the updated agreement.

#### **(b) The Old Treaty Ceases to Apply on the Same Date**
- Prior to the 2002 amendment, there had been an earlier version of the Canada–Belgium tax treaty, which was **replaced** by the updated version.
- As a result, **Article 28 of the original treaty** (which governs the termination or replacement of treaties) was invoked.
- Consequently, the **previous version of the Canada–Belgium tax treaty** (the one that existed before the 2002 amendment) **ceased to apply on October 6, 2004**.

> This means that the old treaty was **automatically replaced and invalidated** on the same day the new treaty took effect.

### **4. Legal Authority and Process**

- The proclamation was issued following a prior **Order in Council P.C. 2005-1512**, dated **August 31, 2005**, which directed the Governor in Council to issue the proclamation.
- The Governor General, acting on the advice of the **Privy Council**, formally **gives notice** of the changes in the treaty’s status.
- This is not a unilateral decision but a **statutory requirement** to ensure legal clarity and compliance with international tax agreements.

---

### **5. Public Notice and Legal Effect**

- The proclamation serves as **official public notice** that:
  - The new Canada–Belgium tax treaty is now in effect.
  - The outdated treaty is no longer valid.
- All persons, including taxpayers, tax professionals, financial institutions, and government bodies, are **required to take notice** and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- This ensures that tax planning, compliance, and enforcement activities are based on the **current, legally valid treaty**.

| **Transparency** | Ensures that Canadians and Belgians dealing with cross-border taxation are aware of the current legal framework. |
