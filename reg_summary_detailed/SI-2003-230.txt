**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities within the Canadian federal public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority:**  
   The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council. This is the formal mechanism by which the Canadian government, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, executes administrative decisions, including the transfer of public service functions and responsibilities.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the power to reorganize or transfer parts of the public service, including the delegation of control and supervision of specific units or departments, provided such actions are in the public interest and are recommended by the Prime Minister.

3. **Subject of the Transfer:**  
   The specific unit being transferred is the **National Crime Prevention Centre (NCPC)**. This is a component or division within the Department of Justice that focuses on crime prevention initiatives, research, policy development, and public education related to reducing crime.

4. **Transfer of Control and Supervision:**  
   The regulation explicitly transfers **control and supervision** of the NCPC from the **Department of Justice** to the **Department of the Solicitor General**. This means that the Department of the Solicitor General will now be responsible for:
   - Overseeing the day-to-day operations of the NCPC,
   - Setting strategic direction and priorities,
   - Managing human resources, budgets, and performance,
   - Ensuring accountability and reporting to higher authorities.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. This date marks the official start of the new administrative arrangement, after which all operational, managerial, and reporting responsibilities shift to the Department of the Solicitor General.

6. **Implications of the Transfer:**
   - **Organizational Realignment:** The move reflects a strategic shift in how crime prevention is managed within the federal government, possibly to align with the Solicitor General’s mandate, which includes oversight of legal policy, law enforcement, and public safety.
   - **Enhanced Coordination:** Placing the NCPC under the Solicitor General may improve coordination between crime prevention efforts and broader legal and policing frameworks.
   - **Public Service Efficiency:** The transfer is likely intended to streamline responsibilities, reduce duplication, and improve the effectiveness of crime prevention programming.

7. **No Change in Legal or Operational Mandate:**  
   While the administrative control shifts, the **legal mandate and functions** of the National Crime Prevention Centre remain unchanged. The Centre continues to carry out its mission of promoting crime prevention through research, public awareness, and policy development—only now under the supervision of a different department.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian public service. It transfers operational and supervisory authority of the National Crime Prevention Centre from the Department of Justice to the Department of the Solicitor General, effective December 12, 2003. The move is legally valid under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act and is designed to improve the efficiency and coherence of federal crime prevention efforts by aligning the unit with a department with a direct legal and policy focus on public safety.
