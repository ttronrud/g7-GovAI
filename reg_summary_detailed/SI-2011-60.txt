### **Purpose and Function of the Designation**

1. **Establishing Regulatory Oversight:**  
   The Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act provides a legal framework for the registration, governance, and regulation of not-for-profit corporations in Canada. To ensure that these corporations are properly governed and that regulatory responsibilities are fulfilled, the Act requires a designated minister to act as the official point of contact and authority for administrative and regulatory matters.

2. **Role of the Minister of Industry:**  
   The designation assigns the **Minister of Industry** to serve as the "Minister" under the Act. This means that the Minister is responsible for:
   - Receiving and processing applications for registration of not-for-profit corporations;
   - Issuing or refusing approvals or certifications;
   - Providing official guidance and policy direction related to the operation of not-for-profit entities;
   - Acting as the primary liaison between the federal government and not-for-profit organizations;
   - Ensuring compliance with the Act’s requirements.

3. **Legal Authority and Accountability:**  
   By designating the Minister of Industry, the government ensures that regulatory decisions are made by a senior minister with appropriate authority and accountability. This designation also provides clarity in the chain of command and responsibilities under the Act.

4. **Flexibility and Policy Alignment:**  
   The choice of the Minister of Industry may reflect the government’s policy priorities at the time—such as supporting innovation, entrepreneurship, or community-based organizations—many of which are often represented by not-for-profit entities. The Minister of Industry may have a particular interest in promoting the growth and sustainability of such organizations.

### **Legal and Procedural Context**

- **Section 5 of the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act** provides the legal basis for such a designation. It allows the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to appoint a minister to act as the "Minister" of the Act.
- The designation is not permanent and may be reviewed or modified in future if the government changes its priorities or if a different minister is deemed more appropriate.
- The designation does not create new powers or obligations beyond those already established in the Act. It merely assigns a specific minister to carry out the administrative and regulatory functions outlined in the legislation.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Administrative Clarity:** The regulation ensures that not-for-profit corporations know which federal minister is responsible for their regulatory matters, improving transparency and access to services.
- **Inter-ministerial Coordination:** It may facilitate coordination between the Ministry of Industry and other departments (e.g., Finance, Justice, or Health) that may have overlapping interests in not-for-profit governance.
- **Support for the Not-for-Profit Sector:** By assigning a dedicated minister, the government signals its commitment to supporting the growth and integrity of not-for-profit organizations, which play a vital role in community development, social services, and public interest advocacy.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a procedural but significant instrument that enables the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act to operate effectively by formally designating the **Minister of Industry** as the Minister responsible for administering the Act. It reflects the government’s intent to provide clear, accountable, and responsive oversight of not-for-profit corporations, aligning regulatory functions with broader policy goals related to economic development, community engagement, and social responsibility.

It is a standard practice in Canadian administrative law to designate a minister to serve as the official point of contact for specific legislative frameworks, and this designation ensures that the not-for-profit sector has a clear and accessible pathway to federal engagement.

**Note:** While this regulation is legally binding, it is typically not widely publicized or subject to public comment, as it is a routine administrative designation.
