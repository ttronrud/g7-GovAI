It appears that you've provided a prompt asking for a detailed summary of a regulation, but no actual regulation text or content was included in your message. Could you please provide the specific regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the full text or details of the regulation (such as the title, issuing authority, or the content itself), I will be happy to deliver a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured summary covering key provisions, objectives, scope, requirements, and implications.
