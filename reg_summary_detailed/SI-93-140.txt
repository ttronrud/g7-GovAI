   - This realignment aims to improve coordination between policy development, food safety, processing standards, and consumer information related to agricultural products.

2. **Departments Involved in the Transfer**:

   - **From the Department of Industry, Science and Technology**:
     - The **Food Products Branch**.
     - Specifically, the portion relating to **agri-food processing and manufacturing**.
     - This includes regulatory functions, standards, inspections, and policy development related to how agricultural products are processed, manufactured, and brought to market.
