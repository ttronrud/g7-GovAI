**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Claims (Poland) Settlement Regulations**

### **Overview**

The *Foreign Claims (Poland) Settlement Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs and the Minister of Finance, under **Vote Item 22a in Schedule B of Appropriation Act No. 9, 1966**. These regulations govern the **determination and payment** of certain claims by **Canadian citizens** against the **Government of the Polish People's Republic** and its citizens, stemming from nationalizations or other governmental actions prior to **October 15, 1971**.

The regulations are formally titled the *Foreign Claims (Poland) Settlement Regulations* and are designed to ensure a fair, transparent, and legally sound process for resolving financial claims arising from the nationalization of property, rights, or enterprises in Poland during a period of political and economic transformation.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Agreement (Accord)**

2. **Canadian Citizen**

### **Core Provisions and Operational Framework**

#### **1. Time Limit for Claim Submission**
- Only claims **notified to the Government of Canada on or before October 15, 1971** are eligible for consideration.
- Any notice of a claim received on or before that date must be **forwarded to the Commission** for review.

#### **2. Submission of Evidence**
- All **documentary evidence** and **written representations** supporting a claim must be submitted to the Commission **by March 31, 1976**.
- This deadline ensures that claims are processed within a defined timeframe and that the Commission has sufficient information to assess eligibility and value.

#### **3. Citizenship Requirement for Eligibility**
- To qualify for an award:
  - The claimant must have been a **Canadian citizen from the time the claim arose or when they obtained title to it**, up to **October 15, 1971**.
- If title to the claim was obtained **after** it arose:
  - All **predecessors in title** must have been Canadian citizens during the period they held the claim.

> This rule ensures that only individuals with continuous Canadian citizenship during the relevant period are eligible, protecting the integrity of the compensation scheme.

#### **4. Death of a Claimant After October 15, 1971**
- If a claimant who gave notice before October 15, 1971 **dies after that date**, the award may be paid to any person **lawfully entitled to it**, regardless of nationality.
- This provision allows for the transfer of compensation to heirs or beneficiaries, even if they are not Canadian citizens.

#### **5. Deduction of Compensation from Other Sources**
- If a claimant receives, or is likely to receive, **compensation from any source other than the Fund**, the Commission **must deduct that amount** from the recommended award.
- This prevents double compensation and ensures that the Fund only pays for claims not otherwise resolved.

#### **6. Deemed Compensation Due to Neglect or Default**
- If a claimant **fails to act** (due to neglect or default) and thereby **loses eligibility** to receive compensation from a source other than the Fund, they are **deemed to have received** that compensation.
- This includes situations where the claimant knew or should have known that failing to act by a fixed deadline would result in forfeiture.

> Example: A claimant fails to apply for compensation from a Polish government entity by the deadline and thus loses that right — the regulation treats this as if they had already received it.

#### **7. Reporting and Decision-Making Process**
- The **Chief Commissioner** must report to the Minister and the Minister of Finance on each claim, stating:
  - Whether the claimant is **eligible** for an award.
  - The **amount of the recommended award**, if any.
- The Chief Commissioner may issue a report **early** if delay would cause **undue hardship or delay** in processing.

#### **8. Final Determination of Awards**
- After receiving the Chief Commissioner’s report, the **Minister and Minister of Finance jointly decide** on:
  - The **final amount** of the award to be paid from the Fund.
  - If the claimant is deceased, **to whom** the award shall be paid.

> This step adds a layer of oversight and ensures that decisions are made by both foreign affairs and finance ministers.

#### **9. Calculation of Awards and Fund Limitations**
- The final award amount is calculated **after deducting** any compensation already paid, likely to be paid, or deemed to have been paid (as per Section 5).
- **Payment is limited** to funds derived from:
  - Moneys received from the Polish Government under **Article I of the 1971 Agreement**.
  - Interest credited to the Fund on those moneys.

> This ensures that the Fund is used strictly for claims under the Agreement.

#### **10. Insufficient Funds: Payment Rules**
- If the funds in this designated portion of the Fund are **insufficient to pay all awards in full**, the following rules apply:
  - Each award will be paid **in full or for $1,000**, whichever is **less**.
  - Any remaining unpaid awards will be paid on a **pro rata basis** from any remaining funds.

> This establishes a **priority and fairness mechanism** when the Fund is short of funds — ensuring no claimant is left uncompensated, but also preventing overextension.

#### **11. Payment Timing and Installments**
- Awards may be paid in **one or more installments**, depending on:
  - The amount of available funds in the relevant portion of the Fund.
  - The potential size of future awards (including those still pending).

> This provides flexibility in managing cash flow and financial risk.

#### **12. Documentation and Compliance**
- The Commission must **certify** to the Minister of Finance that:
  - All documents of title or supporting documents upon which the award recommendation is based have been **transmitted to the Minister**.
- This certification is required to fulfill **Article VII of the 1971 Agreement**, which governs the transfer of claims and documentation.

#### **13. Assignment or Undertaking of Rights**
- The Commission may recommend, or the Minister of Finance may require, that:
  - A claimant **assign their entitlement** to compensation from non-Fund sources to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
  - If assignment is not possible, the claimant must **sign an undertaking** to take all necessary actions to **vest the compensation and rights in the Government of Canada**.

> This ensures that Canada has full control over claims that may be recoverable from other sources, preventing private claims from undermining the Fund’s integrity.

#### **14. Succession and Continuity of Office**
- If the **Chief Commissioner is absent, incapacitated, or the office is vacant**, the **Deputy Chief Commissioner** may perform all duties.
- If **two or more Commissioners are absent or disqualified**, the **remaining Commissioner** may act on behalf of the full Commission.

> These provisions ensure continuity and functionality of the Commission even in adverse circumstances.
