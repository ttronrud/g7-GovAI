**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Hydro Nuclear Facilities Exclusion from Part I of the Canada Labour Code Regulations (Industrial Relations)**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, under **sections 121.2a and 121.5a of the Canada Labour Code**. It establishes a specific **exclusion** for employment at certain nuclear facilities in Ontario from the general provisions of **Part I of the Canada Labour Code Regulations (Industrial Relations)**, which govern labor relations in most sectors of the Canadian economy.

The regulation was enacted under the authority of the federal *Canada Labour Code*, which applies across Canada but allows for **provincial variations** or exclusions in cases involving specialized or high-risk industries—such as nuclear energy.

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **exclude employment at Ontario Hydro nuclear facilities** from the broad application of Part I of the Canada Labour Code (which governs collective bargaining, strikes, union recognition, and other labor relations matters), while **retaining key protections** under provincial and federal labor legislation. This exclusion was intended to:

- Recognize the **unique operational, safety, and security requirements** of nuclear facilities;
- Allow for **specialized labor governance** tailored to the nuclear industry;
- Maintain **national and international safety standards** by ensuring that nuclear operations are not subject to the standard industrial relations processes that may introduce instability or risk.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Employment**  
   - Refers to employment with **Ontario Hydro** or with a **"nuclear facility"** as defined below.

2. **Nuclear Facility**  
   - A nuclear facility in Ontario that:
     - Is subject to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* or its regulations;
     - Is **owned and operated by Ontario Hydro**, or  
     - Is **owned or operated by another entity**, but **on the day these regulations come into force or after**, it is **taken over by Ontario Hydro**.

   > This definition ensures that the exclusion applies to nuclear facilities that are either currently or will become under Ontario Hydro’s control, thereby protecting the continuity of operations and safety oversight.

3. **Labour Relations Act, 1995 (LRA 1995)**  
   - Refers to *Schedule A* to the *Labour Relations and Employment Statute Law Amendment Act, 1995* (S.O. 1995, c. 1).  
   - This is the **primary provincial labor law** governing collective bargaining, strikes, union certification, and dispute resolution in Ontario.

4. **Labour Relations and Employment Statute Law Amendment Act, 1995**  
   - The enabling legislation that introduced major reforms to Ontario’s labor relations framework, including the replacement of the old *Labour Relations Act, 1947* with the more modern LRA 1995.

### **Core Exclusion from Part I of the Canada Labour Code**

- **Employment on or in connection with a nuclear facility is excluded from the application of Part I of the Canada Labour Code**, **except for sections 121.2 to 121.5**.

> This means that **most labor relations provisions** (such as:
> - Recognition of unions,
> - Collective bargaining requirements,
> - Strike rights,
> - Certification processes,
> - Dispute resolution procedures) **do not apply** to workers at nuclear facilities.

> However, **sections 121.2 to 121.5** (which deal with the **protection of certain rights**, such as the right to be represented by a union, and the **prohibition of unfair labor practices**) **remain in force** and are still applicable.

> This narrow exception ensures that **basic protections against unfair treatment** are preserved, even in the excluded context.

---

### **Applicable Provincial and Federal Laws**

Despite the exclusion from Part I of the Canada Labour Code, the following laws and instruments **continue to apply** to employment at nuclear facilities:

1. **The Labour Relations Act, 1995 (LRA 1995)** and its **regulations**  
   - These are **fully applicable**, even though the Canada Labour Code is generally the federal framework.  
   - This allows Ontario to maintain a **provincial labor framework** for nuclear workers, consistent with broader labor rights.

2. **Older regulations made under the previous Labour Relations Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2)**  
   - These remain in effect **until they are repealed or replaced** by the new LRA 1995 regulations.  
   - This provides **continuity and stability** during the transition period.

3. **Rules of Procedure made by the Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB)** under section 110 of the LRA 1995  
   - These procedural rules govern how disputes and hearings are conducted and are **applicable** to nuclear facility employment.

> This ensures that while the broader federal labor regime is bypassed, **procedural fairness and dispute resolution mechanisms** are still available and accessible.

### **Amendments to the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (for Specific Purposes)**

For the purpose of applying the LRA 1995 to nuclear facilities, the following **interpretive amendments** are made:

1. **Paragraph 1(3)(a) of the LRA 1995 is read without reference to the words "architectural" and "land surveying"**  
   - This means that **employees engaged in architectural or land surveying work** at nuclear facilities are **not excluded** from coverage under the Act.  
   - This is a critical clarification to ensure that **non-core technical roles** are not inadvertently left out of labor protections.

2. **The definition of "employee" in subsection 1(1) of the LRA 1995 is expanded**  
   - It includes **persons whose duties involve the supervision of other employees**.  
   - This ensures that **supervisors, managers, and team leaders** are recognized as employees under the Act and are entitled to the same rights and protections as other workers.

3. **Every reference in sections 15, 54, or 136 of the LRA 1995 to the "Human Rights Code" is read as a reference to the "Canadian Human Rights Act"**  
   - This ensures that **human rights protections** are drawn from the **federal Canadian Human Rights Act**, not the provincial Human Rights Code.  
   - This is significant because:
     - The **Canadian Human Rights Act** applies nationwide and has a broader scope than provincial codes;
     - It aligns nuclear facility employment with **federal human rights standards**, which is especially important given the **national significance and sensitivity** of nuclear operations.

### **Continuity of Proceedings**

- Any **proceeding initiated before April 1, 1998** (the date the regulations came into force) before the **Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB)** is **continued as if the regulations had never been made**.  
- This ensures **legal continuity** and prevents disruption of existing cases involving labor disputes, union recognition, or grievances related to nuclear workers.

> This provision is critical for **fairness and consistency**, especially for long-standing disputes that were already in progress.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **came into force on April 1, 1998**.

> This date marks the official implementation of the exclusion, after which the specified labor protections and exclusions take effect.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Industry-Specific Regulation**  
   - Demonstrates how federal labor law can be **adapted to high-risk industries** with unique safety, operational, and regulatory needs.

2. **Balancing Safety and Labor Rights**  
   - While removing broad labor relations processes (like strikes), the regulation preserves **basic protections** (e.g., against unfair treatment) and **procedural fairness**.

3. **Federal-Provincial Coordination**  
   - Shows the **interplay between federal and provincial labor laws**, where federal law can be modified or excluded in specific contexts when provincial or national safety regulations require it.

4. **Long-Term Relevance**  
   - Though Ontario Hydro was eventually privatized and decommissioned (with most facilities now operated by other entities), the **principles of this exclusion** may inform future regulations for **other high-risk or regulated industries** (e.g., oil and gas, aerospace, or critical infrastructure).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, industry-specific exclusion** from the general application of the Canada Labour Code’s industrial relations provisions, designed to accommodate the **unique risks, safety requirements, and operational needs** of nuclear energy facilities in Ontario. It maintains **core labor protections** under provincial law while allowing for **specialized governance**. By excluding most labor relations processes but preserving key rights and procedural mechanisms, it strikes a balance between **labor rights and national safety imperatives**.

It remains a landmark example of how labor law can be adapted to serve **public safety** without undermining **employee rights** in critical sectors.

--- 

> **Note**: This regulation was made in the context of Ontario Hydro’s role as a major nuclear energy provider. While Ontario Hydro no longer operates nuclear facilities directly (its operations were largely transitioned to private entities and decommissioned), the principles of this exclusion may still inform future policy in regulated or high-risk industries.
