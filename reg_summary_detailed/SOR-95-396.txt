### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 3 – Wheat and Wheat Products and Barley and Barley Products for Personal Use**

---

#### **1. Legal Background and Authority**

This regulation establishes **General Import Permit No. 3**, issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** of Canada under the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**. The permit authorizes the **personal importation** of specific wheat and barley products into Canada.

- **Legal Basis**:
  - The regulation is grounded in two key provisions:
    1. **Section 6.2(1)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 106): This allows the Minister to determine an **import access quantity** for certain goods, including wheat and barley products.
    2. **Section 8.3(3)** of the same Act (S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 109): This grants the Minister the authority to issue a **general import permit** when an import access quantity has been established.

- **Historical Context**:
  - Wheat and barley products were previously listed on the *Import Control List* under *C.R.C., c. 604*, as per **SOR/89-251**, 1989 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 2569.
  - This permit was issued on **August 3, 1995**, to facilitate personal imports of these staple agricultural goods.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This permit was **repealed** on **April 1, 1997**, under **SOR/97-42, s. 2**. It is no longer in force as of that date and should not be used for current import activities.

#### **2. Purpose of the Permit**

The primary purpose of this general permit is to:

- Allow **Canadian residents** to import **wheat and wheat products**, and **barley and barley products** for **personal use** and for use within the **importer’s household**.
- Provide a simplified, non-licensing pathway for individuals to bring in these goods without needing individual import permits or complex customs documentation—provided the goods fall within the defined scope.
