**Detailed Summary of the Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1985, No. 4**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This authority is derived specifically from **paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act** (TLA), which originally establishes a reservation of certain territorial lands to the Crown. The Order serves to **waive** this reservation in specific circumstances.

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **remove the Crown’s reservation rights** over certain designated territorial lands in the **Northwest Territories**. By waiving the reservation, the Crown relinquishes its claim to these lands, allowing for their potential transfer, development, or use by other parties—such as individuals, Indigenous communities, or government entities—without the restriction imposed by the original reservation.

**3. Scope of the Waiver:**

The waiver applies specifically to:

- A **grant of territorial lands** located on **Joliffe Island** in the Northwest Territories.
- The lands are restricted to those that lie **within 30.48 metres (approximately 100 feet)** of the waters of **Yellowknife Bay**, a specific portion of **Great Slave Lake**.

This geographic limitation ensures that only the immediately adjacent land to the shoreline of Yellowknife Bay is affected by the waiver, preserving the Crown’s reservation rights over more distant or non-adjacent areas of Joliffe Island.

**4. Legal Effect of the Waiver:**

By waiving the reservation under paragraph 9(b) of the Territorial Lands Act, the Crown no longer holds a legal claim to these specific lands. This means:

- The lands are no longer subject to the Crown’s reserved rights under the Act.
- The grant of these lands can now proceed without the need to seek Crown consent or navigate the reservation provisions.
- The lands become available for use, development, or future disposition under applicable land laws and agreements, potentially including Indigenous rights, private ownership, or public use.

**5. Citation and Reference:**

The Order is formally cited as:  
**Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1985, No. 4**  
This citation allows for legal reference and consistency in subsequent land-related decisions or legal proceedings.

**6. Context and Significance:**

- This Order is part of a broader framework of land governance in the Northwest Territories, where land rights, especially in relation to Indigenous communities and Crown reserves, are carefully managed.
- The waiver may reflect efforts to facilitate land use, development, or Indigenous self-governance by removing legal impediments to land access or transfer.
- It underscores the Crown’s ability to voluntarily relinquish certain rights in specific, defined areas, particularly when such actions are recommended by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, indicating alignment with Indigenous land rights or regional development priorities.

**7. Limitations and Conditions:**

- The waiver is **limited in scope** and applies **only to the specific lands described in the Schedule** (noted as an annex to the Order).
- The waiver does **not affect other reservations** under the Territorial Lands Act or other statutes.
- It does not imply a transfer of ownership or title to any party; it only removes the Crown’s reservation interest, leaving title to the land subject to any existing grants, agreements, or future legislation.

**Conclusion:**

The **Reservation to the Crown Waiver Order, 1985, No. 4** is a legally binding instrument that removes the Crown’s reservation rights over a defined strip of land on Joliffe Island—specifically, the area within 30.48 metres of Yellowknife Bay in Great Slave Lake. Issued under the Territorial Lands Act, it enables greater flexibility in land use and potential development or Indigenous land use planning in that region. The Order reflects a strategic decision by the federal government to adjust land tenure in a way that supports regional development and land governance, while remaining within the legal framework of the Territorial Lands Act.
