**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998**

---

### **Overview**

The *Alberta Fishery Regulations, 1998* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, under **section 43a and subsection 79.7(5)b of the Fisheries Act**. These regulations implement and govern fishing activities within the Province of Alberta, with a primary focus on **conservation, sustainability, and the protection of fish populations**, particularly game fish and native species.

The regulations came into force on **April 23, 1998**, and are administered under the authority of the **Fisheries (Alberta) Act (S.A. 1992, c. F-12.2)** and the broader *Fisheries Act* (federal).

### **3. Authority and Licensing**

#### **General Fishing Authority**
- No person may fish **except** as authorized by:
  - The *provincial Act*;
  - A specific provision (e.g., close time, quota);

#### **Indian Fishing Rights**
- **Indigenous peoples (Indians)** may engage in **sportfishing without a licence**.

The provincial Minister may impose specific conditions on commercial or research licences, including:
- Species and quantities of fish that may be taken
- Size, age, sex, or developmental stage restrictions
- Waters where fishing is permitted
- Transport locations and vessels
- Gear types, sizes, and deployment methods
- Reporting requirements (e.g., trip reports)
- Recordkeeping obligations
- Fish tagging or segregation
- Release of certain species (e.g., undersized fish)
- Timeframes for submitting data or reports

> These conditions ensure **scientific monitoring and sustainable harvest**.

### **4. Sportfishing Restrictions**

This section governs recreational fishing and includes strict rules to protect fish stocks.

#### **Prohibited Activities in Sportfishing**
- **Snagging** (hooking fish in body parts other than mouth) is **strictly prohibited**.
- **Possession of snagging devices** or **gaff hooks** while angling is banned.
- **No use of spring-loaded hooks**.
- **No use of fish as bait** — only dead bait fish (e.g., dead smelt, herring, fish eggs), or dead parts (skin, fins, eyes) of game fish caught by angling are allowed.

#### **Hook and Line Limits**
- **Maximum of three hooks** on a single line.
- **No more than three points** on a single hook shaft.
- **No more than three hooks** on a lure.
