**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Repeal of the Alberta Milk Order and the Introduction of the Alberta Milk Control Board Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; SOR/84-317, 1984 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1650)**

---

### **Background and Context**
This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, serves two primary functions:

1. **Repeals** the outdated *Alberta Milk Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1984-1305, April 18, 1984), which had governed the marketing and regulation of milk produced in Alberta.
2. **Introduces a new regulatory framework** by replacing it with a modernized Order that grants authority to the **Alberta Milk Control Board** (the "Commodity Board") to regulate the **interprovincial and export trade of milk** produced in Alberta.

This change reflects evolving agricultural market dynamics, the need for more flexible and market-responsive regulation, and the integration of Alberta’s dairy sector into broader national trade mechanisms.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- The regulation is enacted under **Section 2** of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council to make orders to regulate the marketing of agricultural products.
- It operates within the framework of the *Dairy Board Act of Alberta*, which establishes the legal foundation for the Alberta Milk Control Board.

---

### **Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Dairy Board Act of Alberta* – the enabling legislation for the Commodity Board. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *Alberta Milk Control Board*, established under the Dairy Board Act. |
| **Milk** | Milk or cream from cows, produced for consumer use in liquid form in Canada. |
| **Plan** | A marketing plan for milk established and amended over time under the Dairy Board Act. |

---

### **Scope of Application**
- Applies specifically to:
  - Milk **produced in the Province of Alberta**.
  - Milk **produced in British Columbia** that is shipped to Alberta (as referenced in paragraph 3(1)(b)).

> Note: This means the regulation governs both Alberta-origin milk and certain BC-origin milk being exported to Alberta, under specific conditions.

---

### **Regulatory Authority of the Alberta Milk Control Board**

Under this Order, the Commodity Board is granted broad authority to regulate the **marketing of milk in interprovincial trade**, including exports, with the following key powers:

#### 1. **Regulatory Powers**
- The Board may regulate the marketing of milk **outside of Alberta** (i.e., interprovincial trade and export).
- It may exercise **all or any powers** previously available to it in regulating **local marketing within Alberta**, including:
  - Setting prices, quotas, and marketing policies.
  - Managing supply and demand through marketing plans.
- **Exclusions**:
  - The Board **does not have authority** over milk produced in Alberta and marketed in **Saskatchewan**, if such marketing is governed by a **Saskatchewan Milk Order** and a milk quota granted by the Saskatchewan Milk Control Board.
  - The Board **does not have authority** over marketing activities governed by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act*.

> This exclusion ensures that national-level marketing functions (e.g., price stabilization, national supply management) remain under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Dairy Commission.

#### 2. **Levies and Charges**
- The Commodity Board may:
  - **Fix and impose levies or charges** on milk or its components (e.g., fat, protein).
  - **Classify producers or marketers** into different groups (e.g., by farm size, volume, or type of operation).
  - **Set different levies or charges** for different groups.
- These levies are **collected from persons engaged in the production or marketing of milk** who fall under the categories specified in subsection 3(1).

#### 3. **Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected may be used for:
- Creating **reserves** (to buffer against price fluctuations).
- Covering **operational expenses** of the Board.
- Paying for **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of milk.
- Conducting **equalization or adjustment** among milk producers to ensure fair distribution of income from milk sales.

> This mechanism helps stabilize income for producers during periods of market volatility and supports equitable returns across different segments of the dairy industry.

---

### **Important Exclusions and Limitations**
- **No authority over Saskatchewan milk trade**: If milk from Alberta is sold in Saskatchewan under a quota system administered by the Saskatchewan Milk Control Board, the Alberta Board has no power to regulate that transaction.
- **No overlap with Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)**: The CDC operates independently under its own Act and has jurisdiction over interprovincial marketing. This Order does **not** grant the Alberta Board authority to interfere with CDC functions.

---

### **Repeal and Historical Context**
- The original *Alberta Milk Order* (P.C. 1984-1305) was a product of the earlier era of state-controlled milk marketing, designed to manage supply and price in a more rigid, centralized manner.
- This new Order reflects a shift toward **market-based regulation**, allowing greater flexibility and responsiveness to changing market conditions.
- The original Order was **fully repealed** by **SOR/2001-16, section 34**, which came into force in 2001, indicating that the regulatory framework has been superseded by more modern, market-oriented systems.

---

### **Significance and Implications**
1. **Modernization of Dairy Regulation**: The Order replaces outdated, rigid controls with a more dynamic, producer-focused system.
2. **Enhanced Producer Support**: Through levies and equalization mechanisms, producers benefit from financial stability and risk mitigation.
3. **Interprovincial Trade Clarity**: Defines clear boundaries between provincial and federal roles in milk marketing, preventing duplication or conflict.
4. **Alignment with National Frameworks**: Respects the role of the Canadian Dairy Commission in national-level coordination, ensuring a cohesive national dairy policy.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant evolution in Alberta’s dairy marketing policy. By repealing the old Alberta Milk Order and establishing a new, more flexible framework for the Alberta Milk Control Board, it enables better management of interprovincial and export milk trade. It provides the Board with essential tools—such as levies, classification, and equalization—to support producers and stabilize markets, while clearly delineating its authority and respecting the jurisdiction of federal and provincial bodies.

> **Final Note**: Although this Order was effective in 1991 and remains legally valid until its repeal in 2001, its core principles—particularly the use of levies and equalization—have influenced subsequent dairy policy developments in Canada.
