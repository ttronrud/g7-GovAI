**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Instrument:**  
Order under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), S.C. 2002, c. 29  
Issued by: His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  
Pursuant to: Subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2) of the *Species at Risk Act*

### **Key Provisions and Actions**

1. **Referral of Assessment Back to COSEWIC**  
   The Governor General in Council has referred the status assessment of the **Carolinian population of the Spring Salamander (*Gyrinophilus porphyriticus*)** back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further review and consideration.  

   - This action is taken because new and emerging scientific information has become available since COSEWIC’s previous assessment in 2011, which may affect the understanding of the population’s current status.  
   - The referral is not a reclassification or designation of the species as at risk, but rather a formal request to reassess the population’s status using updated data.

2. **Reason for Referral**  
   - In its 2011 assessment, COSEWIC concluded that the **Carolinian population of the Spring Salamander was "extirpated"** — meaning the species was locally extinct in that region.  
   - This determination was based on the absence of valid, documented sightings of the species in the Niagara Regional Municipality (southern Ontario) for over 50 years.  
   - However, since that assessment, **new data and observations** have emerged that suggest the possibility of the species’ return or persistence in the region. These include potential sightings, habitat indicators, or ecological evidence that could support a reevaluation of the population’s viability.

3. **Purpose of the Referral**  
   The referral allows COSEWIC to:  
   - Reassess the current status of the population using the most recent scientific data.  
   - Evaluate whether the species may still be present, or whether there is a potential for recovery.  
   - Determine whether the population warrants a different status (e.g., "special concern," "threatened," or "endangered") or whether further research and monitoring are required.

4. **Public Registry Requirement**  
   The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include in the **public registry established under Section 120 of the *Species at Risk Act*** a statement attached as a schedule to this Order.  
   - This statement outlines the **reasons for the referral** to COSEWIC.  
   - The public registry ensures transparency and public access to information about species assessments and decisions under SARA.  
   - It serves as a formal record of the government’s recognition that new information warrants a reassessment.

### **Background on the Spring Salamander**

- The **Spring Salamander (*Gyrinophilus porphyriticus*)** is a large, lungless salamander native to eastern North America.  
- It is typically found in moist, forested habitats with cool, clean streams and leaf litter.  
- The **Carolinian population** historically occurred in the **Niagara region of southern Ontario**, an area known for its unique biodiversity and ecological significance.  
- The species is sensitive to habitat disturbance, pollution, and climate change, making it a species of conservation interest.

### **Significance of the Regulation**

- This regulation reflects a key principle of the *Species at Risk Act*: **scientific rigor and adaptability** in species assessments.  
- It demonstrates that even when a population is declared extirpated, the government remains open to revising that status if new evidence emerges.  
- The referral ensures that conservation decisions are based on the best available science and not solely on historical records.  
- It also underscores the importance of **ongoing monitoring and research** in protecting biodiversity, especially for rare or elusive species.

---

### **Next Steps**

- COSEWIC will conduct a new assessment of the Carolinian population, incorporating the new information.  
- The updated assessment will be published and may lead to:  
  - A revised status (e.g., not extirpated, or "special concern").  
  - Recommendations for conservation measures.  
  - Further actions by the government under SARA, such as recovery planning or habitat protection.  
- The public registry will remain accessible, allowing stakeholders, researchers, and the public to monitor the progress of the reassessment.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a procedural and scientific step to ensure that the status of the Spring Salamander in the Niagara region is evaluated with the most current information. By referring the assessment back to COSEWIC, the government affirms its commitment to evidence-based conservation and the dynamic nature of species status determinations. It also highlights the ecological value of the Carolinian region and the need for continued attention to the recovery and protection of at-risk species.
