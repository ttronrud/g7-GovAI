### **Detailed Summary of the United Nations Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations**

This regulation is a Canadian implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions (specifically **Resolution 1493 (2003)**, **Resolution 1533 (2004)**, and **Resolution 1552 (2004)**) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It was enacted under **Section 2 of the United Nations Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to make regulations to enable the effective application of those UN resolutions.

The regulation establishes a comprehensive legal framework to **prohibit Canadian persons and entities from engaging in transactions or activities that support armed conflict, the proliferation of weapons, or military activities in the DRC**, particularly those involving designated individuals or entities linked to armed groups. However, it includes **critical exceptions for humanitarian, diplomatic, and authorized security-related activities**.
