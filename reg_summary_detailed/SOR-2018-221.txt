### **Detailed Summary of the CPTPP Rules of Origin Regulations (Canada)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**.  
This provision allows the federal government to implement rules of origin in accordance with international trade agreements, specifically the **Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)**.

The regulation is formally enacted under:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** – which authorizes the implementation of CPTPP rules through regulations.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – which provides the foundational framework for customs tariff and origin rules in Canada.

#### **2. Provisions of the CPTPP with Force of Law in Canada**
The following specific provisions of the CPTPP are incorporated into Canadian law and have **full legal effect**:

- **Articles 3.1 to 3.18**: These form the core of the CPTPP’s rules of origin. They establish the general principles for determining whether a product qualifies as "originating" for tariff treatment under the agreement. Key elements include:
  - The requirement that goods must meet certain **origin criteria** (e.g., regional value content, production processes, or changes in tariff classification).
  - The use of **product-specific rules** depending on the type of good.
  - The application of **methods of calculation** (such as net cost and build-down methods) to determine regional value content.

- **Annex 3-C**: Contains **product-specific rules of origin** for certain goods, particularly those in specific tariff headings. These rules define the precise conditions under which a good can be considered originating.

- **Annex 3-D and Appendix 1**: Provides **additional rules and definitions**, including detailed procedures for calculating regional value content, especially for complex or manufactured goods. Appendix 1 offers illustrative examples and clarifications.

- **Paragraphs 1 to 9 of Article 4.2**: These address the **application of rules of origin** in specific contexts, such as:
  - The treatment of goods that are processed or transformed.
  - The use of **regional value content** thresholds.
  - The **exemption of certain goods** from strict origin rules under specific conditions.

- **Annex 4-A and Appendix 1**: Contains **rules for goods in specific tariff classifications**, including detailed rules for goods related to machinery, vehicles, and industrial products.

> These provisions collectively establish a comprehensive and consistent framework for determining whether a product qualifies as "originating" under the CPTPP, which is essential for eligibility for preferential tariff treatment.

#### **3. Special Provision for Heading 87.03 (Goods of Heading 87.03)**
A **notable exception or adjustment** is made specifically for **goods of heading 87.03** in the Harmonized System (HS), which refers to **"plastic articles, including those of plastic film, plastic sheets, and plastic containers"**.

For **Canada’s trade with Australia and Malaysia**, the following **product-specific rules of origin** apply when determining whether a good of heading 87.03 qualifies as originating:

> **Either of the following conditions must be met**:
> 1. **A change in tariff classification** from any other heading (i.e., the good undergoes a transformation or reclassification to heading 87.03).
> 2. **No change in tariff classification** (i.e., the good remains in heading 87.03), **provided** it meets one of the following **regional value content thresholds**:
>    - **At least 40% regional value content**, calculated using the **net cost method**.
>    - **At least 50% regional value content**, calculated using the **build-down method**.

> ✅ **Note**: This exception applies **only between Canada and Australia** and **between Canada and Malaysia**. It does **not apply to other CPTPP partners**.

> ⚠️ **Why this matters**: The standard rules of origin in the CPTPP typically require a higher regional value content (e.g., 40% or 50%) for most goods. However, this provision allows for **greater flexibility** in the case of goods in heading 87.03, which may be more complex or subject to different manufacturing processes.

> 🔍 **Methodological clarification**:
> - **Net cost method**: Calculates regional value content by comparing the cost of materials and components used in the product to the total cost of the final product.
> - **Build-down method**: Traces the value of inputs back through the production process, subtracting the value of non-originating inputs until only originating components remain.

This flexibility is designed to ensure that **goods in this category can still qualify for preferential treatment** even if they are not fully transformed or involve significant imported inputs.

---

#### **4. Effective Date and Implementation**
- The **Regulations come into force** on the day that **Section 43 of the CPTPP Implementation Act** (Chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada 2018) comes into force.
- **If the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures a **smooth and predictable transition** into the new rules of origin, aligning Canada’s domestic customs regime with the CPTPP obligations.

---

#### **5. Reference to Prior Regulations**
- The regulations are **effective as of December 30, 2018**, and are referenced in:
  - **S.I. 2018-101** (Statutory Instrument 2018-101)
  - **S.I. 2018-108** (Statutory Instrument 2018-108)

These instruments provide the **original text and official publication** of the rules, ensuring legal transparency and traceability.
