**Detailed Summary of the Outerwear Fabrics Remission Order, 1998**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
The *Outerwear Fabrics Remission Order, 1998* was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **Section 101 of the Customs Tariff Act (R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.))**. This section empowers the government to make regulations related to customs duties, including remission (reduction or exemption) of duties for specific goods under certain conditions.

---

### **2. Definitions**

Two key definitions are established in the Order:

- **Outerwear Apparel**:  
  Refers to specific types of clothing made from outerwear fabric, including:
  - Children’s and infants’ coats, jackets, and snow/ski wear
  - Women’s and girls’ jackets and snow/ski wear
  - Men’s and boys’ jackets and snow/ski wear
  - Women’s and girls’ coats
  - Men’s and boys’ coats  
  *Note: All must be made from outerwear fabric.*

- **Outerwear Fabric**:  
  Defined as broadwoven fabrics that consist solely of:
  - Nylon or other polyamide fibres/filaments  
  - Polyester fibres/filaments  
  - Acetate, triacetate, or rayon (in pure form)  
  - Cotton fibres, or cotton mixed solely with man-made fibres, or man-made fibres mixed solely with other man-made fibres  
  *Note: The fabric must be broadwoven and meet one of these composition criteria.*

### **3. Purpose of the Remission Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **reduce or eliminate customs duties** on the importation of specific **outerwear fabrics** into Canada, **for use in manufacturing outerwear apparel**. This is intended to support the domestic production of outerwear, reduce costs for manufacturers, and promote competitiveness in the apparel industry.

### **4. Remission Schedule by Year**

The Order provides a **phased remission structure** based on the year of importation, with varying percentages of duty remission:

| Year Range | Remission Percentage | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| **January 1, 1998 – December 31, 2004** | **Full remission (100%)** | All duties on imported outerwear fabrics are waived for use in manufacturing outerwear apparel. |
| **January 1, 2005 – December 31, 2006** | **Full remission (100%)** | Continued full duty remission. |
| **January 1, 2007 – December 31, 2007** | **75% remission** | 75% of customs duties are remitted. |
| **January 1, 2008 – December 31, 2008** | **50% remission + 25% additional remission** | Two separate remissions: 50% and 25% → total of **75%** remission (cumulative). |
| **January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2009** | **75% remission** | 75% of duties remitted. |
| **January 1, 2010 – December 31, 2010** | **50% remission** | 50% of duties remitted. |
| **January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2011** | **50% remission** | 50% of duties remitted. |
| **January 1, 2012 – December 31, 2012** | **50% remission** | 50% of duties remitted. |

> **Note**: The remission percentages are applied **per calendar year** and are **cumulative** for each manufacturer.

### **5. Limitation on Total Remission Amount**

A critical restriction is introduced to prevent excessive financial benefit:

> **The total remission granted in any given calendar year shall not exceed the total amount of customs duties remitted to the manufacturer under the Outerwear Fabrics and Outerwear Apparel Remission Order in respect of outerwear fabrics imported during 1995.**

- This means that **no manufacturer can receive more remission in any year than the total duty amount that was previously remitted to them in 1995**.
- This cap acts as a **safeguard against unlimited benefit**, ensuring that the policy does not distort market dynamics or create unfair advantages.

---

### **6. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission, manufacturers must:

- **Submit a claim to the Minister of National Revenue within three years** of the date the outerwear fabric is imported into Canada.
- The claim must be made **within a 3-year window** from the date of importation.

> This creates a time-bound obligation, ensuring timely administration and compliance with customs procedures.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

The Order **comes into effect on December 29, 1997**.

> This means that the benefits of the remission began being available from that date, even though the first full remission period (1998–2004) started in 1998.

---

### **8. Applicability**

- Applies only to **manufacturers listed in the Schedule** (a separate document attached to the Order).
- The remission applies **only to outerwear fabrics imported into Canada** by those manufacturers.
- The fabrics must be **used exclusively in the production of outerwear apparel**, as defined.

---

### **9. Key Policy Objectives**

1. **Support Domestic Manufacturing**:  
   By reducing import costs of raw materials (outerwear fabric), the policy encourages Canadian manufacturers to produce outerwear, supporting local industry.

2. **Promote Economic Competitiveness**:  
   Lower input costs help Canadian apparel producers compete with international manufacturers.

3. **Encourage Innovation and Product Diversity**:  
   Facilitates the development of new styles and products (e.g., children’s, ski, and snow wear).

4. **Phased Reduction to Allow Transition**:  
   The gradual reduction in remission (from 100% to 50%) allows the market to adjust over time, reducing dependency on duty exemptions.

5. **Ensure Fiscal Responsibility**:  
   The 1995 cap and 3-year claim deadline ensure the policy remains financially sustainable and accountable.

---

### **10. Important Notes and Implications**

- **Not a blanket exemption**: The remission applies only to specific fabric types and apparel categories.
- **Fabric quality and type matter**: Only broadwoven fabrics meeting the defined composition criteria qualify.
- **No benefit for non-manufacturers**: Only manufacturers listed in the schedule are eligible.
- **No benefit for non-outerwear apparel**: The remission is strictly tied to outerwear apparel production.
- **Historical reference (1995)**: The 1995 duty remittance cap ties the current policy to past benefits, anchoring its fiscal impact.

### **Conclusion**

The *Outerwear Fabrics Remission Order, 1998* is a targeted, time-limited, and financially constrained regulation designed to support the Canadian apparel manufacturing sector by reducing the cost of importing key raw materials—outerwear fabrics—into the country. It balances economic support with fiscal responsibility through phased remission, eligibility restrictions, and time-bound claims.

The policy reflects a strategic approach to industrial development: providing significant support in the early years to build capacity, then gradually reducing incentives to encourage efficiency and market integration, while ensuring long-term government accountability.
