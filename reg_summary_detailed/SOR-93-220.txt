### **Detailed Summary of the Historic Canals Regulations (Canada)**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose of the Regulation**

The *Historic Canals Regulations* were introduced by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under **Sections 16 and 17 of the Department of Transport Act**. These regulations **revoke the previous Heritage Canals Regulations (P.C. 1984-196)** and establish a comprehensive framework for the **management, maintenance, proper use, and protection of historic canals administered by Parks Canada**.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To preserve the **historic character, cultural integrity, and natural values** of designated canals.
- To ensure **safe navigation** for vessels and infrastructure (e.g., locks, dams).
- To protect **cultural and natural resources**, wildlife, and public safety.
- To regulate activities such as camping, dredging, construction, and events in a way that balances public access with conservation.

These regulations may be cited as the **"Historic Canals Regulations"** and apply to all **historic canals** as defined in Schedule I.
