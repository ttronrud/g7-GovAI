## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Northern Inland Waters Regulations (1992, as amended and effective June 15, 1993)**

### 📌 **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation was issued under the authority of several federal and territorial laws:

- **Northern Inland Waters Act (NIWA)** – Section 29 allows revocation and replacement of existing inland water regulations.
- **Northwest Territories Waters Act (NWTWA)** – Section 33 authorizes the creation of new water regulations.
- **Yukon Waters Act (YWA)** – Section 33 provides similar authority for the Yukon Territory.

The **original Northern Inland Waters Regulations (C.R.C., c. 1234)** were **revoked** and replaced by two new sets of regulations:

1. **Northwest Territories Inland Water Resources Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 39)**
2. **Yukon Territory Inland Water Resources Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 40)**

These regulations became effective on **June 15, 1993** and apply to federal areas within designated **water management areas** in the NWT and Yukon.

> ⚠️ Note: The regulation was **repealed in 2016** (SOR/2016-130, s. 2), meaning it no longer has legal force. However, this summary reflects its content and historical significance.

## 🎯 **Core Purpose of the Regulations**

To **manage and regulate the use of inland water resources** in the Northwest Territories and Yukon Territory in a way that:

- Protects the environment;
- Prevents adverse impacts on ecosystems, communities, and other water users;
- Ensures sustainable development;
- Balances economic activity (e.g., mining, power generation, agriculture) with environmental protection.

## 📚 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act* (MV-RMA), which provides the overarching legal framework. |
| **Groundwater** | All water in saturated zones beneath the land surface, regardless of origin (e.g., rainwater, snowmelt, aquifers). |
| **Undertaking** | A specific activity involving the use of water or deposition of waste, as listed in **Schedule II**. Examples include industrial, mining, municipal, power, agricultural, etc. |
| **Watercourse** | A natural body of water (river, stream, spring, swamp, gulch), whether currently flowing or not. Includes groundwater. |

---

## 🌍 Geographical Scope: Water Management Areas

The regulation establishes **specific geographic zones** in the NWT and Yukon as **Water Management Areas (WMAs)**, defined in **Schedule I**. These areas include:

1. **Great Slave Lake and all waters draining into it**
2. **Great Bear Lake and its tributaries (including the Great Bear River)**
3. **Mackenzie River and all its tributaries**
4. **Mainland waters draining into Hudson Bay**
5. **All other waters draining into the Arctic Ocean or adjacent waters**

> These zones are critical for environmental protection and are subject to strict water use and waste management rules.

## ✅ **Exemptions from Licensing (No Licence Required)**

Certain activities may proceed **without a licence** if they meet strict environmental and operational criteria:

### 1. **Low-Impact Uses**
- Uses or waste deposits with **no significant adverse environmental effects**.
- Do **not interfere** with existing rights of other water users or waste depositors.
- Meet the **criteria in column II of Schedules IV to VIII** (by undertaking type):
  - Agricultural, conservation, recreational, municipal, industrial, mining/milling, power.

> For example, small-scale farming or seasonal camp operations may qualify.

### 2. **Residential Sewage Waste**
- Individuals may deposit **sewage from residential buildings** under the **General Sanitation Regulations** of the NWT.

### 3. **Vessel Waste Deposition**
- Vessels (as defined in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*) may deposit waste **if not prohibited under Part 9** of that Act.

> This ensures shipping operations do not violate marine pollution standards.
