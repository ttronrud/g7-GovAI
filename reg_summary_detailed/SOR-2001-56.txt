**Detailed Summary of the Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The **Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations** were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under two specific provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act*:

- **Section 672.1a** of the Insurance Companies Act  
- **Paragraph 703(a)** of the same Act  

These provisions empower the government to establish rules governing the types of information that are considered *supervisory information* and must be kept confidential by insurance companies.

The regulations are **Statutory Regulation Number S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 126**, and were previously referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 47**. This indicates their long-standing role in the regulatory framework of federally regulated insurance companies in Canada.

---

### **2. Definitions**
- **"Company"** is broadly defined to include:
  - A domestic company
  - A society
  - A foreign company
  - A provincial company  

This broad definition ensures that all forms of insurance entities under federal regulation are covered by the rules.

### **3. What Constitutes "Prescribed Supervisory Information" (Section 2)**

Under **section 672.1 of the Insurance Companies Act**, the following information is designated as *prescribed supervisory information* and must be treated as confidential:

#### **(a) Ratings Assigned by the Superintendent**
- Any **rating** issued by the **Superintendent of Financial Services** (or equivalent regulatory body) to assess the **financial condition** of the company.
- Also includes **any other rating** that is **substantially based on information obtained from the Superintendent** (e.g., credit ratings, risk ratings, solvency assessments).

> *Rationale:* These ratings provide insight into the financial health and risk profile of the company and are critical for investors, regulators, and policyholders.

#### **(b) Stage of Intervention**
- The **level of intervention** applied to the company, based on the following supervisory guides:
  - For **life insurance companies**: *Supervisory Guide Applicable to Federally Regulated Life Insurance Companies*
  - For **property and casualty or marine companies**: *Supervisory Guide Applicable to Federally Regulated Insurance Companies*

> *Examples of intervention stages may include:*  
> - Monitoring  
> - Early warning  
> - Restructuring  
> - Restriction of operations  
> - Liquidation  

> *Rationale:* These stages reflect the severity and nature of regulatory action taken to protect policyholders and maintain financial stability.

#### **(c) Orders, Agreements, or Directions Issued by the Superintendent**
Specifically includes:
- **Orders** under:
  - Subsection **515(3)** – related to financial reporting
  - Subsection **516(4)** – related to capital adequacy

  - Subsection **609(2)** – related to payment obligations
- **Prudential agreements** entered into under **section 675.1** of the Act (e.g., capital or liquidity support agreements)
- **Directions** issued under **section 676** of the Act (e.g., operational or financial directives)

> *Rationale:* These are formal regulatory actions that directly impact the company’s operations and financial obligations.

#### **(d) Reports and Recommendations from the Superintendent**
- Any **report** prepared by or at the request of the Superintendent
- Any **recommendation** made by the Superintendent following:
  - Annual or special examinations
  - Other supervisory reviews (e.g., stress tests, risk assessments)

> *Includes associated correspondence* with:
  - Directors
  - Officers
  - Board members

> *Rationale:* These documents provide detailed findings and assessments that inform regulatory decisions and internal governance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The provision stating *"Repealed, SOR/2011-196, s. 20"* indicates that a prior version of this regulation (likely related to disclosure rules) was **repealed in 2011**, suggesting an update or refinement of the disclosure framework.

### **4. Supervisory Information Regarding Affiliates (Section 3)**

For **affiliates** of an insurance company (e.g., subsidiaries, parent companies, holding companies), the following regulations define what constitutes supervisory information:

- If the affiliate is a **bank** subject to the *Bank Act* → apply **Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations**
- If the affiliate is an **authorized foreign bank** → apply **Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations**
- If the affiliate is a **cooperative credit association** → apply **Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**
- If the affiliate is a **trust and loan company** → apply **Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**
- If the affiliate is a **bank holding company** → apply **Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**
- If the affiliate is an **insurance holding company** → apply **Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

> *Rationale:* This ensures that regulatory oversight extends across the entire corporate group, particularly where financial risks may be interlinked between insurance and banking operations.

### **5. Confidentiality Obligations (Section 4 and 5)**

#### **General Prohibition on Disclosure**
- **A company shall not directly or indirectly disclose** any information referred to in **section 2** (the prescribed supervisory information) without authorization.

> *This applies to all forms of disclosure*, including public statements, media releases, investor presentations, or internal communications.

#### **Permitted Exceptions**
A company may disclose the information **only** to the following parties, **provided** it ensures the information remains **confidential**:

- **Affiliates** of the company  
- **Directors, officers, employees**  
- **Auditors**  
- **Securities underwriters**

#### **Exception for Material Facts (Section 2(1)(c))**
- A company or its affiliate may disclose information under **paragraph 2(1)(c)** (e.g., reports, recommendations) **if**:
  - The information contains a **material fact** or a **material change** in financial condition or risk profile
  - Such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., Canadian securities regulators, provincial securities commissions)

> *Example:* If a supervisory report reveals a material decline in capital, and this must be disclosed under the *Securities Act* or *Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) rules*, the disclosure is permitted.

> *Rationale:* Balances regulatory confidentiality with transparency obligations under securities legislation.
