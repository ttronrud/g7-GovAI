**Detailed Summary of the Public Service Pension Adjustment Regulations**

---

**1. Citation of the Regulation**  
These regulations are formally titled *The Public Service Pension Adjustment Regulations* and may be cited as such.

---

**2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"**  
  Refers to the *Public Service Pension Adjustment Act* (Loi). This Act provides the legal framework under which pension increases are determined and implemented for certain public service employees and their beneficiaries.

- **"Re-employed recipient"**  
  A person who:
  - Holds any office or position, or
  - Performs any services,  
  for which remuneration is paid from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund** of Canada or by an **agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.  
  This definition broadly covers public servants (e.g., federal government employees, civil servants, or officials) who are currently employed by the federal government.  
  The term "re-employed" implies that the individual has previously retired or ceased employment and is now returning to public service, which triggers specific pension adjustment rules under the Act.

**3. Suspension of Pension Increases When the Pension Itself Is Suspended**

- If, under the **original legislation** (e.g., a specific pension act or statute) or the **pension plan** governing the recipient’s pension, **any portion of the pension is suspended** (either partially or fully), then:
  - The **increase in pension** provided under the *Public Service Pension Adjustment Act* is **suspended** as well.
  
- This means that if a re-employed recipient’s pension is temporarily halted—due to reasons such as temporary disability, leave of absence, or a change in employment status—the corresponding increase in pension under the Act will not be applied during the suspension period.

> **Purpose**: This ensures consistency and prevents the payment of an increase that would be inconsistent with the suspension of the base pension. It aligns the adjustment mechanism with the actual status of the pension.

---

**4. Payment of Pension Increases When the Pension Is Not Suspended**

- If, under the same legislation or pension plan, **no part of the pension is suspended** (i.e., the pension remains active and fully in force), then:
  - The **increase in pension** under the Act **shall be paid**.
  - This increase must be paid **to the extent that it would be payable if the increase were included as part of the pension** under the original enactment or pension plan.

> **Interpretation**:  
> This provision ensures that the adjustment is not only applied but also treated as a legitimate component of the pension, not as a separate or external benefit. It implies that the increase is integrated into the pension structure as if it were a standard benefit component—similar to how salary increases or allowances are included in a public servant’s compensation.

> **Example**:  
> If a re-employed recipient’s pension is not suspended and the Act provides a 3% increase, that 3% will be applied to the pension amount, just as if it were a built-in component of the pension plan (e.g., like a salary adjustment or benefit enhancement).

**Key Principles and Implications**

- **Alignment with Pension Status**: The regulation ties the application of pension increases directly to the active status of the pension itself. If the pension is off, the increase is off too; if the pension is on, the increase is on.

- **Fairness and Consistency**: By suspending increases during pension suspensions, the regulation avoids overpayment or inconsistencies in pension treatment.

- **Integration into Pension Structure**: The increase is not treated as a standalone payment but as a legitimate part of the pension entitlement, reinforcing its status as a core benefit.

- **Applicability to Re-employed Public Servants**: The rules specifically apply to individuals who return to public service after retirement, highlighting the Act’s focus on adjusting pensions for those who re-enter government employment.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Public Service Pension Adjustment Regulations* establish a clear and conditional mechanism for applying pension increases to re-employed public servants. The increase is only paid when the recipient’s pension is active and not suspended, and it is treated as an integral part of the pension under the governing legislation or pension plan. This ensures that adjustments are both timely and consistent with the recipient’s employment and pension status, promoting fairness and administrative clarity in public service pension administration.
