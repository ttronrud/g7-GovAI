### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title:**  
*Personal Health Information Custodians in Nova Scotia Exemption Order*

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is made under the authority of **paragraph 26(2)(b)** of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*, which allows for exemptions from Part 1 of PIPEDA in specific circumstances involving personal health information.  

The Order is issued by **His Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Industry**, and is based on the determination that the **Personal Health Information Act (PHIA), SNS 2010, c. 41**, which governs the handling of personal health information in Nova Scotia, applies to certain designated health information custodians.

---

### **Key Provisions:**

1. **Applicability of the Personal Health Information Act (PHIA):**  
   The Governor in Council is satisfied that the PHIA — a provincial law in Nova Scotia that is substantially similar in scope and purpose to Part 1 of PIPEDA — applies to specific organizations or entities referred to in the **annexed Order**. These entities are known as *personal health information custodians*.

2. **Exemption from PIPEDA (Part 1):**  
   Any organization that qualifies as a *personal health information custodian* under the PHIA and that collects, uses, or discloses personal health information **within Nova Scotia** is **exempt from the requirements of Part 1 of PIPEDA** in respect to such activities.

   - This exemption specifically covers the **collection, use, and disclosure** of personal health information.
   - The exemption applies **only to the activities occurring in Nova Scotia**, meaning that if such activities take place outside the province, the exemption may not apply.

3. **Purpose of the Exemption:**  
   The exemption is intended to:
   - Allow health-related organizations in Nova Scotia to operate under a **provincial framework** (PHIA) that is tailored to the specific needs of the healthcare sector.
   - Avoid **duplicative or conflicting obligations** between provincial health privacy laws and federal PIPEDA.
   - Ensure that sensitive personal health information is managed in a way that respects patient privacy while allowing healthcare providers and institutions the flexibility to comply with local standards and practices.

4. **Scope and Limitations:**  
   - The exemption is **limited to personal health information**.
   - It applies **only to custodians listed in the annex** of the Order.
   - The exemption does **not extend to other types of personal information** (e.g., financial, identity, or demographic data outside of health).
   - The exemption does **not override** other applicable laws (such as those governing data security, breach notification, or consent) that may apply under PHIA or other legislation.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette* or the official government register, as per standard legal procedure.

### **Background and Context:**

- The *Personal Health Information Act (PHIA)*, enacted in 2010 in Nova Scotia, establishes a comprehensive framework for the protection of personal health information.
- It mirrors the federal *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)* in structure and intent but is adapted to the unique context of healthcare delivery in Nova Scotia.
- This exemption Order ensures that health-related organizations (such as hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and long-term care facilities) are not subject to the broader, more general rules of PIPEDA when handling health data, which could create operational burdens or inconsistencies.

---

### **Implications:**

- **For Health Organizations:**  
  These entities can rely on the PHIA for compliance with privacy obligations related to health information, without having to meet the full scope of PIPEDA’s requirements (e.g., consent, notice, data minimization, and access rights).

- **For Patients:**  
  Patients in Nova Scotia are still protected under the PHIA, which includes rights to access, correct, and request the use or disclosure of their personal health information.

- **For Federal Oversight:**  
  The exemption does not negate federal oversight in areas such as data security or cross-border transfers. It only applies to the **collection, use, and disclosure** of personal health information **within Nova Scotia**.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a **provincial exemption** from federal PIPEDA for designated health information custodians operating in Nova Scotia. By doing so, it promotes consistency, efficiency, and practicality in the management of personal health information within the province, while ensuring that patient privacy and data protection standards remain robust under the PHIA.

> **Note on Typographical Errors:**  
> The text contains repeated and likely erroneous references to "Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Acta" — this is almost certainly a typo. The correct name of the federal law is the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)*. Similarly, "SNS 2010, c. 41" refers to the *Personal Health Information Act, 2010*, which is the provincial law in Nova Scotia.
