**Detailed Summary of the "Total Assets for Supervisability and Public Holding Requirements (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations"**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
- **Recommendation Source**: The Minister of Finance  
- **Legal Authority**: Section 978a of the *Bank Act* (Canada)

This regulation was enacted under the authority granted by section 978a of the *Bank Act*, which empowers the federal government to establish rules regarding the supervision of banks and bank holding companies, particularly concerning the definition of "total assets" for regulatory purposes.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **define what constitutes "total assets"** for a bank or a bank holding company at any given point in time. This definition is critical for compliance with specific provisions in the *Bank Act* that relate to:

- **Supervisability** (i.e., the ability of the Bank of Canada or other regulators to oversee a financial institution)
- **Public holding requirements** (i.e., the requirement that certain institutions must have public shareholders or be publicly held to meet transparency and accountability standards)

Specifically, the regulation applies to subsections:
- **54.1(4)** – Relates to the supervisability of banks and bank holding companies
- **386(3)** – Concerns the public holding requirements for bank holding companies
- **895(3)** – Addresses the reporting and transparency obligations of banks

### **3. Definition of "Total Assets"**

The regulation provides a clear and standardized definition of "total assets" as follows:

> *Total assets, in respect of a bank or a bank holding company, at a particular time, means the total value of the assets that would be reported on its balance sheet, prepared as at that time in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications of the Superintendent referred to in subsection 308(4) or 840(4) of the Bank Act, as the case may be.*

#### Key Elements of the Definition:

- **Balance Sheet Basis**: The total assets are derived from the balance sheet of the institution as of a specific date.
- **Accounting Standards**: The balance sheet must be prepared in accordance with the **accounting principles and specifications** established by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions**.
  - For **banks**, the relevant standard is **subsection 308(4)** of the *Bank Act*, which refers to the accounting standards set out by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (SFI).
  - For **bank holding companies**, the applicable standard is **subsection 840(4)** of the *Bank Act*, which also governs the accounting practices for holding companies.
- **"As at that time"**: The asset values are based on the financial position of the institution on a specific date (e.g., the end of a reporting period), not estimated or adjusted values.

This ensures consistency and transparency in how total assets are calculated across financial institutions under regulatory oversight.

### **4. Effective Date and Implementation**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the day that **subsection 54.1(4) of the Bank Act** comes into force.
- **Enabling Legislation**: Subsection 54.1(4) was enacted by **section 57 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act**, which was passed as part of **Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001**.
- **Actual Effective Date**: The regulations were first published on **October 24, 2001**, and became effective on that date (as noted in the "Note" at the end of the regulation).

> *Note: These regulations are in force as of October 24, 2001 (SI/2001-102).*

This timing aligns with broader reforms in Canada’s financial regulatory framework aimed at improving transparency, accountability, and supervisory effectiveness.

### **5. Repeal Clause**

- The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that it may be superseded or replaced by future amendments or new legislation.
- This reflects the dynamic nature of financial regulation, where definitions and requirements evolve in response to changing economic conditions, risks, or legislative updates.

---

### **6. Significance and Impact**

- **Regulatory Clarity**: Provides a clear, legally binding definition of "total assets" to prevent ambiguity in supervisory and reporting requirements.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all banks and bank holding companies use the same accounting standards when determining their total assets, promoting fairness and comparability.
- **Transparency**: Supports public accountability by enabling regulators and the public to assess the size and financial health of institutions based on standardized metrics.
- **Supervisory Effectiveness**: Enables the Bank of Canada and other regulators to assess risks, determine capital adequacy, and enforce public holding requirements more effectively.

### **7. Contextual Background**

These regulations were introduced during a period of financial reform in Canada, following the 1990s and early 2000s financial sector modernization efforts. The 2001 amendments to the *Bank Act* (particularly through the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*) aimed to:
- Strengthen consumer protection
- Improve transparency in financial institutions
- Enhance the supervisory framework for banks and holding companies

By defining total assets precisely, the regulation supports the broader goals of financial stability, market integrity, and public confidence in the banking system.
