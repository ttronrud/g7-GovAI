**Detailed Summary of the Governor in Council Authority Delegation Order**

---

**Title of the Order:**  
*Governor in Council Authority Delegation Order*

---

### **Overview**  
This regulatory instrument formally delegates specific powers and authorities from the Governor in Council (the federal government's executive authority) to designated federal ministers under the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act (AWPAA)*. The purpose is to enhance administrative efficiency and ensure effective enforcement of pollution prevention measures in Canada’s Arctic regions by assigning responsibility to relevant ministers based on their areas of administrative jurisdiction.

The delegation is structured to align authority with the administrative responsibilities of the respective ministers—particularly in relation to natural resource management in the Arctic.

---

### **Key Provisions and Delegation Structure**

#### **1. Delegation to the Minister of Transport**  
The Minister of Transport is authorized to exercise powers and perform acts that the Governor in Council is otherwise empowered to do under the following provisions of the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act*:

- **Subsection 5(2)**  
  → Relates to the regulation of pollution resulting from **a deposit of waste from a ship**.  
  → The Minister may issue directives, impose conditions, or take enforcement actions when pollution arises from **ship-generated waste** (e.g., ballast water, sewage, or other marine discharges).

- **Subsection 6(2)**  
  → Applies when pollution results from a **deposit of waste from a ship**.  
  → This provision allows for the Minister to take action to prevent or respond to pollution caused by **ship-related waste dumping**.

- **Paragraph 8(1)(d)**  
  → Pertains to **pollution resulting from the discharge or release of hazardous substances** from vessels.  
  → The Minister may act to prevent, investigate, or respond to such discharges originating from maritime activities.

- **Subsection 13(1)**  
  → Authorizes the Governor in Council to issue regulations or take actions to prevent pollution in the Arctic.  
  → The Minister of Transport may implement or enforce these measures in cases involving **ship-related pollution**.

- **Subsection 14(1)**  
  → Grants authority to designate or appoint pollution prevention officers (PPOs) and to take enforcement actions.  
  → The Minister of Transport may act under this provision to manage pollution risks in maritime contexts.

> ✅ **Scope**: This delegation applies **only to pollution originating from ship waste**.

#### **2. Delegation to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)**  
The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is authorized to act under the following provisions, **in relation to areas where the Minister has administrative responsibility for natural resources** in the Canadian Arctic:

- **Subsection 5(1)**  
  → General power to prevent pollution from activities in the Arctic.  
  → Applies to pollution not directly caused by ships (e.g., from land-based operations, Indigenous activities, or resource development).

- **Subsection 6(2)**  
  → Applies when pollution **does not result from a ship deposit of waste**.  
  → The Minister may intervene in pollution events from non-maritime sources (e.g., mining, drilling, or industrial operations).

- **Paragraphs 8(1)(a), (b), and (c)**  
  → These refer to pollution from:
    - **Industrial activities** (8(1)(a))
    - **Discharges from land-based facilities** (8(1)(b))
    - **Discharges from operations involving natural resource extraction** (8(1)(c))  
  → The Minister may regulate or respond to such pollution within their jurisdiction.

- **Section 10**  
  → Addresses the establishment of pollution prevention plans and reporting requirements.  
  → The Minister may require or approve pollution prevention plans for operations in their areas.

- **Subsection 14(1)**  
  → Allows for the designation of pollution prevention officers (PPOs), **but only up to the powers specified in subsections 15(1) and (2)**.  
  → The Minister **cannot** appoint PPOs with enhanced or broader enforcement powers beyond those defined in 15(1) and (2).

> ⚠️ **Limitation**: The Minister **cannot** designate PPOs with powers exceeding those in subsections 15(1) and (2).

> 📍 **Jurisdictional Basis**: This delegation applies only to **Arctic areas where MIAND has administrative responsibility for natural resources** (e.g., Inuit regions, Nunavut, Nunavik, etc.).

---

#### **3. Delegation to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (MEMR)**  
The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources is similarly authorized under the same provisions, **in relation to areas where the Minister has administrative responsibility for natural resources** in the Canadian Arctic:

- **Subsection 5(1)**  
  → General pollution prevention authority.

- **Subsection 6(2)**  
  → In cases where pollution does **not** stem from ship waste.

- **Paragraphs 8(1)(a), (b), and (c)**  
  → Applies to pollution from industrial, land-based, and resource extraction activities.

- **Section 10**  
  → Powers to require or approve pollution prevention plans.

- **Subsection 14(1)**  
  → Authority to designate pollution prevention officers, **but only within the limits of subsections 15(1) and (15)(2)**.  
  → Cannot appoint officers with greater powers than those defined in those subsections.

> 📍 **Jurisdictional Basis**: This delegation applies to **Arctic areas where MEMR has administrative responsibility for natural resources** (e.g., offshore oil and gas, mining operations in the Northwest Territories, etc.).

---

### **Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- **Pollution from ship waste** is **exclusively** within the jurisdiction of the **Minister of Transport**.
- **Non-ship-related pollution** (e.g., from mining, drilling, industrial sites) is shared between MIAND and MEMR, depending on which minister has administrative oversight.
- **No delegation of enhanced PPO powers**: Neither MIAND nor MEMR may appoint pollution prevention officers with powers beyond those explicitly set out in **subsections 15(1) and (2)** of the Act. This ensures a cap on enforcement authority to maintain consistency and accountability.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

1. **Efficiency and Responsiveness**:  
   By delegating authority to the ministers most directly involved in managing specific activities (e.g., transport for maritime pollution, natural resource development for land-based pollution), the government ensures timely and context-appropriate responses.

2. **Jurisdictional Clarity**:  
   The delegation is tied to administrative responsibility, ensuring that pollution prevention actions are taken by the appropriate authority based on the nature and location of the activity.

3. **Risk Management in the Arctic**:  
   The Arctic presents unique environmental challenges due to its fragile ecosystems and remote locations. Delegating authority allows for more agile and localized enforcement of pollution prevention measures.

4. **Legal Consistency and Accountability**:  
   Limiting the powers of pollution prevention officers (especially in MIAND and MEMR) ensures that enforcement actions remain within the legal framework and do not exceed the scope of delegated authority.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order effectively streamlines the implementation of pollution prevention measures under the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act* by:

- Assigning **ship-related pollution** to the **Minister of Transport**,
- Assigning **non-ship-related pollution** (from land-based or resource development activities) to the **Ministers of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and **Energy, Mines and Resources**, based on their administrative responsibilities,
- Ensuring that **no minister exceeds the powers defined in subsections 15(1) and (15)(2)** when designating pollution prevention officers.

This delegation strengthens the federal government’s ability to protect Arctic waters from pollution while respecting jurisdictional boundaries and maintaining legal accountability.
