### **2. Definitions**

Key definitions used throughout the regulation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*. |
| **Designated entity** | An entity that is *not* an insurance company, a securities dealer, or an entity controlled by one of those. This category includes other financial or non-financial entities under the bank holding company’s control. |
| **Insurance company** | Any insurance company incorporated under Canadian federal or provincial law. |
| **Minority interest** | An equity interest in an entity controlled by a bank holding company that is held by someone other than the bank holding company or by an entity controlled by it. |
| **Securities dealer** | An entity defined in paragraph (g) of the definition of *financial institution* under section 2 of the Bank Act. This includes firms engaged in buying and selling securities. |

> These definitions establish the scope of entities subject to the regulatory capital rules and clarify what constitutes "control" and "ownership" for capital calculations.

### **3. Core Formula for Regulatory Capital**

The **regulatory capital** of a bank holding company at any given time is calculated using the following formula:

> **Regulatory Capital = (Total of: Shareholders’ equity + Minority interests + Subordinated indebtedness)**  
> **+ (Amount of goodwill)**

Where:
- The amounts are based on the **financial statements** of the bank holding company prepared **as at that time**.
- The financial statements must follow the **accounting principles and specifications** set out by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** under subsection 840(4) of the Bank Act.
- **Goodwill** is included only if it would be recognized in those financial statements (i.e., as per accounting standards).

> **Purpose**: This formula ensures that regulatory capital reflects the actual economic value and financial strength of the bank holding company, including both equity and certain debt instruments.

---

### **4. Conditions for Including Subordinated Debt or Preferred Shares**

An amount can be included in regulatory capital **only if** the security meets **all** of the following criteria:

1. **Subordination**: The security is **subordinate in right of payment** to all other liabilities of the issuing entity, **except** those that rank equally with or are subordinate to it.
2. **Fully Paid-Up**: The security must be **fully paid up** (i.e., no outstanding capital or unpaid portions).
3. **Term Requirements**:
   - For **subordinated indebtedness** or **preferred shares**:
     - The security must have an **initial minimum term of five years or more**, or **no fixed term**.
     - It **cannot be redeemed or purchased for cancellation** during the first five years after issuance.

> **Rationale**: These conditions ensure that only long-term, non-redeemable, and truly subordinated instruments are counted, reducing risk and ensuring stability in the capital base.

### **5. Adjustments to Regulatory Capital (Under Sections 938–940 of the Bank Act)**

For the purposes of **sections 938 to 940 of the Bank Act**, the regulatory capital of a bank holding company is adjusted downward (i.e., reduced) by the following amounts:

#### **(a) Equity or Subordinated Debt of Controlled Insurance Companies or Securities Dealers**
- All amounts representing:
  - Shareholders’ equity or subordinated indebtedness of an **insurance company** or **securities dealer** that is **controlled by** the bank holding company, or
  - An entity controlled by such an insurance or securities dealer,
  - **That is included** in the bank holding company’s regulatory capital under section 2.

> **Purpose**: Prevents double-counting of capital. If a bank holding company owns an insurance or securities dealer, the capital of that subsidiary is not added again to the parent’s regulatory capital.

#### **(b) Investments in Insurance or Securities Dealers (that are part of their capital)**
- All amounts representing:
  - Investments (other than equity or subordinated debt) made by the bank holding company or a designated entity it controls in an insurance company or securities dealer **controlled by it**,
  - **If** such investment is part of the capital of the subsidiary.

> **Rationale**: Prevents overstatement of capital when the investment is used to support the capital structure of a subsidiary.

#### **(c) Loans to Insurance or Securities Dealers (that are part of their capital)**
- All amounts representing:
  - Loans (other than subordinated debt) made by the bank holding company or a designated entity it controls to an insurance or securities dealer **controlled by it**,
  - **If** the loan is part of the capital of the recipient.

> **Rationale**: Avoids counting loans as capital when they are actually used to bolster the capital base of a subsidiary.

#### **(d) Minority Interests in Controlled Insurance or Securities Dealers**
- All amounts representing:
  - Minority interests in an insurance or securities dealer controlled by the bank holding company, or
  - In an entity controlled by such a company,
  - That are included in the bank holding company’s regulatory capital under section 2.

> **Rationale**: Prevents double-counting of minority equity interests that are already part of the parent’s capital calculation.

### **6. Definition of "Capital" for Adjustments**

For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(b) and (c), the term **"capital"** is defined as:

- For an **insurance company** subject to the *Insurance Companies Act*:  
  → Its **regulatory capital** as defined in the *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations*.

- For **any other insurance company or securities dealer**:  
  → The amount that would be treated as **capital** by the **regulatory body** that oversees that entity (e.g., the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions or the Office of the Insurance Commissioner).

> **Purpose**: Ensures consistency in capital measurement across different types of financial institutions and regulatory regimes.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the date that **sections 938 to 940 of the Bank Act** are enacted and come into force.

> **Source**: Section 183 of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*, Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001.  
> **Effective Date**: October 24, 2001 (as noted in SI/2001-102).

## **Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk-Based Capital Measurement** | Ensures that bank holding companies maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses, especially in stressed conditions. |
| **Prevention of Capital Overstatement** | Avoids double-counting capital in subsidiaries or in investments/loans that are part of a subsidiary’s capital base. |
| **Subordination and Long-Term Stability** | Only instruments with long maturities and subordinated rights are counted, promoting financial resilience. |
| **Regulatory Consistency** | Aligns capital calculations with the regulatory frameworks governing insurance and securities dealers. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires financial statements prepared under standardized accounting principles, ensuring comparability and oversight. |

## **Practical Application Example**

Suppose a bank holding company (BHC) owns:
- A securities dealer (SD)
- An insurance company (IC)
- A minority interest in a third-party entity (E)

Under these regulations:
- The regulatory capital of BHC includes its own equity, subordinated debt, and goodwill.
- However, the capital of SD and IC **is not added again** to BHC’s regulatory capital.
- Any investment in SD or IC that is part of their capital is **subtracted**.
- Any loan to SD or IC that is part of their capital is **subtracted**.
- Any minority interest in SD or IC is **subtracted** if included in BHC’s capital.

This ensures a **clean, accurate measure** of the bank holding company’s own capital, free from inflated or double-counted values.

## **Conclusion**

The *Regulatory Capital (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* provide a **comprehensive, risk-sensitive framework** for determining the regulatory capital of bank holding companies in Canada. By:

- Defining clear criteria for inclusion of equity, debt, and goodwill,
- Establishing strict subordination and term requirements,
- Adjusting capital to avoid double-counting in controlled entities,
- Aligning with the capital standards of insurance and securities regulators,

the regulations enhance **financial stability**, **transparency**, and **regulatory consistency** in the Canadian financial system.

These rules are essential for ensuring that bank holding companies maintain adequate capital buffers to protect depositors, investors, and the broader economy
