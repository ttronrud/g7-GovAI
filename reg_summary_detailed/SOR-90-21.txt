**Detailed Summary of the Non-smokers’ Health Regulations (S.C. 1989, c. 7, s. 1; R.S., c. 15 (4th Supp.))**

---

### **Overview**
The *Non-smokers’ Health Regulations* are a set of rules established under the *Non-smokers’ Health Act* to protect the health of non-smokers by restricting smoking in workplaces and public spaces. These regulations were enacted in 1989 and came into force with the Act, with the goal of reducing exposure to secondhand smoke in enclosed environments where people are working or using public services.

The regulations define designated smoking areas and rooms, outline obligations for employers, and establish penalties for violations. Importantly, they contain provisions for transitional and phased implementation, especially in transportation sectors (air, rail, and maritime), and include provisions that respect collective agreements.

### **Key Definitions and Terminology**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Non-smokers’ Health Act*.
- **Living accommodation**: Separate living or sleeping quarters set aside by an employer for employees at a workplace.
- **Designated smoking room/area**: Specific areas where smoking is permitted under strict conditions, designed to minimize exposure to non-smokers.

> *Note: Several outdated terms such as "ASHRAE" and "entity charter" have been repealed (SOR/2007-233, s. 1 and s. 2), and are no longer in force.*

## **Core Provisions**

---

### **1. Designated Smoking Areas and Rooms (Section 3)**

Employers may designate the following as **designated smoking rooms or areas**:

#### **a) Living Accommodations**
Any separate living or sleeping quarters provided for employees at a workplace.

#### **b) Motor Vehicles and Equipment**
Any motor vehicle, lighthouse, crane cab, caboose, locomotive, or other room/area within a workplace that:
- Is not incorporated into another work space;
- Does not share a ventilation system with any other area;
- Is accessible by only one person during a shift.

#### **c) Ship Areas**
Any room on a ship where only one person normally has access during a shift.

> **Exception**: Paragraph (1)(b) does *not* apply to these types of rooms or areas.

---

### **2. Employer Obligations (Section 4)**

Every employer must ensure that:
- All designated smoking areas are equipped with **ashtrays or non-combustible covered receptacles** for waste disposal.
- All such areas are clearly marked with a **sign** that:
  - Meets the requirements in subsection 6(2);
  - Is clearly visible to anyone approaching the area.

> This ensures visibility and compliance with health and safety standards.

---

### **3. Public Notification (Section 5)**

Employers must inform both employees and members of the public about smoking policies:

#### **For Workplaces under Employer Control:**
- Smoking is **prohibited in all workspaces** except in designated smoking rooms or areas.
- Employees must be informed **in writing or via visible signs** of:
  - The prohibition of smoking;
  - The locations of any designated smoking areas.

#### **For Public Workspaces (e.g., public facilities, transport hubs):**
- A **clearly visible sign** must be posted at each entrance to inform the public:
  - Smoking is prohibited in the space; OR
  - Smoking is allowed only in designated smoking rooms or areas.

> The signs must be:
- In writing, or
- Substantially in the form of an appropriate symbol (as defined in **Schedule I**) in the specified colours.

---

### **4. Special Provisions for Transportation Services**

#### **Rail Transport (Trains)**

An employer operating a train may designate:
- Any **bedroom, roomette, or drawing room** in a sleeping car or baggage crew car as a **designated smoking room**.

For **passenger seating areas** on trains, the following limits apply:

| Service Type | Designation Limit |
|------------|-------------------|
| Corridor service (e.g., Quebec City to Windsor) | ≤1/3 of seating capacity designated |
| Regional service (local stops) | ≤1/3 of seating capacity designated |
| Remote service (rural access) | ≤1/3 of seating capacity designated |
| Tourism service (seasonal) | ≤1/3 of seating capacity designated |
| Transcontinental service (e.g., Halifax–Montreal, Toronto–Vancouver) | ≤1/3 of seating capacity designated, and only on ≤1/3 of passenger cars |

> These limits ensure that smoking is restricted to a small portion of the train, protecting non-smoking passengers.

#### **Maritime Transport (Ships)**

- Employers may designate:
  - Any **employee leisure/recreational area** as a designated smoking area.
  - Any **passenger cabin** as a designated smoking room.
  - Any **passenger area** (excluding cabins) as a designated smoking area, **provided**:
    - The total surface area of all such areas does not exceed **30%** of the total enclosed passenger areas (excluding cabins).

> This ensures that smoking areas remain limited and do not dominate passenger spaces.

#### **Aircraft (Private Aircraft)**

- An employer operating a **private aircraft** may designate any area or all of the aircraft as a designated smoking area **for any flight**.

> This provision is more flexible and applies only to private use, not commercial operations.

---

### **5. Commercial Aircraft (International Flights)**

For commercial aircraft operating **specified international flights**, the following rules apply:

#### **Definition of "Specified International Flight"**
A flight segment qualifies if:
- It is between Canada and a point outside Canada with a scheduled duration of **over six hours**;
- It occurs **entirely outside Canada**; or
- It occurs **entirely within Canada**, but:
  - Originated outside Canada;
  - Only passengers who boarded outside Canada are on board;
  - Smoking was permitted on the previous segment.

#### **Monthly Quota System (Phased Reduction)**

The maximum percentage of passenger seats that can be designated for smoking in a month is reduced over time:

| Period | Monthly Quota |
|--------|----------------|
| July 1, 1990 – June 30, 1991 | 75% of seat allocation |
| July 1, 1991 – June 30, 1992 | 50% |
| July 1, 1992 – June 30, 1993 | 25% |
| July 1, 1993 – June 30, 1994 | 15% |

> **Seat allocation** is defined as:
- 20% of all passenger seats on all specified international flights (for Canadian carriers who began operations after May 1990);
- Or, 75% of seat allocation for the first phase.

> **Rule**: No employer may designate smoking areas that include **more than the monthly quota** of passenger seats in any given month.

> **Note**: This entire section **ceases to have effect on June 30, 1994**.

#### **Canada–Japan Flights**

- Employers operating flights between Canada and Japan may designate smoking areas.
- The maximum allowed is **15% of total passenger seats** available during any given month.
- This provision **ceases to have effect on August 31, 1994**.

> These provisions reflect a phased transition toward complete smoking bans in international aviation.

### **6. Enforcement and Penalties (Section 14)**

The Act provides for fines for violations. The applicable fines depend on the nature of the violation and the number of offenses:

| Violation Type | First Offence | Second Offence | Subsequent Offences |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **General offense (e.g., smoking in prohibited area)** | $50.00 | $75.00 | $100.00 |
| **More serious offense (e.g., violation of signage or public notice)** | $500.00 | $1,000.00 | $5,000.00 (third offense), $10,000.00 (each subsequent offense) |
| **Administrative offense (e.g., failure to post signs)** | $250.00 | $500.00 | $1,000.00 |

> The forms for **tickets** and **information** (legal documents used in proceedings) are specified in **Schedule III**.

---

### **7. Transitional Provisions (Section 16)**

Despite the general prohibitions in the regulations, **designations made prior to the coming into force of these regulations**—specifically those under the old version of the regulations—**may continue to apply** if they were:
- Made under sections 3, 14, or 15 of the prior regulations;
- Made in accordance with a **collective agreement** or other **contractual agreement**.

> This provision ensures that existing workplace agreements are respected and not invalidated by the new rules, allowing for a smooth transition.

## **Key Features and Policy Intent**

1. **Health Protection**: The primary objective is to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke in enclosed workplaces and public transport.
2. **Phased Implementation**: Smoking restrictions were introduced gradually, especially in aviation, to allow industry adaptation.
3. **Workplace Flexibility**: Recognizes that certain areas (e.g
