Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation, which is part of the *Special Import Measures Act* (S.C. 1983-84, c. 25), as amended and now **repealed by SOR/2019-314, s. 2**.

## 🔍 **Regulation Summary: Special Import Measures (Repealed – SOR/2019-314, s. 2)**

### 📌 **Overview**
This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance under **Section 97 of the Special Import Measures Act**, establishes detailed rules for determining **normal value** and **cost of production** of imported goods. These rules are used in assessing whether certain imports are being sold below fair value (i.e., dumping), which could harm domestic industries.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2019-314, section 2**, and is no longer in force. It was replaced by updated provisions in modern trade regulations, particularly under the *Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement* and subsequent tariff and anti-dumping frameworks.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Special Import Measures Act* |
| **American Secretariat** | Refers to the U.S. section of the Secretariat under the Free Trade Agreement. The operation of this body is **suspended** during specific periods (subsections 56(1.02), 58(1.2), 59(3.3), and section 77.038) unless a definitive decision was made before those provisions came into effect. |
| **Officer** | As defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Customs Act* (e.g., customs officers, border officials). |
| **Pre-competitive development activity** | Repealed – no longer applies. |
| **Production** | Includes **manufacturing, growing, and processing**. |
| **Start-up period of production** | A defined time frame that begins when new production facilities are first used for **commercial production**, or when a new or substantially different product begins commercial production requiring **new or substantially different equipment/technology**. It ends when production levels are no longer limited by technical difficulties related to those new systems or products. |

## 📊 Purpose and Scope

The regulation provides detailed rules to ensure **fair and accurate comparisons** between the **price of imported goods** and the **normal value** of like goods in the country of export. This is essential for determining whether goods are being dumped (sold below fair value), which may lead to anti-dumping or countervailing duties.

It applies specifically to:
- Determining **normal value** under Sections 15, 19, and 20 of the Act.
- Calculating **cost of production**, **profit**, and **administrative/selling costs**.
- Adjusting prices to reflect differences in **quantity, quality, delivery, discounts, taxes, and sales conditions**.

## 🔄 Price Adjustment Rules (for Determining Normal Value)

These rules ensure that the price of "like goods" in the country of export reflects the **true market value** of goods sold to the Canadian importer — accounting for commercial differences.

### 1. **Quantity Discounts**
- If the importer bought in **larger quantities**, the price of like goods must be adjusted to reflect the **discount** normally granted in such bulk sales.
- If the discount cannot be determined:
  - **Add** the estimated cost that the exporter would incur to sell in those quantities.
  - **Subtract** the estimated savings the exporter would gain from such a sale.

### 2. **Differences in Quality, Design, Warranty, Delivery, or Conditions of Sale**
If the goods sold to Canada differ from like goods in the country of export in any of the following ways:
- Quality, structure, design, or material
- Warranty or performance guarantee
- Time between order and shipment
- Other sales conditions (excluding standard ones)

👉 Then the price of like goods must be adjusted:
- **If the price is higher**: Deduct the estimated difference.
- **If the price is lower**: Add the estimated difference.

> *This ensures that differences in product features don’t distort the comparison.*

### 3. **Rebates, Deferred Discounts, or Cash Discounts**
- If such discounts are **commonly granted** in the country of export, they must be **deducted** from the price of like goods **if the sale to Canada would qualify** for them.

### 4. **Delivered Price Adjustments**
- If like goods are sold at a **delivered price**, deduct the **cost of delivery** to the buyer.
- If like goods are generally sold at a **common delivered price** within a **transportation zone** (e.g., a region where shipping costs are standardized), deduct the **average delivery cost** to destinations within that zone.

### 5. **Substitution of Purchasers**
- If buyers **one level below** the importer (e.g., wholesalers instead of retailers) have been substituted:
  - Deduct costs incurred due to **additional activities** required to serve those lower-tier buyers.
  - If no data exists, deduct **no more than the typical discount** offered to similar-tier buyers in the country of export.

### 6. **Taxes and Duties**
- If the **importer bears no taxes/duties** on the goods (but the like goods in the country of export do), deduct those **taxes/duties** from the price of like goods.

## 💰 Determining "Reasonable Amount for Profits" and "Administrative/Selling Costs"

These are key components in calculating normal value.

### ✅ **Reasonable Amount for Profits**
The profit margin is derived from **sales data** in the country of export, with a hierarchy of fallbacks:

| Case | Description |
|------|-------------|
| (i) | If the **exporter** has made multiple sales of like goods in the country of export → use **weighted average profit** from those sales. |
| (ii) | If (i) doesn’t apply, but the exporter has sold goods of the **same general category** → use weighted average profit. |
| (iii) | If (i) and (ii) don’t apply, but **other producers** have sold like goods → use weighted average profit. |
| (iv) | If (i)–(iii) don’t apply, but other producers sold goods of the **next largest category** → use weighted average profit. |
| (v) | If (i)–(iv) don’t apply, but producers sold goods of the **next largest group/range** → use weighted average profit. |

> ✅ **Key Principle**: The most relevant sales data is used to ensure a **proper comparison**.

### ✅ **Reasonable Amount for Administrative, Selling, and All Other Costs**
Includes costs not part of production, such as:
- Marketing
- Distribution
- Warranty
- Design/engineering (if not included in production cost)

These are determined by:
- Aggregating costs that are **reasonably attributable** to production and domestic sales.
- Must satisfy the **greatest number of conditions** in paragraphs 15(a) to (e) of the Act.
- If no amount can be determined, use **all such costs reasonably attributable** to production and sale.

> ⚠️ **Note**: If the **exporter is not the producer**, profits and costs must include:
- Profits earned by the **producer** and any **subsequent vendors** in the supply chain.
- Costs incurred by the **producer** and vendors in selling to the exporter.

## 🏭 Cost of Production (Section 11 & 11.1)

### General Rule:
Cost of production = All costs:
- Attributable to or related to the **production** of the goods, or
- Directly attributable to the **design or engineering** of the goods.

### Special Case: Input Costs from Associated Persons
If an input is purchased from an **associated person** (e.g., a related company), and is a **significant factor** in production:

> The cost is taken as the **greater of**:
1. The price paid by the exporter or producer to the associated person,
2. The cost incurred by the associated person in producing the input (including administrative, selling, and other costs),
3. The **market price** of the same or similar input in the country of export — if sufficient data exists from:
   - Non-associated sales in the same or similar quantities, or
   - Published market prices.

### Exception: Market Conditions Preventing Proper Comparison
If the President determines that a **market situation** prevents a fair comparison (e.g., lack of transparency, monopoly), then the input cost is adjusted to reflect **actual cost** using one of these options:
1. Price of inputs sold to exporters or producers in the country of export.
2. Price of inputs sold from the country of export to a third country.
3. Published prices in the country of export.
4. Price of inputs produced in a third country, **adjusted** for price differences between countries.
5. Published prices outside the country of export, **adjusted** for comparability.

## 🔧 Design/Engineering Costs (Section 11.1)

If direct design/engineering costs cannot be determined for a specific product, but **can be determined** for similar goods in the same category:
