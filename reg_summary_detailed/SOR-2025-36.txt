**Detailed Summary of the *Certain Products Containing Toxic Substances Regulations* (S.C. 2023, c. 12, s. 55)**

---

### **Overview and Legal Basis**

The *Certain Products Containing Toxic Substances Regulations* (the "Regulations") are a set of environmental regulations made under **subsection 93(1)d of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**. These Regulations were introduced by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, following a formal consultation process.

#### **Key Procedural Background:**
- On **November 18, 2023**, the Minister of the Environment published a **proposed version** of the Regulations in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing public notice and an opportunity for stakeholders to:
  - Submit **comments** or
  - File a **notice of objection**, requesting a **board of review** and providing reasons for the objection.
- The **National Advisory Committee** was also given the opportunity to provide advice under section 6c of CEPA 1999.
- The Governor in Council concluded, under subsection 93(4), that the proposed Regulations **do not conflict** with other federal environmental or health legislation and **provide sufficient protection** to human health and the environment.

Thus, the Regulations were formally adopted and made under **section 93(1)d** of CEPA 1999.

## **Core Objectives of the Regulations**

The primary goals of these Regulations are:

1. **To regulate specific products containing toxic substances** that pose risks to human health and the environment.
2. **To ensure that manufacturers and importers** of such products demonstrate:
   - Technical and economic feasibility of alternatives.
   - A viable plan to minimize or eliminate environmental and health risks.
3. **To phase out or restrict** the use of certain toxic substances in specific product categories over time.
4. **To enforce accountability** through mandatory recordkeeping and permit systems.

## **Key Definitions and Scope**

### **Regulated Product**
A product that:
- Belongs to a **product category** specified in **Sections 13, 17, or 21**, and  
- Contains a **toxic substance** listed in **Schedule 1** of CEPA 1999.

> *Note: The term "toxic substance" refers to substances identified as harmful under CEPA, such as coal tars, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 2-butoxyethanol.*

### **Product Category**
A product belongs to a category if:
- It is **labeled or documented** (on container or in product documentation) as belonging to that category.
- The manufacturer or importer provides evidence of such classification.

> *Example: A product labeled as a "roofing sealant" is considered to belong to the roofing sealant category.*

### **Exclusions**
- **Waste** or products at the **end of their useful life** that are intended for **recycling** are **not covered**.
- The Regulations **do not apply** to products that are **in transit** through Canada (from outside to outside Canada).

| **Annual production/import/sales volume** | Estimated volume per calendar year (with units) |
| **Intended and potential uses** | Description of how the product is used |
| **Feasibility of alternatives** | Evidence that **no technically or economically feasible alternative** exists that: <br> - Achieves the same function, and <br> - Has a less harmful environmental or health impact |
