**Detailed Summary of the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Regulations (S.C. 2012, c. 16)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Pooled Registered Pension Plans Regulations* (S.C. 2012, c. 16) are a set of administrative rules made under **section 76 of the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act (PRPP Act)**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. These regulations provide detailed operational, investment, governance, and disclosure requirements for **Pooled Registered Pension Plans (PRPPs)** — a type of registered pension plan designed to offer cost-effective, pooled investment options for members, particularly in Canada’s retirement savings system.

The regulations aim to ensure **transparency, fairness, prudent investment practices, risk management, and accountability** in how PRPPs manage member funds, especially in relation to conflicts of interest, related-party transactions, and investment limits.
