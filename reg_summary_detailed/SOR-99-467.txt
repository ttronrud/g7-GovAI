### **5. Assessment Criteria for Indemnity Approval**

The Minister evaluates each application based on **seven core criteria**:

| Criterion | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Canadian Theme & Heritage** | If the exhibition is Canadian in theme, it must promote exposure to Canada’s human, natural, artistic, and scientific heritage, enhancing public awareness and appreciation. |
| **2. Global Significance** | If the exhibition has global relevance, it must feature objects of cultural significance in archaeology, prehistory, history, sociology, ethnography, art, or science. |
| **3. High Museological Standards** | The exhibition must meet professional museum standards in presentation, curation, and handling. |
| **4. Knowledge Advancement** | The exhibition must contribute to public understanding and knowledge of its theme or subject matter. |
| **5. Public Access & Awareness** | Maximum public access and awareness must be achieved at every venue. |
| **6. Minimal Risk of Damage** | The risk of damage due to size, fragility, or material must be minimal. |
| **7. Safe Handling and Transport** | Objects must be transported by appropriate means and competent shippers; packed and crated to withstand normal transit hazards; unpacked and installed by trained professionals. |
| **8. Facility Standards** | All hosting institutions must meet museum industry standards in security, fire protection, and environmental control (e.g., temperature, humidity). |
| **9. Security Measures** | Appropriate enhanced security must be in place during display, storage, and transit. |
| **10. Environmental Controls** | If required, objects must be maintained under specific environmental conditions (lighting, temperature, humidity, vibration) throughout transit and display. |
| **11. Safety & Security** | Objects must remain safe and secure at all times — during transit, storage, and on display. |

> These criteria ensure that only exhibitions that meet rigorous cultural, safety, and logistical standards receive indemnity support.
