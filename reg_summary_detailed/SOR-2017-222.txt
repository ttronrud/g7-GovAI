These regulations, made under **Section 33 of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act (NSICPA)**, establish detailed operational and security protocols governing how members of the **National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICP)** access, handle, discuss, and protect **sensitive information**. The regulations are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of information related to national security and intelligence matters, while maintaining accountability and transparency within the Committee.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Act* (NSICPA), which provides the legal foundation for the Committee’s mandate and powers.

2. **Member**  
   A member of the NSICP — individuals elected or appointed to serve on the Committee who are responsible for exercising powers and performing duties related to national security and intelligence oversight.

3. **Restricted Area**  
   A physically defined area monitored continuously with the following characteristics:
   - Access is strictly limited to authorized personnel and escorted visitors.
   - Access logs are maintained and regularly audited to ensure accountability.

4. **Sensitive Information**  
   Information or documents that:
   - A member obtains, creates, or accesses during the performance of their duties under the Act; **and**
   - Is being actively protected by a government department due to its national security implications.

### **Security Clearances and Personal Circumstances Reporting**

- **Necessary Security Clearance**:  
  A member must hold a **Top Secret security clearance**, issued by the **Clerk of the Privy Council**, to access sensitive information.

- **Reporting of Personal Changes**:  
  Members must **immediately report to the Clerk of the Privy Council** any changes in personal circumstances that could affect their security clearance, including:
  - Criminal conviction;
  - Being subject to a law enforcement investigation or action;
  - Association with known criminals;
  - Significant changes in personal financial status (e.g., bankruptcy, large asset transfers).

> *Purpose*: To ensure ongoing suitability and reliability of members in handling sensitive national security information.

---

### **Security Briefings**

- A member must attend a **security briefing provided by the Secretariat** before:
  1. First accessing sensitive information; and  
  2. Accessing sensitive information in a category for which they have not previously received a briefing.

> *Purpose*: To ensure members understand the risks, rules, and procedures associated with handling sensitive information.

---

### **Handling and Access to Sensitive Information**

- **Physical Access Requirement**:  
  A member may **only handle sensitive information while physically inside a restricted area**.

- **Discussion Restrictions**:  
  Sensitive information may **only be discussed within a restricted area**.  
  Outside of such areas, members must **avoid indirectly disclosing** sensitive information when discussing their powers, duties, or functions under the Act.

> *Note*: Indirect disclosure includes references that could reasonably lead to the inference of sensitive details (e.g., "We were told that X occurred" without specifying what X is).

- **Transportation of Sensitive Information**:  
  - May only be transported **directly from one restricted area to another**.  
  - Must use **equipment provided by the Secretariat** for this purpose.  
  - Must maintain **physical control** of the equipment throughout the transport.

> *Purpose*: Prevents unauthorized exposure or loss during movement.

- **Electronic Use of Sensitive Information**:  
  - May only **produce, store, or transmit** sensitive information using **electronic equipment provided by the Secretariat**.  
  - If a member uses **non-authorized electronic equipment** (e.g., personal laptop, smartphone), they must **immediately report** the incident to the Secretariat.

> *Purpose*: Prevents data breaches through unsecured or unmonitored devices.

- **Custody and Return of Sensitive Information**:  
  - When a member takes sensitive information into custody from the Secretariat, they must ensure it is **returned promptly** to the Secretariat.  
  - All information derived from sensitive information (e.g., reports, summaries, analyses) must be **returned to the Secretariat** as soon as circumstances permit.

> *Purpose*: Ensures no unauthorized retention or duplication of sensitive data.

---

### **Device Management Before Entering Restricted Areas**

- Before entering a restricted area, a member must **store all personal electronic devices outside the area** — devices not provided by the Secretariat.

> *Purpose*: Eliminates the risk of unauthorized data access or leakage via personal devices.

---

### **Reporting of Suspicious Activities**

Members must **immediately report to the Executive Director of the Secretariat** any of the following:
- Any act, event, or omission that could lead to:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive information or a restricted area; or
  - Unauthorized disclosure, destruction, removal, modification, or use of sensitive information.
- Any contact with an individual who may be attempting to gain access to sensitive information.

> *Purpose*: Creates a proactive monitoring and reporting mechanism to prevent breaches.

---

### **Emergency Response Protocol**

In the event of an **emergency** (e.g., fire, breach, threat) at a location where a member is exercising their duties:
- The member must take **all safe and feasible actions** to protect sensitive information in their custody.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that even in crisis situations, national security information is protected.

---

### **Enforcement and Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the date the **NSICPA (S.C. 2017, c. 15)** comes into force — **October 6, 2017**.
- If the regulations are registered later, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> *Note*: This ensures consistent implementation with the enabling legislation.

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several critical functions:
- **Protect national security** by limiting exposure of sensitive intelligence and information.
- **Ensure accountability** of parliamentary members who have oversight responsibilities in national security.
- **Prevent breaches** through strict access controls, equipment management, and mandatory reporting.
- **Maintain public trust** by demonstrating that the Committee operates with the highest standards of integrity and security.

They reflect a balance between the need for effective parliamentary oversight and the imperative to protect sensitive information from misuse, unauthorized access, or compromise.

### **Conclusion**

The *National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians Regulations* (S.C. 2017, c. 15) establish a comprehensive, enforceable, and precautionary framework for the secure handling of sensitive information. By setting clear rules on access, transport, use, reporting, and emergency response, the regulations ensure that members of the NSICP operate within a secure and accountable environment — fulfilling their mandate to provide effective and responsible oversight of national security and intelligence activities in Canada.

These regulations remain in force as of the date of this summary and continue to be a cornerstone of Canada’s parliamentary oversight of national security.
