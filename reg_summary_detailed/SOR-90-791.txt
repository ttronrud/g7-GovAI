The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain provisions in a regulatory document, specifically under **SOR/2009-315, s. 104**, and a few other related sections such as **SOR/2002-170, s. 28** and **SOR/96-115, s. 5 and s. 6**.

### Summary:

There is **no active regulation** in this list — the content does not describe a rule, requirement, or legal provision that is currently in force. Instead, it is a **list of repealed provisions**, indicating that the specific sections referenced were **officially removed or canceled** by the government through a statutory instrument.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Repeal by SOR/2009-315, s. 104**  
   - This section of the *Statutory Instrument of 2009-315* (which was issued under the authority of the Government of Canada) **repeals (cancels)** a number of previously existing regulations.
   - The repeated references (over 30 times) suggest that **multiple provisions** were repealed under this single section.
   - SOR/2009-315 is a **Statutory Instrument** (a type of secondary legislation) that amends or removes rules in the regulatory framework.
   - The specific sections being repealed were likely related to **health, safety, environmental, or administrative rules**, depending on the original context of the repealed provisions.

2. **Repeal by SOR/2002-170, s. 28**  
   - This indicates that one or more provisions were repealed earlier, in **2002**, under a different statutory instrument (SOR/2002-170, section 28).
   - This shows a historical pattern of regulatory updates and simplifications.

3. **Repeal by SOR/96-115, s. 5 and s. 6**  
   - These provisions were repealed in **1996**, under SOR/96-115 (a much earlier statutory instrument).
   - This suggests that the regulations in question were part of a long-standing regulatory framework that has been progressively updated or removed over time.

### Interpretation:

- **No active regulation exists** in this list.
- The text is a **record of historical regulatory changes**, not a current rule.
- The repeated entries are likely due to a formatting or data duplication error — the same repeal notices are listed multiple times.
- The repeal of these provisions likely reflects **regulatory modernization**, **consolidation**, or **redundancy** — where outdated or overlapping rules were removed to simplify the legal framework.

### Key Takeaway:

> **This list does not contain a current regulation. It is a record of repealed sections of a regulatory framework, officially removed by SOR/2009-315, s. 104 (and earlier instruments). As such, the provisions referenced are no longer in force and do not apply to current legal or administrative practice.**

### Suggested Next Steps (if needed):

If you are seeking information on what the **original provisions** were (e.g., what they regulated), you would need to consult:
- The **full text of the repealed regulations** (available in the Canadian government's legislation database, such as [canada.ca/laws](https://www.canada.ca/en/legislation.html))
- The **reason for repeal** (e.g., duplication, obsolescence, merger with another regulation)
