Order in Council P.C. 2025-14  
**Date of Publication:**  
April 2025 (implied by the SI/2025-14 designation)  
**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister

### 1. **Repeal of Previous Order in Council (P.C. 2025-84)**  
The regulation formally repeals **Order in Council P.C. 2025-84**, issued on **February 12, 2025**.  

- **Purpose of Repeal:**  
  This action indicates that the previous order—likely related to electoral boundaries or ministerial appointments under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994*—is no longer in force. The repeal suggests a change in policy or administrative direction, possibly due to a shift in government priorities, a procedural error, or a decision to align with current ministerial responsibilities.  
- **Legal Effect:**  
  Once repealed, all provisions of P.C. 2025-84 are nullified and no longer have legal effect. This means any prior appointments, designations, or procedural rules established under that order are rescinded.

### 2. **Designation of the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons as Minister under the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994**  
The regulation designates the **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** as the **Minister** for the purposes of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994* (S.C. 1994, c. 19).  

- **Legal Basis:**  
  This designation is made under the authority of the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994*, which provides a legal framework for suspending electoral boundary adjustments during specific periods—typically to allow for political stability or to avoid disruption during transitions of government.  
- **Purpose of the Designation:**  
  The Act allows for the suspension of boundary adjustments when a Minister is designated to oversee the process. This ensures that the process is managed by a senior government official with clear authority and accountability.  
- **Who is Designated?**  
  The **Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** (i.e., the Prime Minister, or in some cases, the leader of the governing party in Parliament) is formally recognized as the Minister responsible for overseeing the suspension of electoral boundary readjustments.  
- **Scope of Authority:**  
  This designation grants the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons the authority to:  
  - Make decisions regarding the suspension or resumption of boundary readjustment processes;  
  - Approve or reject boundary adjustment proposals;  
  - Exercise oversight and accountability in accordance with the Act’s provisions.

### 3. **Reference to the Original Act**  
The regulation references **S.C. 1994, c. 19**, the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994*, which establishes the legal basis for suspending the process of adjusting electoral boundaries in Canada. This Act is typically invoked during periods of political transition, such as when a new government is formed, or during times of national crisis or electoral uncertainty.

### 4. **Significance and Implications**  
- **Political Stability:**  
  By designating the Prime Minister (or Leader of the Government in the House of Commons) as the Minister responsible, the government ensures continuity and clear leadership in managing boundary suspension matters.  
- **Administrative Clarity:**  
  This designation avoids ambiguity in who has the authority to act under the Act, ensuring that decisions are made by the highest-ranking official in the government.  
- **Procedural Update:**  
  The repeal of P.C. 2025-84 and the introduction of this new designation reflect a formal update to the government’s administrative approach to electoral boundary management, possibly in response to changes in the political landscape or procedural needs.

### Conclusion  
This Order in Council (P.C. 2025-14) serves two key functions:  
1. It **repeals a prior order** (P.C. 2025-84), effectively ending its legal standing;  
2. It **designates the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons** as the Minister responsible under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994*, thereby granting them formal authority to manage suspensions of boundary adjustments.  

This reflects a standard administrative practice in Canadian government to ensure clear, accountable leadership in matters of electoral governance, particularly during transitional or politically sensitive periods.

**Note:**  
While the regulation appears to be a relatively straightforward administrative order, its significance lies in reinforcing the central role of the Prime Minister in overseeing electoral governance under statutory authority. It also demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to procedural transparency and stability in the federal electoral system.
