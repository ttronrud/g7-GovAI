### **Detailed Summary of the Kananaskis Falls and Horseshoe Falls Water Power Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Section 15 of the Dominion Water Power Act**. This grants the federal government the authority to regulate and renew water power rights in Canada, particularly for hydroelectric development on rivers such as the Bow River in Alberta.

The regulations specifically govern the **diversion and use of water power at Kananaskis Falls and Horseshoe Falls** on the Bow River in Alberta. They are a renewal of long-standing rights originally granted under the Dominion Lands Act and later administered under the Dominion Water Power Act.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**
- **"Original Licence"**: Refers to the final licence issued on **May 28, 1946**, to the Original Licensee (Calgary Power Company) for the development of water power at Kananaskis Falls and Horseshoe Falls. This licence was renewable for two additional 21-year periods and was subject to specific terms and conditions.
- **Precedence Clause**: In the event of any inconsistency between these regulations and the broader *Dominion Water Power Regulations*, **these regulations prevail**.

---

#### **3. Licensing and Renewal Framework**
- The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** has the authority to issue **new licences to TransAlta Utilities Corporation** (the current licensee) for the **renewal of rights** under the original licence.
- These newly issued licences are **treated as renewals** of the original licence for the purposes of the *Dominion Water Power Regulations*.
- The renewal is granted based on the **original rights established in 1912 and confirmed in 1946**, with modifications approved through modern regulatory and environmental standards.

---

#### **4. Historical Background and Evolution of the Licence**
The rights to develop water power at Kananaskis Falls trace back to:

- **1910**: Calgary Power Company (Original Licensee) applied for a licence to divert water from the Bow River.
- **October 14, 1912**: Agreement with the federal government (Minister of Interior) under the *Dominion Lands Act* granted a 21-year licence with renewable terms, subject to conditions including annual rental and land use rights.
- **May 20, 1914**: Settlement with the Stoney Indian Band for land, easements, and water rental (annual $1,500 from 1919 onward).
- **October 14, 1915**: Licence issued after fulfilling all conditions under the 1912 agreement.
- **1946**: Final "Original Licence" issued under the *Dominion Water Power Act*, valid for 21 years (October 14, 1936 – October 14, 1957), renewable for two further 21-year periods, but terminating **no later than October 13, 1997** (the expiry date of the Horseshoe Falls licence).
- **1947**: Licence assigned from Calgary Power Company to **Calgary Power Ltd.**
- **1981**: Calgary Power Ltd. reorganized and renamed to **TransAlta Utilities Corporation**.
- **1993**: TransAlta applied for an extension of rights under the original licence.

#### **5. Key Features of the New Licence (Issued in 1997)**
The new licence grants **TransAlta Utilities Corporation** the right to:

- **Divert and use water** from the Bow River at Kananaskis Falls.
- Operate within the **area shown on Record Plan No. KAT 18487**, dated October 1995, filed with the Office of the Director of Water-Power.
- The licence term is **30 years**, beginning on **October 14, 1998**, and is renewable in accordance with the *Dominion Water Power Act* and its amendments.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The licence terminates no later than **October 13, 1997**, due to the Horseshoe Falls licence expiry — but this is superseded by the new 30-year term starting in 1998, indicating a continuity of rights.

---

#### **6. Core Operational Conditions**
The licence includes strict operational and environmental conditions:

##### **(a) Water Return Requirement**
- All diverted water must be **returned to the river channel** in a manner that:
  - Does **not reduce the volume** of water downstream from the point of return.
  - Maintains the **natural flow** of the river as if no diversion had occurred.

##### **(b) Indemnification Clause**
- The Licensee **indemnifies the Crown** (Government of Canada) against:
  - All claims arising from:
    - Construction, operation, or maintenance of the works.
    - Any failure of the dam or infrastructure.
  - This includes claims related to **renewals or modifications** of the licence.

##### **(c) Rental Structure**
The annual rental is structured as follows:

1. **Fixed lump sum**: $40,000 payable on the **first day of each licence year** (October 14 to October 13).
2. **Performance-based payment**:
   - An additional amount equal to:
     > **(0.60 × total megawatt-hours produced during the year) – $40,000**
   - This is payable **within 60 days after the end of the year**.
3. **Meter Accuracy**:
   - Meters must be verified **every 5 years** by an inspector authorized by the Minister.
   - If a meter is found inaccurate, the Licensee must pay any balance owed within **30 days** or adjust overpayments.
4. **Interest on Delinquency**:
   - If payments are overdue, **interest accrues at 1% per month, compounded monthly**, from the due date until payment is made.

##### **(d) Rental Revision Mechanisms**
The rental structure may be adjusted under two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1 (Alberta Rate Increase)**:
  - If Alberta increases its rental for other hydroelectric projects, and the rate exceeds the current rate under this licence, the rental will be **increased to match the provincial rate** on the **5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, or 25th anniversary** of the licence term.
  - The lump sum will be increased by the same proportion.

- **Scenario 2 (Federal Rate Adjustment)**:
  - If the Minister determines that the rental should be higher based on comparable non-Crown, non-regulated hydro projects, and notifies the Licensee **at least six months in advance**, both parties will attempt to **agree on an increased rate**.
  - If no agreement is reached, the dispute is referred to **arbitration** under the *Commercial Arbitration Act*:
    - Arbitrators are appointed per **Article 11(3)** of the Commercial Arbitration Code.
    - The **Federal Court** is the competent court for final determination.

##### **(e) Revenue Sharing**
- All rental payments are split between:
  - **Government of Canada**: 45/72 of total rentals.
  - **Province of Alberta**: 27/72 of total rentals.
- The **$1,500 annual payment** from the 1914 agreement with the Stoney Indian Band is **included in the Canada share**.
