It is referenced in the official publication as **S.C. 2001, c. 29, par. 72(p)** and **S.C. 2001, c. 26**.

Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the regulation, broken down into key components and explained in clear, comprehensive terms:

---

## 🔹 1. **Purpose and Authority**
- The regulation establishes **administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)** for violations of provisions in the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* (the "Act") and regulations made under it.
- It is enacted under **paragraphs 244(f) to (j)a** of the Canada Shipping Act, which authorize the Minister to create rules governing penalties for breaches of shipping laws.
- The goal is to ensure compliance with safety, environmental, and operational standards in Canada’s maritime sector through enforceable financial penalties.

---

## 🔹 2. **Definition of "Violation" and Penalties**
- A **violation** occurs when:
  - A provision of the Act or a regulation made under it (as listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**) is contravened, **or**
  - A direction issued under such a provision is ignored.
- The **penalty range** applicable to each violation is specified in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
  - This means that if a person or entity breaches a rule, they may be fined between a minimum and maximum amount (e.g., $500 to $10,000), depending on the nature of the violation.
- If **"X"** appears in **Column 3** of a Part of the Schedule:
  - The violation is considered **a separate violation for each day it continues**.
  - For example, if a vessel fails to carry required safety equipment for three days, it could result in three separate penalties — one per day.

> ✅ This reflects a **day-by-day penalty structure**, which encourages prompt correction and discourages prolonged non-compliance.
