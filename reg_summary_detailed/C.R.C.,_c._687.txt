**Detailed Summary of the Defence Floating Equipment Rental Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Defence Floating Equipment Rental Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes a formal framework for the temporary rental of specific floating equipment by the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) to individuals or organizations in emergency or operational circumstances.

---

### **2. Definition of "Floating Equipment"**
The term **"floating equipment"** is defined to include:
- Large tugs  
- Medium tugs  
- Small tugs  
- Derricks  
- Flat scows  

These are all types of vessels or mobile maritime machinery that are either:
- **Owned by** the Department of National Defence (DND), or  
- **Under charter agreement** with the DND  

This definition ensures clarity about which assets are eligible for rental under the Order.

---

### **3. Purpose and Authority of the Minister**
The **Minister of National Defence** is authorized to:
- **Rent floating equipment on request**,  
- **Only when commercially available facilities are not available**,  
- At **prevailing commercial rental rates** for similar equipment in the same geographic area.

This provision ensures that the rental process is cost-effective and fair, aligning with market standards while maintaining operational flexibility during urgent or unforeseen needs.

> **Key Principle**: The rental is a last-resort measure — it applies only when private or commercial alternatives are unavailable.

---

### **4. Form of Agreement**
All rentals must be conducted through a **formal written agreement** in the form set out in the **Schedule** to the Order. This standardized agreement ensures consistency, legal enforceability, and clear terms between the DND and the Charterer.

The agreement must be **signed by the firm or individual** seeking to rent the equipment.

### **5. Key Provisions of the Charter Agreement**

#### **(a) Rental Payment Obligation**
- The Charterer agrees to pay **the prevailing commercial rental rate** for the equipment.
- The payment covers the **entire period** during which:
  - The equipment is **in use**, or  
  - **Being moved** to or from the intended location of use.

> This includes transit time — the rental is not limited to "on-site" use only.

#### **(b) Indemnity for Damage or Loss Due to Charterer’s Negligence**
- The Charterer agrees to **indemnify Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada** (i.e., the Government of Canada) for:
  - Any **damage** to the equipment  
  - Any **loss** of the equipment or any part thereof  
  - Caused by the **negligence** of the Charterer, their servants, agents, or employees.

> This protects the DND from financial liability arising from user error or poor handling.

#### **(c) Indemnity for Third-Party Claims**
- The Charterer agrees to **indemnify and hold harmless** the Government from:
  - All claims for **loss, costs, damages, or expenses** resulting from the use of the equipment  
  - **Except** where such claims arise from the **negligence or wrongful acts of DND agents or servants**.

> This limits the Government’s exposure to claims not attributable to the Charterer’s actions.

#### **(d) Right of Termination by the Minister**
- The Minister of National Defence (or the Naval Officer in Charge of the equipment) may **terminate the charter at any time**, without notice, if:
  - It is deemed **necessary or expedient** to do so.

> This gives the Government operational flexibility to reallocate resources, respond to emergencies, or due to safety, security, or logistical concerns.

#### **(e) Evidence of Commercial Unavailability**
- The Charterer must **certify in writing** that:
  - They have made **reasonable efforts** to obtain privately owned equipment suitable for the intended work  
  - **No such equipment is currently available** in the market

> This requirement ensures that the rental is not used as a substitute for private procurement and confirms that commercial alternatives have been exhausted.

### **6. Operational Timeline**

- The **equipment** being made available  
- The **rate** of rental  
- The **start date** and **end date** of the charter

### **8. Key Objectives and Policy Rationale**
- **Operational Flexibility**: Enables DND to respond rapidly to urgent maritime needs (e.g., search and rescue, emergency response, construction, or military operations) when commercial solutions are unavailable.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Uses prevailing market rates to ensure fair pricing and avoid overpayment.
- **Risk Management**: Places responsibility for damage or liability on the Charterer, protecting public funds.
- **Accountability**: Requires proof of effort to obtain private alternatives, preventing misuse of the rental system.

---

### **9. Limitations and Conditions**
- **Not a permanent solution**: Rental is temporary and subject to termination at any time.
- **Only for emergencies**: Cannot be used for routine or non-urgent operations.
- **No guarantee of availability**: Equipment may be unavailable due to maintenance, repair, or other operational constraints.
- **No liability for government negligence**: Charterer is not liable for claims arising from DND’s own actions or failures.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Defence Floating Equipment Rental Order** is a targeted, emergency-based regulatory mechanism that allows the Canadian Department of National Defence to temporarily rent essential floating assets to private parties or contractors when commercial alternatives are not feasible. It balances operational necessity with legal accountability, ensuring that:
- Equipment is used efficiently and fairly  
- Costs are aligned with market rates  
- Risk is appropriately shared  
- Government assets are protected from misuse or uncontrolled liability  

It serves as a vital tool in national defence and emergency response operations where immediate access to maritime equipment is critical.
