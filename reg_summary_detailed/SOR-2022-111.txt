## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit System Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Purpose**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under the following statutes:
- **Section 192 and 195 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA)** – which establishes the legal framework for greenhouse gas (GHG) offset programs.
- **Section 5b of the Environmental Violations Administrative Monetary Penalties Act (EVPAMPA)** – which supports enforcement and compliance mechanisms.

> **Objective**: To establish a **national, transparent, and scientifically sound offset credit system** that allows projects which reduce or remove greenhouse gases (GHGs) to generate and issue **offset credits**—which can be used to meet compliance obligations under Canada’s carbon pricing regime.

## 🔍 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act* (GGPPA) |
| **Proponent** | The individual or entity responsible for implementing a project |
| **Project** | A project that either prevents GHG emissions or removes GHGs from the atmosphere |
| **Protocol** | A standardized set of requirements and quantification methods for a specific project type, published in the *Compendium of Federal Offset Protocols* |
| **Compendium of Federal Offset Protocols** | The official document (published by Environment and Climate Change Canada) that contains all approved protocols for different project types |
| **Crediting Period** | The time frame during which a project can generate GHG offset credits |
| **Start Date** | The date when project activities begin, as defined in the applicable protocol |
| **Environmental Integrity Account** | A tracking account maintained by the Minister to ensure the integrity and accountability of offset credits |
| **Offset Credit** | A unit representing a verified, real, additional, unique, and permanent reduction or removal of GHGs |
| **Verification Body** | A third-party entity authorized to verify project reports according to ISO standards |
| **Real, Additional, Quantified, Verified, Unique, Permanent (RAQVUP)** | The core criteria for qualifying GHG reductions to be credited |

> **Note**: Unless otherwise specified, all references to documents incorporated by reference remain valid and amended over time. A key exception: **ISO 14065:2020** may be complied with for up to **four years** after publication of an amendment.

## 📅 Crediting Periods

The duration for which a project can generate offset credits depends on the **project type**:

| Project Type | Crediting Period |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Forestry sequestration** | 30 years |
| **Non-forestry sequestration** | 20 years |
| **All other projects** (e.g., energy efficiency, waste reduction) | 10 years |

> **Start of Crediting Period**:
- Begins on the **later of**:
  - The **date the project is registered**, or
  - The **project start date**
- **Exception for agricultural projects**: If required by protocol, the period starts on the **start of the growing season**, but **not earlier than registration or start date**.

> **Overlap with Prior Systems**:
- If a project was previously registered in **another offset system**, the crediting period is **reduced** by the time it was active in that system.

> **Aggregations of Projects**:
- The crediting period begins on the **later of**:
  - The **registration date of the aggregation**, or
  - The **earliest project start date** among the projects in the aggregation
- However, **a project cannot generate credits until its own start date** if it begins after the aggregation's registration.
- When a new project is added to an aggregation, its crediting period begins on the **later of**:
  - The date it is added, or
  - Its own start date
- When a project is transferred between aggregations, its crediting period aligns with the new aggregation’s start date.

> **Protocol Updates**:
- If a **new version of a protocol** is issued during a project’s crediting period, the proponent may **opt to use the new version**.
- However, **only one version** of the protocol can apply during the period covered by a single project report.

> **Withdrawal of Protocol**:
- If the protocol for a project type is **withdrawn** at the time of registration or renewal, the application is **refused**.

## ✅ Requirements for Project Registration

A project may be registered **only if** the proponent meets the following conditions:

### 1. **Basic Eligibility**
- The proponent must:
  - Be an **individual residing in Canada**, or
  - Be a **corporation or entity with a place of business in Canada**
- The proponent must have **exclusive rights** to claim the offset credits generated by the project.

### 2. **Project Implementation & Compliance**
- The proponent must have the **necessary authorizations** to carry out the project.
- **Baseline conditions** (as defined in the protocol) must be met **before the project starts**.
- The project activities must be **explicitly outlined** in the applicable protocol.

### 3. **Additionality Requirement**
- GHG reductions must be **additional**, meaning:
  - They would **not have occurred** without the project.
  - They are **not mandated by law** or required by a government pricing mechanism.
  - They do **not come from sources, sinks, or reservoirs** subject to federal or provincial GHG pricing.

### 4. **Uniqueness**
- The reductions must be **unique**—not already credited under:
  - Another offset program
  - Another GHG reduction mechanism (e.g., carbon credits under provincial programs)

### 5. **No Overlap with Provincial Programs**
- The project must **not be covered** by a provincial offset protocol in the province where it is located.
- **Exception**: If a provincial protocol is published **after** the federal protocol is included in the Compendium, and the application is submitted within **six months** of the project becoming eligible under the provincial program, registration may proceed.

### 6. **Sequestration-Specific Requirements**
- For sequestration projects (e.g., reforestation, soil carbon storage):
  - The proponent must **specify** which quantification method to use: **tonne-tonne**, **tonne-year**, or **hybrid tonne-year**.
  - If using **tonne-tonne or hybrid tonne-year**, a **reversal risk management plan** must be established (to prevent GHGs from being released back into the atmosphere).

> **Reversal Risk Management Plan**:
- Required for tonne-tonne and hybrid tonne-year methods.
- Must include monitoring and mitigation strategies to prevent **reversal** (i.e., GHGs being released after sequestration).

> **No Prior Cancellation**:
- A previous registration must **not have been cancelled** due to a **voluntary reversal**.

> **Criminal Record Check**:
- The proponent or their authorized official must **not have been convicted** of an offence under the *Criminal Code* (e.g., fraud, environmental crime) within the **five years prior** to submitting the application.

> **Application Timing**:
- Must be submitted **within time limits** set out in **section 10** of the regulations.

## 📝 Project Report and Verification Process

To receive offset credits, the proponent must:

1. **Implement the project** in accordance with the protocol.
2. **Prepare a project report** in accordance with **section 20**.
3. **Have the report verified** by an authorized **verification body** under **sections 24–27**.
4. **Submit**:
   - The project report
   - A **verification report** (prepared under section 28)
   - A **corrected project report**, if required (under section 32)

6. **Submit monitoring reports** as required under section 22
7. **Meet compliance unit obligations** (if required under section 181 of the GGPPA)

- Verification must be conducted by a **third-party verification body** authorized under section 23
- Verification must follow **ISO 14064-3:2019** (guidance on verification and validation)

> **Verification Body Requirements**:
- Must be accredited and meet international standards (e.g., ISO 14065:2020)

## 🏢 Aggregation of Projects

Projects can be grouped into **aggregations** (a group of projects of the same type) for streamlined registration and reporting.

### Conditions for Aggregation Registration:
- All projects must be in the **same province**
- Each project must meet individual registration criteria
- The **same protocol and version** must apply to all projects
- For sequestration projects, the **same quantification method** must be used across all projects
-
