- The regulation is formally titled: *"Transfer of Portions of the National Research Council of Canada Regulations"*.
- It is published under **S.C. 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13**, indicating its origin in the legislative framework of the Public Service Employment Act.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation:**

- Specifically, the regulation transfers control or responsibility over two key operational units:
  - The **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**
  - The **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

**3. Scope of Application:**
- The transferred units are designated as **portions of the federal public administration** within the NRC.
- These units are now subject to the provisions of **subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act**.

  - Align IT operations with centralized federal standards
  - Ensure consistent application of public service employment rules across federal agencies
- The units, which manage email systems, data centers, and network services, are critical to the day-to-day operations of the NRC and other federal institutions, so their reorganization ensures continuity and security.

**6. Administrative and Operational Impact:**
- Employees in these units will now be subject to the same public service employment rules as other federal employees, reinforcing accountability, transparency, and fairness in hiring, performance, and management.
- The support unit, which likely provides administrative and technical assistance to the main unit, is also included in the scope, ensuring that operational continuity is maintained.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation establishes a formal transfer of two key IT service units within the National Research Council of Canada to a new administrative and employment framework governed by the Public Service Employment Act. It ensures that employees in these units are protected under consistent public service standards and brings the NRC’s technical infrastructure in line with federal best practices.
