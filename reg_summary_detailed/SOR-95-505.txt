### **Detailed Summary of the Holman Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

- **Origin of the Regulation**:  
  These regulations were developed under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* of Canada. Specifically:
  - **Section 5.5** of the Aeronautics Act required that a proposed regulation on zoning at Holman Airport be published in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I* (June 17 and 24, 1995) and in two successive issues of *The News of the North* (June 19 and 26, 1995).
  - This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment**, allowing interested parties (e.g., residents, businesses, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.

- **Final Adoption**:  
  Based on the public consultation and recommendations, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, **formally enacted** the regulations under **Section 5.4** of the Aeronautics Act.

- **Regulation Title**:  
  The regulations are officially titled the **Holman Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such.

#### **2. Key Definitions and Components**

The regulations define several critical geographic and technical elements to establish safe and effective airspace and ground-use boundaries around the airport:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Holman Airport, located near Holman in the Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the runway used as a fixed reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Located on the centerline of runway 062T–242T, 655.3 meters from the threshold of runway 062T. |
| **Elevation of ARP** | 32 meters above sea level. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, consisting of a rectangular zone (150 meters wide, 1,430.6 meters long) prepared for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (runway 062T–242T). |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the strip, designed to ensure clear visibility for pilots during approach. Each has a **1:40 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 40 meters horizontal run). They rise to an imaginary horizontal line 3,000 meters from the end of the strip, 525 meters from the centerline, and 75 meters above the elevation at the strip end. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes extending upward and outward from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. These have a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal run) and extend until they intersect with the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 32 + 45 = 77 meters above sea level). However, **if this plane is less than 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unsafe structures near the surface. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all land** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Holman Airport, including:
  - Public road allowances
  - Private land
- The exact boundaries of the affected land are defined in **Part VI of the schedule**, which is based on the **Holman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3038**, dated October 6, 1994.

- **Outer Boundary**:  
  The outer boundary of the regulated area is a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

#### **4. Key Prohibitions**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or build any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones),  
- **On land subject to these regulations**,  
- Where the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no obstruction (e.g., trees, towers, buildings, antennas) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach — preserving **safety and visibility** for pilots.

---

#### **5. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **protect aviation safety** by preventing obstructions that could compromise aircraft visibility during critical phases of flight (especially during approach and landing).
- To **establish clear, measurable boundaries** using standardized geometric planes (approach, transitional, outer surfaces) based on established aviation design principles.
- To ensure **compliance with Canadian aeronautical standards**, particularly those related to **visual flight rules (VFR)** and **runway approach safety**.
- To provide a **transparent, publicly accessible framework** that balances community development with aviation needs.

#### **6. Supporting Documentation**

All spatial and dimensional descriptions are derived from the **Holman Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3038**, dated October 6, 1994, which serves as the foundational planning document. Key features included in the plan are:

- Runway configuration (062T–242T)
- Strip dimensions (150 m wide, 1,430.6 m long)
- Location and elevation of the ARP
- Detailed depiction of approach, transitional, and outer surfaces

This plan is referenced throughout the regulation and forms the basis for enforcement and interpretation.

---

#### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Violations may result in legal action, including demolition or removal of structures that exceed the defined elevation limits.
- Compliance is expected to be monitored through land-use planning, development applications, and inspections.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Holman Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, safety-focused set of rules designed to protect aviation operations at Holman Airport in the Northwest Territories. By defining precise elevation limits through approach, transitional, and outer surfaces, and by applying these limits to a clearly defined geographic area (a 4,000-meter radius circle), the regulations ensure that no structures will interfere with aircraft during critical flight phases.

These regulations reflect a balance between **public development** and **aviation safety**, grounded in established aeronautical standards and transparent public consultation processes.

### **Key Takeaways (Bullet Points)**

- Enacted under the *Aeronautics Act* (Sections 5.4 and 5.5).
- Applies to all land within a 4,000-meter radius of the airport reference point.
- Defines three key elevation boundaries: approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, and outer surface.
- Prohibits any structure whose highest point exceeds these boundaries.
- Based on the 1994 Holman Airport Zoning Plan (E.3038).
- Aims to ensure safe aircraft approaches and landings by preventing visual obstructions.
- Provides a clear, measurable, and enforceable framework for land use near the airport.
