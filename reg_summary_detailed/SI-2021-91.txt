The provided text outlines a regulatory transfer of powers, duties, and functions under Canadian federal legislation. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers under the Official Languages Act**

#### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Act").
- This provision allows for the reassignment of powers, duties, and functions among federal ministers, particularly within the Public Service, to improve administrative efficiency or align responsibilities with current policy priorities.

#### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
- The **powers, duties, and functions** previously held by the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages** are being transferred.
- These responsibilities were originally assigned to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages under the **Official Languages Act**.
- The transfer is specifically limited to the **duties and functions** that were previously transferred to that Minister via **Order in Council P.C. 2019-1368**, dated **November 20, 2019**.

#### **3. Recipient of the Transfer**
- The powers, duties, and functions are being transferred **to the Minister of State (Official Languages)**.
- This reflects a reorganization within the federal government’s structure to consolidate responsibility for official languages under a dedicated ministerial office, improving focus and accountability in official language policy and implementation.

#### **4. Legal Framework and References**
- The regulation is codified under several statutes:
  - **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22* (likely the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act) provides the legal authority for ministerial transfers.
  - **R.S., c. P-34**: Refers to the *Public Service Act* (or related public service legislation).
  - **R.S., c. 31 (4th Supp.)**: Likely refers to the *Official Languages Act* or a supplementary amendment to it, which establishes the legal framework governing official language responsibilities.
  - **SI/2019-130**: A Statutory Instrument (SI) issued in 2019 (likely the Order in Council P.C. 2019-1368) that initially transferred certain official language duties from the Minister of Economic Development to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages.

#### **5. Purpose and Context**
- The transfer is part of a broader effort to **streamline and clarify responsibilities** related to official languages in Canada.
- By moving these functions to the **Minister of State (Official Languages)**, the government aims to:
  - Enhance oversight and policy development in official language matters.
  - Ensure that official language implementation (e.g., in government services, institutions, and communications) is managed by a dedicated minister with focused expertise.
  - Improve coordination between federal departments on language rights and services under the *Official Languages Act*.

#### **6. Effect of the Regulation**
- As of the date of the regulation's publication (implied to be after the Order in Council P.C. 2019-1368), the **Minister of State (Official Languages)** now exercises the powers, duties, and functions previously held by the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages in relation to the *Official Languages Act*.
- This includes responsibilities such as:
  - Ensuring compliance with the Official Languages Act.
  - Overseeing the implementation of official language services in federal institutions.
  - Managing the promotion and use of official languages in government operations.
  - Addressing language rights and access for English and French speakers across Canada.

#### **7. Implications**
- The transfer **does not affect** the Minister of Economic Development’s broader responsibilities in economic development.
- It **reduces the scope** of the former Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages' role in official language matters, which are now fully under the jurisdiction of the Minister of State (Official Languages).
- This reorganization strengthens the federal government’s commitment to **bilingualism and linguistic equality** as enshrined in the *Official Languages Act*.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally transfers specific powers, duties, and functions related to official language policy and administration from the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages to the Minister of State (Official Languages), based on the authority granted under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The transfer is a result of prior legislative action (P.C. 2019-1368) and serves to improve governance, accountability, and efficiency in the implementation of Canada’s official languages policy.

It reflects a strategic realignment of ministerial responsibilities to ensure that official language matters are managed by a dedicated office within the federal government.

> **Note**: While the citation "S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207" and "R.S., c. P-34" may refer to foundational statutes, the actual transfer of duties is operationalized through the 2019 Order in Council and the subsequent ministerial reassignment. The regulation is a formal confirmation and implementation of that shift in administrative responsibility.
