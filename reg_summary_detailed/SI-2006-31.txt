The regulation referenced — "[Repealed, SI/2011-48]" — indicates that the specific legislative instrument (SI) numbered 2011-48 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the governing statute it was part of, or the jurisdiction — e.g., Canada, United Kingdom, or another country), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a regulation is marked as "repealed," it means:

- The regulation is no longer in force.
- It has been formally cancelled or replaced by a new legal instrument.
- The repeal is typically enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument or act, and the repeal is published in the official government gazette (e.g., the Canada Gazette, the UK Statutory Instruments, etc.).

For example, if SI/2011-48 was a regulation under the *Canada Shipping Act* or the *Environmental Protection Act*, the repeal would mean that the specific rules or provisions it established are now obsolete and no longer apply.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- Full title of the regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting the use of certain chemicals in food processing")
- The enabling statute or parent act
- The jurisdiction (e.g., Canada, UK, Australia)
- The original scope, purpose, and key provisions of the regulation
- The reason for its repeal (e.g., superseded by new legislation, outdated, or inconsistent with current policy)

Until such details are available, the most accurate summary is:
