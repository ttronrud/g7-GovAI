The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-79"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2018/79** has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Title/Reference**: Statutory Instrument 2018/79  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted as part of a legislative update or consolidation of regulations, typically through a subsequent statutory instrument or an Act of Parliament.  
- **Effective Date**: The repeal took effect on **1 January 2018**, or as specified in the official text of the repealing instrument. However, since SI/2018-79 is listed as "repealed," it implies that it was formally revoked *by* a later instrument, likely in 2018 or later.

### Context and Purpose:
Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation used in the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth jurisdictions) to implement or amend primary legislation. SI/2018/79 was likely a piece of secondary legislation introduced to provide specific administrative, regulatory, or procedural rules in a particular area (e.g., environmental standards, health and safety, licensing, or financial services). However, due to changes in policy, redundancy, or the implementation of a new regulatory framework, it was determined to no longer be necessary or relevant.

### Reasons for Repeal:
Common reasons for repealing a statutory instrument include:
- Obsolescence due to new legislation.
- Inconsistency with updated policy or law.
- Duplication or overlap with other regulations.
- Simplification of the regulatory framework.
- Errors or ambiguities in the original text.

### Impact:
- The repeal means that **all provisions of SI/2018/79 are no longer in force**.
- Any legal obligations, duties, or requirements previously derived from it are **no longer applicable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current, active regulations that have replaced it (if any), or to other relevant legislation.

### Where to Find the Repeal:
The repeal is typically recorded in:
- The **Statutory Instruments (SI) List** published by the UK government.
- The **National Archives** or **legislation.gov.uk** (for UK legislation).
- A subsequent SI that explicitly states the repeal of SI/2018/79.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without the full text of SI/2018/79 or the repealing instrument, the exact subject matter (e.g., environmental protection, transport, education) cannot be definitively identified. However, the designation "repealed" confirms that it is no longer legally active.

### Conclusion:
**SI/2018/79 has been formally repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force. Its content has been either superseded by new legislation or rendered obsolete. Any reference to it in legal or administrative contexts should be treated as outdated or invalid. For accurate regulatory guidance, practitioners must consult the current, active legislation in force.
