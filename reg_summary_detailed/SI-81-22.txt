## **I. Background and Context**

This regulation, formally titled **"Northern Pipeline Socio-Economic and Environmental Terms and Conditions for Northern British Columbia"**, was issued by the **Governor in Council** on **August 29, 1980**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister responsible for the Northern Pipeline Agency** and pursuant to **subsection 20(4)** of the *Northern Pipeline Act*.

### **Key Background Elements:**
- A **Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity** was issued on **April 13, 1978**, to **Foothills Pipe Lines (North B.C.) Ltd. (Foothills)** for a pipeline project in northern British Columbia.
- The pipeline route spans from **Watson Lake** in a southeasterly direction across northern B.C. to a point near **Boundary Lake**, where it meets the Alberta border.
- In **1976**, a public hearing before the **National Energy Board (NEB)** was held involving multiple companies (including Foothills, Alberta Gas Trunk Line, Westcoast Transmission, etc.) regarding the **Alaska Highway Pipeline Project**.
- During this hearing, various **undertakings** were made concerning **social, economic, environmental, fisheries, and agricultural impacts**.
- Under **subsection 21(2)** of the Act, such undertakings are deemed to be **terms or conditions** and are incorporated into **Schedule III** of the Act — the regulatory framework governing the pipeline's operation.

## **II. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

1. **Rescind outdated or inappropriate undertakings** from Schedule III related to social and environmental matters.
2. **Replace them with new, comprehensive, and enforceable socio-economic and environmental terms and conditions** tailored specifically to Foothills’ operations in northern British Columbia.
3. Ensure that the pipeline project adheres to **modern standards of environmental protection, community engagement, and Indigenous rights**, while maintaining public accountability.
