**Detailed Summary of the "Equity of a Cooperative Credit Association Regulations"**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulations are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **Section 463a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCAA)**. This provision empowers the federal government to establish rules defining and determining the equity of cooperative credit associations (CCAs), which are financial institutions operating under cooperative principles, such as credit unions or cooperative banks.

---

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define what constitutes the "equity" of a cooperative credit association** for the purposes of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act. This definition is critical for regulatory oversight, financial reporting, capital adequacy assessments, and compliance with federal financial standards.

**3. Definition of "Equity"**  
According to these regulations, the **equity of a cooperative credit association** is defined as the **sum of two components**, both measured at their **aggregate book value** as reflected in the association’s **consolidated financial statements**:

- **(a) The aggregate book value of the shares of the association**  
  This refers to the value of the shares issued by the cooperative to its shareholders (e.g., corporate or institutional shareholders), based on their accounting value (not market value), as recorded in the financial statements.

- **(b) The aggregate book value of the membership shares of the association**  
  Membership shares are the equity interests held by individual members of the cooperative. These represent the ownership stake of members in the cooperative and are typically linked to their deposits or participation in the association. The book value here reflects the accounting value of these shares, as determined by the financial statements.

> ✅ **Key Point**: The equity is not based on market value or fair value, but on **book value** — the value recorded in the financial records, which reflects historical cost adjusted for depreciation, amortization, and other accounting entries.

**4. Application and Scope**  
These regulations apply to **all cooperative credit associations** governed by the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. They provide a standardized, transparent, and legally enforceable definition of equity that ensures consistency across all such associations in Canada.

The use of **consolidated financial statements** ensures that the equity calculation accounts for all subsidiaries, divisions, or related entities within the association’s group, providing a comprehensive view of its financial health.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the **day that paragraph 463(i.1) of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act** becomes effective. This specific paragraph was enacted by **Section 339 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 339)**.  

> 🔍 **Note**: The effective date is tied to a broader legislative change aimed at strengthening financial consumer protection and improving transparency in the cooperative sector.  
> The regulations were formally published on **October 24, 2001**, and are referenced in **Statutory Instrument SI/2001-102**.

**6. Significance and Implications**  
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Provides a clear, legally binding definition of equity, reducing ambiguity in financial reporting and regulatory assessments.  
- **Capital Monitoring**: Enables regulators (such as the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada or other oversight bodies) to monitor the financial stability of CCAs by assessing their equity levels.  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensures that both member and non-member stakeholders understand the financial foundation of the cooperative.  
- **Compliance**: Associations must ensure that their financial statements accurately reflect the book values of shares to comply with this regulation.

---

**7. Historical and Legislative Context**  
- These regulations were introduced as part of a broader reform of the cooperative sector in Canada, aligning it with modern financial oversight standards.  
- The 2001 amendment to the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* (via Section 339) provided the legal mechanism to activate this equity definition, reflecting a shift toward greater financial transparency and consumer protection.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Equity of a Cooperative Credit Association Regulations* establish a precise, legally grounded method for calculating the equity of cooperative credit associations based on book value in consolidated financial statements. This definition supports financial stability, regulatory oversight, and accountability within the cooperative financial system. The regulations are effective upon the enactment of Section 339 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act and became operational on **October 24, 2001**.
