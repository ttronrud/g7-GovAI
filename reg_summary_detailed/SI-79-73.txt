Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation, broken down into key components for better understanding:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Canadian Exploration Expense Remission Order**

#### **1. Purpose of the Order**
This regulation, known as the **Canadian Exploration Expense Remission Order**, provides a **remission (i.e., reduction or forgiveness) of income tax** for certain taxpayers who incurred **Canadian exploration expenses** after May 25, 1976, and before 1980. The remission applies only to taxpayers who are **not principal-business corporations**.

> **Key Objective**: To relieve non-principal-business taxpayers from paying income tax on the portion of their tax liability that results from the over-application of a specific tax rule related to exploration expenses.

---

#### **2. Legal Authority**
The Order is issued under:
- **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**,  
- On the recommendation of:
  - The **Minister of Finance** and  
  - The **Treasury Board**.

This means the government has the legal power to issue such an order to adjust tax liabilities based on policy or administrative considerations.

---

#### **3. Applicable Tax Period**
The Order applies to **any taxation year ending after May 25, 1976**.

> This means the tax year in question must begin on or after May 26, 1976, and end after that date. It does **not** apply to years ending before May 25, 1976.

---

#### **4. Who Is Eligible?**
The remission applies to **any taxpayer** who:
- Was liable for income tax under **Part I of the Income Tax Act** (i.e., general income tax liability),  
- In a taxation year **after May 25, 1976**,  
- And whose tax liability is **greater than** what would have been owed if a specific provision of the Act had been modified.

> **Important Note**: This remission **does not apply to principal-business corporations**.  
> "Principal-business corporations" are defined as those whose primary business activity is in the exploration or production of oil, gas, or minerals. These entities are excluded from the benefit of this remission.

---

#### **5. The Tax Remission Mechanism**

The remission is granted when the **tax payable** under the Income Tax Act exceeds the tax that would have been payable **if a specific provision of the Act were altered**.

Specifically, the remission applies when:
> The **amount of tax payable** for the year  
> **exceeds**  
> the amount of tax that would have been payable **if subparagraph 66.1(3)(a)(i)** of the Income Tax Act were read as follows:

> *"the amount by which his Canadian exploration expense incurred after May 25, 1976 and before 1980 exceeds the aggregate of all amounts claimed by virtue of this paragraph in a previous taxation year."*

---

#### **6. Interpretation of the Modified Subparagraph**

To understand this, let’s break down what the modified subparagraph means:

- **Canadian exploration expense** refers to costs incurred by a taxpayer in exploring for natural resources (e.g., oil, gas, minerals) in Canada.
- The time frame is **after May 25, 1976, and before 1980**.
- The taxpayer can claim these expenses under the Income Tax Act, but only up to a certain limit.
- The key point is that **a taxpayer cannot claim the same exploration expense more than once** across years.
- The **"aggregate of all amounts claimed in previous years"** means that if a taxpayer claimed $100,000 in exploration expenses in one year, and $150,000 in another, the total claimed in prior years is $250,000.

> Therefore, the **excess** over that total (e.g., if expenses incurred in a given year are $300,000, and prior claims totaled $250,000) is the **amount of eligible exploration expense** that can be recognized in that year.

---

#### **7. How the Remission Works**
- If the **actual tax liability** (as calculated under the current rules) is **higher** than the tax liability that would result **if the modified subparagraph were applied**, then the **difference** is remitted.
- In other words, the taxpayer is **not required to pay** the extra tax that resulted from the original rule (which allowed over-claiming of exploration expenses across years).

> This effectively **reduces or eliminates** the tax liability that arose due to an over-claim of exploration expenses in prior years.

---

#### **8. Key Implications**
- **Tax relief for non-principal-business taxpayers**: This rule is designed to protect smaller or non-core businesses (e.g., individuals, small companies not primarily engaged in resource extraction) from being unfairly burdened by tax due to historical exploration expense claims.
- **Historical context**: This Order addresses a gap in the tax system that existed between 1976 and 1980, where the rules on exploration expenses allowed for cumulative claims that could inflate tax liabilities.
- **No benefit to principal-business corporations**: The exclusion ensures that companies whose main business is resource exploration (e.g., oil and gas producers) are not affected, as they are already subject to different tax treatments.

---

#### **9. Citation and Reference**
- The Order may be cited as:  
  **The Canadian Exploration Expense Remission Order**  
- It is a formal, legally binding instrument issued under the Financial Administration Act.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **targeted tax relief measure** to correct an over-application of exploration expense rules in the Income Tax Act for a specific historical period (1976–1980). It ensures that non-principal-business taxpayers are not penalized with higher tax liabilities due to cumulative claims on exploration expenses. By remitting the difference between the actual tax owed and the tax that would have been owed under a revised interpretation of the law, the government provides fairness and consistency in tax treatment for eligible taxpayers.

---

### **In Simple Terms**
> "If you're not a major resource company and you spent money exploring for natural resources in Canada between May 25, 1976, and 1980, and you ended up paying more tax because of how those expenses were counted in past years, you may be eligible for a refund or reduction in tax — up to the amount that would have been saved if the rules had been applied more fairly."
