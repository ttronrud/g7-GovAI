## 🧩 **Rules on Contribution and Benefit Liability**

### 1. **Employment-Based Liability (Article 5)**
> **General Rule**: Liability for contributions is determined **only under the legislation of the Party where the person is employed**.

- If a person is employed in Canada → subject to Canadian rules (CPP/OASA).
- If a person is employed in the UK → subject to UK rules.

> **General Rule**: For self-employed persons:
- Liability is determined **based on where the person ordinarily resides**.
- If self-employed in one country and residing in the other → subject to the legislation of the country where they **ordinarily reside**.

> **Special Case (UK only)**:
- If a person is self-employed in Canada but **ordinarily resident in the UK**, they are treated as a UK self-employed earner.
- **No liability** arises for **immediate profits or gains** derived from that self-employment in Canada.

---

### 3. **Dual Employment (Employed + Self-Employed)**
> If a person is:
- Employed in one country and
- Self-employed in the other,

→ Liability is determined **based on where the person ordinarily resides**.

---

### 4. **Temporary Work Abroad (Article 7)**
> If an employee is **sent from a Party’s territory (or a third country not party to the Convention)** to work in the other Party’s territory:
- The **original Party’s legislation applies** (i.e., the one where the employer is based).
- This applies **only if the employment does not exceed five years**.
- The legislation of the destination country **does not apply**.

> Example: A Canadian worker sent to the UK by a Canadian employer for temporary work (≤5 years) remains subject to Canadian CPP rules.

---

### 5. **Government Service (Article 8)**
> If a person is in **government service in one Party** and employed in the other Party:

> Applies to federal, provincial, or public service employees.

---

### 6. **Diplomatic and Consular Staff (Article 9)**
> If a person works in a **diplomatic mission or consular post** of one Party in the other:
- The **destination Party’s legislation applies** (as if employed in its territory).
- **Exception**: Within **three months** of entering the mission or beginning employment, the individual may **choose to be insured under the home Party’s legislation**.
- If they **do not choose**, they are **not liable** to pay contributions under the UK legislation.

## 🏡 **Residence and Benefit Calculations (Article 10)**

### For **Old Age Security (OAS) and CPP Benefits**:
- **If a Canadian is insured under CPP during a period of residence in the UK**:
  - That period is counted as **residence in Canada** for the individual and their spouse/dependants **who are not compulsorily insured under UK legislation**.

- **If a UK citizen is insured under UK legislation during a period of residence in Canada**:
  - That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada for the individual or their dependants **who are not insured under Canadian CPP or provincial plans**.

> This promotes **benefit portability** and avoids double counting or exclusion.

## ⚖️ **Industrial Accidents and Diseases (Article 11)**

- For **industrial accidents or diseases** occurring during that employment:
