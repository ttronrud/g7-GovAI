The provided text indicates that a specific regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) and does not contain any substantive content or details about the regulation itself. Here is a detailed summary based on the information given:

---

**Summary of the Regulation (as indicated by the provided text):**

- **Status:** The regulation is **repealed**.
- **Date of Repeal:** 1998
- **Legal Citation for Repeal:** Section 201 of Chapter 10 of the Statutes of 1998 (c. 10, s. 201)
- **Replacement or Further Reference:** The repeal is referenced in **Statutory Instrument 2013-107** (SI/2013-107), which formally confirms the revocation of the regulation.
- **Number of References:** The repeal note appears five times in the original text, indicating that the regulation was cited or referenced multiple times in related documents or sections, but no specific regulation is named.

**Key Implications:**

- The regulation in question is **no longer in force** and cannot be applied or referenced in current legal or administrative contexts.
- The repeal means that any provisions, obligations, or requirements previously established by the regulation are **no longer binding**.
- The reference to SI/2013-107 suggests that the repeal was formally enacted and published as part of a broader legislative or administrative update, likely to modernize, streamline, or replace outdated rules with current ones.
- Since the original regulation is not named or described in the text, it is not possible to determine its subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, labor laws, licensing, etc.) without additional context.

**Conclusion:**

This entry serves as a **repeal notice** rather than a summary of an active regulation. It confirms that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework in 1998 and officially recognized in 2013 through SI/2013-107. As such, it is **not currently applicable**, and any legal or operational reliance on it would be invalid.

To obtain further details about the original regulation (such as its title, scope, or purpose), additional sources—such as the full text of the 1998 statute or the 2013 statutory instrument—would need to be consulted.
