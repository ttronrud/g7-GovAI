### **Overview**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, represents a significant reorganization of public service governance in Canada. It transfers specific human resources management functions and programs from the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** to the newly established **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)**.

### **Key Elements of the Transfer**

#### 1. **Scope of Transferred Functions**

The following units and programs within the Public Service Commission are transferred to the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency:

- **Accelerated Executive Development Directorate** – This central unit oversees executive talent development and leadership pipelines.
  - **Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) Prequalification Process** – Responsible for assessing and prequalifying candidates for senior executive positions.
  - **Accelerated Executive Development Program** – A leadership development initiative for high-potential public servants.
  - **Career Assignment Program** – A program that enables public servants to gain experience in different departments or regions through structured assignments.
  - **Management Trainee Program** – A rotational program designed to develop future mid-level managers by placing trainees in various roles across the federal government.
  - **Accelerated Economist Training Program** – A specialized training initiative for economists aiming to prepare them for senior roles in economic policy and analysis.
  - **Interchange Canada** – A program facilitating the movement of public servants between federal departments and agencies, promoting cross-departmental experience and workforce flexibility.
  - **Demographics within the Research Directorate** – Data collection and analysis related to workforce composition (e.g., age, gender, region, education).
  - **Labour Market Studies within the Research Directorate** – Research on labour market trends, skills gaps, and employment patterns to inform human resources policy.

#### 2. **Exclusions from Transfer**

Despite the broad transfer, **certain core functions of the Public Service Commission remain with the Commission**. These are explicitly excluded from the transfer and continue to be exercised by the PSC under the authority of the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Paragraph 5(a)** of the *Public Service Employment Act* – Likely refers to the Commission’s general authority to regulate the employment of public servants, including appointment, promotion, and disciplinary matters.
- **Section 6a** – Likely pertains to the Commission’s role in managing the public service’s employment policies and standards.
- **Section 8** – Likely relates to the Commission’s responsibility for the administration of the public service’s employment rules and regulations.
- **Section 35b** – May involve the Commission’s oversight of the appointment of certain senior officials or the integrity of public service employment processes.
- **Section 37c** – Possibly concerns the Commission’s role in managing or overseeing the implementation of public service policy and accountability.
- **Section 41d** – May relate to the Commission’s authority in matters involving public service ethics, integrity, or accountability.

These exclusions ensure that the Commission retains essential statutory responsibilities related to public service integrity, employment governance, and oversight — particularly those involving senior appointments, disciplinary actions, and policy enforcement.

### **Rationale and Context**

This transfer was part of a strategic shift in the Canadian federal public service to:

- Improve efficiency and accountability in human resources management.
- Create a more specialized, focused agency dedicated to workforce development and talent management.
- Align public service HR functions with modern workforce needs, including diversity, mobility, and leadership development.
- Promote cross-departmental collaboration through programs like Interchange Canada and the Career Assignment Program.

By transferring talent development and workforce planning functions to the PSHRMA, the government aimed to:
- Enhance the effectiveness of leadership pipelines.
- Improve workforce flexibility and responsiveness to changing policy and operational demands.
- Strengthen data-driven decision-making through better demographic and labour market analysis.

### **Legal Authority**

The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer functions between public service agencies, provided such transfers are consistent with the public service’s mission and operational needs.

The statutory references confirm the legal foundation of the transfer:
- **S.C. 1996, c. 18, s. 14** – Establishes the general framework for the transfer of duties.
- **S.C. 1999, c. 31, s. 185 and s. 186** – Provide specific provisions related to the transfer of human resources functions and the creation of the PSHRMA.

### **Implications**

- **For the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency (PSHRMA):**  
  Gains responsibility for leading talent development, workforce planning, and data analysis — positioning it as a central hub for human capital strategy.

- **For the Public Service Commission (PSC):**  
  Retains critical oversight and regulatory functions related to employment standards, integrity, and senior appointments, preserving its role as a guardian of public service values and accountability.

- **For Public Servants:**  
  Benefits from enhanced leadership development opportunities, greater mobility, and more responsive career planning.  
  However, access to certain employment governance processes (e.g., promotions, disciplinary actions) remains governed by the Commission.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Canada’s public service human resources architecture. It transfers key talent development and workforce planning functions from the Public Service Commission to the newly formed Public Service Human Resources Management Agency, effective April 1, 2004. The transfer is designed to improve the efficiency, agility, and effectiveness of public service leadership pipelines and workforce planning. However, the Public Service Commission retains essential statutory powers and duties related to employment governance, ensuring that core principles of accountability, integrity, and fairness remain intact.

This reorganization reflects a shift toward a more modern, results-oriented, and employee-centered public service.
