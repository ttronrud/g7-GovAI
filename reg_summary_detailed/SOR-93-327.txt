### **Detailed Summary of the Whale Cove Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Whale Cove Airport Zoning Regulations** are formally enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act of Canada**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and in a local newspaper (in this case, *News of the North*) to ensure public notice and opportunity for comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Grants the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) the power to adopt and promulgate such regulations after a public consultation period.

The proposed regulations were published in **two successive issues of the Canada Gazette Part I** on **March 6 and 13, 1993**, and in **two successive issues of the News of the North** on **March 15 and 22, 1993**. This provided a reasonable opportunity for stakeholders—including residents, landowners, aviation operators, and other interested parties—to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the regulations were officially adopted by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, effective as of the date of publication.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Official Title**: *Whale Cove Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to **all land** located:
  - Adjacent to, or
  - In the vicinity of
  - Whale Cove Airport, in the Northwest Territories.

This includes **public road allowances**, meaning even government-owned or publicly accessible land near the airport is subject to the zoning restrictions.

The specific boundaries and areas affected are detailed in **Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulations.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in enforcement, the following key terms are defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Whale Cove Airport, located in the vicinity of Whale Cove, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographical point used as a reference for measuring elevation and distances. It is located on the centerline of runway 150T–330T, 609.6 meters from the threshold of runway 330T. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip (runway 150T and 330T). These surfaces are designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches by limiting obstructions that could interfere with visibility. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the airport reference point**. However, if this elevation would place it below **9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or impractical restrictions. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, specifically the rectangular portion of the runway (1,339.2 meters long and 150 meters wide), including both runways 150T and 330T. It is centered on the runway's centerline. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), until they intersect with the outer surface. These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

#### **4. Elevation Reference**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is established at **17.5 meters above sea level**.
- All measurements and elevation limits in the regulations are referenced from this point.

#### **5. Key Prohibitions and Restrictions**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures)** on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that structure exceeds** any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This restriction ensures that no physical obstruction—such as towers, buildings, trees, or antennas—interferes with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases, thereby maintaining **flight safety and visibility**.

---

#### **6. Detailed Description of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway Ends)**

Two approach surfaces are defined—one for each runway end (150T and 330T):

- **Runway 150T Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined plane rising at a ratio of **1:40** (1 meter vertical per 40 meters horizontal).
  - Extends to an imaginary horizontal line:
    - 3,000 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.
    - 525 meters from the centerline of the runway (on either side).
    - Located **75 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**.
  
- **Runway 330T Approach Surface**:
  - Same 1:40 slope and geometric configuration as above.
  - Applies symmetrically to the opposite end of the runway.

> These surfaces are designed to protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring that no obstruction rises above this plane within the designated approach corridor.

##### **B. Outer Surface**

- A horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP (17.5 m ASL)** → **62.5 meters above sea level**.
- **Exception**: Where the 45-meter elevation would fall below **9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.
- This ensures that in low-lying areas, the regulation does not impose impractical or unachievable height restrictions.

> The outer surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure in the broader airport vicinity.

##### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from:
  - The lateral edges of the strip (runway)
  - The approach surfaces
- Continue upward and outward until they **intersect with the outer surface**.
- These surfaces provide a smooth, gradual transition between the runway area and the outer surface, ensuring that height restrictions are applied progressively and safely.

##### **D. Boundary of Applicable Land**

- The outer boundary of all land subject to these regulations is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This means that **any land within 4 kilometers of the ARP** is governed by these zoning rules.

> This creates a clearly defined buffer zone around the airport to protect flight operations.

#### **7. Legal and Operational Significance**

- **Flight Safety**: The primary purpose of these regulations is to **protect aircraft operations** by preventing obstructions that could compromise visibility, navigation, or safe landing/takeoff procedures.
- **Zoning Clarity**: By defining precise geometric surfaces (approach, transitional, outer), the regulations provide **clear, measurable, and enforceable limits** for development near the airport.
- **Public Participation**: The publication in both national and local media ensured transparency and allowed for meaningful stakeholder input before final adoption.
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: The regulations are legally binding. Any construction or modification that violates the height limits will be prohibited, and enforcement would fall under the jurisdiction of Transport Canada or local authorities as appropriate.

#### **8. Reference to Existing Planning Documents**

All definitions and spatial boundaries are derived from **Whale Cove Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2848**, dated **May 31, 1990**. This plan serves as the foundational document for the regulation and provides the visual and technical basis for the zoning design.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Whale Cove Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and scientifically grounded framework to ensure the **safety and efficiency of aviation operations** at Whale Cove Airport. By defining strict height limits through clearly delineated surfaces—approach, transitional, and outer—these regulations protect aircraft during critical phases of flight while balancing development needs in the surrounding area.

The regulations are rooted in sound aeronautical principles, supported by public consultation, and anchored in a detailed, measurable plan. They serve as a model for how airports in remote or sparsely populated regions can manage development in a way that respects both safety and community interests.
