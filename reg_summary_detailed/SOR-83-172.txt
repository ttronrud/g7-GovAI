- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **June 1, 2007**, as SOR/2007-160 was published in the Canada Gazette on that date.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: Although the original content of the regulation is not provided in the query, the repeated references suggest that this was a specific rule or provision (possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or another area) that was previously in force and was removed by legislative amendment.
- **Legal Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it is **no longer in force** and cannot be cited or applied. Any obligations, requirements, or penalties previously established under it have been removed and replaced (if applicable) or superseded by new legislation.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active or current regulation** described in the provided text. The entire entry serves as a **notice of repeal**, indicating that a prior regulation was officially canceled by the Government of Canada through SOR/2007-160, section 5. As such, **no detailed summary of the original regulation’s content** can be provided due to its absence in the input.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation prior to its repeal — which is not available in this query.
