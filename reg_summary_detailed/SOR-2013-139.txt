### **3. Classification of Violations**

Violations are categorized into three levels based on severity:

| Category | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Category A** | Minor or low-risk violations (e.g., minor recordkeeping errors, failure to report minor incidents) |
| **Category B** | Moderate-risk violations (e.g., failure to follow safety procedures, unauthorized access to restricted areas) |
| **Category C** | Serious or high-risk violations (e.g., failure to maintain safety systems, intentional disregard of safety controls, failure to report major incidents) |

This classification determines the **penalty range** applicable to the violator.

### **4. Penalty Amounts**

Penalties are differentiated based on whether the violator is an **individual** or a **person other than an individual** (e.g., corporations, organizations).

### **5. Factors Considered in Determining Penalty Amount**

The CNSC considers the following factors when setting the final penalty amount:

1. **Compliance History**  
   – Prior history of compliance or past violations (e.g., previous warnings, minor penalties).

2. **Degree of Intention or Negligence**  
   – Whether the violation was intentional, reckless, or due to gross negligence.

3. **Harm Caused or Potentially Caused**  
   – The actual or potential impact on safety, environment, public health, or nuclear security.

4. **Competitive or Economic Benefit**  
   – Whether the violator gained financial advantage, market benefit, or economic gain from the violation.

5. **Efforts to Mitigate or Reverse Harm**  
   – Whether the person took steps to correct the violation, reduce its impact, or restore safety.

6. **Assistance Provided to the CNSC**  
   – Whether the violator cooperated fully, provided information, or assisted in investigations.

7. **Early Disclosure**  
   – Whether the violation was reported to the CNSC before it was discovered or escalated.

> These factors ensure that penalties are **proportionate, fair, and reflective of the seriousness and context** of each violation.
