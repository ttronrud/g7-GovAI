### **Detailed Summary of the Smithers Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Smithers Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of official rules established under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* in British Columbia, Canada. These regulations were approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, and are designed to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency at **Smithers Airport**, located near the town of Smithers.

## **1. Purpose and Scope**

### **Objective**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish spatial and elevation controls** around Smithers Airport to:
- Prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff and landing.
- Ensure safe flight paths by limiting structures and natural features that could interfere with aircraft approaches and departures.
- Protect the airport’s critical operational zones from development or environmental hazards.

### **Applicable Area**
The regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—within or adjacent to the airport, specifically:
- The lands **within** the designated boundaries (the "outer limits").
- The lands **directly under** any portion of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limits.

This means that even land just beneath the approach surface is subject to strict height restrictions.

## **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Smithers Airport, near Smithers, BC |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point used as the baseline for elevation measurements. Located at the **northeast corner of the Rotating Beacon**, with UTM coordinates: 6,076,470.969 North, 616,611.411 East. Its assigned elevation is **519 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway (runway 14–32). It slopes at a **1:50 ratio** (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontal distance) to meet the outer surface. Designed to protect aircraft during approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 519 m + 45 m = 564 m ASL), **except** where the ground is lower than 9 meters. In such cases, the outer surface is **9 meters above ground level** to prevent dangerous overhangs. |
| **Strip** | The main runway area (14–32), measuring **300 meters wide** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,948.8 meters long**. This is the central zone where aircraft take off and land. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces**, sloping at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontally), rising to meet the outer surface. Ensures a smooth transition from the runway edge to the outer surface. |

> All these surfaces are detailed in the official **Department of Transport Smithers Airport Zoning Plan No. B.C. 1384**, dated January 31, 1980.

## **3. Height Restrictions**

### **Prohibited Construction**
No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**.
- Add any **extension** to an existing building, structure, or object.

On any land covered by these regulations, **the highest point** of any such structure or object must **not exceed** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**
2. **Outer Surface**
3. **Transitional Surface**

This rule applies to all structures, including towers, trees, antennas, or even rooftop features.

---

## **4. Natural Growth Regulation**

If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to:
- Remove or trim the excessive growth.
- Ensure the vegetation does not pose a hazard to aircraft operations.

This provision ensures that natural features do not become obstructions during flight operations.

---

## **5. Waste Disposal Prohibition**

No owner or occupier of regulated land may:
- Use the land for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible** to birds.
  - **Attractive** to birds.

This is a critical measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation hazard. The regulation aims to reduce bird populations near the airport by eliminating food sources and nesting sites.

---

## **6. Boundary Description (Outer Limits)**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a precise, detailed **legal boundary description** (a legal description in survey terms). The boundary is composed of a series of straight-line segments and directional bearings, starting and ending at a defined point.

### **Key Features of the Boundary:**
- Begins at the **intersection of the centerline of approach 14** and the **northerly boundary of the Southeast 1/4 of Section 26, Township 1A**.
- Proceeds through a series of directional bearings (azimuths) and straight-line segments, referencing specific land parcels (e.g., District Lots, Sections, Plats).
- Includes reference to:
  - **Approach surfaces** (14 and 32)
  - **Lot numbers and plans** (e.g., Lot 1, Plan 4975)
  - **Township and section boundaries**
  - **The Bulkley River**
- Ends at the **intersection of the centerline of approach 32** and the **southerly boundary of Lot U, Plan 6127 of District Lot 865**.

> The full boundary is **graphically shown in yellow** on the official Department of Transport plan (B.C. 1384, January 31, 1980).

## **7. Surface Descriptions**

### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 14–32)**

Each approach surface is defined for both **runway 14** and **runway 32**:

#### **Runway 14 Approach Surface:**
- Starts at the end of the strip (runway 14).
- Begins as an **inclined plane** with a **1:50 slope** (1 m rise per 50 m horizontal).
- Rises to meet the **outer surface**.
- Continues horizontally to an imaginary line drawn at **right angles** to the runway centerline at the **northerly boundary of the Southeast 1/4 of Section 26, Township 1A**.
- Then slopes upward at the same 1:50 ratio for **15,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the strip.
- At the outer end, the surface reaches **804.3 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 519 m + 804.3 m = 1,323.3 m ASL).

#### **Runway 32 Approach Surface:**
- Starts at the end of the strip (runway 32).
- Same 1:50 slope to meet the outer surface.
- Continues horizontally to a line drawn at right angles to the runway centerline at the **southerly boundary of Lot U, Plan 6127 of District Lot 865**.
- Then slopes upward for 15,000 meters horizontally.
- At the outer end, it reaches **799.7 meters above the ARP** (i.e., 519 m + 799.7 m = 1,318.7 m ASL).

> These surfaces are designed to provide a safe "clear zone" for aircraft during final approach.

---

### **Outer Surface**

- **Elevation**: Constantly **45 meters above the ARP** (519 m ASL → 564 m ASL).
- **Exception**: If the natural ground surface is less than **9 meters above sea level**, the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground level** to avoid creating dangerous overhangs.

This ensures that no object, whether man-made or natural, rises above a safe threshold.

---

### **Transitional Surface**

- Extends **from the lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces**.
- Slopes at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter rise per 7 meters horizontally).
- Runs at right angles to the runway centerline.
- Rises to meet the **outer surface**.

This surface ensures a gradual transition between the runway edge and the outer surface, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or obstruction height.

---

## **8. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue **directions** requiring removal of excessive vegetation.
  - Enforce compliance with height and waste restrictions.
- Violations of these regulations may result in penalties or legal action.

---

## **9. Legal and Operational Significance**

These regulations are:
- **Legally binding** under the *Aeronautics Act*, Section 6.
- Based on **aviation safety standards** used in Canada to manage airport zones.
- A critical component of **airport environmental and operational planning**.
- Designed to protect aircraft from:
  - Obstruction during approach/departure.
  - Bird strikes.
  - Uncontrolled growth or
