**Detailed Summary of the Financial Security (Electronic Means) Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

The *Financial Security (Electronic Means) Regulations* are made under the authority of **paragraph 8.6(1)(a)a** and **subsection 166(1)b** of the *Customs Act* (S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 304 and s. 330(1); R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)). These provisions empower the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to establish rules governing the form, method, and enforcement of financial security required under the *Customs Act* and the *Customs Tariff*.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **modernize and standardize the process by which financial security is provided**—specifically, to require that all such security be given through a centralized, secure, and electronic system, thereby improving transparency, accountability, and efficiency in customs enforcement.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define four core terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Customs Act*.
- **Debtor**: A person who has given security under the *Customs Act* or *Customs Tariff*.
- **Security Agreement**: A legally binding agreement between a debtor and a security provider, under which the provider guarantees payment of an amount owed by the debtor.
- **Security Provider**: A person who provides financial assurance that a debtor will pay their obligations under the Act or Tariff.

These definitions form the foundation for interpreting the scope and obligations under the regulations.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all financial security required under the Customs Act or Customs Tariff**, with specific exceptions noted in Section 6 (see below).

---

### **4. Required Form of Security**

Under **paragraph 166(1)(b)** of the *Customs Act*, security must be either:
- A **deposit**, or  
- A **written security agreement**.

This regulation ensures that security is not given in informal or unrecorded forms, and must be formally documented and recorded electronically.

---

### **5. Mandatory Terms and Conditions of Security Agreements**

Every security agreement must contain the following **terms and conditions**, which are deemed **integral and binding**, and **take precedence over any conflicting or inconsistent provisions** in the agreement:

1. **Validity and Binding Nature**:  
   The debtor and security provider **represent and warrant** that the security agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation.

2. **Payment Obligation upon Default**:  
   If the debtor fails to pay an amount due by the day it is payable, the **security provider must pay** to *His Majesty in right of Canada* the **lesser of**:
   - The amount owed by the debtor under the Act or Tariff (subject to the limit in subsection 8(5)), and  
   - The amount of security entered or confirmed by the provider under paragraph 5(2)(e).

> This ensures that the security provider is only liable up to the amount of security provided, and that they are not held responsible for more than what was agreed upon.

---

### **6. Eligible Security Providers**

Only specific types of entities may act as security providers. A provider must be one of the following:

| Eligible Entity Type | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Approved Insurance Company** | A company approved by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions under subsection 53(1) of the *Insurance Companies Act* to conduct fidelity or surety insurance in Canada. |
| **Licensed Provincial Fidelity/Surety Business** | An entity licensed or authorized under provincial law to offer fidelity or surety insurance. |
| **Canadian Payments Association Member** | A member of the Canadian Payments Association (as defined in section 4 of the *Canadian Payments Act*). |
| **CDIC- or AMF-Insured Depository Corporation** | A corporation that accepts public deposits insured by the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)** or the **Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)**, up to the maximum limits set by their respective statutes. |
| **Credit Union** | As defined in subsection 137(6) of the *Income Tax Act*. |
| **Public Deposit Corporation with Provincial Guarantee** | A corporation that accepts public deposits, where repayment is guaranteed by *His Majesty in right of a province*. |

> This list ensures that only financially sound, regulated, and accountable institutions can provide security, reducing risk to the Canadian government.

---

### **7. Electronic System Requirement**

**Subject to subsection (3)**, all security must be given **through the electronic system specified by the Minister**.

This is a central feature of the regulation, designed to:
- Improve traceability,
- Reduce fraud,
- Ensure real-time monitoring,
- Enhance compliance.

#### **When Security is Given (Electronic Entry/Confirmation)**

A security agreement is considered "given" when the security provider **enters or confirms via the electronic system** the following information:

- A unique **number or identifier** for the agreement  
- The **names of the parties** (debtor and provider)  
- The **relevant Agency program** (e.g., import duty program)  
- The **applicable business number** (e.g., Business Number under the Canada Revenue Agency)  
- The **amount of the security**  
- The **legislative authority** under which the security is given (e.g., section of the *Customs Act*)  
- The **validity period** of the agreement  

> This creates a fully digital, auditable record of every security arrangement.

---

### **8. Exceptions to Electronic Requirement**

The Minister may **require security to be given by other means** (e.g., paper, manual entry) **only if** one of the following conditions applies:

- The **infrastructure** is inadequate or incompatible with the designated electronic system;  
- A **natural disaster, national crisis, or exceptional circumstance** prevents or makes the electronic system unreliable; or  
- It is **impracticable** for the debtor (due to circumstances beyond their control) to use the electronic system.

> These exceptions are narrowly defined and require Ministerial determination, ensuring that the electronic mandate remains the default.

---

### **9. Reporting Obligations**

- **On Request**, both the **debtor and security provider** must submit a **copy of the security agreement** to the Minister via the **electronic system**.
- If a security agreement is to be **terminated**, the provider must notify the Minister **at least 30 days in advance** via the electronic system.

> This ensures transparency and allows the Minister to monitor the lifecycle of all security arrangements.

---

### **10. Demand for Payment Upon Default**

If a debtor fails to pay an amount due by the day it is payable, the Minister may **demand payment** from the security provider under subsection 8(2).

#### **Requirements for a Demand Letter**:
- Must be sent **in writing**  
- Must include:
  - The **amount of payment demanded**  
  - The **information** that the provider entered or confirmed under subsection 5(2)

#### **Timing of Demand**:
- Can only be made **within one year** after the agreement has **expired or been terminated**.

#### **Amount of Demand**:
The demand must be for the **lesser of**:
- The amount the debtor owes under the Act or Tariff, and  
- The amount of security entered or confirmed under paragraph 5(2)(e)

> This ensures that the security provider is not liable for more than the amount they agreed to guarantee.

---

### **11. Response to Demand (Within 60 Days)**

Within **60 days** of receiving the demand, the security provider must either:

1. **Pay** the amount demanded to *His Majesty in right of Canada*, or  
2. **Provide information to rebut** the demand (e.g., evidence that the debtor did not default or that the amount owed is incorrect).

#### **Review and Determination by the Minister**:
- If the provider submits rebuttal information, the Minister must **review it** and decide whether to:
  - Continue the demand,  
  - Amend it, or  
  - Withdraw it  
- The provider must be **notified in writing** of the Minister’s decision.

#### **Payment Upon Final Determination**:
- If the notice indicates that payment is required, the provider must **pay the amount on the day the notice is received**.

> This establishes a clear, time-bound, and enforceable process for resolving disputes and collecting security payments.

---

### **12. Dispute and Liability Clauses (For Greater Certainty)**

- **Payment is mandatory regardless of disputes** between the debtor and the security provider.  
  > This ensures that the government is not delayed or blocked from recovering funds due to internal disagreements.

- **Payment by the security provider does not relieve the debtor of liability**.  
  > The debtor remains responsible for the amount owed, even if the security provider pays it. This protects the government’s interest and ensures that the debtor cannot avoid obligations through third-party arrangements.

---

### **13. Exemption for Pre-Existing Security**

These regulations **do not apply** to any security that:
- Was given **under the Act or Customs Tariff** and  
- Was **valid immediately before** the day these regulations came into force.

> Such pre-existing security **continues to be valid** until it expires or is terminated.

> This provides **legal continuity** for existing arrangements and avoids sudden disruption to ongoing operations.

---

### **14. Coming Into Force**

The regulations come into force at **3:00:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight
