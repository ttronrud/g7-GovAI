**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Critical Habitat of the Hotwater Physa (Physella wrighti) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk of extinction. The full name of the Act is *Species at Risk Act, S.C. 2002, c. 29*, and it establishes a legal framework for identifying, protecting, and managing critical habitat for endangered species.

The specific provision invoked in this Order is **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of SARA. These subsections empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFDO) to designate and regulate the critical habitat of a species listed as endangered under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to SARA.

**2. Species at Risk: Hotwater Physa (Physella wrighti)**

- The **Hotwater Physa** (*Physella wrighti*) is a species of small, freshwater snail native to specific aquatic environments in Canada.
- It is officially listed as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Species at Risk Act**.
- This listing means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate conservation measures.

---

**3. Critical Habitat Identification**

- A formal **action plan** for the Hotwater Physa was developed to guide recovery efforts.
- This action plan identified the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.
- The identified critical habitat has been officially **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a government database that publicly records information on species at risk and their conservation status.

---

**4. Key Legal Determination**

- The regulation explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat** designated in this Order falls within a location referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA.
- Subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA would otherwise trigger a prohibition on certain activities (such as development or alteration) in areas where critical habitat is located *and* where such areas are within a "prohibited area" (e.g., land or waters subject to federal or provincial jurisdiction with specific restrictions).
- By confirming that **no portion of the designated critical habitat is in a prohibited area under subsection 58(2)(b)**, the regulation avoids potential conflicts or legal complications related to land-use or development restrictions.

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The **Critical Habitat of the Hotwater Physa (Physella wrighti) Order** formally designates and legally recognizes the specific geographic areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.
- This designation serves as a legal tool to:
  - Protect the habitat from harmful activities (e.g., pollution, habitat destruction, or alteration).
  - Ensure that federal projects or activities that may affect the habitat are assessed and, if necessary, modified under SARA’s regulatory framework.
- The Order is **binding** and applies under **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, which mandates that the critical habitat of an endangered species is subject to protection and management by the Minister.

---

**6. Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- Once registered, it becomes enforceable and is subject to oversight by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
- The Minister may issue directives or permits to manage or mitigate impacts on the designated critical habitat, in accordance with SARA’s requirements.

---

**7. Significance and Conservation Implications**

- This Order strengthens the legal protection of a rare and ecologically sensitive species.
- It reflects the government’s commitment to conserving biodiversity and fulfilling its duty under international and domestic environmental obligations.
- The designation helps ensure that future development, environmental assessments, and land-use planning take into account the needs of the Hotwater Physa and its habitat.

**Conclusion**

This regulation formally establishes the critical habitat of the endangered Hotwater Physa (*Physella wrighti*) under the *Species at Risk Act*. It is based on scientific data from the species’ action plan, which is publicly accessible in the Species at Risk Public Registry. The Order is legally sound, as it avoids conflicts with prohibited areas under SARA, and it provides a clear, enforceable framework to protect this vulnerable species and support its recovery. The Order is a key step in Canada’s broader strategy to conserve biodiversity and prevent species extinction.
