**Detailed Summary of the Atlantic Region Ferry Remission Order (SI/74-123)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Atlantic Region Ferry Remission Order** (SI/74-123) is issued under the authority of **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board) to make or revoke orders related to customs duties. This action is taken with the **concurrence of the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)**, ensuring that the decision aligns with transport policy and regulatory oversight.

The order revokes the earlier **Newfoundland Gulf Ferry Remission Order** (P.C. 1974-2332, dated October 22, 1974), which had granted similar remission benefits, and replaces it with a new, more specific and targeted remission policy for the **Atlantic Region Ferry Service**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **grant a remission (exemption) of customs duties** for vessels operated by **CN Marine Corporation** under charter agreements to provide ferry services across the Atlantic provinces. This supports the development and operation of essential transportation infrastructure in the Atlantic region, particularly in areas where interprovincial and intraprovincial connectivity is vital.

---

### **3. Scope of the Remission**
The remission applies to:

- **All customs duties** under the **Customs Tariff** that are:
  - Paid or payable in respect of **vessels chartered by CN Marine Corporation**;
  - Used for the **intraprovincial and interprovincial conveyance of goods and passengers**;
  - Operated within the **Atlantic provinces** (specifically: Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick).

Additionally, the remission extends to **spare parts** necessary for the operation of these vessels while they are in service.

> This means that the cost of importing the vessels (or their components) is effectively reduced or eliminated, making it more economically feasible for CN Marine Corporation to operate ferry services in the region.

---

### **4. Conditions of the Remission**
A key condition attached to the remission is:

> The **Water Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)** must **notify the Minister of National Revenue** that **no suitable vessel is available** to fulfill the required ferry service.

This condition serves as a **policy safeguard** to ensure that:
- The remission is not granted in cases where alternative transportation solutions exist;
- The government is informed that the service is genuinely necessary due to a lack of viable alternatives;
- The remission is only used when there is a genuine need due to geographic, economic, or logistical constraints.

This requirement ensures accountability and prevents misuse of the remission benefit.

### **5. Citation and Publication**
The Order is officially cited as the **Atlantic Region Ferry Remission Order** and was published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, Volume 108, No. 21**, on **November 13, 1974**.

---

### **6. Significance and Context**
- This order reflects the federal government’s role in supporting **critical infrastructure** in remote or underserved regions of Canada.
- It underscores the importance of **interprovincial connectivity** in the Atlantic provinces, where ferry services are often the only viable means of transport between islands and coastal communities.
- The revocation of the older Newfoundland Gulf Ferry Order suggests a shift in focus—from a specific regional route (Newfoundland Gulf) to a broader, more comprehensive policy for the entire Atlantic region.
- The inclusion of spare parts indicates that the government recognizes the **operational continuity** and **sustainability** of ferry services, not just the initial vessel import.

---

### **7. Key Implications**
- **For CN Marine Corporation**: Significant cost savings on customs duties, enabling more affordable operation of ferry services.
- **For the Canadian Transport Commission**: A formal obligation to assess vessel availability and report to the Minister of National Revenue, reinforcing oversight.
- **For the Atlantic provinces**: Enhanced access to reliable transportation, which supports trade, commerce, and public mobility.

### **Conclusion**
The **Atlantic Region Ferry Remission Order (SI/74-123)** is a targeted fiscal and regulatory measure designed to support the operation of ferry services in Canada’s Atlantic provinces. By remitting customs duties on vessels and spare parts used in intraprovincial and interprovincial transport, it promotes regional connectivity and economic viability. However, this benefit is conditional upon the Canadian Transport Commission confirming the absence of alternative vessels, ensuring that the remission is used only when truly necessary.

This order exemplifies how federal policy can balance economic support with regulatory accountability in infrastructure development.
