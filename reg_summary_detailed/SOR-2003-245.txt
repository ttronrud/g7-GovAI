**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Exemption from Approval for Certain Investments in Intragroup Service Entities (Trust and Loan Companies)*

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 459(b)a** and **section 531b** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (TLC Act), and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This reflects a delegation of regulatory power to the federal government to implement specific provisions related to trust and loan companies.

**Statutory References:**  
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 550** – Provides the enabling authority for the regulation.  
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 569** – May relate to procedural or administrative aspects of the regulation.  
- **S.C. 1991, c. 45** – Likely refers to the original or amended version of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* or related legislation.  

**Core Provision (Subsections 453(5) and (6) of the TLC Act):**  
Under the original provisions of the TLC Act, certain activities involving acquisitions of control or substantial investments in other entities are subject to **prior regulatory approval**. Specifically, subsections 453(5) and (6) would normally require approval for:

- A trust or loan company acquiring **control** of another entity, or  
- A trust or loan company acquiring or increasing a **substantial investment** in another entity.

However, **this requirement does not apply** in specific circumstances defined in **paragraph 453(4)(b)** of the Act.

**Key Exemption Condition:**  
The exemption applies **only when** the financial intermediary activities of the entity in question (the "service entity") are **limited to providing services exclusively to the company or to members of the company’s group**.

In simpler terms:  
If a trust or loan company invests in, or acquires control of, a service entity (such as a back-office support, administrative, or technology service provider), and that service entity **does not engage in financial intermediary activities that expose it to material market or credit risk**, then **no prior regulatory approval is required**.

**Definition of "Financial Intermediary Activities" (Implied):**  
These are activities that involve taking on financial risk, such as:  
- Lending money  
- Accepting deposits  
- Trading financial instruments  
- Underwriting or issuing securities  
- Managing credit risk  

If such activities are **exclusively limited to serving the parent company or its group members**, and do **not involve exposure to external market or credit risks**, the investment is considered non-risky from a regulatory standpoint and thus exempt from approval.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective is to **promote operational efficiency and group integration** within financial institutions. By allowing trust and loan companies to freely invest in internal service entities without needing approval, the regulation:

- Reduces regulatory burden on internal service operations  
- Encourages better coordination and cost-sharing within corporate groups  
- Supports the development of efficient, vertically integrated financial service structures  
- Ensures that only entities with genuine financial risk exposure are subject to regulatory scrutiny  

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means they are immediately effective upon official publication, allowing companies to apply the exemption from the date of registration.

**In Summary:**  
This regulation provides a **clear exemption** from the requirement for prior approval when a trust or loan company invests in or acquires control of a service entity — provided that the entity's financial activities are **non-intermediary** and **exclusively serve the parent company or its group members**. It is a targeted measure to support internal efficiency and group governance while maintaining regulatory oversight of risk-exposed financial activities.

This exemption is **not a blanket permission** — it is conditional on the service entity’s activities being strictly limited to non-risky, internal support functions. Any entity engaging in financial intermediation with external market exposure would fall outside the scope of this exemption and would require regulatory approval under the standard provisions of the TLC Act.
