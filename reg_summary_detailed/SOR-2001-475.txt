### **3. Conditions That Money Market Mutual Funds Must Meet**

A money market mutual fund must comply with **all** of the following conditions:

#### ✅ **Condition 1: Investment in Permitted Assets**
All assets must be invested in **one or more** of the following:
- **Cash**
- **Cash equivalents**
- **Evidences of indebtedness** (non-cash equivalents) with a remaining term to maturity of **365 days or less**
- **Floating rate evidences of indebtedness** (i.e., variable-rate debt), **only if**:
  - The principal amount of the obligation will **remain approximately at par** (i.e., market value near face value) at the time of each rate adjustment.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures funds are invested in highly liquid, short-duration instruments with predictable value.

---

#### ✅ **Condition 2: Portfolio Maturity Limit**
- The **dollar-weighted average term to maturity** of the fund’s portfolio of evidences of indebtedness must **not exceed 90 days**.
- For **floating rate obligations**, the term is calculated as the period **remaining to the next rate-setting date**.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Limits exposure to interest rate risk and ensures high liquidity. This prevents funds from holding long-duration debt, which could be subject to significant price fluctuations.

---

#### ✅ **Condition 3: Currency Alignment Requirement**
- **Not less than 95%** of the fund’s assets must be invested in:
  - Cash, or
  - Cash equivalents, or
  - Evidences of indebtedness **denominated in the same currency** as the **net asset value (NAV) per security** of the fund.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Prevents currency risk and ensures that the fund’s value is stable and predictable in relation to its stated NAV. This avoids exposure to foreign exchange volatility.

---

#### ✅ **Condition 4: Credit Quality Requirement**
- **Not less than 95%** of the fund’s assets must be invested in one or more of:
  - Cash
  - Cash equivalents
  - Evidences of indebtedness from **issuers whose commercial paper has an approved credit rating**

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures that the majority of the fund’s holdings are backed by issuers with strong creditworthiness, reducing default risk.

> 💡 *Note*: "Commercial paper" refers to short-term unsecured debt issued by corporations to finance operations. The requirement applies only to issuers whose commercial paper is rated at or above the approved threshold.

### **4. Regulatory Objectives and Rationale**

These regulations were introduced to:
- **Protect investors** by ensuring that money market mutual funds are not exposed to significant credit, interest rate, or currency risks.
- **Maintain liquidity** through strict limits on maturity and investment types.
- **Ensure transparency and stability** in the fund’s performance by requiring ratings and clear criteria for asset selection.
- **Align with international best practices** in money market fund governance.

> These rules are particularly relevant in a financial environment where short-term debt can be vulnerable to sudden shifts in interest rates or credit conditions.

### **5. Key Takeaways and Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Strict Maturity Cap (90 days)** | Funds cannot hold long-term debt; even floating-rate instruments must have short reset periods. |
| **High Cash/Cash Equivalent Requirement** | Funds must maintain a large portion of assets in highly liquid, low-risk instruments. |
| **Approved Credit Rating Requirement** | Fund managers must verify that all debt instruments are rated by a recognized agency and are at or above the minimum threshold. |
| **Currency Matching Rule** | The fund’s currency of investment must match the currency used to calculate NAV—preventing currency risk. |
| **No Exposure to High-Risk Debt** | Funds cannot invest in instruments without approved ratings or in foreign currencies unrelated to NAV. |

---

### **6. Compliance and Enforcement**

- The regulations apply to all **money market mutual funds** operating in Canada.
- Fund managers and custodians are responsible for ensuring compliance with these conditions.
- Regulatory oversight is likely exercised by **FINTRAC**, the **Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)**, or **OSFI** (Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions), depending on the fund structure.
- Non-compliance could result in penalties, suspension of operations, or regulatory intervention.

---

### **7. Historical Context and Relevance**

- These regulations were introduced in **2001**, during a period of increased financial market volatility and concern over liquidity risks in mutual funds.
- They reflect a broader trend in financial regulation to **enhance investor protection** in low-risk, short-term investment vehicles.
- While the core principles remain relevant, some aspects (e.g., credit rating thresholds) may be reviewed or updated in light of evolving market conditions or changes in the *Canadian Payments Act*.
