### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 5 (ND)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
- The regulation is issued under **section 18(1) of the Privacy Act** (Canada), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence and the Treasury Board) to designate certain personal information banks as "exempt" from the general privacy protections set out in the Act.
- The designation is further grounded in **section 21 of the Privacy Act**, which provides the legal basis for declaring specific personal information banks as exempt from the requirements of the Act when they contain sensitive information necessary for national security or intelligence operations.

#### **2. Name and Citation**
- The Order is officially titled:  
  **"Exempt Personal Information Bank Order, No. 5 (ND)"**  
- It may be cited as: **S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 111, (Schedule II)**  
  This indicates that it is part of a consolidated statutory instrument (Statutory Code) from the years 1980 to 1983, specifically Chapter 111, and is included in Schedule II of that legislation.

#### **3. Subject Matter of the Order**
- The Order designates a specific personal information bank within the **Department of National Defence (DND)** as an **exempt personal information bank**.
- The specific file referenced is:  
  **Security and Intelligence Information Files, No. ND-P70**

#### **4. Scope and Content**
- The **ND-P70 files** are a collection of personal information maintained by the Department of National Defence.
- These files contain **sensitive personal information** related to individuals involved in or connected with national security and intelligence activities.
- The information in these files is considered critical to the operations of Canada’s security and intelligence apparatus and is not subject to the general privacy protections under the Privacy Act.

#### **5. Legal Implications of the Exemption**
- By designating ND-P70 as an **exempt personal information bank**, the Order means that:
  - The collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal information in this bank are **not subject to the usual privacy requirements** of the Privacy Act (such as those governing access, notice, and accountability).
  - The exemption is justified under **section 21**, which allows such exemptions when the information is necessary for:
    - The protection of national security,
    - The effective operation of intelligence and security services,
    - The prevention of threats to public safety or national security.
- The exemption does **not** imply that the information is unregulated or unprotected. It means that the privacy protections typically applied to personal information (e.g., public access, individual consent, data minimization) do **not apply** in this specific case due to its sensitive and strategic nature.

#### **6. Oversight and Accountability**
- Although the information is exempt from standard privacy rules, the Department of National Defence remains responsible for:
  - Ensuring the **legitimate and lawful use** of the information,
  - Maintaining **security and confidentiality** of the data,
  - Complying with other applicable laws (e.g., the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Defence Act, or other relevant legislation),
  - Providing **justified, documented reasons** for any access or disclosure of the information.

#### **7. Purpose and Rationale**
- The primary purpose of this Order is to:
  - Enable the Department of National Defence to operate effectively in national security and intelligence matters,
  - Protect the integrity and operational secrecy of intelligence operations,
  - Prevent undue delays or legal challenges that could arise from applying standard privacy requirements to highly sensitive information.

#### **8. Duration and Review**
- While the regulation does not explicitly state a sunset clause or review mechanism, such exemptions are typically subject to:
  - Periodic review by the Minister of National Defence and the Treasury Board,
  - Oversight by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (where applicable),
  - Reassessment if the nature of the information or the operational needs change.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a formal exemption under the **Privacy Act** for the **Security and Intelligence Information Files No. ND-P70**, maintained by the Department of National Defence. It reflects a balance between the need for national security and the protection of individual privacy rights. By designating this information bank as exempt, the government acknowledges that certain personal information is essential for intelligence and security operations and must be handled under special, non-standardized privacy rules to ensure operational effectiveness and national security.
