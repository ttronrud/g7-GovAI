**Detailed Summary of the Lighters Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Lighters Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish comprehensive safety standards for lighters sold in Canada. These regulations aim to **prevent injuries, particularly to children**, by ensuring that lighters are designed with child-resistant features, operate safely under various conditions, and are clearly labeled with necessary warnings and instructions.

The regulations apply to all lighters sold or imported into Canada, with special provisions for **luxury lighters** (refillable, higher-value lighters) and **different types of fuel** (gas vs. wick).

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CFR** | Title 16 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, revised as of January 1, 2004. Used as a reference for testing standards. |
| **Gas lighter** | A lighter using liquid hydrocarbons (e.g., n-butane, isobutane) with a vapor pressure at 24°C > 100 kPa. |
| **Lighter** | Any device with a fuel reservoir and an integral ignition system used for domestic purposes or to ignite tobacco. |
| **Luxury lighter** | A refillable lighter (not a utility lighter) that has a value of **over $2.50** at time of sale (if made in Canada) or **over $2.50 in duty value** (if imported). |
| **Production lot** | A group of substantially identical lighters manufactured under the same conditions by the same manufacturer. |
| **Shield** | A structure that surrounds the fuel orifice and extends beyond it. |
| **Surrogate lighter** | A test device that mimics the appearance, size, weight, and child-resistance characteristics of the actual lighter—contains no fuel and produces a sound or light instead of a flame. |
| **Utility lighter** | A lighter that is **100 mm or longer** when fully extended. |
| **Wick lighter** | A lighter using fuels like hexane with vapor pressure at 24°C ≤ 34 kPa. |

## **Child Resistance Requirements**

### **General Rule**
- **All lighters except luxury lighters must be child-resistant.**

### **Child Resistance Test Protocol**
A lighter is considered child-resistant **if its surrogate lighter** passes one of the following tests and **at least 85% of children** in the test **cannot operate it**:

- **Utility lighters**: Test per **CFR section 1212.4**, *excluding* subsections (a)(3) and (b)(1).
- **All other lighters**: Test per **CFR section 1210.4**, *excluding* subsections (a)(3) and (b)(1).

> These tests simulate how easily a child (typically aged 3–6 years) could ignite the lighter.

### **Requirements for Child-Resistant Mechanisms**
The child-resistant mechanism must:
1. **Reset automatically** after each ignition attempt.
2. For **gas lighters**, continue to function effectively after testing in **sections 5–9 of the schedule**.
3. For **wick lighters**, continue to function effectively after testing in **sections 11 and 12 of the schedule**.

## **Flame Height and Operation Requirements**

### **Gas Lighters – Flame Height Limits**
- **No shield, no flame height adjustment**: Max **50 mm** vertical flame height.
- **With shield, no flame height adjustment**: Max **100 mm**.
- **With flame height adjustment**:
  - **Maximum flame height**: 120 mm
  - **Minimum flame height**: 50 mm
- **After extinguishing**: Flame must **not reappear for more than 2 seconds**.

### **Prohibited Flame Behaviors**
During testing (sections 5–10), gas lighters must **not exhibit**:
- A sudden increase in flame height of **50 mm or more**
- Vertical flame height exceeding the maximum limits
- Explosion
- Combustion outside the fuel orifice or main flame
- Escape of liquid fuel causing a shower of burning droplets
- Any other unsafe or abnormal burning behavior

### **Durability and Safety During Testing**
- Must not show **damage** that would make operation unsafe.
- During **section 8 (drop test)**: No fuel escape exceeding **15 mg/min**.
- During **section 9 (temperature test)**: No total fuel exhaustion after cooling period.
- During **section 10 (pressure test)**: No drop in internal pressure exceeding **250 kPa/min**.

### **Extended Operation Test (Section 7)**
During a **2-minute continuous burn**:
- Must not ignite component parts
- Must not expel the valve mechanism
- Must not rupture the fuel reservoir (with or without flame)

---

## **Wick Lighter Requirements**

### **Burn Test (Sections 11 & 12)**
- Must not exhibit:
  - Sudden flame increase of **50 mm or more**
  - Explosion
  - Combustion outside the wick
  - Any other unsafe burning behavior

### **Drop Test (Section 12)**
- Must not suffer:
  - Rupture of fuel reservoir
  - Any damage that would make operation unsafe

---

## **Labeling and Marking Requirements**

### **Mandatory Permanent Markings**
Every lighter must have:
- **Manufacturer’s name** (in Roman letters, Arabic numerals, or combination)
- **Trademark** registered in Canada or pending application

> Markings must remain **clear and visible throughout the lighter’s useful life**.

### **Production Lot Identification**
If multiple production lots are offered for sale, each lighter must have a **clear and visible identification** of its lot.

### **Business Information**
- If **manufactured in Canada**: Must show manufacturer or distributor’s **principal place of business**.
- If **imported**: Must show **importer or distributor’s name and principal place of business in Canada**.

> Applies **only if not a luxury lighter** (see exception below).

### **Child Safety Warning**
All lighters must carry the warning:
> **"KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN / TENIR HORS DE LA PORTÉE DES ENFANTS"**  
(or any equivalent warning conveying the same meaning)

### **Flame Adjustment Symbols**
Every lighter with a flame height adjustment mechanism must have a **clear, easily understood symbol** indicating:
- Direction to increase flame height
- Direction to decrease flame height

## **Refillable Lighters – Specific Requirements**
