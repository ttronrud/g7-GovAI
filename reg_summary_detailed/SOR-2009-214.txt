**Detailed Summary of the CPFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Enactment**

The *CPFTA Rules of Origin Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing the origin of goods for the purpose of determining eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under a free trade agreement.

The regulation is formally enacted under **Section 34(1) of S.C. 2001, c. 28** (the *Customs Tariff*), and is further supported by **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which provides the foundational legal framework for implementing international trade agreements in Canada.

**2. Applicable Provisions of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)**

These Regulations incorporate and give legal effect in Canada to specific provisions of the **Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru**, signed on **May 29, 2008**. The following provisions are designated as having the **force of law in Canada**:

- **Articles 301 to 305**: These articles establish the general principles and definitions related to origin, including the concept of "originating goods," the treatment of goods produced in a member country, and the conditions under which a product may be considered to have "originated" for the purposes of preferential tariff treatment.

- **Article 306, paragraphs 1 and 2**: This article outlines the **rules of origin for manufactured goods**, including the requirement that at least a certain percentage of the value of a product must be derived from the territory of the other party (Canada or Peru) to qualify as originating. It also specifies the **"value-added" rule** and **"substantial transformation"** criteria.

- **Articles 307 to 315**: These articles detail the **specific rules of origin for various product categories**, such as textiles, machinery, vehicles, and processed agricultural goods. They provide country-specific thresholds (e.g., value content, percentage of components sourced from the other country) and define how products are classified under the agreement.

- **Article 318**: This article addresses **rules for goods produced in a third country** (i.e., goods that are not directly produced in Canada or Peru). It establishes conditions under which such goods may still qualify as originating if they meet certain criteria (such as being produced under a "processing" or "manufacturing" operation in a member country and meeting value thresholds).

- **Annex 301**: This annex contains **detailed product-specific rules of origin**, including product codes, tariff classifications, and specific value thresholds. It provides a comprehensive, itemized list of goods that are eligible for preferential treatment under the agreement, with clear rules on how to determine origin for each category.

These provisions are not merely advisory—they are **legally binding in Canada** and form the basis for determining whether a good qualifies as "originating" under the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement.

**3. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the **date on which Section 36 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 16 of the Statutes of Canada, 2009) becomes effective. This section of the Implementation Act establishes the formal mechanisms for applying and enforcing the CPFTA, including the rules of origin.

The regulations were **officially in force on August 1, 2009**, as noted in the reference to **SI/2009-67** (Statutory Instrument 2009-67), which confirms the publication and commencement of the rules in the Canada Gazette.

**4. Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these Rules of Origin Regulations is to:

- Provide a **clear, consistent, and legally enforceable framework** for determining whether a product qualifies as originating under the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement.
- Enable Canadian importers, exporters, and customs officials to **accurately classify goods** and claim preferential tariff treatment (such as reduced or zero tariffs) when trading with Peru.
- Ensure **fair and transparent trade practices** by preventing the use of non-originating goods to circumvent tariff obligations.
- Support **economic integration** between Canada and Peru by encouraging investment and trade in goods that are produced in either country.

**5. Key Implications**

- **Origin Determination**: Importers must demonstrate that a product meets the origin criteria set out in the rules (e.g., value content, processing requirements) to qualify for preferential treatment.
- **Customs Compliance**: The rules are used by Canadian customs authorities to assess whether goods are eligible for reduced tariffs under the agreement.
- **Compliance and Audits**: Businesses involved in cross-border trade must maintain documentation to prove compliance with the rules of origin, which may be subject to audit by customs.
- **Product-Specific Rules**: The detailed rules in Annex 301 mean that different product categories have different thresholds—some require a high percentage of value from Canada or Peru, while others may have more flexible criteria.

**Conclusion**

The *CPFTA Rules of Origin Regulations* are a critical component of Canada’s implementation of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement. By legally incorporating key articles and annexes of the agreement into Canadian law, these regulations ensure that trade between Canada and Peru is conducted on a fair, transparent, and rules-based foundation. They provide a clear pathway for businesses to benefit from reduced tariffs on qualifying goods, while safeguarding the integrity of the trade agreement through strict origin requirements.

These regulations, effective from August 1, 2009, remain in force and are regularly reviewed in the context of evolving trade practices and international trade dynamics.
