### 4. **Eligibility and Rights for Cross-Border Residents**
Any person (including nationals of either country) who has been or is subject to the legislation of either country is eligible for benefits from the other country **under the same conditions as nationals of that country**.

#### Key Principles:
- Benefits are **not reduced, suspended, canceled, or confiscated** simply because the person resides in the other country.
- Benefits are **paid in the territory of the other country** (e.g., a Canadian resident working in Mexico receives a CPP pension in Mexico).
- If a person resides in a **third country**, benefits are paid under the same conditions as if they were a national of that third country.

> ✅ This ensures **non-discrimination** and **equal treatment** for cross-border residents.

### 5. **Work and Employment Rules**

| A person working for their own account in the territory of the other Party | Subject **solely** to the legislation of the Party where they **reside** |

### 6. **Creditable Periods and Benefit Calculations**
This section details how **creditable periods** are counted and combined across countries to determine eligibility and benefit amounts.

#### A. **Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Creditable Periods**
- If a person is covered by the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a **provincial comprehensive pension plan** during residence in Mexico:
  - That period is **counted as residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (if not subject to Mexican employment).
- If a person is covered by Mexican legislation during residence in Canada:
  - That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada **unless** the person is covered by CPP or provincial plan.

#### B. **Creditable Periods in Mexico Counted as Canadian Periods**
- A **calendar year** of creditable periods in Mexico (with at least 13 weeks) counts as a **year of creditable service** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**.

#### C. **Creditable Weeks in Canada Counted in Mexico**
- A **week** of creditable service under the **Old Age Security Act (OASA)** that is not part of a CPP period counts as a **week of creditable service** under Mexican law.
- A **calendar year** of CPP creditable periods counts as **52 weeks** of creditable service under Mexican law for old age or retirement benefits.
- For **invalidity or death benefits**, a CPP year counts as **52 weeks** of creditable service in Mexico.

#### D. **Totalization of Creditable Periods**
- If a person does **not meet minimum requirements** under either country’s legislation, their total creditable periods (from both countries and any third country with reciprocal agreements) are **added together** to determine eligibility.
- This applies under **Chapter 1** of the Agreement (totalization rules).

> ⚠️ **Exception**: If total creditable periods under a Party are **less than one year**, and no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, the competent institution **does not have to award** a benefit under this Agreement.

### 7. **Pension and Allowance Calculations**
If a person is entitled to a pension **only through totalization**, the amount is calculated as follows:

#### For Old Age Security (OAS) Pension:
- **Earnings-related portion**: Based solely on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
- **Flat-rate portion**:
  - Multiply the flat-rate amount from CPP by:
    - The **ratio of actual CPP contributions** to the **minimum qualifying period** required under CPP.
    - This ratio **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., no more than 100% of the flat-rate benefit).

#### For Spouse’s Allowance or Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS):
- Paid **only to the extent permitted** by the OASA.
- Not available beyond the limits set by Canadian law.

> 🚫 **Important**: A person outside Canada can only receive an OAS pension if their **totalized periods of residence** meet or exceed the **minimum residency requirement** in Canada.
