**Detailed Summary of the *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations* (CPLR)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations* (CPLR) are a set of rules under the *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act* (CPLA) that govern how prepackaged products must be labeled in Canada. The primary objective is to ensure **consumer transparency**, **accuracy**, and **accessibility** of product information through standardized labeling practices. These regulations apply to most prepackaged goods sold to consumers, with specific exemptions for certain categories.

---

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

### 1. **Act**
- Refers to the *Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act*, which provides the legal foundation for these regulations.

### 2. **Canadian Unit**
- A unit of measurement defined in **Schedule II** of the *Weights and Measures Act*. Examples include:
  - Litre (for volume)
  - Kilogram (for weight)
  - Gram, millilitre, etc.
- These units are preferred for labeling due to their standardization and public familiarity.

### 3. **Metric Unit**
- Units defined in **Schedule I** of the *Weights and Measures Act* (e.g., grams, millilitres, metres).
- Used when applicable, especially in international trade or where metric is standard.

### 4. **Declaration of Net Quantity**
- The mandatory statement on a label indicating the **actual net quantity** of the product (excluding packaging).
- Must include:
  - The numerical quantity
  - The unit of measurement (metric or Canadian)
  - The unit must be clearly visible and displayed in bold, at a minimum height based on container size.

### 5. **Ornamental Container**
- A container designed primarily as a **decorative item**, not for functional storage.
- Must meet the following criteria:
  - No promotional or advertising material on its surface (except trademark or common name).
  - Designed to look like a decorative ornament.
  - Sold both as a container and as a standalone decorative item.
- **Labeling Exception**: All labeling may be applied to the **bottom** of the container or to a **tag attached** to it.

### 6. **Principal Display Surface (PDS)**
- The **most visible surface** of a container under normal or customary conditions of sale or use.
- Determined by the container type:
  - **Side or surface** visible → total area of that side (excluding top, if any)
  - **Lid** visible → top surface of the lid
  - **No clear side visible** → 40% of total surface area (excluding top/bottom), if visible
  - **Bag with equal sides** → one side
  - **Bag with unequal sides** → largest side
  - **Narrow wrapper/band** → area of a ticket or tag attached
  - **Wine container** → any surface visible without turning the bottle

> *Note: The PDS is critical because it is where the **declaration of net quantity** and **product identity** must be prominently displayed.*

### 7. **Principal Display Panel (PDP)**
- The portion of the label applied to the **principal display surface**.
- Specific rules apply depending on container type:
  - **Mounted on display card**: Label can be on the container or the card, as long as it is visible under normal sale conditions.
  - **Ornamental container**: Label can be on the **bottom** or on a **tag**.
  - **All other containers**: Label must be on the PDS.

## **Exemptions from Labeling Requirements**

Certain prepackaged products are **exempt** from full compliance with labeling requirements under the Act and these Regulations. These exemptions are based on product type, use, or market conditions.

| Exemption Category | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|
| **Commercial/Industrial Use** | Products made for internal use by businesses (e.g., for manufacturing or operations), not sold to consumers. |
| **Export or Duty-Free Sales** | Products destined solely for export or sold in duty-free stores. |
| **Consumer Textile Articles** | Subject to the *Textile Labelling Act* (e.g., clothing, fabrics). |
| **Vehicle/Equipment Replacement Parts** | Exempt unless intended or displayed for sale to consumers. |
| **Art Supplies** | Includes paints, dyes, glazes, ceramics, tools — exempt if used by artists. |
| **Products Covered by Other Acts** | Products regulated under the *Feeds Act*, *Fertilizers Act*, *Seeds Act*, or *Pest Control Products Act* — exempt from sections 4, 5, 6, and 10 of the CPLA. |

## **Language Requirements (Official Languages)**

Canada's official languages are **English and French**. All labeling information must be in **both official languages**, **except** for:

### 1. **Identity and Principal Place of Business**
- May be shown in **only one** official language.

### 2. **Exemptions Based on Local Language Use**
- **Local Product**:
  - A product manufactured and sold within a local government unit (e.g., city, town).
  - May be labeled in **only the language** that is the **mother tongue of at least 10% of residents** in that area.
  - Applies only if **neither language** is the mother tongue of ≥10% of residents.
- **Test Market Product**:
  - A product not previously sold in Canada, with significant differences in composition, function, or packaging.
  - Must be pre-approved by the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs with a **notice of intention** filed **6 weeks before test marketing begins**.
  - Labeling may be in one language if that language is the mother tongue of ≥10% of residents.
  - **Ceases to be a test market product after 12 months** of initial sale — unless acquired by another dealer before that time.

### 3. **Specialty Product**
- An imported product:
  - Not widely used by Canadians.
  - No readily available comparable Canadian-made substitute.
- May be labeled in **one official language** only.

### 4. **Special Cases Where Language May Be Reduced**
- If **other surfaces** on the label are **equal in size and prominence** to the PDP, information required on the PDP may be shown in **one language**, provided it is also shown on another surface.
- **Appropriate Language Exceptions**:
  - Greeting cards
  - Books
  - Talking toys
  - Games requiring knowledge of a specific language to play
  - Labeling may be in the **language appropriate to the product**.

## **Labeling Requirements on the Principal Display Panel**

The **PDP** must display the following information:

1. **Net Quantity**  
   - Must be clearly visible and in **bold type**.
   - Minimum font height depends on the size of the PDS:
     | PDS Area | Minimum Font Height |
     |---------|---------------------|
     | ≤5 sq in (32 cm²) | 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) |
     | >5 to ≤40 sq in (258 cm²) | 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) |
     | >40 to ≤100 sq in (645 cm²) | 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) |
     | >100 to ≤400 sq in (25.8 dm²) | 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) |
     | >400 sq in (25.8 dm²) | 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) |

2. **Product Identity**
   - Must indicate the **common or generic name** or **function** of the product (e.g., "milk", "soda", "detergent").

3. **Other Required Information**
   - As specified in the Act or Regulations (e.g., manufacturer, ingredients, expiry date, allergens).

> **Note**: If the PDS is **≤1.55 sq in (10 cm²)**, and all required information is on the PDP, the non-net quantity information may be in **1/32 inch (0.8 mm)** font — a reduced standard due to space constraints.

## **Label Application Rules**

- The label must be **applied to the container** where the product is displayed for sale.
- **Mounting on a display card**:
  - Label may be applied to either the container or the card.
  - The **height of the net quantity** must be proportional to the **total visible area of the display card**, not the container.
- **Wrapper or narrow band** (e.g., for small items):
  - Label must be a **ticket or tag** attached to the wrapper.
- **Ornamental containers**:
  - Label may be on the **bottom** or on a **tag**.
- Label must be applied so that the product **bears the label at the time of sale**.

---

## **Units of Measurement**

- **Net quantity** must be shown in **either metric or Canadian units**.
- When both are used:
  - They must be **grouped together** (e.g., "500 mL (17 oz)")
  - Exceptions: Any **hazard symbols** required under the *Hazardous Products Act* may be placed **between or adjacent** to the units.

---

## **Net Quantity by Product Type**

The **declaration of net quantity** must be shown in terms of:
- **Volume** (e
