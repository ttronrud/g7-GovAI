## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Benzene in Gasoline Regulations**

### 🔍 **Legal Basis and Adoption**
The regulations were enacted under the authority of the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999** (R.S.C., c. 16 (4th Supp.)):

- **Section 34b and 87** of CEPA authorize the Governor in Council to make regulations to control substances that pose a risk to the environment or human health.
- The regulations were proposed on **May 3, 1997**, and published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, giving stakeholders a chance to file **notices of objection** under subsection 48(2) of CEPA.
- After review, the Governor in Council concluded that the proposed regulations **did not overlap with any other federal or provincial legislation** (subsection 34(3)).
- The final regulations were approved by the **Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, following consultation with a **federal-provincial advisory committee** under section 6 of CEPA.

> ✅ This ensures regulatory legitimacy, public participation, and intergovernmental coordination.

## 📖 Key Definitions

The regulations define key terms used throughout to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*. |
| **Additive** | A substance added to gasoline that improves performance (e.g., corrosion inhibitors, oxidation inhibitors), without materially altering composition. *(Note: "additives" was repealed in SOR/99-204)* |
| **Aromatics** | Benzene and other cyclic hydrocarbons containing benzene rings, measured per method in subsection 5(2). |
| **Auditor** | Certified professional (ISO 14000/9000 or equivalent) to assess quality assurance systems. |
| **Authorized Official** | Officer or representative authorized to act on behalf of a corporation, individual, or entity. |
| **Batch** | A distinct quantity of gasoline with consistent model parameters, sampled and measured per section 5 or 6. |
| **Benzene Emissions Number (BEN)** | A calculated index (per Schedule 1) indicating benzene-related emissions from gasoline. |
| **Blend** | Mixing gasoline components (including oxygenates), **excluding** mixing only compliant gasolines, U.S. reformulated gasolines, or California gasolines. |
| **Blender** | Person who owns, operates, controls, or manages a blending facility. |
| **Blending Facility** | Any physical or mobile location (e.g., cargo tanker, rail car) where blending occurs. |
| **California Gasoline** | Gasoline meeting California’s reformulated standards and formally identified under subsection 9(1). *(California Phase 2 gasoline was repealed in 2003)* |
| **Cargo Tanker** | A vehicle with a bulk liquid tank (e.g., truck or trailer). |
| **Commercially Pure Butane** | Butane with strict limits: benzene ≤0.03%, aromatics ≤2.0%, sulfur ≤140 mg/kg until Dec 2004, then ≤40 mg/kg. |
| **Commercially Pure Oxygenate** | Oxygen-containing additive with benzene ≤0.25%, aromatics ≤2.5%, sulfur ≤170 mg/kg until Dec 2004, then ≤40 mg/kg. |
| **Competition Vehicle** | Vehicle used exclusively for racing or competition. |
| **Complying Gasoline** | Gasoline meeting benzene and BEN limits and formally designated under subsection 9(1) or (2), or as "northern winter complying gasoline". |
| **Gasoline** | A fuel sold or used in spark-ignition engines, meeting specific physical and chemical properties (vapour pressure, antiknock index, distillation range). |
| **Gasoline-Like Blendstock** | Unfinished gasoline intended for further refining/blending into compliant gasoline. |
| **Grade** | Classification based on minimum antiknock index. |
| **Highway** | Public road or pathway used by general traffic. |
| **Import** | Importing gasoline into Canada (excluding fuel in a conveyance for engine use). |
| **Manufacturer** | Person who owns, operates, or controls a refinery. |
| **Model Parameters** | Seven measurable properties of gasoline: oxygen (% by weight), sulfur (mg/kg), vapour pressure at 37.8°C, evaporative fractions at 93.3°C and 148.9°C, aromatics and benzene concentrations (% by volume). |
| **Northern Supply Area** | Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and parts of Quebec and Newfoundland & Labrador north of 51°N and 49°N respectively. |
| **Olefins** | Unsaturated hydrocarbons with double bonds, measured per subsection 5(3). |
| **Oxygenate** | Oxygen-containing, ashless compound added to increase oxygen content in gasoline. |
| **Primary Supplier** | For domestic gasoline: owner/operator of refinery or blending facility; for imported gasoline: the importer. |
| **Quality Control Program** | Lab testing, statistical analysis, and inter-laboratory comparisons to verify sample accuracy. |
| **Refinery** | Facility that separates and processes crude oil into liquid fuels, including associated processing and packaging. |
| **Scientific Research** | Excludes consumer preference or marketing studies. |
| **Statistical Quality Assurance Program** | Testing and statistical methods to verify compliance with benzene and BEN limits. |
| **Summer** | April 15 to September 15. |
| **Winter** | September 16 to April 14. |
| **Year** | Calendar year, except 1999 (July 1 – December 31). |
| **Yearly Pool Average** | Volume-weighted average of benzene concentration or BEN across all gasoline supplied by a primary supplier in a year. |

> 🔁 All incorporated standards (e.g., ASTM, CAN/CGSB) are **automatically updated** as amended.

## 🚫 **Exclusions from Regulation Scope**

The regulations **do not apply** to the following:

| Exclusion | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Aircraft fuel** | Gasoline used in aircraft is excluded. |
| **Competition vehicles** | If gasoline has an antiknock index of **at least 100**. |
| **Scientific research** | Research into consumer preferences or marketing is excluded. |
| **Gasoline in transit** | From outside Canada to outside Canada, with written proof of transit. |
| **Gasoline for export** | If accompanied by evidence of export. |
| **U.S. Reformulated Gasoline & California Gasoline** | Exempt under subsections 3(1), 4, 16, and 17. |
| **Gasoline-like blendstock** | Exempt under sections 9–13 and subsections 18(4), 19(3). |
| **Northern winter gasoline (stored for emergencies)** | If supplied before July 1, 1999 and stored before July 1, 2000. |

> ⚠️ These exclusions ensure practicality, avoid overreach, and protect legitimate industrial and research activities.

## 📏 **Key Compliance Limits**

### 1. **Benzene Concentration Limits**

| Scenario | Limit | Effective Date |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **All gasoline** | ≤1.0% by volume | July 1, 1999 (subject to section 15) |
| **Northern Supply Area** | ≤1.5% by volume | July 1, 2000 |
| **Areas with temporary alternative limits** | ≤1.5% by volume | April 1, 2000 (based on Minister’s authorization under paragraph 16(3)(b)) |
| **All other areas** | ≤1.5% by volume | October 1, 1999 |

> 📌 Note: The limit is stricter in the north, reflecting higher sensitivity due to cold climate and potential health risks.

---

### 2. **Benzene Emissions Number (BEN) Limits**

| Season | Maximum BEN | Effective Date |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Summer batches** | ≤71 | July 1, 1999 |
| **Winter batches** | ≤92 | July 1, 1999 |

> ⚠️ BEN is a more comprehensive metric than benzene concentration alone, reflecting actual emissions from engine combustion. This is critical for reducing air pollution and health risks.

> 🔍 A batch supplied in summer but intended for winter use in the northern supply area is considered a **winter batch** if labeled as **northern winter complying gasoline** under subsection 9(1).

## 🔬 **Testing and Sampling Requirements**

All testing and sampling must follow **standardized, internationally recognized methods**:

| Parameter | Standard Method |
