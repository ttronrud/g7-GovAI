**Detailed Summary of the Infant Feeding Bottle Nipple Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The *Infant Feeding Bottle Nipple Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. This action is authorized under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, which empowers the government to establish regulations to ensure the safety of consumer products, particularly those that pose potential risks to vulnerable populations such as infants.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to protect infants from exposure to harmful chemical substances present in infant feeding bottle nipples. Specifically, the regulations focus on controlling the levels of **N-nitrosamines**, a class of potentially carcinogenic compounds that can form in certain plastics or through chemical degradation.

**3. Definition of "Infant Feeding Bottle Nipple"**  
The term *"infant feeding bottle nipple"* is broadly defined in the regulations to include any product that is designed to be placed in an infant’s mouth during feeding. This definition ensures that the regulation applies not only to traditional bottle nipples but also to similar products, such as those used in breast milk feeders, pacifiers, or other infant feeding devices that are inserted into the mouth of an infant.

**4. Key Safety Standard**  
The regulation establishes a strict **maximum allowable limit** for total volatile N-nitrosamines in infant feeding bottle nipples:  
- **No more than 10 µg/kg** (micrograms per kilogram of product weight).  
This limit is based on scientific assessment of the potential health risks associated with N-nitrosamines, which are known to be carcinogenic in animal studies and may pose a risk to developing infants due to their sensitive physiology.

**5. Testing Methodology**  
To determine compliance with the limit, the presence of total volatile N-nitrosamines is measured using a **dichloromethane extraction method**. This standardized analytical procedure involves:  
- Extracting volatile N-nitrosamines from the nipple material using dichloromethane, a common organic solvent.  
- Quantifying the extracted compounds through analytical techniques (such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry).  
This method ensures consistency and reliability in testing across manufacturers and laboratories.

**6. Repeal Clause**  
The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that these specific regulations are being issued to replace or supersede any prior regulations on the same subject. This reflects an update or refinement in safety standards based on new scientific evidence or evolving risk assessments.

**7. Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This immediate enforcement ensures that manufacturers, importers, and distributors of infant feeding bottle nipples are required to comply with the new safety standard without delay.

**Key Implications and Significance**  
- **Consumer Protection**: The regulation safeguards infants from exposure to potentially harmful chemicals, especially during early development when the body is more vulnerable to carcinogens.  
- **Industry Compliance**: Manufacturers must ensure that all infant feeding bottle nipples meet the 10 µg/kg N-nitrosamine limit and implement appropriate quality control and testing procedures.  
- **Regulatory Clarity**: By defining the scope and setting a measurable standard, the regulation provides clear guidance to industry stakeholders and regulatory enforcement bodies.  
- **Alignment with Global Standards**: While not explicitly stated, the regulation aligns with international efforts to limit the presence of toxic substances in consumer products used by infants.

**Conclusion**  
The *Infant Feeding Bottle Nipple Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21) represent a targeted, science-based intervention to reduce infant exposure to carcinogenic N-nitrosamines in commonly used feeding devices. By establishing a clear, enforceable limit and a standardized testing method, the regulations enhance product safety and reflect Canada’s commitment to protecting public health, particularly among vulnerable populations.
