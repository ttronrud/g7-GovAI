**Detailed Summary of the Bagotville Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The **Bagotville Airport Zoning Regulations** were enacted under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Subsection 5.5(1)**: Requires that proposed regulations affecting an airport be published in two successive issues of a local newspaper and in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette, Part I* to ensure public notice.
- **Paragraph 5.4(2)(b)**: Authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence) to adopt zoning regulations to protect airport safety.

The proposed regulations were:
- Published in **two successive issues of a local newspaper** (May 27 and 28, 1992),
- Published in **two successive issues of Canada Gazette Part I** (April 11 and 18, 1992).

This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, municipalities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations to the Minister of National Defence.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to **prevent land adjacent to or near Bagotville Airport from being developed or used in ways that could compromise the safe operation of aircraft**. This includes:

- Avoiding obstructions that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach.
- Minimizing hazards such as bird populations or environmental features that could endanger aviation.

---

### **3. Legal Title and Scope**

- **Title**: *Bagotville Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1  
- **Applicability**: Applies to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Bagotville Airport**, including public road allowances, **except lands that are part of the airport itself**.

### **4. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Bagotville Airport located in the Municipality of Laterrière and the Town of La Baie, Quebec. |
| **Airport Zoning Reference Point** | A fixed point on the centerline of runway 11–29 at the threshold of runway 29. It serves as the baseline elevation for all other surfaces. |
| **Elevation of Reference Point** | **156 meters above sea level**. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport’s landing zone, including runways, designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Each strip has defined width and length. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a strip (runway) to prevent obstructions during aircraft approach. Defined by specific slopes and elevation thresholds. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the sides of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward and outward to meet the outer surface. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the airport zoning reference point (i.e., 156 + 45 = 201 meters above sea level)**, except where it would fall below **9 meters above ground level** — in which case it is set at 9 meters above ground. |

### **5. Key Provisions and Restrictions**

#### **A. Prohibition on Structures and Natural Growth**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land **if the highest point of the object exceeds**:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

This applies to **all structures**, including new constructions and expansions of existing ones.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) is also restricted. Owners or lessees **must not allow natural growth to exceed** the elevation limits of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.

#### **B. Restrictions on Hazardous Land Uses**
To minimize **bird hazards** to aviation, the following land uses are prohibited:
- Sanitary landfills  
- Food garbage disposal sites  
- Sewage lagoons  
- Open water storage reservoirs  

These are considered high-risk for attracting birds, which can pose a direct threat to aircraft during flight.

### **6. Description of Airport Features (Runways and Surfaces)**

#### **Runway Strips**
Two main strips are defined:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **11–29** | 300 meters (150 m on each side of centerline) | 3,286.863 meters |
| **18–36** | 300 meters (150 m on each side) | 1,956.965 meters |

These are based on the **Department of Public Works Bagotville Airport Zoning Plan No. MM-88-6775**, dated January 4, 1988.

---

#### **Approach Surfaces**

Each approach surface begins at the end of a runway strip and slopes upward to meet the outer surface. The slopes and elevation thresholds vary slightly by runway:

| Runway | Initial Slope (to outer surface) | Final Horizontal Line Elevation (m above ref. point) |
|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Runway 18** | 1:60 (1m up per 60m horizontal), then 1:50 | 291 m |
| **Runway 36** | 1:60, then 1:50 | 294.6 m |
| **Runway 11** | 1:60, then 1:50 | 293.4 m |
| **Runway 31** | 1:60, then 1:50 | 291 m |

- All approach surfaces extend **15,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the runway.
- The final horizontal line is **2,400 meters from the runway centerline** on either side.
- The surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft can approach safely without encountering obstructions.

---

#### **Transitional Surfaces**

- Each transitional surface is an **inclined plane** rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- It extends from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces** up to where it meets the outer surface or the transitional surface of an adjacent strip.
- Ensures smooth transition between the runway area and the outer zones, preventing sudden changes in elevation that could affect aircraft performance.

---

#### **Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the airport zoning reference point** (i.e., 201 meters above sea level).
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is higher than 45 meters above the reference point, the outer surface is **not reduced below 9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface defines the **outer boundary** of the regulated zone.

> The outer surface is described using a **complex polygonal path** based on arcs and straight lines, defined by precise coordinates in the **Quebec Plane Coordinate System (S.CO.P.Q.)**, Zone 7, Central Meridian 70°30′.

---

### **7. Geographical Coordinates and Boundary Description**

The outer limits of the regulated zone are defined by a detailed, coordinate-based path involving:

- **Arcs of circles** (radius 4,000 m and 8,000 m) centered at key runway intersections.
- **Straight lines** with specific azimuths (directions).
- **Distance measurements** between points.

This ensures that the zoning boundary accurately reflects the **geometric requirements** for safe aviation operations, particularly around approach paths and lateral clearances.

#### Example of Outer Surface Path (simplified):
1. Starts at intersection of northerly limit of runway 11’s approach surface and a circle of 4,000 m radius.
2. Follows a northerly arc to a point.
3. Moves via straight lines to points along runways 18, 29, and 36.
4. Returns via arcs and lines to the starting point.

> The full boundary is **closed and symmetrical**, ensuring consistent protection around all runways.

---

### **8. Coordinate System and Measurement System**

- All distances, angles, and coordinates are based on the **Quebec Plane Coordinate System (S.CO.P.Q.)**, Zone 7.
- Central meridian: **70°30′**.
- This system is used to ensure **precision and consistency** in land surveying and boundary definition across Quebec.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations apply to **all landowners and lessees** within the defined zone.
- Any violation (e.g., building exceeding surface elevation or using prohibited land uses) may result in enforcement actions by the Minister of National Defence or relevant authorities.
- Compliance is essential to maintain **aviation safety** and prevent disruptions to airport operations.

---

### **10. Significance and Implications**

- These regulations establish a **formal, legally binding zoning framework** for land use around Bagotville Airport.
- They reflect **modern aviation safety standards**, particularly in managing:
  - Obstruction risks (from structures and vegetation),
  - Environmental hazards (bird populations),
  - Geometric clearances (approach and transition zones).
- The use of **precise mathematical and geographic definitions** ensures that the boundaries are objective, measurable, and enforceable.
