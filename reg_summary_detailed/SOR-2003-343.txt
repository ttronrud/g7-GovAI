The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2014-176, section 44**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2014-176**, specifically **Section 44** of that instrument.
- **Frequency of Mention**: The phrase "[Repealed, SOR/2014-176, s. 44]" appears 48 times, which suggests that the original regulation may have been referenced multiple times in a legislative or regulatory document (e.g., in a list of repealed provisions, a table of amendments, or a compilation of rules), but the content itself is not present.
- **Implication**: Since the regulation is **repealed**, it is no longer in force. Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously established by it have been terminated and are superseded by newer legislation or regulatory provisions.

### What This Means in Practice:
- No current legal authority exists under this repealed regulation.
- Any references to it in older legal documents, compliance frameworks, or administrative procedures must be updated or replaced with current regulations.
- The repeal by SOR/2014-176, s. 44 indicates that the government (likely the Government of Canada, as SOR stands for Statutory Instrument of Canada) determined that the regulation was outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current laws or policies.

### Contextual Notes:
- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of Canada*, which is a method by which federal or provincial governments introduce new laws or amend existing ones without passing a full bill.
- **SOR/2014-176** is a specific statutory instrument issued in 2014, and Section 44 likely contains the formal repeal of one or more previous rules or regulations.
- The repeated listing suggests a compilation or index, not the actual content of the regulation.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** described in the input — instead, the text serves as a **repeal notice**. The regulation in question has been **officially removed from the legal framework** and is **no longer applicable**. For any legal or compliance purposes, this regulation should be disregarded, and relevant authorities should refer to current, active regulations that may have replaced its functions.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The regulation is **repealed** by *SOR/2014-176, section 44*. It is no longer in force and has been formally canceled. The repeated references indicate its presence in a list or index of repealed provisions, but no substantive content of the regulation is provided. Legal or administrative actions based on this regulation are invalid.
