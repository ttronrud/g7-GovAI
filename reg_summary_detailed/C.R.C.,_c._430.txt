**Detailed Summary of the Designated Areas Firearms Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Designated Areas Firearms Order* is a regulatory instrument that establishes specific geographic areas within Canada where **permits to possess firearms or ammunition may be issued to individuals under the age of 14 years** who reside within those areas. This order operates under the broader framework of firearms legislation in Canada, specifically related to the **provision of firearm access to minors**, and is designed to **allow for controlled, localized access** to firearms for young residents in designated remote or rural regions.

It is important to note that this order **does not authorize the possession of firearms for all minors**—only in the specified areas, and only under the supervision and issuance of a **local registrar of firearms**. It does not extend to the general population or to persons aged 14 and over.

### **Key Provisions and Designated Areas**

The Order designates specific geographic regions across several provinces and territories. In each area, a **local registrar of firearms** has the authority to issue permits to persons **under 14 years of age** who reside within that area. These permits are typically intended for **educational, safety, or cultural purposes**, such as participation in youth programs or training, and are not for general firearm ownership.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each designated area:

---

#### **1. Ontario**

- **District of Cochrane**  
  - **Excludes** organized municipalities:  
    - Towns: Cochrane, Hearst, Kapuskasing, Smooth Rock Falls, Timmins  
    - Townships: Black River (Matheson), Calvert, Fauquier, Glackmeyer, Kendrey, Mount Joy, Playfair, Shackleton, Machin, Tisdale, Whitney  
  - **Included**: All remaining parts of the District of Cochrane outside the listed municipalities.

- **District of Thunder Bay**  
  - The portion **north of No. 11 Highway**  
  - **Boundaries**:  
    - East: Cochrane–Thunder Bay District Boundary  
    - West: Kenora–Thunder Bay boundary  

- **District of Kenora and Patricia**  
  - The portion **north of the main Canadian National Railway line**  

> *Note*: This means that only areas in these districts located north of certain lines or highways are eligible for permits to minors.

---

#### **2. Manitoba**

- **Entire Province of Manitoba**  
  - All areas within Manitoba are designated.  
  - Minors residing in any part of Manitoba may apply for a permit to possess a firearm or ammunition under the supervision of a local registrar.

---

#### **3. Alberta**

- A **specific geographic boundary** defined as follows:  
  1. Start at the point where the **Alberta–Saskatchewan boundary** intersects the **north boundary of Township 68**  
  2. Go **west** along the north boundary of Township 68 to its intersection with the **5th meridian**  
  3. Proceed **north** along the 5th meridian to its intersection with the **north boundary of Township 92**  
  4. Go **west** along the north boundary of Township 92 to its intersection with the **Alberta–British Columbia boundary**  
  5. Proceed **north** along the Alberta–British Columbia boundary to the **boundary of the Northwest Territories**  
  6. Go **east** along this boundary until it meets the **Alberta–Saskatchewan border**  
  7. Proceed **south** along the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary back to the **point of origin**

> This creates a **large, northwestern corridor** of Alberta, including areas such as northern Alberta, near the Rockies and the border with BC, and extending into the northern reaches of the province. This area is **not** the entire province—only the defined polygon.

#### **4. Yukon Territory**

- **Entire Territory**  
  - All areas within the Yukon Territory are included.  
  - Minors residing in the Yukon may apply for firearm permits through local registrars.

---

#### **5. Northwest Territories**

- **Entire Territory**  
  - All areas within the Northwest Territories are designated.  
  - Minors residing in any part of the NWT may apply for permits.

---

#### **6. Quebec**

- A **specific northern region** defined by latitude and longitude boundaries:  
  - North of the **50th degree of latitude**  
  - Between the **Quebec–Ontario border** and the **68th degree of longitude**  
  - Proceeds **due north** to the **51st degree of latitude**  
  - Then moves **east** along the 51st parallel to the **60th degree of longitude**  
  - Then follows the **coastline** (or a line approximately 10 miles inland from the coast) to the **Quebec–Newfoundland border**

> This area covers **northern Quebec**, particularly the **Côte-Nord region** and parts of the **Nunavik and northern mainland**, excluding coastal areas too far east or south. The inclusion of a "10-mile inland line" suggests a buffer zone from the coast to ensure safety and community-based access.

---

#### **7. Saskatchewan**

- All areas **north of the 54th parallel of north latitude**  
  - This includes the **northern half** of the province, extending into the **interior and northern regions**  
  - Excludes southern areas below 54°N

> This is a straightforward geographic boundary, allowing minors in northern Saskatchewan to access firearm permits.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **Age Limitation**:  
   - Only individuals **under 14 years of age** are eligible for permits under this Order.  
   - The policy reflects a balance between **youth safety and access** in remote or underserved communities.

2. **Local Registrar Authority**:  
   - Permits must be issued by a **local registrar of firearms**, not a provincial or federal authority.  
   - This ensures **community-based oversight**, particularly in rural or remote areas where access to services may be limited.

3. **Purpose of Permits**:  
   - The permits are not for general ownership. They are typically for **specific, supervised purposes**, such as:  
     - Youth safety education  
     - Cultural or traditional activities (e.g., Indigenous communities)  
     - Participation in youth programs involving firearms (e.g., training, hunting education)  
     - Emergency preparedness or community defense (subject to strict conditions)

4. **Exclusions and Boundaries**:  
   - The Order **excludes** certain urban or organized municipalities (e.g., in Cochrane), recognizing that these areas have different levels of regulation, access, and risk.  
   - Urban centers and densely populated areas are generally **excluded** from this permit framework due to higher safety risks.

5. **Geographic Specificity**:  
   - The Order reflects a **pragmatic, risk-based approach** to firearm access, targeting **remote and rural areas** where youth may have limited access to safety education or recreational programs.

6. **Federal Oversight**:  
   - While the permits are issued locally, they are still subject to **federal firearms legislation** (e.g., the *Firearms Act*), including requirements for background checks, reporting, and compliance with safety standards.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of the *Designated Areas Firearms Order* are:

- To **expand access to firearm safety education** for youth in remote or underserved communities.  
- To **support Indigenous and rural youth programs** that involve firearms in culturally relevant contexts.  
- To **promote community-based safety initiatives** in areas where traditional access to firearms is limited.  
- To **align with national firearm safety policies** while recognizing regional differences in population density, infrastructure, and cultural practices.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Not a general permit**: This Order does **not** allow minors to possess firearms in general.  
- **No automatic access**: A permit must be **applied for and approved** by a local registrar.  
- **Strict conditions apply**: Permits are subject to conditions such as:  
  - Supervision by a parent or guardian  
  - Use only for approved purposes  
  - Regular reporting and review  
- **Not available in all areas**: Urban or high-density areas are excluded due to safety concerns.  
- **May be subject to review or amendment**: The government may revise the areas or conditions based on public safety, youth outcomes, or legislative changes.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Designated Areas Firearms Order* is a **targeted, geographically specific regulation** that allows for the **limited and supervised issuance of firearm permits to minors under 14 years of age** in designated rural, remote, and northern regions of Canada. It reflects a **balanced approach** between promoting youth safety education and cultural access in isolated communities, while maintaining strong controls and oversight to prevent misuse or harm.

This Order is a key component of Canada’s broader strategy to **ensure responsible firearm access**, particularly in areas where traditional access is limited, and where youth engagement in safety and cultural programs is vital.
