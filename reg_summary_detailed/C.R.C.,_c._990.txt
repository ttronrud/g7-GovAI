**Detailed Summary of the *Motor Vehicle Operators Hours of Work Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Motor Vehicle Operators Hours of Work Regulations** and may be cited as such. They form part of the broader framework of labor standards under the *Canada Labour Code (Act)*, specifically modifying provisions related to working hours for certain classes of motor vehicle operators.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the regulations define several key terms:

- **Motor Vehicle Operator**: A person who operates a motor vehicle (any vehicle propelled by non-muscular power, excluding rail-based vehicles).

- **Bus Operator**: A motor vehicle operator who operates a bus.

- **City Motor Vehicle Operator**:  
  - Operates exclusively within a 10-mile radius of their home terminal.  
  - Is not a bus operator.  
  - Includes operators classified as such in a collective agreement or recognized by prevailing industry practice in their region.

- **Highway Motor Vehicle Operator**:  
  - Not a bus operator or city motor vehicle operator.  
  - Typically operates on long-distance routes outside local areas.

- **Motor Vehicle**: Any vehicle operated by an employee, powered by mechanical means (not human power), excluding rail vehicles.

- **Working Hours**:  
  - Defined as all hours from the start of a work shift until the operator is relieved of job responsibilities.  
  - **Exclusions** include:
    - Authorized meal and rest breaks while en route.
    - Time spent due to illness or fatigue.
    - Resting en route when sharing a sleeper berth with another operator.
    - Resting in a motel, hotel, or similar facility with sleeping accommodations.

- **Standard Hours of Work**:  
  - The maximum number of hours per day or week specified for each class of operator under these regulations.

### **3. Scope and Modification of the Canada Labour Code (Act)**

The regulations modify **sections 169 and 171 of the Canada Labour Code** (Loi) to apply **Division I** (which governs working hours) to the following three classes of employees:

- Bus operators  
- City motor vehicle operators  
- Highway motor vehicle operators  

**Conditions of Application**:
- Only applies to operators employed in industrial establishments involved in:
  - Transporting goods or passengers **from within a province to outside that province**, or  
  - Transporting mail **anywhere in Canada**.

This means the standard working hour limits do not apply to local or intraprovincial transport that does not cross provincial boundaries unless it involves interprovincial movement.

### **4. Exemptions and Flexibility in Working Hours**

#### **Exemption from Subsection 169(2) of the Act**
- **City and highway motor vehicle operators** are **exempted from the restriction** in subsection 169(2) of the Act, which normally limits work to 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week. This exemption allows for greater flexibility in scheduling.

> This means these operators can work beyond standard limits **without violating the core provisions of the Labour Code**, provided they fall within the scope of these regulations.

---

### **5. Standard Hours of Work by Operator Class**

#### **(a) City Motor Vehicle Operators**
- **Daily**: May exceed **8 hours** but shall not exceed **9 hours**.
- **Weekly**: May exceed **40 hours** but shall not exceed **45 hours**.
- **Exception during a general holiday week**:
  - If a general holiday (under Division V of the Act) entitles the operator to a holiday with pay:
    - Standard hours may exceed **32 hours** but shall not exceed **36 hours**.
  - **Important Note**: When calculating hours in such a week:
    - **No account is taken** of time worked on the holiday.
    - No account is taken of time when the operator was at the employer’s disposal during the holiday.

> This provides flexibility during holidays while protecting against excessive workloads.

#### **(b) Highway Motor Vehicle Operators**
- **Weekly**: May exceed **40 hours** but shall not exceed **60 hours**.
- **Exception during a general holiday week**:
  - If entitled to a holiday with pay:
    - Hours may exceed **32 hours** but shall not exceed **50 hours**.
  - Again, **no account is taken** of time worked on the holiday or time at the employer’s disposal during the holiday.

> Allows for longer workweeks during interprovincial transport, especially on routes requiring extended coverage.

#### **(c) Exception for Non-Standard Driving (Permit-Based)**
- A highway motor vehicle operator who **does not normally drive on public roads** (e.g., a driver performing special duties or in temporary assignments) may exceed 60 hours per week **if authorized under the *Commercial Vehicles Drivers Hours of Service Regulations***.
- Once such a permit is issued, **the hours specified in the permit become the standard hours of work** for that operator.

> This is a critical exception allowing temporary flexibility for specific operational needs.

### **6. Multiple Class Employment and Combined Workload Rules**

#### **(i) When an Employee Works in Two or More Classes**
If an employee works in **two or more of the following classes** during a day or week:
- City motor vehicle operator  
- Highway motor vehicle operator  
- An employee whose hours are not governed by these regulations and are calculated under the *Canada Labour Standards Regulations*

Then:
- Their **standard hours of work** for that day or week are determined by the class in which they work the **greatest number of hours**.

> This ensures that employees are governed by the most applicable working hour standard based on actual workload.

#### **(ii) Application of Section 174 of the Act (Overtime)**
- **Section 174** of the Act normally applies to overtime (hours beyond standard limits).
- However, **when an employee works in multiple classes**, **section 174 does not apply** to any time worked as a **highway motor vehicle operator**.
- This means **overtime is not triggered** simply because the employee works as a highway operator, even if total hours exceed 60.

> This is a significant exception that protects highway operators from being subject to overtime rules when working across multiple roles.

#### **(iii) Overtime Calculation**
- If the **total working hours** of such an employee exceed **60 hours in any week**, **all hours beyond 60 are counted as overtime**.
- This ensures accountability for excessive work, even if section 174 is otherwise exempted.

#### **(iv) Reduction of Standard and Maximum Hours**
- If an employee works **in two or more classes** over a period of time and works the **greatest number of hours in a week as a city or highway operator**, then:
  - Their **standard and maximum hours of work** (for both classes) are **reduced by 40 hours for each week** in which they work in such a class.
- This is a protective mechanism to prevent overwork and ensure compliance with safe working limits.

> Example: If an employee works 50 hours as a highway operator in one week, and 45 hours as a city operator in another, their weekly limits are reduced by 40 hours for each of those weeks.

#### **(v) Special Rule for Employees Working in City, Highway, and a Third Class**
- If an employee works the **greatest number of hours in a week as an employee described in paragraph (c)** (i.e., one not governed by these regulations under Canada Labour Standards Regulations):
  - Their **standard and maximum hours** are counted **only for the purpose of the Canada Labour Standards Regulations**.
  - **No hours worked as a city or highway operator are counted** in that calculation.

> This ensures that non-regulated employees are not penalized or overburdened by the hours of regulated operators.

---

### **7. Working Hours for Bus Operators**

- For **bus operators**, working hours are calculated from the **start of the shift to its end**.
- **Excluded** are times when the bus is in a garage or parked and the operator is not required to remain with the vehicle.

> This prevents double-counting of idle time and ensures accurate tracking of actual work duties.

---

### **8. Flexibility for Irregular Schedules**

Where the nature of the work in an industrial establishment requires **irregular distribution of hours** (e.g., due to unpredictable demand or shift patterns), the following applies:

- Operators may have **no fixed daily or weekly hours**, or their scheduled hours may vary from time to time.
- In such cases, **working hours may be scheduled and actually worked without regard to section 173 of the Act** (which normally sets fixed daily/weekly limits).

> This allows for operational flexibility in industries like emergency services, delivery, or seasonal transport where schedules are inherently variable.
