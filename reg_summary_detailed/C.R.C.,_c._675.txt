**Detailed Summary of the Assignment of Crown Debt Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Assignment of Crown Debt Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes the procedural and administrative framework governing the assignment of certain Crown debts in Canada under the *Financial Administration Act (Act)*.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation introduces and defines several key terms used throughout:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Financial Administration Act*, which provides the legal basis for the management and assignment of Crown debts.
  
- **"Assignment"**: Defined as the transfer (cession) of a debt specified under subsection 68(1) of the Act. This means a legal transfer of a debt owed by the Crown to another party.

- **"Power of Attorney"**: A written document executed before a witness, signed by a person to whom a Crown debt is owed, authorizing another individual to receive payments due on that debt and to provide a valid receipt or discharge. This is essential when the debtor (the Crown) delegates payment rights to a third party.

---

### **3. Designation of Paying Officers (Under Part VII of the Act)**
Certain individuals or offices are designated as **paying officers** responsible for discharging Crown debts. These include:
- **Divisional Services Officers**
- **District Services Officers**
- **Minister of National Revenue**, specifically with respect to specific classes of Crown debts listed in **Section 13** of the Act.

This ensures accountability and clear lines of responsibility in the payment process.

---

### **4. Form and Requirements for Notices of Assignment**
A notice of assignment must:
- Be in the **form set out in Appendix I**.
- Be completed to the **satisfaction of the Receiver General**.

This form is standardized to ensure consistency, clarity, and legal validity in all assignments.

Additionally, the regulation mandates that:
- If a notice of assignment is submitted **without the original or a duplicate copy** of the assignment or power of attorney, a **notarial certificate** must be attached to a copy of the assignment, certifying that the copy is a true and accurate reproduction of the original.

---

### **5. Required Supporting Documents by Type of Assignor**

#### **A. Assignments Made by Corporations**
If a corporation has assigned a debt, the notice must include:
1. **Corporate Seal Documentation**:
   - If the assignment or power of attorney used a corporate seal:
     - A copy of the **board resolution or by-law** authorizing the president and secretary (or president and secretary-treasurer) to witness the affixing of the seal.
     - A copy of the resolution or by-law **certified by the secretary or secretary-treasurer**.
     - Certification that the resolution/by-law was **in effect on the date of the assignment**.

2. **Without Corporate Seal**:
   - A copy of the **board resolution or by-law** authorizing the individual(s) who signed on behalf of the corporation.
   - Certified by the **secretary or secretary-treasurer**.
   - Certified to be a true copy and to have been in effect on the assignment date.

3. **If Signed by a Trustee or Liquidator**:
   - A **certified or notarial copy** of the **court order** appointing the trustee or liquidator.

> These requirements ensure that corporate actions are legally valid, authorized, and traceable to proper corporate governance.

#### **B. Assignments Made by Partnerships**
For partnerships:
- An **affidavit of execution** must be submitted, completed by the person who witnessed the partner(s)' signature.
- If the assignment was made in **Quebec** and signed by **fewer than all partners**:
  - Additional documentation must establish that the signing partners had **authority under partnership law** to act on behalf of the partnership.

> This safeguards against unauthorized or invalid actions by individual partners.

#### **C. Assignments Made by Individuals (Non-Corporate, Non-Partnership)**
- A **simple affidavit of execution** must be provided, completed by the person who witnessed the signing.

#### **D. Assignments Made Outside Canada**
- A **written opinion** from legal counsel of a Canadian diplomatic, consular, or trade representative in the country where the assignment was made is required.
- The opinion must confirm:
  - That the assignment or power of attorney is **valid under local law**.
  - In the case of an assignment, whether it is **binding on the assignor** (i.e., the Crown) under the laws of the jurisdiction.

> This ensures that foreign assignments meet Canadian legal standards and are enforceable.
