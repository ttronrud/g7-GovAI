## 🔍 **OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATION**

This document is a **formal Canadian Proclamation** that officially brings into force the **Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay**, signed on June 2, 1999. The agreement establishes a framework for mutual recognition of social security rights, particularly for pensions and related benefits, between the two countries. It ensures that individuals who work or reside in either country can accumulate creditable periods of contributions that count toward eligibility for retirement, disability, or survivor benefits in both jurisdictions — without facing reductions, suspensions, or loss of benefits due to cross-border residency.

The agreement is grounded in international social security cooperation principles and is aligned with the **Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations**, which remain applicable even under this agreement.

### 7. **Creditable Periods and Totalization (Article 8)**

This section governs how periods of contribution or residence in one country are counted toward eligibility in the other.

#### a) **Residence and Contribution Periods in Uruguay**
- If a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial comprehensive pension plan during a period of residence in Uruguay:
  - That period is counted as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependents **not employed in Uruguay**.

- If a person is subject to **Uruguayan legislation** during a period of residence in Canada:
  - That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada for the person or their dependents **unless they are employed in Canada**.

> ⚖️ *Only employment or self-employment leads to creditable periods.*

#### b) **Eligibility Determination (Totalization Rules)**
- If a person does **not meet the required creditable periods** under one country’s legislation:
  - The competent organization may **totalize** creditable periods from **both countries**, provided the periods do not overlap.
- If totalization still fails to meet eligibility:
  - The person may be assessed against **third-party agreements** where both countries have social security arrangements allowing totalization.

> 📌 *This ensures that OAS is not available without sufficient residency, but allows for cross-border credit.*

#### b) **Calculation of OAS Pension**
- If a person is eligible **only through totalization**, the amount is calculated:
  - Based **only on periods of residence in Canada**.
  - Using rules for **partial pensions** or spouse allowances under OASA.

> 📉 *No benefit is paid if total creditable periods under one country are less than one year and no right exists under that country’s law — but such periods may still count toward eligibility in the other country.*
