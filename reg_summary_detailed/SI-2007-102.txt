The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular provision has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2011-93, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**:  
  The regulation is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable. It has been formally removed from the legal framework by a subsequent legislative instrument.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  The repeal is enacted under **Statutory Instrument 2011-93, Section 5**.  
  Statutory Instruments (SIs) are a form of secondary legislation used in Canada and some other jurisdictions to implement or amend primary legislation. In this case, SI 2011-93 was issued to amend or repeal certain provisions of an existing law.

- **Nature of the Repeal**:  
  The repeated reference to "[Repealed, SI/2011-93, s. 5]" suggests that multiple provisions (or sections) were repealed by the same instrument. While the original content of the repealed regulation is not provided, the summary confirms that:
  - The regulation was previously in force.
  - It was formally canceled or abolished by SI 2011-93, section 5.
  - No further legal effect exists for the repealed provision.

- **Legal Implications**:  
  Any reference to this regulation in legal documents, policy, or administrative procedures is now outdated and should be disregarded. Legal or regulatory actions based on this provision would be invalid or unenforceable.

- **Jurisdictional Context**:  
  The use of "SI" (Statutory Instrument) suggests this is from a jurisdiction that uses SIs for delegated legislation—common in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, or other Commonwealth nations. The specific jurisdiction is not stated, but the format aligns with Canadian or UK-style regulatory frameworks.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in your query **does not currently exist** in force. It was **officially repealed** by **Statutory Instrument 2011-93, section 5**. Therefore, it has no legal standing, and any prior reliance on it is no longer valid. To understand the current legal framework, one would need to refer to the provisions that replaced it (if any) or to the current version of the parent statute.
