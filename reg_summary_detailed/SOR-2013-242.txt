**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Winter Cereals Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Basis**
The Saskatchewan Winter Cereals Order is issued under the authority of **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6), and is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**. This means the Order is a regulatory instrument enacted at the provincial level to govern the marketing of winter cereals in Saskatchewan.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **regulate the marketing of winter cereals** in two key markets:
- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada)

It enables the provincial regulatory bodies to manage and stabilize the market for winter cereals—specifically those grown in Saskatchewan—by establishing a framework for levies, charges, and financial mechanisms to support producers and ensure fair market outcomes.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
The Order establishes clear definitions to ensure consistency and clarity in its application:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act, 2004* (S.S. 2004, c. A-15.21), which provides the legal foundation and framework for the operation of the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board.
  
- **Commodity Board**: The *Saskatchewan Winter Cereals Development Commission*, established under the Agri-Food Act. This body is responsible for managing the marketing and financial aspects of winter cereals production and trade.

- **Supervisory Board**: The *Agri-Food Council*, which continues in its role as a supervisory body under the Act. It oversees compliance, policy, and ensures the integrity of the regulatory process.

- **Winter Cereals**: Specifically defined as:
  - Winter wheat (*Triticum aestivum* L.)
  - Fall rye (*Secale cereale* L.)
  - Winter triticale (*X Triticosecale Wittmack*)

  These crops must be **produced in Saskatchewan** to be eligible under this Order.

### **4. Regulatory Powers Granted**
The Commodity Board and the Supervisory Board are granted **broad powers** to regulate the marketing of winter cereals in interprovincial and export markets, with the same authority they have over **local marketing within Saskatchewan** under the Act.

These powers include:

#### **(a) Levies and Charges**
- The Boards are authorized to:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals and entities engaged in:
    - The **production** of winter cereals
    - The **marketing** of winter cereals
  - These levies can be applied to different groups of producers or marketers based on their size, type of operation, or other relevant factors.

- The Boards may **classify persons** into distinct groups (e.g., small farms, large co-ops, exporters), and set **different levies or charges** for each group.

#### **(b) Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (to provide financial stability during market downturns)
- **Payment of expenses and losses** arising from the sale or disposal of winter cereals (e.g., due to poor market conditions or price drops)
- **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among winter cereal producers

This financial mechanism ensures that producers who may have experienced lower returns due to market fluctuations can receive compensation or financial support from the collective pool generated by levies. This helps **mitigate risk and promote equity** among producers.

---

### **5. Scope and Application**
- The powers granted apply to **persons and property situated within Saskatchewan**.
- The regulations apply specifically to **winter cereals grown in the province**.
- The Boards operate with the same level of authority in interprovincial and export markets as they do in domestic (local) markets.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Saskatchewan Gazette). This ensures immediate legal effect upon formal adoption.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**
This Order plays a critical role in:
- **Stabilizing the winter cereal market** in Saskatchewan by providing a structured financial mechanism.
- **Supporting producers** through risk-sharing and loss compensation.
- **Ensuring fair and equitable market access** for producers, especially in volatile international or interprovincial markets.
- **Maintaining provincial control** over key agricultural commodities, aligning with broader goals of agricultural sustainability and economic resilience.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Saskatchewan Winter Cereals Order* is a targeted regulatory tool designed to manage the marketing of winter cereals in both domestic and international markets. By empowering the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board to impose and use levies, it creates a financial safety net for producers and enhances market stability. The Order reflects a balanced approach—combining market regulation with producer support—within the framework of the *Agri-Food Act, 2004*, ensuring long-term sustainability in Saskatchewan’s agricultural sector.
