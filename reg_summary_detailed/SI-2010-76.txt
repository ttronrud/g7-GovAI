The regulation you provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically referencing the process by which Canada officially recognizes and acknowledges scientific assessments of species at risk. Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order Acknowledging Receipt of Assessments under Section 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act

**Governing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(1)** of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which empowers the Minister of the Environment to acknowledge the receipt of scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** regarding species at risk.

**Key Provisions and Purpose:**

1. **Recognition of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   This Order formally acknowledges that the assessments conducted by COSEWIC — a scientific body established to assess the status of wildlife species in Canada — have been received and are now recognized as official inputs for the management and protection of species under SARA.

2. **Species Covered:**  
   The Order specifically refers to the species listed in the **annexed schedule** (not included in this excerpt). These are species that COSEWIC has evaluated and designated as at risk (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern, etc.) based on scientific criteria.

3. **Legal and Administrative Significance:**  
   - The acknowledgment serves as a formal step in the SARA process, confirming that the scientific evaluation of these species has been received by the federal government.  
   - It triggers the next steps in the legal process, such as the potential listing of species on the *List of Wildlife Species at Risk*, which may lead to the development of recovery strategies and action plans.  
   - It ensures transparency and accountability by publicly recognizing the role of scientific assessment in conservation decision-making.

4. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is responsible for evaluating the conservation status of wildlife species using scientific data and expert analysis. Its assessments are critical to determining whether a species qualifies for protection under SARA. This Order affirms that these assessments are now part of the official federal record.

5. **Timing and Effect:**  
   The Order becomes effective upon its **making** (i.e., upon being published and issued). This means that the acknowledgment is not retroactive but applies from the date the Order is formally enacted and made available to the public and relevant agencies.

6. **Implementation and Follow-Up:**  
   Following this acknowledgment, the Minister of the Environment may proceed with:
   - Designating species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" in the official list.
   - Developing recovery strategies and action plans.
   - Enacting protective measures, including habitat protection, restrictions on harvesting, or prohibitions on trade.

**Context and Importance:**

This regulation is a foundational step in Canada’s biodiversity protection framework. By formally recognizing COSEWIC assessments, the government ensures that conservation decisions are based on sound, science-driven evaluations. It strengthens public trust in the regulatory process and supports effective, evidence-based policy development.

**In Summary:**  
This Order is a formal, legally binding acknowledgment by the federal government that scientific assessments of specific wildlife species by COSEWIC have been received and accepted under the *Species at Risk Act*. It marks the beginning of a formal conservation process for the species listed in the annexed schedule, paving the way for potential listing, protection, and recovery efforts.
