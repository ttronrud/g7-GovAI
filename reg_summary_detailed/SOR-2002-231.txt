The provided text consists of three identical references to a repealed regulation:

**[Repealed, SOR/2012-255, s. 2]**

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (Section 2 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2012-255) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by another legislative or regulatory instrument.

- **SOR/2012-255** refers to the *Statutory Instrument of 2012, No. 255*, which is a regulatory document issued under the authority of a Canadian provincial or federal government (in this case, likely a provincial government, given the format of SOR, which stands for "Statutory Rules" or "Statutory Orders").
- **Section 2** of that instrument was the specific provision that was repealed.
- The repeal is effective as of the date the SOR/2012-255 was enacted, and it means that the content of Section 2 of that instrument is no longer in force or applicable.

### Key Implications:
- The regulation previously in effect under Section 2 is **no longer valid** and cannot be cited or applied.
- Any legal obligations, rules, or requirements previously established by that section have been **removed**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Align with updated legislation,
  - Remove outdated or redundant provisions,
  - Improve regulatory clarity or efficiency,
  - Reflect changes in policy or administrative structure.

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation is **repealed**, there is **no substantive content** to summarize in terms of its provisions or requirements.
- The summary is not about what the regulation *did* before repeal, but rather about the **legal status** of its repeal.
- The repetition of the same line three times appears to be a formatting or technical error in the original document and does not indicate multiple distinct regulations.

### Conclusion:
The entry "[Repealed, SOR/2012-255, s. 2]" signifies that **Section 2 of Statutory Instrument No. 255 from 2012 has been formally canceled and is no longer in effect**. There is no active or enforceable regulation under this section. Any prior legal or operational reliance on this section is invalid.

For further context, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2012-255 or the legislative intent behind its repeal. However, based solely on the provided information, the summary is limited to the status of repeal.
