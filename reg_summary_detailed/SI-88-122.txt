Certainly. Here is a detailed and clear summary of the provided regulation:

**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions under the Currency Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which authorizes the transfer of powers, duties, and functions between government ministers.

**Subject Matter:**  
The regulation transfers specific powers, duties, and functions previously held by the **Minister of Supply and Services** to the **Minister of Finance**.

**Scope of Transfer:**  
The transfer applies only to the powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Supply and Services under **Part I of the Currency Act**.

**Historical Context:**  
This transfer is based on a prior Order in Council, **P.C. 1976-2857**, dated **November 18, 1976**, which originally transferred those same powers, duties, and functions from the Minister of Supply and Services to the Minister of Finance. This current regulation formally confirms and reaffirms that transfer under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.

**Key Implications:**

1. **Functional Reassignment:**  
   The Minister of Finance now assumes responsibility for all aspects of the functions related to currency management as defined in Part I of the Currency Act that were previously managed by the Minister of Supply and Services.

2. **Continuity of Operations:**  
   The transfer ensures continuity in the administration of currency-related matters, with the Minister of Finance now overseeing these functions as part of their broader fiscal responsibilities.

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is legally valid and binding because it is issued under the authority of a specific enabling statute (the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act), and it references a prior Order in Council that established the original transfer.

4. **Limited Scope:**  
   The transfer is strictly limited to **Part I of the Currency Act**. Other parts of the Act or functions outside this specific section remain unaffected.

5. **Administrative Efficiency:**  
   This reorganization reflects a broader effort to streamline government operations by consolidating responsibilities under more central and financially capable ministries—particularly the Minister of Finance, who is better positioned to manage monetary and fiscal policy.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally and legally transfers certain currency-related administrative responsibilities from the Minister of Supply and Services to the Minister of Finance. It is a procedural and administrative update to a 1976 transfer, ensuring that the current government structure reflects the intended delegation of duties under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The change does not alter the substantive content of the Currency Act but reassigns the executive implementation of its provisions to a different ministerial office.

**Note:**  
This regulation is a routine administrative reorganization and does not introduce new policy or legislative changes. It serves to clarify and formalize existing ministerial responsibilities within the Canadian federal government structure.
