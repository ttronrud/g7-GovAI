**Detailed Summary of the Northern Ontario Loan Insurance Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Northern Ontario Loan Insurance Regulations* (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 3; S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 90; S.C. 1988, c. 25) are a set of government regulations established to promote economic development in Northern Ontario by providing **loan insurance** to lenders who finance commercial projects in designated regions. These regulations were enacted under the authority of the *Appropriation Acts* of 1980–81, 1981–82, and 1988–89, and are administered by the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology**.

The primary objective is to encourage investment in economically significant sectors in Northern Ontario by reducing the financial risk for lenders—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—that might otherwise be unable to secure loans due to perceived risks associated with location, sector, or project viability.

## **Claim Process and Loss Definition**

A claim can only be paid by the Minister **if**:
1. The lender makes a **formal written demand**.
2. The lender submits evidence that:
   - It took **all reasonable steps** to protect its rights and realize on the security.
   - It **suffered a loss** as defined in Section 11.

### **Definition of "Loss"** (total amount payable to lender):

Loss =  
**(a)** Principal amount of the outstanding loan + unpaid interest at date of formal demand  
**(b)** Reasonable legal, administrative, and collection costs  
**(c)** Costs incurred to protect the loan security  
**(d)** Interest on (a), (b), and (c) at the **lender’s rate** for up to **180 days** after formal demand  
**(e)** Additional interest at **half the rate** for up to another 180 days (only if the Minister and lender agree to realize on security during this period)  
**Minus**:
- Any amount **realized from the security**
- Any amount **recovered by the lender after formal demand** in excess of all other loans made to the applicant

> Thus, the loss is capped by the **insured amount** at the time of formal demand and is limited to the actual financial loss incurred.

The Minister may, **on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada**, acquire a **stock option** in a company as a condition of entering into a loan insurance agreement **only if**:

- The loan amount is **$500,000 or more**.
- The expected rate of return on the project **justifies** the acquisition.

### Key Rules:
- The Minister may **exercise, assign, or sell** the stock option **only if it benefits Canada**.
- If capital stock is acquired under the option, the Minister must **sell it within two years** of acquisition to benefit Canada.
- If a third party offers to buy the stock option or capital stock, the Minister must **notify the applicant in writing**.
- If the applicant intends to purchase the stock at the offered price and terms, it must **advise the Minister within seven business days**.
- Upon such notice, the Minister **must sell the stock option or capital stock to the applicant**.
