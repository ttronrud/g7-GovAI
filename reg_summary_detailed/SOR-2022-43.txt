**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order**

---

### **1. Background and Rationale**

This regulatory order is issued under the authority of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act* (R.S.C. 1970, c. R-10), specifically in response to a report submitted under **Section 56** of that Act. The report indicates that the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund** currently holds a surplus—significantly exceeding the amount required to adequately fund the projected future pension obligations.

Despite the surplus, the government determines that it is appropriate to **increase pension benefits** for certain beneficiaries to improve financial support for dependants of RCMP members, particularly widows and surviving family members.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, pursuant to **subsection 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act*. This provision authorizes the Governor General to issue orders to adjust pension benefits when necessary to ensure adequate provision for future payments.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

The Order establishes specific increases in pension benefits for three distinct categories of beneficiaries, effective on **April 1** in each of the **2020, 2021, and 2022 plan years**:

#### **(a) Pensions for Current and Prospective Widows**

- **Increase:** A **2% increase** in pension amounts for:
  - Current widows (those who are currently receiving pensions)
  - Prospective widows (those who may become eligible in the future)
- **Effective Dates:** April 1 of the **2020, 2021, and 2022 plan years**.
- **Purpose:** To provide greater financial stability and support to surviving spouses of RCMP members.

> *Note:* This increase is applied annually and is not a one-time adjustment. It is scheduled to occur in three consecutive years, ensuring sustained benefit growth over time.

---

#### **(b) Lump Sum Benefits on Death of a Former Member (Not Survived by a Widow)**

- **Increase:** A **2% increase** in lump sum benefits payable upon the death of a former RCMP member who:
  - Contributed to the pension plan
  - Is **not survived by a widow**
- **Effective Dates:** April 1 of the **2020, 2021, and 2022 plan years**.
- **Purpose:** To enhance the financial support provided to beneficiaries who do not receive a pension due to the absence of a surviving spouse.

> *Note:* This adjustment ensures that even non-widow beneficiaries receive a proportional increase in their death benefits, reflecting the broader goal of equitable and fair benefit distribution.

---

#### **(c) Residual Amounts Payable on Death of a Former Member’s Widow**

This provision is more complex and involves a **"deemed increase"** in the former member’s contributions to calculate residual benefits. Residual benefits are payments made to a widow after the death of her deceased spouse, typically based on the member’s contributions and the pension plan’s formula.

- **Deemed Increase in Contributions:**
  - **2021 Plan Year:** **1,381%** increase in the former member’s contributions
  - **2022 Plan Year:** **1,411%** increase in the former member’s contributions
  - **2023 Plan Year:** **1,441%** increase in the former member’s contributions

> *Important Clarification:*  
> The term “deemed increase” means that the pension calculation will assume the former member contributed **1,381% more** than their actual contributions for the 2021 plan year, and similarly for the subsequent years. This is not a real increase in actual contributions but a **hypothetical adjustment** used in the formula to compute the residual benefit.

> *Purpose:*  
> This extraordinary adjustment significantly boosts the residual benefit amount payable to a widow upon her death. It reflects a policy decision to provide enhanced financial security to widows, particularly in later years, by treating their deceased spouse’s contributions as if they were substantially larger—thereby increasing the pension entitlement.

> *Impact:*  
> The 1,381% to 1,441% increase represents a **substantial uplift** in the benefit calculation. For example, if a widow’s residual benefit is based on a base contribution of $100,000, a 1,441% increase would effectively raise the value to $1,441,000 (in hypothetical terms), though this is a formulaic adjustment and not a real cash increase.

> *Note:* This adjustment is **not retroactive** and only applies to deaths occurring in the respective plan years (2021, 2022, and 2023).

### **4. Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day on which it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).

---

### **5. Key Observations and Implications**

- **Surplus Fund Context:** The decision to increase benefits despite a surplus in the pension fund suggests a **policy priority**—enhancing support for dependants, particularly widows, who may face significant financial hardship.
- **Equity and Fairness:** The increases are designed to ensure that both widows and non-widow beneficiaries receive proportionate and growing benefits over time.
- **Unusual Deemed Increase:** The 1,381% to 1,441% deemed increase is **exceptional** and likely intended to reflect a long-term strategy to improve the financial security of widows, possibly in response to changing demographics, inflation, or cost-of-living pressures.
- **Annual Schedule:** The phased implementation across 2020–2022 (with a forward-looking 2023 provision) allows for a gradual adjustment, giving the pension fund time to manage the financial implications.

### **6. Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in strengthening the financial support provided to the dependants of RCMP members. It reflects both a financial and humanitarian rationale—leveraging a surplus fund to provide meaningful increases in pension benefits, especially for widows. The use of a **deemed increase** in contributions for residual benefits is a unique and impactful mechanism, designed to substantially enhance the value of these benefits in later years.

While the increases are modest in nominal terms (2% for pensions and lump sums), the **residual benefit adjustment** represents a major structural change in how benefits are calculated, potentially offering long-term financial security to widows.

**Final Note:** This Order is binding and enforceable under the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act*. It applies to all eligible beneficiaries and must be implemented in accordance with the pension plan’s rules and administrative procedures.
