### Detailed Summary:

**1. Status of the Regulation**  
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed by SI 2017-54, section 1. This means the legal text, provisions, or rules previously contained in the regulation are **no longer valid or applicable** under current law.

**2. What is SI 2017-54?**  
SI 2017-54 is a statutory instrument issued in the United Kingdom (or a jurisdiction that uses such instruments) in 2017. Statutory instruments are a form of secondary (or delegated) legislation used to implement or amend primary legislation. The repeal of a regulation through such a notice signifies that the law has been updated or replaced.

**3. Section 1 of SI 2017-54**  
Section 1 of SI 2017-54 typically contains the **repeal clause**, which explicitly removes certain provisions from existing legislation. In this case, the repeated reference suggests that **multiple or several provisions** (possibly a section or multiple subsections) of a prior regulation were repealed. The exact regulation being repealed is not specified in the text provided, but the reference implies that the regulation in question was one of the ones listed or referenced in the original legislation.

**4. Implications of Repeal**  
- The legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.  
- Any legal actions, compliance requirements, or administrative processes based on that regulation are now invalid or require updating.  
- The repeal may have been made to:  
  - Streamline or modernize the law  
  - Correct errors or inconsistencies  
  - Align with new policy objectives  
  - Be superseded by more current or comprehensive legislation  

**5. Limitations of the Summary**  
Because the original regulation itself is not provided in the query, the summary cannot detail the **specific content, scope, or purpose** of the repealed regulation (e.g., whether it related to environmental standards, employment, health, or another area). The only information available is that it was repealed by SI 2017-54, section 1.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question has been **formally repealed** by Statutory Instrument 2017-54, section 1. As such, it is **no longer legally binding or in effect**. The repeal likely reflects a legislative update or consolidation of laws. Without the original text of the repealed regulation, a detailed description of its content, purpose, or application cannot be provided. For further details, one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation or the explanatory notes accompanying SI 2017-54.

If you can provide the name or subject of the original regulation (e.g., "Regulation on Food Safety" or "Rules for Public Transport"), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
