**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Regarding the Boundaries of the Town of Banff**

---

**1. Background and Context**  
This regulation pertains to the official establishment and formalization of the boundaries of the town of Banff within Banff National Park in the Province of Alberta. The process began with a public hearing held on **August 31, 1989**, in the town of Banff. This hearing was conducted to ensure transparency, public input, and community engagement in defining the precise territorial limits of the town. Public hearings are a key procedural requirement under Canadian land and environmental legislation, particularly when altering or formally establishing boundaries within protected areas such as national parks.

**2. Legal Authority**  
The regulation is issued under **section 8.1** of the *National Parks Act* (R.S., c. 39 (4th Supp.), s. 7). This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) the authority to formally define, adjust, or establish the boundaries of designated towns or communities located within national parks. The power is exercised in accordance with legal procedures, including public consultation, to ensure that such changes are both legitimate and in the public interest.

**3. Key Provisions of the Regulation**

- **Boundary Fixing**:  
  The Governor General in Council officially **fixes the boundaries of the town of Banff** in accordance with **Schedule IV**, which is attached to and referenced in the regulation. This schedule provides a detailed, legally binding description of the town’s geographic limits, including coordinates, parcel descriptions, and reference points.

- **Incorporation into the National Parks Act**:  
  Schedule IV is not merely an annex; it is formally **added as Schedule IV to the National Parks Act**. This means the boundary description becomes an integral part of the statutory framework governing Banff National Park, making it legally enforceable and accessible under the Act.

- **Land Description and Area**:  
  The town of Banff is defined as a parcel of land located **within Banff National Park, Alberta**, specifically referenced on **Plan Number 72468** in the Canada Lands Survey Records. A copy of this plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office in Calgary** under reference number **LTO 8911788**.  
  The total area of the parcel is approximately **487 hectares**, more or less — a precise measure used for legal, administrative, and planning purposes.

**4. Significance and Implications**

- **Legal Clarity and Precision**:  
  By formally defining the boundaries, the regulation removes ambiguity about the extent of the town’s jurisdiction, which is essential for land use planning, zoning, municipal governance, and environmental management.

- **Public Accountability**:  
  The public hearing prior to the regulation reflects a commitment to democratic principles and transparency. It ensures that residents, stakeholders, and interested parties had the opportunity to provide input before the final boundaries were adopted.

- **Integration with National Park Governance**:  
  As the boundaries are now part of the *National Parks Act*, they are subject to the same legal protections and oversight as other designated areas within the park. This integration supports consistent management of both urban and natural components of the protected area.

- **Administrative and Land Use Consequences**:  
  The fixed boundaries will impact future development, infrastructure planning, property rights, and emergency services within the town. They also serve as a foundation for legal disputes, land transactions, and intergovernmental coordination between the provincial government, Parks Canada, and local municipalities.

**5. Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a formal, legally binding action to define the territorial limits of the town of Banff within Banff National Park. It follows a transparent process involving public consultation and is grounded in statutory authority. By incorporating the boundary description into the *National Parks Act*, the government ensures long-term stability, legal enforceability, and alignment with environmental and land-use objectives. The 487-hectare parcel, referenced on Plan 72468 and filed in Calgary, now serves as the official geographic and legal boundary for the town of Banff.
