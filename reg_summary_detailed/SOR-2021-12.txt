**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Critical Habitat of the Fernald’s Braya (Braya fernaldii) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **Part 2 of Schedule 1**, which designates certain wildlife species as endangered and mandates the protection of their **critical habitat**.

- **Act**: *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)  
- **Relevant Provisions**:
  - **Section 58(1)**: Requires the designation of critical habitat for listed species.
  - **Section 58(4)**: Authorizes the competent minister to make an Order designating critical habitat.
  - **Section 58(5)**: Requires consultation with other competent ministers when the proposed critical habitat may affect lands under the jurisdiction of other federal departments or agencies.
  - **Section 58(9)**: Requires consultation with relevant ministers when the critical habitat overlaps with lands managed by other federal departments.

### **2. Species at Risk**

The species in question is **Fernald’s Braya (Braya fernaldii)**, a rare and endangered plant species native to Canada.

- It is officially listed as **endangered** under SARA.
- The species is part of a formal action plan that outlines conservation strategies, including the identification of its **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.

---

### **3. Critical Habitat Designation**

- The **critical habitat** for Fernald’s Braya has been formally identified in the **action plan** for the species.
- This action plan is **publicly accessible** and registered in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public accountability.
- The **annexed Order** now officially designates the specific geographic areas where this critical habitat is located.

---

### **4. Jurisdictional and Consultation Considerations**

- The Minister of the Environment, who is responsible for administering SARA, has determined that:
  - **No portion** of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA. This provision protects areas that are “in a place that is under the authority of a minister other than the Minister of the Environment” — in this case, the critical habitat is not in a location under the direct jurisdiction of another minister under that clause.
- However, the Minister acknowledges that the Order may affect land **under the authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**.
- Therefore, the Minister of the Environment **consulted with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** in accordance with **subsection 58(9)** of SARA to ensure that any potential impacts on MFO-managed lands are considered and addressed.

---

### **5. Legal Authority and Purpose**

- The Minister of the Environment issues this Order **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA.
- This means:
  - The Order is legally valid and enforceable.
  - It reflects a formal, science-based determination that the identified areas are essential for the survival and recovery of Fernald’s Braya.
  - The consultation process with other ministers ensures interdepartmental coordination and compliance with SARA’s collaborative requirements.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the appropriate federal registry.
- This ensures immediate legal effect once the document is officially published and recognized.

---

### **7. Key Outcomes and Implications**

- **Legal Protection**: The designated critical habitat is now legally protected under SARA. Any federal projects, developments, or land-use activities that would impact this habitat must undergo **environmental assessment** and **mitigation measures**.
- **Conservation Focus**: The designation supports targeted conservation efforts, including habitat restoration, monitoring, and research.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By publishing the Order in the Public Registry and including the consultation record, the government demonstrates adherence to open governance and stakeholder engagement principles.
- **Interdepartmental Cooperation**: The consultation with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans highlights the importance of cross-ministerial coordination in protecting biodiversity across federal jurisdictions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the endangered Fernald’s Braya (Braya fernaldii) under the Species at Risk Act. It is grounded in scientific assessment, complies with legal requirements for consultation, and reflects a commitment to conserving biodiversity. The Order ensures that the specific areas essential for the survival of this rare plant species are protected from harmful federal activities, while also respecting the jurisdictional boundaries of other federal agencies.
