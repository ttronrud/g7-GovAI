**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to establish a **clear, consistent, and fair fee** for individuals who request a replacement of their Social Insurance Number Card. It replaces the previous fee structure with a more transparent and equitable policy that accounts for legitimate and exceptional circumstances that may justify exemption from the fee.

**Key Provision: Standard Replacement Fee**

- The **standard replacement fee** for a Social Insurance Number Card is **$10 per card**.
- This fee applies to all individuals who request a replacement of their SIN card **unless an exemption applies**.

**Exemptions from the Replacement Fee**

The regulation provides **three specific exemptions** under which the $10 replacement fee is **not required** to be paid:

1. **Legal Change in the Holder’s Name**  
   - If the individual’s name has legally changed (e.g., through marriage, divorce, or court order), the replacement of the SIN card is exempt from the $10 fee.  
   - This exemption recognizes the administrative necessity of updating official records when a person’s legal identity changes.

2. **Error by a Government Official**  
   - If the error in the original SIN card (such as a typo in the name, address, or date of birth) is attributable to a **mistake made by an official of the Government of Canada** in the performance of their duties, the replacement is exempt from the fee.  
   - This provision protects individuals from financial burden when government errors result in an invalid or incorrect card.

3. **Natural Disaster**  
   - If the replacement of the SIN card is required due to a **natural disaster** (e.g., fire, flood, earthquake, or other events that destroy or damage the original card), the fee is waived.  
   - This exemption acknowledges the hardship faced by individuals whose cards are lost or destroyed due to unforeseen and uncontrollable events.
