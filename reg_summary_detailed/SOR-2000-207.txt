## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations**

### 🔹 **Overview**
These regulations, made by the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** and approved under **section 44 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**, establish the legal framework governing the **possession, use, licensing, and disposal** of **radioactive nuclear substances**, **sealed sources**, and **radiation devices** in Canada. They define key terms, set exemption and clearance levels, and outline conditions under which certain activities can be carried out **without a license**.

The regulations apply to all nuclear substances and sealed sources, as well as radiation devices **excluding Class II prescribed equipment**. They do **not apply** to the **packaging or transport** of such materials.

| **Nuclear Criticality** | Self-sustaining fission chain reaction. |
| **Operate** | Includes coupling, uncoupling, locking/unlocking, and all activities involving exposure devices when the sealed source is not in the fully shielded position. |
| **Prescribed Equipment** | Equipment listed in the *General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations*. |
| **Radiation Device** | Any device containing > exemption quantity of a nuclear substance for radiation use, or containing a radium luminous compound. |
| **Radiation Survey Meter** | Instrument measuring radiation dose rates. |
| **Sealed Source** | Radioactive material in a robust, leak-proof capsule or bonded cover. |
| **Sealed Source Assembly** | Sealed source integrated into an exposure device with permanent components. |
| **Servicing** | Maintenance (installation, repair, dismantling) not part of routine operation or authorized in the license. |
| **Specific Activity** | Activity per unit mass (e.g., Bq/g). |
| **Unconditional Clearance Level** | Maximum allowable concentration for bulk material (excluding surface contamination). Defined per substance and atomic number. |
| **Unsealed Source** | Source not in a sealed capsule. |
| **Worker** | Person performing work authorized in a license. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These definitions are critical for interpreting thresholds and exemptions.

## 📝 **Licensing Requirements**

### 1. **General Application for a Licence (Non-Servicing Activities)**  
All applications for a licence (except for servicing) must include the following additional information:

| Requirement | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Methods & Procedures** | For carrying out the licensed activity and during emergencies. |
| **Accident Response Plan** | Must include: <br> - Monitoring of radioactive releases <br> - Detection of radiation dose and activity <br> - Containment of contamination <br> - Decontamination procedures |
| **Site Description** | Proposed location and site details. |
| **Worker Roles & Training** | Qualifications, responsibilities, duties, and proposed training programs. |
| **Emergency Procedures** | For fires, spills, and other incidents involving nuclear substances. |
| **Equipment Inspection Program** | Routine checks for safety and functionality. |
| **Calibration Plans** | For radiation survey meters and dosimeters (per Regulation). |
| **Leak & Survey Testing** | Methods for conducting required leak tests and radiation surveys. |
| **Room Design (if applicable)** | For unsealed sources used in enclosed rooms. |
| **Radiation Device Details** | Brand name, model number, and quantity. |
| **Criticality Prevention** | Required for Category I, II, or III nuclear material (per *Nuclear Security Regulations*). |
| **Disposal Procedures** | For devices or check sources (if manufacturing/distributing). |

> ⚠️ **Exception**: Licensing applications for **imports or exports** are governed by the *Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations* and are exempt from these requirements.

### 2. **Application for Licence to Service a Radiation Device**

Must include:
- Brand name and model number (or certificate number) of the device.
- Description of the servicing activity (e.g., repair, maintenance).
- Proposed methods, procedures, and equipment.
- Worker qualifications and training program.
- Post-service verification procedures to ensure the device is safe for use.

> 🔍 This is a more limited scope than full licensing and focuses on maintenance and safety.

## ✅ **Exempt Activities (No Licence Required)**

A person may carry out the following **without a licence**, provided the activity or concentration does not exceed:

### 1. **Radioactive Nuclear Substances**
- Possess, transfer, import, export, use, mine, produce, refine, convert, enrich, process, reprocess, manage, or store a radioactive substance **if**:
  - The activity or concentration does **not exceed**:
    - Its **exemption quantity**
    - Its **conditional clearance level**
    - Its **unconditional clearance level**

> 🔍 These thresholds vary by substance and are based on risk, distribution, and atomic number.

---

### 2. **Sealed Sources (Low Activity)**
- Possess, transfer, import, export, store, use, or abandon a sealed source **containing less than the exemption quantity** of radioactive material.

---

### 3. **Radiation Devices (Non-Exposure Devices)**
- Possess, transfer, store, use, or abandon a radiation device (other than exposure devices) **if** the quantity of nuclear material contained is **less than 10 times the exemption quantity**.

---

### 4. **Deuterium and Deuterium Compounds**
- Possess, transfer, store, use, or dispose of deuterium (or compounds) **if less than 10 kg per calendar year**.
