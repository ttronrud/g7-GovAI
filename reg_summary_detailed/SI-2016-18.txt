### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of the Canadian Secretariat to the Canada-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207).
- The Act provides the legal framework for reorganizing federal public administration and transferring duties among departments and agencies.

#### **2. Key Transfer**
- The **control and supervision** of the **Canadian Secretariat** — a component of the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** — is being transferred.
- The Canadian Secretariat is a key administrative body within the Privy Council Office that supports the functioning of the federal government, including policy coordination, interdepartmental communication, and administrative support to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

#### **3. Recipient Organization**
- The transferred functions and responsibilities are being transferred to the **Canada-U.S. Regulatory Cooperation Council (CUSRCC)**.
- The CUSRCC is a bilateral body established to promote regulatory cooperation between Canada and the United States. Its mandate includes reducing regulatory barriers, enhancing regulatory transparency, and facilitating mutual understanding of regulatory standards in areas such as environment, health, safety, and trade.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The transfer becomes effective on **April 1, 2016**.
- This date marks the point at which the Canadian Secretariat’s administrative control and oversight are formally assumed by the CUSRCC.

#### **5. Purpose and Rationale**
- The transfer is intended to:
  - Strengthen **cross-border regulatory collaboration** between Canada and the U.S.
  - Improve **regulatory efficiency and predictability** in joint markets.
  - Leverage the CUSRCC’s existing mandate and institutional capacity to manage and coordinate regulatory issues in a bilateral context.
  - Align public administration functions with broader economic and trade policy goals, particularly in the context of North American economic integration (e.g., under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA).

#### **6. Implications**
- **Administrative Shift**: The Canadian Secretariat, which previously operated under the direct oversight of the Privy Council Office, now operates under the authority and governance of the CUSRCC.
- **Functional Integration**: The CUSRCC gains enhanced administrative and operational capacity to support bilateral regulatory dialogue and coordination.
- **Policy Impact**: This move reflects a strategic realignment of federal public service functions to support international regulatory cooperation, particularly in areas of mutual economic interest.

#### **7. Legal Citation**
- The regulation is cited as:  
  **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** (Section 207 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)  
  and is referenced in the **Regulations of the Canada Revenue Agency and other federal statutes** under **R.S., c. P-34** (Public Service Regulations).

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It transfers a key administrative function — the Canadian Secretariat — from the core executive support office (Privy Council Office) to a specialized intergovernmental body focused on U.S.-Canada regulatory cooperation. The move underscores Canada’s commitment to strengthening bilateral regulatory alignment and improving cross-border governance in a globalized economy.

> **Note**: While the regulation is dated 2003, the actual transfer of control to the CUSRCC occurred in 2016, indicating that the legislative authority was activated and implemented at a later date. This highlights the difference between the enactment of a law and its practical application.
