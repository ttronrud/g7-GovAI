**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Text Overview**

This regulation, issued on **April 3, 2012**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage**, under **section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, formally **excludes certain provisions of the PSEA from applying** to a specific category of indeterminate employees.

The key provision excluded is the application of:

- **Section 16, paragraph 22(2)(a)b**  
- **Subsection 29(3)**  
- **Sections 30, 31, and 40 to 48c**  
- **Subsection 51(4)**  
- **Section 77** of the Public Service Employment Act

To a particular type of **indeterminate employee** who:

1. Is **appointed or deployed** to a position as an indeterminate employee;
2. Is affected by a **relocation of their work unit**;
3. **Does not wish to relocate**;
4. Or whose **services are no longer required** due to:
   - Lack of work;
   - Discontinuance of a function;
   - Transfer of work or function **outside the public service**;
5. And who has **not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer**.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The regulation is grounded in two key policy considerations:

#### 1. **Practicability and Public Interest**
The Public Service Commission (PSC) concluded that applying the full scope of the above-mentioned provisions — which typically govern **job security, reassignment rights, and protection against dismissal** — to such employees would be:
- **Neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service**.

This means that enforcing these protections (e.g., requiring a reasonable job offer or mandating reassignment) in these specific circumstances would create administrative burdens, inefficiencies, or operational challenges that could undermine effective public service operations.

#### 2. **Consultation with the Employer**
Under **subsection 20(2)** of the PSEA, the PSC was required to consult with the employer before making this exclusion. The fact that consultation occurred confirms that the decision was made in a transparent, collaborative, and accountable manner, ensuring that employer perspectives were considered.

### **Key Legal Provisions Excluded**

Let’s briefly explain what each of these sections normally covers, and why their exclusion is significant:

| Section | Typical Meaning | Why Exclusion Matters |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Section 16, para. 22(2)(a)b** | Provides protection against dismissal without cause or without a reasonable job offer. | Excluding this means the employee is not entitled to protection against dismissal when their work unit relocates or functions are discontinued, especially if no reasonable job offer is provided. |
| **Subsection 29(3)** | May require a reasonable job offer before dismissal or transfer. | Exclusion removes the obligation to offer a reasonable job, even in cases of relocation or function changes. |
| **Sections 30, 31, 40 to 48c** | Cover procedures for reassignment, redeployment, and dismissal; include requirements for job offers and consultation. | These are now bypassed, reducing procedural safeguards for the employee. |
| **Subsection 51(4)** | Relates to the right to a reasonable job offer in cases of transfer or discontinuance of function. | Excluded, so no obligation to offer a reasonable alternative position. |
| **Section 77** | Governs dismissal procedures and job security in certain circumstances. | Exclusion means the employee may be dismissed without following full procedural protections. |

### **Who Is Affected?**

The regulation applies specifically to:

- **Indeterminate employees** — individuals hired on a temporary or project-based basis, not with a fixed term or permanent appointment.
- Employees whose **work unit is relocated** (e.g., office moved, department restructured).
- Employees who **do not wish to relocate**.
- Employees whose **services are no longer needed** due to:
  - Closure of a program or function;
  - Change in organizational structure;
  - Transfer of responsibilities to another sector or agency (e.g., outside the public service).
- Employees who have **not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer** — meaning no formal assurance or offer of reassignment or alternative role.

> **Note**: The employee is not being dismissed per se — the exclusion applies when their role becomes obsolete or their unit moves, and no reasonable job offer is made.

### **Implications for Employees**

This regulation significantly **reduces job security** for certain indeterminate employees in the face of organizational changes. Key implications include:

- **No automatic right to a reasonable job offer** when a work unit relocates or a function ends.
- **No protection under sections 30, 31, or 40–48c** against dismissal or reassignment without due process.
- **Greater flexibility for employers** to restructure or discontinue functions without being bound by employment protections.
- **Increased risk of job loss** without formal notice or procedural safeguards.

This may be seen as a **balance between organizational efficiency and employee protection**, favoring administrative agility in times of restructuring.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Section 20 of the Public Service Employment Act** grants the Public Service Commission the authority to **exclude provisions of the Act** from application in specific circumstances.
- The PSC exercised this power **only after consultation with the employer**, fulfilling the procedural requirement under subsection 20(2).
- The exclusion is **not retroactive** — it applies to future cases involving such employees.

### **Policy Context and Broader Implications**

This regulation reflects a broader trend in public service management to:
- Allow greater **flexibility in organizational restructuring**;
- Respond efficiently to **changing government priorities or budget constraints**;
- Avoid the cost and complexity of reassigning or rehiring temporary staff.

However, it also raises concerns about:
- **Fairness and equity** for temporary or project-based workers;
- The **potential for job insecurity** in the public service;
- The **need for clear communication and transparency** in workforce changes.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **specific exemption** from key employment protections under the Public Service Employment Act for indeterminate employees facing relocation or loss of function, particularly when no reasonable job offer has been made. While it enables the public service to adapt efficiently to structural changes, it does so at the expense of employee job security. The decision is based on a formal assessment by the Public Service Commission, supported by consultation with employers, and grounded in the principle that such protections are not always practical or beneficial in all circumstances.

It is a **significant departure from standard employment protections** and underscores the importance of balancing organizational needs with employee rights in the public sector.
