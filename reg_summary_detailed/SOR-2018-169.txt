### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Critical Habitat of the Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata) – Great Lakes / St. Lawrence – Canadian Shield Population Order**

#### **1. Background and Context**
This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **subsection 58(4) and (5)**, to define and manage the **critical habitat** of the **Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata) Great Lakes / St. Lawrence – Canadian Shield population**.

- The species is officially listed as **"threatened"** in **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to SARA, meaning it is at risk of extinction in the wild and requires protection under federal law.
- A formal **recovery strategy** for this population has been developed and is publicly accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry**, identifying specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.
- This regulation builds upon that recovery strategy by formally designating or excluding certain areas from being recognized as critical habitat.

---

#### **2. Key Legal Provisions Invoked**
The regulation is grounded in specific provisions of SARA:

- **Subsection 58(1)**: Requires the designation of critical habitat for listed species.  
  → Applies to the Western Chorus Frog population, **except** for areas that fall under certain exclusions.

- **Subsection 58(2)**: Specifies that certain areas are **excluded from critical habitat designation**:
  - Areas located in a **"place"** referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) of SARA.
  - Lands set apart for the **use and benefit of Indigenous bands** under the **Indian Act**.

- **Subsection 58(5)**: Mandates that the **Minister of the Environment** must **consult with other competent ministers** when determining critical habitat.  
  → This ensures intergovernmental coordination, particularly with other federal departments and agencies.

- The **Minister of the Environment** is also the **Minister responsible for Parks Canada**, which creates a direct link to land management decisions involving protected areas.

---

#### **3. Scope of the Regulation**
The Order:
- **Designates critical habitat** for the Western Chorus Frog (Pseudacris triseriata) Great Lakes / St. Lawrence – Canadian Shield population, as identified in the recovery strategy.
- **Excludes specific portions** of that critical habitat from the designation due to legal exclusions under SARA:
  - Areas located in a **"place" referred to in subsection 58(2)(b)** — this typically includes areas designated as **provincial or territorial lands, or areas under jurisdiction of other federal departments** (e.g., military installations, national defence sites, or other government-controlled lands).
  - Lands **set apart for the use and benefit of a First Nation or Indigenous band** under the Indian Act.

> **Important Note**: The exclusion is not a denial of importance, but a legal requirement under SARA to avoid conflicts with Indigenous rights, land use, and jurisdictional responsibilities.

---

#### **4. Purpose and Objectives**
The primary objectives of this Order are:
- To **formally recognize and protect** the areas essential for the survival and recovery of the Western Chorus Frog population.
- To **ensure that development, resource activities, or other human impacts are avoided or mitigated** in designated critical habitat.
- To **promote cooperation** between federal agencies (especially Environment and Parks Canada) and other relevant ministries or Indigenous governments.
- To **comply with legal obligations** under SARA, including consultation and exclusion requirements.

---

#### **5. Jurisdiction and Authority**
- The **Minister of the Environment** issued this Order, based on:
  - The recovery strategy in the Species at Risk Public Registry.
  - Legal authority under **SARA, sections 58(4) and (5)**.
  - Requirement to consult with other competent ministers (e.g., Minister of Natural Resources, Minister of Indigenous Affairs, etc.).

---

#### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- This ensures immediate legal effect upon formalization, allowing for prompt enforcement and compliance.

---

#### **7. Legal and Policy Significance**
- **Environmental Protection**: Strengthens conservation efforts for a species of regional and ecological importance.
- **Indigenous Rights and Land Use**: Respects Indigenous land rights and governance by excluding lands designated for band use.
- **Inter-Agency Coordination**: Reinforces the principle of intergovernmental consultation under SARA, promoting transparency and collaborative decision-making.
- **Legal Precedent**: Sets a precedent for how critical habitat designations are adjusted to reflect jurisdictional and legal constraints.

#### **8. Reference and Citation**
- **Issuing Body**: Minister of the Environment  
- **Date**: July 24, 2018  
- **Statutory Authority**:  
  - S.C. 2002, c. 29 (original SARA)  
  - S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60 (amendment to SARA, clarifying critical habitat exclusions)  
- **Public Registry**: The recovery strategy is accessible in the **Species at Risk Public Registry** (available online via Environment and Climate Change Canada).

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a legally binding instrument that:
- Confirms the critical habitat of the Western Chorus Frog (Great Lakes / St. Lawrence – Canadian Shield population) as identified in its recovery strategy,
- Excludes specific areas due to jurisdictional or Indigenous land-use considerations,
- Ensures compliance with SARA’s procedural and substantive requirements,
- And promotes the long-term recovery of a threatened species through targeted protection and intergovernmental collaboration.

It represents a balanced approach to conservation, respecting both ecological needs and legal and cultural responsibilities of Indigenous communities and other government entities.

✅ **Key Takeaway**:  
This Order does not remove the need to protect the species — it **refines and legally defines** where protection applies, while **respecting Indigenous rights and federal jurisdictional boundaries**.
