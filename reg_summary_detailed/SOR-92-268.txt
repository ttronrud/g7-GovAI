**Detailed Summary of the Pulp and Paper Mill Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Pulp and Paper Mill Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Defoamer and Wood Chip Regulations") are a set of federal environmental regulations enacted under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999**. These regulations were introduced to reduce the environmental and health risks associated with the use of certain toxic substances in the pulp and paper industry—specifically, **defoamers containing dibenzofuran or dibenzo-para-dioxin**, and **wood chips treated with polychlorinated phenols**.

The regulations were originally proposed in 1991 and finalized in 1992, with the final version coming into force after being approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of National Health and Welfare, following consultation with a federal-provincial advisory committee.

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 34 of CEPA (1999)**: This section empowers the Governor in Council to make regulations to control or restrict the manufacture, import, sale, use, or handling of toxic substances that pose a risk to human health or the environment.
- **Section 48(1)**: This provision allows the Minister of the Environment to publish proposed regulations in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, inviting public and stakeholder input.
- **Section 34(3)**: Confirms that these regulations do not overlap with or duplicate existing provisions under other federal or provincial laws.

### **Core Regulatory Provisions**

#### **1. Restrictions on Defoamers Used in Chlorine Bleaching Mills**

No person may **use** a defoamer at a pulp and paper mill that employs a chlorine bleaching process **unless**:
- A **sample analysis** of each batch shows:
  - ≤ **40 ppb** of dibenzofuran
  - ≤ **10 ppb** of dibenzo-para-dioxin  
  *OR*
- A **certificate from the manufacturer** confirms:
  - ≤ **40 ppb** of dibenzofuran
  - ≤ **10 ppb** of dibenzo-para-dioxin

> This ensures that only defoamers with very low levels of these toxic compounds are allowed in chlorine-based bleaching processes.

#### **2. Prohibition on Manufacturing, Importing, or Selling Defoamers Exceeding Thresholds**

No person may:
- **Manufacture, import, offer for sale, or sell** a defoamer for use in a chlorine bleaching mill if it contains:
  - More than **40 ppb** of dibenzofuran  
  - More than **10 ppb** of dibenzo-para-dioxin

> This establishes a strict **maximum concentration limit** to prevent the introduction of highly toxic substances into the Canadian market.

#### **3. Ban on Use of Wood Chips Treated with Polychlorinated Phenols**

No person may:
- **Import, offer for sale, sell, or use** wood chips that were treated with polychlorinated phenols (PCPs)

> This prohibits the use of contaminated raw materials in pulp production, which could otherwise lead to toxic chemical runoff or emissions.

#### **4. Methodology for Measuring Toxic Compounds**

Concentrations of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-para-dioxin must be measured using the **Reference Method for the Determination of Dibenzofuran and Dibenzo-p-dioxin in Defoamers**, published by the Department of the Environment (Report 1/RM/20, 1991), as amended from time to time.

> This standardizes testing procedures to ensure consistency, accuracy, and comparability across laboratories and mills.

### **Reporting Requirements**

#### **A. Manufacturer, Importer, or Vendor Reports (Quarterly)**

Every person who manufactures, imports, offers for sale, or sells defoamers for use in chlorine-bleaching mills must submit a **quarterly report** to the Minister of the Environment, no later than **60 days after the end of each quarter**, containing:

1. Name and address of the manufacturer/importer/vendor  
2. Quantity and batch number of each batch produced, imported, or sold  
3. Concentrations of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-para-dioxin in each batch  
4. Name, title, phone number, and signature of the person providing the information  

> This enables the government to monitor compliance and track the levels of toxic substances in the supply chain.

#### **B. Operator Reports (Quarterly)**

Every operator using a chlorine bleaching process with defoamers must submit a **quarterly report** to the Minister, including:

1. Name and address of the mill  
2. Quantity and batch number of each defoamer received, along with the name and address of the manufacturer/importer/vendor  
3. A copy of:
   - The analysis (from paragraph 4(1)(a)), or
   - The manufacturer’s certificate (from paragraph 4(1)(b))  
4. Name, title, phone number, and signature of the person providing the information  

> These reports provide detailed data on actual usage and compliance at the mill level.

#### **C. Exception for Consistent Compliance**

If a person (manufacturer, importer, vendor, or operator) has consistently reported **concentrations below the limits** (≤40 ppb dibenzofuran and ≤10 ppb dibenzo-para-dioxin) over **four consecutive quarters**, they may submit **simplified reports** for the next quarter:

- For **manufacturers/importers/vendors**: Only the concentrations of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-para-dioxin in each type of defoamer  
- For **operators**: A copy of an analysis or certificate showing that each defoamer used contains ≤40 ppb dibenzofuran and ≤10 ppb dibenzo-para-dioxin  

> This reduces administrative burden for compliant entities while maintaining oversight.

### **Recordkeeping Requirements**

All parties involved must maintain **detailed records** for a period of **five years**:

#### **For Defoamer Manufacturers, Importers, and Vendors (Schedule II):**
- Quantity and name of each shipment
- Date of manufacture, import, offer, or sale
- Name and address of each mill receiving the defoamer
- Quantity and batch number of defoamers received at each mill
- Concentrations of dibenzofuran and dibenzo-para-dioxin in each batch
- Name of laboratory conducting analyses (if not done by manufacturer/importer/vendor)

#### **For Mill Operators (Schedule I):**
- Quantity, name, and date of delivery of each shipment of defoamer
- Copy of analysis or certificate for each batch
- Name of the wood processing facility from which wood chips originated (if applicable)

#### **For Wood Chip Deliveries:**
- Quantity of wood chips delivered
- Date of delivery
- Name of the wood processing facility where PCPs were used

> These records serve as a **traceability mechanism**, allowing regulators to trace toxic substances back to their source and investigate potential violations.

### **Purpose and Environmental/Risk Context**

- **Dibenzofuran and dibenzo-para-dioxin** are **persistent organic pollutants (POPs)** known for their:
  - Long atmospheric and environmental half-lives
  - Bioaccumulation in food chains
  - Toxic effects on human health (e.g., endocrine disruption, carcinogenicity)
  - Potential to cause developmental, reproductive, and immune system damage

- **Polychlorinated phenols (PCPs)** are also **highly toxic**, including known carcinogens and mutagens. They can leach into water and soil and persist for long periods.

- The chlorine bleaching process in pulp mills is a **major source of these pollutants**, especially when defoamers containing these compounds are used.

- By setting strict concentration limits and requiring full traceability, the regulations aim to:
  - Minimize exposure to workers and communities
  - Prevent contamination of air, water, and soil
  - Protect public health and ecosystems
  - Support Canada’s international commitments under agreements like the **Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants**
