**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Context and Purpose:**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, addresses the cost recovery principle for services and facilities provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Specifically, it establishes a framework for the RCMP to charge individuals who receive services or use its facilities at the RCMP Training Academy (Depot Division) in Regina, Saskatchewan.

The core policy principle stated in the preamble is that **the cost of providing services or using facilities should be borne directly by the individuals or entities receiving those services**. This reflects a broader fiscal accountability and cost-recovery policy aimed at ensuring that public services are not provided at the expense of taxpayer funds without direct compensation.

**Key Actions Taken:**

1. **Revocation of Previous Order in Council:**
   - The regulation formally **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1985-137**, dated January 17, 1985, and the associated notice in the *Canada Gazette*, Part II, page 1037 (SI/85-12).  
   - This prior order likely established a fee structure or exemption from charges for certain individuals or services at the RCMP Training Academy. Its revocation indicates a shift in policy—removing outdated or non-cost-recovery provisions.

2. **Authorization to Introduce New Fee Structure:**
   - The Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Treasury Board) **authorizes the Solicitor General to issue a new order** that prescribes specific fees or charges.
   - These fees will apply to **persons who receive services or use facilities** at the **RCMP Training Academy (Depot Division)** located in **Regina, Saskatchewan**.

**Legal Authority:**

The regulation is enacted under **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to authorize fees or charges for services provided by federal institutions, including government departments and agencies. This provision allows for the establishment of a transparent, cost-based system where users pay for the actual cost of services or access to facilities.

**Scope and Application:**

- The fee structure applies specifically to:
  - Individuals or organizations using **RCMP training facilities**.
  - Persons receiving **services** such as classroom instruction, practical training, accommodation, or access to equipment or infrastructure at the Depot Division of the Training Academy.
- The fees are intended to **reflect the actual cost of providing those services**, promoting fiscal responsibility and equitable cost distribution.

**Implementation:**

- The **Solicitor General of Canada** is authorized to issue a new order (via a future Order in Council) to define:
  - The specific fees for different types of services or uses.
  - The circumstances under which fees apply (e.g., duration of use, type of service, number of participants).
  - Any exemptions or special provisions (e.g., for trainees, government employees, or emergency personnel).
- The new fee schedule will be subject to public notice and transparency, consistent with federal administrative procedures.

**Significance and Implications:**

- This regulation marks a shift toward **user-pays principles** in public service delivery, aligning with modern administrative and financial governance standards.
- It ensures that the RCMP Training Academy operates with **financial sustainability**, reducing reliance on general taxpayer funding for operational costs.
- It promotes **accountability** by making service costs transparent and directly tied to usage.
- It supports the broader federal government objective of **efficient and accountable public service delivery**.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation effectively removes an outdated fee exemption and establishes a formal, legally authorized mechanism for the RCMP to charge users for access to its training facilities in Regina. By relying on paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act, the government ensures that such fee-setting is conducted within established legal and financial frameworks, with oversight from key federal departments. The resulting policy supports fiscal responsibility, cost recovery, and equitable access to RCMP training services.
