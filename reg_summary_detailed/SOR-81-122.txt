**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Document Overview**

- **Title of Permit:**  
  *Import of Turkeys and Turkey Products Permit*

- **Legal Basis:**  
  The regulation is issued under the authority of two provisions of Canadian law:
  1. **Section 10 of the Export and Import Permits Act** – which allows the Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce to cancel an existing general import permit.
  2. **Section 5 of the Import Permit Regulations** – which authorizes the issuance of a new general import permit in substitution for a previous one.

- **Effective Date:**  
  Dated **February 4, 1981**, at Ottawa.

- **Legal Citation:**  
  Enacted under **SOR/79-5**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II, page 8*, on January 1979.  
  This permit was later **revoked** by **SI/83-185, Section 2**, in 1983.

### **Key Provisions of the Permit**

#### **1. Replacement of Previous Permit**
- The Minister cancels the **original General Import Permit No. 7**, as found in *C.R.C., c. 635* (the *Import and Export Permits Act*).
- A **new General Import Permit No. 7** is issued in its place, replacing the old one. This constitutes a formal renewal or update of the permit with revised or clarified terms.

#### **2. Scope of Importation**
The permit authorizes the import of the following items **into Canada**, from any country:

| Item | Quantity Limit |
|------|----------------|
| **One whole turkey** | Per non-commercial importation |
| **Turkey parts** | Not exceeding **10 kg** per non-commercial importation |
| **Turkey poults** (young turkeys) | Allowed |
| **Turkeys contained in jars or cans** | Allowed |

> **Note on "Non-Commercial Importation":**  
> The limits apply only to **non-commercial** purposes. This implies that the importation is not for resale, business, or industrial use, but rather for personal, household, or private use. Commercial imports (e.g., for sale or distribution) would be subject to different regulations and likely require a separate permit.

#### **3. Customs Entry Requirements**
- Any customs entry form submitted for turkeys imported under this permit **must be endorsed** with one of the following:
  - **"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 7"** (in English)
  - **"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 7"** (in French)

> This endorsement ensures that customs officials recognize the importation is authorized under this specific permit and not under a general or unregulated category.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

- This permit was designed to **facilitate the import of turkeys and turkey products** for **personal or private use**, especially in a time when Canada had limited or no formal import controls on small quantities of meat products.
- It reflects a policy of **simplified access** for individuals importing turkeys (e.g., for home consumption or personal use), without requiring full commercial licensing or detailed documentation.
- The permit likely addressed consumer demand or seasonal needs (e.g., holiday turkeys), while minimizing regulatory burden on individuals.

---

### **Revocation and Current Status**

- The permit was **revoked on January 1, 1983**, under **Statutory Instrument SI/83-185, Section 2**.
- This means that **General Import Permit No. 7 is no longer in force**.
- The revocation suggests that the regulatory framework for turkey imports has since been updated or replaced—possibly with more stringent controls, a shift to commercial licensing, or integration into broader food safety and import regulations.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Historical Context:**  
  This permit was a common tool in the 1970s and early 1980s for managing low-volume, non-commercial imports of food items. It allowed flexibility for individuals while maintaining regulatory oversight.

- **Regulatory Evolution:**  
  Its revocation in 1983 indicates a shift toward more structured and comprehensive import controls, especially in the food sector, where safety, labeling, and health standards became more important.

- **Practical Impact:**  
  Before revocation, individuals could legally import one turkey or up to 10 kg of turkey parts for personal use. After 1983, such imports would have required alternative authorization (e.g., under food safety regulations or under a different permit category).

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a temporary, limited authorization for individuals to import turkeys and turkey products for personal use, with clear quantity limits and procedural requirements. While it served a practical purpose in facilitating private imports, it has since been **replaced or revoked**, reflecting broader changes in Canada’s import control policies and food safety regulations.

> **Status:** **Revoked (as of 1983)** – Not currently in effect.
