To **withdraw specific lands within the Nunavik Marine Region** from disposal in order to **facilitate the negotiation and implementation of the Nunavik Inuit Marine Region Agreement-in-Principle** (commonly referred to as the *Nunavik Marine Region Agreement-in-Principle*).  

This is a significant step in the process of Indigenous self-determination, particularly in relation to marine resource management, sovereignty, and economic development in Nunavut.

- **Duration of Withdrawal:**  
  - Begins on the day the Order is made  
  - Ends on **September 30, 2008**  
  - This time-bound withdrawal ensures that the lands remain protected and not subject to commercial exploitation during the negotiation and settlement phase of the agreement.

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exceptions):**

Despite the broad withdrawal of land from disposal, **certain activities and transactions are explicitly excluded** from being affected by this Order. These exclusions ensure continuity in existing rights and legal processes:

1. **Mineral Prospecting Permits (pre-existing):**  
   - A person who holds a prospecting permit issued **before** the Order comes into force may still locate a mineral claim.

2. **Existing Recorded Mineral Claims:**  
   - Claims that were already recorded or located prior to the Order are not affected.

3. **Leasing of Recorded Claims:**  
   - A lease under the *Canada Mining Regulations* can be granted to a person with a recorded claim, even if the lease covers part of the withdrawn area.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (pre-existing exploration):**  
   - A significant discovery licence can be issued to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before** the Order, provided the licence covers the same area as the exploration licence.

5. **Production Licences (pre-existing):**  
   - Production licences can be issued to holders of exploration or significant discovery licences issued **before** the Order, as long as the area is subject to the prior licence.

6. **Surface Leases for Operational Needs:**  
   - A surface lease can be granted to a claim holder to allow them to exercise rights under their claim or interest (e.g., for access to conduct operations), even if the land is withdrawn.

7. **Renewal of Interests:**  
   - Renewals of mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are not affected by the withdrawal.

> ✅ These exceptions preserve existing rights and ongoing operations, ensuring that the withdrawal does not disrupt existing legal or commercial arrangements.
