### **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Moldova) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Rationale**

The **Special Economic Measures (Moldova) Regulations** were enacted by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, in response to a declared **grave breach of international peace and security** in the **Republic of Moldova**. This situation is characterized as having either already occurred or being likely to result in a **serious international crisis**—particularly concerning violations of **sovereignty and territorial integrity** of Moldova or Ukraine, or obstruction of international organizations operating in these regions.

This regulatory action is grounded in Canada’s **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**, specifically under subsections:
- 4(1)a  
- (1.1)b  
- (2)c  
- (3)

These provisions empower the Governor in Council to impose economic sanctions on individuals, entities, or organizations involved in activities undermining peace, security, or the sovereignty of other states.
