| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|

### **3. Reporting Requirements and Flexibility**

#### **a. Telephone Reporting for Certain Cases**
- A **sex offender whose primary residence is in the Northwest Territories** may fulfill certain reporting obligations **by telephone**.
- Specifically, this applies to:
  - **Paragraph 4.1(a) or (b)** of the Act — which typically relate to initial registration and updates of personal information (e.g., address, contact details, changes in status).
  - **Section 4.3** — which may involve updates to registration details after a change in circumstances.
  - **Section 6** — which requires notification of certain events (e.g., relocation, release from custody, or change in employment).

> This provision provides **practical accessibility**, allowing individuals to report without needing to travel to a registration center, especially in remote or rural areas where in-person visits may be difficult.

#### **b. In-Person Reporting Remains Mandatory**
- Despite the allowance for telephone reporting, **subsection (1) does not eliminate the requirement to report in person** under **paragraph 4.1(c)** of the Act.
- Paragraph 4.1(c) likely refers to **specific types of reporting**, such as:
  - Reporting of new criminal convictions involving sex offences.
  - Certain mandatory registration updates (e.g., after a change in legal status or release from prison).
- This ensures **compliance with the core principle of accountability** and maintains a requirement for direct, verifiable reporting to prevent potential fraud or non-compliance.

> **Conclusion**: The regulations balance accessibility with accountability — allowing phone-based reporting for routine updates, while preserving in-person reporting for critical, legally significant events.

### **4. Authorization to Collect and Register Information**

#### **a. RCMP Officers**
- Every **member of the RCMP** operating within the Northwest Territories is **authorized to collect information** related to sex offenders for the purposes of the Act.
- This includes gathering data during routine law enforcement activities (e.g., investigations, arrests, or evaluations of risk).

#### **b. NWTSOIRC Staff**
- Any person whose **duties include the registration of information** at the NWTSOIRC is authorized to **register information** for the purposes of the Act.
- This ensures that only trained and designated personnel can process and record data, maintaining **data integrity and compliance** with privacy and security standards.

> These provisions ensure that information collection and registration are carried out by **authorized, accountable, and properly trained individuals**, reducing the risk of errors or misuse.

---

### **5. Designation of Registration Centres**

#### **a. RCMP Detachments as Registration Centres**
- Each **RCMP detachment** in the Northwest Territories is officially designated as a **registration centre**.
- The **area of service** for each detachment is defined as the **geographic area it serves** (e.g., the community or region where the detachment operates).

> This decentralizes access to registration services, enabling individuals to report to the local RCMP office nearest to them — improving convenience and community engagement.

#### **b. NWTSOIRC as Central Registration Centre**
- The **NWTSOIRC in Yellowknife** is designated as a **central registration centre**.
- Its **designated area of service is the entire Northwest Territories**.
- This means that:
  - All sex offenders in the NWT can submit reports to the NWTSOIRC.
  - The centre acts as a **central repository** for all sex offender data, ensuring consistency and coordination across the territory.

> This dual structure — local detachments for day-to-day reporting and the central NWTSOIRC for data aggregation and oversight — supports both **local accessibility** and **territorial-wide data management**.

### **6. Effective Date and Implementation**

- These regulations come into force on the **later of two dates**:
  1. The date on which the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (S.C. 2004, c. 10) comes into force.
  2. The date on which these regulations are officially **registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

- The regulations were **registered on December 14, 2004**, and the Act came into force earlier, so the final effective date was **December 21, 2004**.

> This phased implementation ensures that all legal and administrative systems are fully prepared before enforcement begins.
