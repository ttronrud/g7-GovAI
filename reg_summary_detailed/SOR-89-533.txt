---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Miawpukek Band Order* (SOR/84-501), published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on July 10, 1984, is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Indian Act*. It formally **revokes an earlier Order in Council (P.C. 1984-2273)** and establishes a new, legally recognized **Indigenous band** in Newfoundland — the **Miawpukek Band** — at the community of **Conne River**.

This Order is significant because it provides a formal, statutory recognition of a distinct Indigenous community under the *Indian Act*, defining its membership, status, and identity in accordance with federal legislation.

### **Legal Authority**

The Order was made by:
- **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**,  
on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**,  
pursuant to:
  - **Subsection 73(3)** of the *Indian Act*, which allows the Governor General to make orders to define or re-define bands;
  - **Paragraph (c) of the definition of "band" in subsection 2(1)** of the *Indian Act*, which defines a band as a body of Indians who are connected by descent, residence, or other ties and who are recognized under the Act.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### 1. **Revocation of Previous Order**
- The Order **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1984-2273**, dated June 28, 1984, which had previously attempted to define or recognize a band in Conne River.
- This revocation is necessary to establish a new, more accurate, and legally sound definition of the Miawpukek Band.

#### 2. **Establishment of the Miawpukek Band**
- The body of Indians described in **Section 3** of the Order — commonly known as the **Conne River Indian Band** — is now officially recognized as a **band under the Indian Act**.
- The band is to be known as:
  - **"Miawpukek Mi’Kamawey Mawio’mi"** (in full, using the traditional name in the Miawpukek language),
  - or more commonly as the **"Miawpukek Band"** (in abbreviated form).

> *Note:* The name "Miawpukek" is derived from the Miawpukek First Nation's traditional language and reflects the cultural identity of the community.

#### 3. **Definition of Membership**

The Miawpukek Band consists of every person who meets **all of the following criteria**:

1. **Canadian Indian Ancestry**  
   – The person must be of **Canadian Indian ancestry** (i.e., descent from a recognized Indigenous person in Canada).

2. **Not Excluded by Section 7 of the Indian Act**  
   – The person must **not be excluded** from registration as an Indian under **Section 7** of the *Indian Act*, which may exclude individuals based on factors such as being born outside the band or having certain types of non-Indigenous parentage.

3. **Residency or Lineage Criteria (Key Condition)**  
   The person must satisfy **one of the following**:
   - Was **ordinarily resident** in the community of **Conne River, Newfoundland**, on **June 28, 1984**; **OR**
   - Is the **child or sibling** of a person who met the above criteria (i.e., was ordinarily resident in Conne River on June 28, 1984); **OR**
   - Is the **child of a sibling** of a person who met the above criteria.

> This establishes a **lineage-based** and **residency-based** membership framework, allowing for inclusion of descendants of residents even if they were born or raised elsewhere.

#### 4. **Residency Exception Clause (Section 3(c))**

A critical provision allows for **exceptions to the residency requirement** under the following conditions:

> A person shall be considered to have been **ordinarily resident** in Conne River on June 28, 1984 **if**:
- They were **absent from the community on that date** due to:
  - **Health reasons**, or  
  - **Education**, **OR**
- Were absent for a **period not exceeding 12 months** during the period from **June 28, 1983, to June 28, 1984**,  
  **and would have been ordinarily resident** in the community **but for that absence**.

> This provision ensures that individuals who were temporarily displaced due to illness or schooling are not excluded from band membership simply because they were not physically present on the specific date.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Formal Recognition**: The Order legally recognizes the Miawpukek Band as a distinct Indigenous community under federal law, providing it with rights and responsibilities under the *Indian Act*.
