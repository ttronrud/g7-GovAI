**Detailed Summary of the Non-Public Funds Staff Regulations**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation is a formal administrative instrument issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission) to address the unique nature and operational requirements of certain positions within the **Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces**.

The core rationale for these regulations stems from a determination by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** that:

- It is **not practicable** (i.e., operationally feasible or administratively viable)  
- And **not in the best interests of the Public Service**  
  to apply the provisions of the **Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** to employees of the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces.

The Staff of the Non-Public Funds refers to personnel who work in support roles within the Canadian Armed Forces but are not part of the regular public service payroll. These individuals typically serve in non-public fund roles—meaning their salaries and benefits are not funded through the federal public service budget, and they are not subject to the same employment standards, processes, or oversight as regular public service employees.

Given this exclusion, the PSC concluded that it was desirable to establish **specific rules** governing the appointment, employment, and management of these personnel. This leads to the creation of the **Non-Public Funds Staff Regulations**, which provide a clear, legally binding framework for how such positions are managed.

### **Legal Authority**

The regulation is enacted under two specific provisions of the **Public Service Employment Act**:

1. **Section 39** – Allows the Governor in Council to approve the **exclusion** of certain positions and employees from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act, based on recommendations from the Public Service Commission.

2. **Subsection 35(1)** – Grants the Minister of National Defence the authority to **appoint individuals** to the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces, in accordance with the regulations.

These provisions ensure that the regulation is both legally sound and operationally justified.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### 1. **Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act**
- All positions and employees of the **Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces** are **exempted** from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act.
- This means that standard public service employment rules—such as those governing recruitment, promotion, collective bargaining, job classification, pay scales, performance evaluations, and disciplinary procedures—do **not apply** to these employees.
- The exclusion is **specific and targeted**, applying only to those individuals and roles within the Staff of the Non-Public Funds.

> *Note: This exclusion is not a blanket dismissal of public service standards but a recognition that these roles have distinct operational, security, and military needs that differ from those of the regular public service.*

#### 2. **Appointing Authority**
- The **Minister of National Defence** has the sole authority to appoint individuals to the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces.
- The Minister may appoint "such persons as he deems proper," which implies discretion based on:
  - Operational requirements
  - Military or strategic needs
  - Technical or administrative expertise
  - Availability of qualified candidates

> This authority allows flexibility in staffing decisions, which is essential in a dynamic, mission-driven environment like the Canadian Forces.

#### 3. **Scope of Application**
- These regulations **only apply** to individuals who fall under the scope of the **Non-Public Funds Staff Exclusion Approval Order**.
- They do not extend to:
  - Regular public service employees
  - Employees of public funds (i.e., those funded through the federal public service budget)
  - Personnel in other branches of government or civilian departments

### **Key Implications and Outcomes**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Employment Standards** | Employees in these roles are not subject to public service employment standards (e.g., pay equity, grievance procedures, collective agreements). |
| **Recruitment Process** | Appointment is not governed by public service hiring processes (e.g., open competition, public advertisements, or merit-based selection under PSEA). |
| **Accountability and Oversight** | Oversight of these staff members is conducted through the Department of National Defence, not through the Public Service Commission or Public Service Employment Board. |
| **Flexibility** | The Minister of National Defence can respond quickly to changing military or operational needs without being constrained by public service bureaucratic processes. |
| **Separation of Functions** | This regulation reinforces the distinction between the civilian public service and the military, recognizing that the Canadian Forces operate under different governance, funding, and personnel frameworks. |

### **Naming and Citation**

The regulations are officially titled:  
**The Non-Public Funds Staff Regulations**  
And may be cited as such in legal and administrative contexts.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Non-Public Funds Staff Regulations** serve as a critical piece of administrative law that:

- Legally and formally excludes the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces from the Public Service Employment Act,  
- Grants the Minister of National Defence broad discretion in appointing personnel to these roles,  
- Recognizes the unique operational, strategic, and security requirements of the Canadian Forces,  
- Ensures that staffing decisions in these areas remain agile and responsive to military needs.

This regulation reflects a pragmatic balance between maintaining public service integrity and respecting the distinct nature of military service and non-public fund operations.

**Final Note**: While the exclusion from public service employment rules may raise questions about equity or transparency, it is justified under the principle that certain specialized, mission-critical roles—particularly within national defense—require flexibility and operational autonomy that cannot be provided under standard public service employment frameworks.
