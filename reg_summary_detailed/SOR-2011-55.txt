Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, the *Security Interest (GST/HST) Regulations*, as made under section 277a of the *Excise Tax Act*:

### **Regulation Summary: Security Interest (GST/HST) Regulations**  
**Enacted by:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance  
**Authority:** Section 277a of the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. E-15)  
**Regulation Citation:** S.C. 1993, c. 27, s. 125(1)  
**Effective Date:** October 20, 2000  

---

## **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and limit the scope of a "prescribed security interest"** in the context of amounts that are deemed to be held in trust under subsection 222(1) of the *Excise Tax Act*. This applies specifically to amounts that are considered to be in trust for Her Majesty (the Crown) due to the nature of certain tax obligations related to Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST).

This regulation ensures that **only certain types of security interests** (specifically, registered mortgages or hypothecs) qualify as "prescribed security interests" for the purpose of protecting the Crown’s interest in trust-held amounts, and that such interests are **appropriately capped** to prevent undue retention or benefit by secured creditors.

## **2. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

### **Definition of "Act"**
- "Act" refers to the *Excise Tax Act* (R.S., c. E-15), which governs GST/HST collection, administration, and related financial obligations.

---

## **3. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Security Interest"?**

A **prescribed security interest** is defined for the purpose of **subsection 222(4)** of the *Excise Tax Act* as follows:

> *"That part of a mortgage or hypothec securing the performance of an obligation of the person that encumbers land or a building, but only if the mortgage or hypothec is registered pursuant to the appropriate land registration system before the time the amount is deemed under subsection 222(1) of the Act to be held in trust by the person."*

### **Key Conditions:**
- The security interest must be a **mortgage or hypothec** (a form of secured loan or lien).
- It must **secure an obligation** (such as a debt or financial liability) of the person.
- It must **encumber land or a building** (i.e., real property).
- The mortgage or hypothec must be **registered in the appropriate land registration system** **prior to** the time when the amount is deemed to be held in trust under subsection 222(1) of the Act.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If the mortgage or hypothec is not registered before the trust arises, it does **not** qualify as a prescribed security interest.

## **4. Limitation on the Amount of Prescribed Security Interest**

If, at a particular time, an amount deemed to be held in trust under subsection 222(1) of the Act has **not been remitted to the Receiver General** or **withdrawn in the required manner and timing** (as specified in Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*), then the **maximum amount** of the prescribed security interest is **limited** by the following formula:

> **Maximum prescribed security interest =**  
> (Outstanding amount of the obligation at the particular time)  
> −  
> (Total of:  
>  (i) All rights of the secured creditor (including guarantees, set-offs, or compensation rights), **adjusted for the circumstances**, including the existence of the deemed trust for the Crown; **excluding** the mortgage or hypothec itself; and  
>  (ii) All amounts applied after the particular time on account of the obligation)

### **Explanation of Formula:**
- The **outstanding obligation** is the base amount due.
- The **secured creditor's rights** (e.g., guarantees, rights of set-off) are included in the total, but only to the extent they exist and are recognized at the time.
- The **"adjusted" value** of these rights must reflect the fact that a portion of the amount is now held in trust for the Crown.
- **Amounts applied after the particular time** (e.g., payments made later) are subtracted to prevent overvaluation of the security interest.

> This formula ensures that the security interest does **not exceed** the value of the obligation minus the creditor's other rights and any payments already made.

---

## **5. Inclusion of Insurance or Expropriation Proceeds**

A prescribed security interest **includes**:
- The amount of **insurance proceeds** or **expropriation proceeds** (e.g., from government seizure or land acquisition) relating to land or a building that is subject to a **registered mortgage or hypothec**.

### **Adjustment Requirement:**
- These proceeds must be **adjusted in accordance with subsection (2)** of the regulation (which is not fully detailed here but implies a valuation method based on market value, timing, and other relevant factors).

> This ensures that proceeds from real property events (like insurance claims) are not used to support a security interest that exceeds the trust amount.

## **6. Exclusions from Prescribed Security Interest**

The following **do not** constitute a prescribed security interest under this regulation:

| Excluded Interest | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| **Lien** | A general claim against property, not tied to a registered mortgage or hypothec. |
| **Priority** | A claim of precedence over other creditors, not a specific security interest. |
| **Security interest created by statute** | Statutory rights (e.g., under other laws) that are not tied to land or building mortgages. |
| **Assignment or hypothec of rents or leases** | Rights over rental income, which may be separated from land or building. |
| **Mortgage or hypothecary right in equipment or fixtures** | If the equipment or fixtures can be **removed or disposed of separately** from the land or building. |

> This exclusion ensures that only **real property-based, registered security interests** that are tied to land or buildings are considered, and that interests in movable or separable assets are excluded.

## **7. Key Legal Principles and Implications**

### ✅ **Trust for the Crown**
- When a person is deemed to have a trust obligation under subsection 222(1) of the Act (e.g., due to a tax liability), a portion of their financial obligations is treated as being held in trust for Her Majesty.
- This creates a **priority interest** in the person’s assets, especially in the context of secured transactions.

### ✅ **Protection of Tax Revenue**
- The regulation prevents secured creditors from claiming more than their legally allowed share of trust-held funds.
- It ensures that **tax revenue is not diluted** by excessive security interests in trust amounts.

### ✅ **Timing of Registration Matters**
- The **registration of the mortgage or hypothec before the trust arises** is a critical requirement. This ensures that the Crown’s interest in the trust is properly recognized and protected.

## **8. Regulatory Effect and Enforcement**

- These regulations are **deemed to have come into force on October 20, 2000**.
- They apply to all transactions involving land or buildings where a mortgage or hypothec is registered and where amounts are deemed to be held in trust under the *Excise Tax Act*.
- The rules are enforceable by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and relevant tax authorities.

## **9. Summary of Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Applicable Context** | Amounts deemed to be held in trust under subsection 222(1) of the Excise Tax Act |
| **Eligible Security Interest** | Registered mortgage or hypothec on land or building, registered **before** the trust arises |
| **Maximum Amount** | Limited by a formula involving outstanding obligation, secured creditor rights, and payments made after the trust arises |
| **Includes** | Insurance/expropriation proceeds from land/building, adjusted appropriately |
| **Excludes** | Lien, statutory rights, lease or rent rights, equipment/fixture interests that can be removed separately |
| **Objective** | To protect Crown’s interest in trust-held amounts and prevent overreaching by secured creditors |

---

## **Conclusion**

The *Security Interest (GST/HST) Regulations* serve as a **critical safeguard** in the tax administration framework, ensuring that when amounts are deemed to be held in trust for Her Majesty (due to tax obligations), **only legitimate, registered, and properly limited security interests** can be claimed by creditors. The regulation balances the rights of secured parties with the need to protect public revenue, particularly in real estate transactions involving GST/HST liabilities.

It reflects a careful legislative approach to **property rights, trust obligations, and tax equity**, and is an essential component of the broader framework for enforcing tax compliance in Canada.
