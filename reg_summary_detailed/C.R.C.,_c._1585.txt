#### 📚 Summary of What Was Originally Intended (Pre-Revocation)

Before revocation, the regulations would have governed:

1. **Eligibility for Treatment and Care**  
   - Covered individuals (veterans or "qualified persons") could receive medical examination, treatment, or care.
   - "Dependants" included:
     - Spouses
     - Children (under 21, living with or maintained by the veteran)
     - Parents or guardians of children, if unable to support themselves
     - A person who assumes household duties (e.g., after a spouse's death)

2. **Definition of "Veteran"**  
   - Covered service in:
     - World War I or World War II (naval, army, air forces)
     - Post-1950 service in the "special force" (e.g., Canadian Special Operations)
     - Reserve forces serving in theatres of operations
   - This broadened eligibility beyond just active-duty service.

3. **Spousal Recognition**  
   - A person may be recognized as a spouse if:
     - They lived with and publicly represented the veteran as spouse for **3 years**, where marriage is otherwise prohibited (e.g., due to prior marriage)
     - For **1 year** if neither party is prohibited from marrying

4. **Interest on Funds**  
   - The Minister could authorize interest on:
     - Trust funds held by the Department
     - Allowances or payments due to veterans
   - Interest only applies if funds are held for **at least 3 months**
   - **No interest** on funds held due to failure to claim or notify address — **unless** the veteran or qualified person is physically or mentally incapable

5. **Death Benefits and Estate Treatment**  
   - Upon death, any **credit balance** from awards under these regulations:
     - Does **not** form part of the veteran’s estate
     - May be paid to:
       - A dependant
       - A person who maintained the veteran
       - Toward last sickness or funeral expenses (if not fully covered by public funds)
     - This provision was designed to ensure financial support for dependents and families

### Final Answer:
> The Veterans Treatment Regulations have been **fully revoked** by SOR/90-595, section 1. As such, **no part of the regulation is currently in force**. The definitions and provisions outlined (such as "veteran," "dependant," "pension," and treatment entitlements) are **no longer valid legal authorities**. The regulation was replaced by updated federal policies and legislation under Veterans Affairs Canada. Any reference to these rules must be treated as historical or obsolete.
