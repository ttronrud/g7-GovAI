**Detailed Summary of the Pitt Meadows Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled:  
**"Pitt Meadows Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development in the vicinity of **Pitt Meadows Airport**, located within the **Corporation of the District of Pitt Meadows, British Columbia**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation introduces several technical definitions essential to understanding its scope and application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Pitt Meadows Airport**, administered by the District of Pitt Meadows. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precisely defined geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is located **929.07 feet northeasterly from and at right angles to the centerline of runway 07R–25L**, and **500 feet northwesterly from and at right angles to the centerline of runway 18–36**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), perpendicular to its centerline. It is defined in **Part III of the Schedule** and ensures safe aircraft approach paths by restricting vertical obstructions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface located above and around the airport, extending beyond the runways and approach areas. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**, it defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object in the broader airport vicinity. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including runways. Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**. Each runway has a corresponding strip. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. It provides a buffer zone to prevent obstructions near the sides of runways. Defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**. |

> **Note**: For regulatory purposes, the **airport reference point is deemed to be 9 feet above sea level**, even though actual elevation may vary.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
- All **land and underwater areas** (including public road allowances)  
- Located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Pitt Meadows Airport**  
- Within the **outer limits defined in Part II of the Schedule**  
- **Excluding** land that is formally part of the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated operational zones)

This means that any development or construction in the surrounding area must comply with the height restrictions set by the regulation.

---

### **4. Prohibited Development**

No person may:
- Erect or construct  
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object  

**On any land or underwater area covered by these regulations**, if the **highest point** of the proposed object would exceed any of the following surfaces at the point of location:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> These surfaces are defined geometrically in the schedule and represent safe zones for aircraft operations. Exceeding them poses a risk to flight safety.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

If a **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, or vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the height of any of the defined surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazardous obstructions during aircraft operations.

---

### **6. Legal Status and Revocation**

> **Note**: The regulation contains a note stating: *"Revoked, SOR/81-201, s. 1"*  
This indicates that **the regulation was formally revoked** by **Statutory Order 81-201, Section 1**, and thus **is no longer in force**.

> This is a critical point: **The Pitt Meadows Airport Zoning Regulations as presented are currently invalid or obsolete** under B.C. law.

---

### **7. Geographic Boundaries (Part II of Schedule)**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed **legal description** (a chain of coordinates and boundaries) that traces a perimeter around the airport. Key elements include:

- Starting at the **northeast corner of Section 15, Block 6 North, Range 1 East of the Coast Meridian**  
- Proceeding through various roads and lots (e.g., Reichenback Road, Rippington Road, Harris Road, Dewdney Trunk Road, 124th Avenue, 118th Avenue, etc.)  
- Crossing major roads and boundaries of private properties  
- Ending at a point near **Lot 65, District Lot 263, Group One, Plan 38722**  
- Continuing southward through several lots and streets (e.g., Powell Avenue, Gordon Avenue, Chatwin Avenue, 123rd Avenue, 115th Avenue, Eltham and Wanstead Streets, Lorne Street, Charlton Street, Princess Street, etc.)

> This boundary effectively defines the **zoning envelope** around the airport where height restrictions apply.

---

### **8. Purpose and Intent**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To **ensure flight safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach  
- To **protect the operational integrity** of Pitt Meadows Airport  
- To **prevent unauthorized construction** that could interfere with aircraft navigation or visibility  
- To provide **clear, enforceable height limits** for all structures and natural features within a defined zone

---

### **9. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth  
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions  
- The regulations are **subject to provincial jurisdiction**, meaning enforcement is under the authority of the Ministry of Transportation.

### **10. Important Legal and Practical Notes**

| Point | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| ❌ **Outdated Status** | The regulation has been **revoked by SOR/81-201, Section 1**. It is **no longer valid law**. Any attempt to enforce it would be legally invalid. |

| 📚 **Schedule References** | The detailed descriptions in Parts I–VI of the schedule are critical for understanding the spatial and geometric constraints, but their current legal enforceability is nullified by revocation. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Pitt Meadows Airport Zoning Regulations** were designed to establish **strict height restrictions** around the airport to ensure flight safety. However, they have been **formally revoked** under Statutory Order SOR/81-201, Section 1. As such:
