**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Excluding Certain Government Ships from the Application of the Canada Shipping Act"**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

This regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **subsection 6(2)a of the Canada Shipping Act**. This provision grants the Governor General the authority to make regulations that exclude certain vessels from the full application of the Canada Shipping Act, particularly when those vessels serve a government function and are managed by a federal department.

The regulation is formally published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1998, Chapter 16, Section 3.

---

**Key Definitions:**

- **"Canadian Coast Guard ship"** is defined as a vessel that is **entrusted for management or operation to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)**.  
  This includes ships operated under the authority of the Canadian Coast Guard (a division of DFO) for purposes such as search and rescue, marine safety, environmental protection, and maritime surveillance.

**Exclusions from the Canada Shipping Act:**

The following specific sections of the Canada Shipping Act are **exempted from application** to Canadian Coast Guard ships:

1. **Section 110 – Regulations respecting certification of masters and seamen**  
   - This provision governs the certification and licensing of ship masters and seamen.  
   - *Exemption*: Canadian Coast Guard ships are not required to comply with the standard certification requirements for masters and seamen under this section.  
   - *Rationale*: Given the specialized nature of Coast Guard operations (e.g., emergency response, law enforcement), the standard certification framework may not be appropriate or practical.

2. **Section 130 – Production of certificates**  
   - This section mandates the issuance and maintenance of official certificates (e.g., for vessel safety, equipment, and crew qualifications).  
   - *Exemption*: Canadian Coast Guard vessels are not required to produce or maintain these certificates as required by the Act.  
   - *Rationale*: The Coast Guard operates under a different regulatory framework focused on operational effectiveness and national security rather than commercial certification.

3. **Section 231 – Regulations respecting crew accommodation**  
   - This section sets standards for the living conditions and accommodations provided to crew members.  
   - *Exemption*: The requirement for specific crew accommodation standards (such as sleeping quarters, ventilation, sanitation) does not apply to Canadian Coast Guard ships.  
   - *Rationale*: Coast Guard vessels often operate in remote or hazardous environments, and their crew may be temporarily assigned or stationed in non-standard conditions.

4. **Section 232 – Regulations giving effect to international labour conventions**  
   - This section requires compliance with international labour standards (such as those from the International Labour Organization) regarding working hours, rest periods, and crew welfare.  
   - *Exemption*: Canadian Coast Guard ships are not subject to these international labour standards.  
   - *Rationale*: These standards are typically designed for commercial shipping and long-term crew employment; Coast Guard operations are often short-term, mission-driven, and involve unique operational demands.

5. **Section 274 – Leaving port in default**  
   - This section outlines penalties and procedures when a vessel fails to comply with port regulations or fails to report or leave a port as required.  
   - *Exemption*: Canadian Coast Guard ships are not subject to penalties or enforcement actions under this section if they fail to comply with port requirements.  
   - *Rationale*: The Coast Guard operates with flexibility in port operations due to its emergency and national security mandates, and rigid enforcement could hinder timely response.

6. **Sections 389 and 390 – Regulations respecting dangerous goods (in so far as they relate to the carriage of aviation fuel)**  
   - These sections regulate the carriage of dangerous goods, including the handling, storage, and transport of hazardous materials.  
   - *Exemption*: The provisions related to the carriage of **aviation fuel** are excluded.  
   - *Rationale*: Aviation fuel is a specialized cargo with unique handling and safety requirements. The Coast Guard may carry aviation fuel for emergency or operational purposes (e.g., supporting remote airfields), and the standard dangerous goods regulations may not be suitable or practical in such contexts. The exemption allows for operational flexibility in these specific cases.

**Effective Date:**

These regulations come into force on **February 25, 2000**.

---

**Purpose and Rationale:**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to **recognize the unique operational, mission-specific, and non-commercial nature of Canadian Coast Guard vessels**. Unlike commercial ships, Coast Guard ships:

- Operate in emergency and crisis situations;
- Serve national security and public safety functions;
- Often operate in remote or extreme environments;
- May have temporary or rotating crews;
- Are not engaged in commercial trade or profit-driven operations.

Therefore, applying the full scope of the Canada Shipping Act—designed primarily for commercial shipping—would create unnecessary administrative burdens, operational delays, and regulatory inconsistencies.

By exempting these specific provisions, the regulation enables the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to manage Coast Guard vessels with greater flexibility, responsiveness, and efficiency while still ensuring safety and compliance in areas where applicable.

---

**Limitations and Scope:**

- The exemptions apply **only** to Canadian Coast Guard ships entrusted to DFO.
- The exemptions are **specific and limited** to the listed sections and subsections.
- The regulation does **not** exempt Coast Guard ships from all safety or operational standards—only from the specified provisions of the Canada Shipping Act.
- The exemptions do **not** extend to other government ships (e.g., military vessels) or to commercial vessels.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a targeted and necessary exemption that allows the Canadian Coast Guard to operate effectively in its core mission areas—maritime safety, search and rescue, environmental protection, and national security—without being constrained by commercial shipping regulations. It reflects a balanced approach to regulation: ensuring public safety and operational effectiveness while recognizing the distinct characteristics of government-operated vessels.

It remains a key piece of regulatory policy that supports the adaptability and responsiveness of Canada’s maritime emergency and public service fleet.
