## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Marine Machinery Regulations (C.R.C., c. 6 (3rd Supp.))**

### 📌 **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The regulation serves to **revise and replace** four outdated and obsolete sets of rules:
- *Liquefied Petroleum Gas Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1437*
- *Steamship Machinery Construction Order, C.R.C., c. 1490*
- *Steamship Machinery Construction Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1491*
- *Steamship Machinery Inspection Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1492*

These are **revoked and replaced** by the new **Marine Machinery Regulations**, which provide modern, comprehensive, and safety-focused standards for:
- The **construction**
- **Installation**
- **Inspection**
of marine machinery on Canadian-registered ships.

This update ensures alignment with current international maritime safety standards and technological advancements in shipboard systems.

> **Legal Authority**: Section 338 of the *Canada Shipping Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council to issue or amend regulations concerning marine machinery.

| **Test Pressure** | Maximum pressure applied during inspection (higher than design pressure) |
| **Unfired Pressure Vessel** | Container under pressure without direct heating (e.g., condensers, accumulators) |
| **Windlass** | Machinery for raising/lowering ship anchors (excludes anchors and cables) |
| **Length** | Measured differently depending on vessel type: <br> - Passenger ships: between perpendiculars at deepest load line <br> - Other ships: from stem to stern post or rudder stock; for double-ended ships, between rudder stocks |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Several terms were **repealed** by *SOR/2021-135*, including "inspection certificate," "inspector," "pressure vessel," "local/remote steering gear control system," and "periodic inspections." These are no longer in force.

### 📌 **4. Scope and Applicability**

#### ✅ Applies to:
- All ships **required to be registered under the Canada Shipping Act** (Part XV of the Act)

#### ❌ Does NOT Apply to:
- **Pleasure yachts** (except for specific cases)
- **Non-passenger, non-self-propelled ships**

#### Exceptions:
1. **Pleasure yachts**:
   - If **gross tonnage exceeds 5 tons**, and they have **propulsion system boilers** → regulations apply.

2. **Non-passenger, non-self-propelled ships**:
   - If the vessel:
     - Operates **more than 15 miles from land**, **OR**
     - Does **not operate more than 15 miles from land** AND has:
       - Boilers or compressed air receivers with **assigned working pressure > 103 kPa**

> ⚠️ **Exception Note**: The regulations **do not apply** to vessels covered by the *Vessel Construction and Equipment Regulations*.

---

### 📌 **5. Construction and Installation Standards**

#### General Principle:
Any machinery listed in **Schedules I to XV** must be constructed and installed according to:
1. **Rules or codes** issued by an **approved classification society** at the time of construction.
2. **Design specifications** from:
   - Part I of the applicable schedule (I–XV)
   - General design specifications in **Schedule XVI**

#### Priority Rule:
- If there is **inconsistency** between the rules/codes and the design specifications in the schedules, **the design specifications prevail**.

#### Flexibility for Existing Machinery:
- Machinery constructed **before or after** the regulation’s coming into force can be **repaired or reinstalled** in accordance with:
  - The standards **in force at the time of repair** (not necessarily original standards)

> ⚠️ **Exception**: If major repairs are **impractical or inappropriate**, they may be carried out using standards from the **original construction era** (i.e., rules in force when machinery was first built).

### 📌 **6. Material Testing Requirements**

#### Mandatory Steps:
1. **Specimen Testing**:
   - Any material used in construction or repair must have **specimen pieces tested** before installation.
