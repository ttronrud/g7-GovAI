### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **grant an exemption from the need for prior regulatory approval** when a **life insurance company** or an **insurance holding company** acquires control of, or increases a substantial investment in, a **service entity** that operates within its corporate group — provided that the entity’s financial intermediary activities are strictly limited to serving the parent company or its group members.

This exemption aims to:  
- Promote operational efficiency and flexibility within insurance groups.  
- Allow life companies and insurance holding companies to better manage internal services (e.g., claims processing, underwriting support, IT, administration) without being burdened by the approval process for internal transactions.  
- Reduce regulatory friction while maintaining safeguards against excessive risk exposure.

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Exemption for Life Companies (Section 495(7) and (8) of the Insurance Companies Act)**  
- **Applicable scenario:** A life company’s acquisition of control of, or an increase in a substantial investment in, an entity referred to in **paragraph 495(6)(b)** of the Act.  
- **Condition for exemption:** The financial intermediary activities of the entity (those that expose it to material market or credit risk) must be **limited exclusively to providing services to the life company or to members of the life company’s group**.  
- **Result:** Under this provision, such transactions **do not require prior approval** from the Superintendent of Financial Services, as long as the entity’s activities are strictly internal and risk-constrained.

> *Example:* A life company may acquire a claims processing entity that only serves its own policies and group subsidiaries — no external clients — and this transaction would be exempt from approval.

#### 2. **Exemption for Insurance Holding Companies (Section 971(5) and (971(6)) of the Insurance Companies Act)**  
- **Applicable scenario:** An insurance holding company’s acquisition of control of, or an increase in a substantial investment in, an entity referred to in **paragraph 971(4)(b)** of the Act.  
- **Condition for exemption:** The financial intermediary activities of the entity must be **limited exclusively to providing services to the insurance holding company or to members of its group**.  
- **Result:** These transactions are **exempt from the requirement for prior approval**, provided the service entity operates only within the group and does not engage in external financial intermediation.

> *Example:* An insurance holding company may invest in a centralized IT service provider that supports only its subsidiaries and does not offer services to external clients — such a transaction would not require regulatory approval.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- The exemption applies **only to service entities** that are part of the corporate group (i.e., intragroup entities).  
- The exemption **does not apply** if the entity provides financial intermediary services to **external parties** — particularly those involving exposure to material market or credit risk.  
- The definition of “financial intermediary activities” includes activities such as lending, investing, underwriting, or other financial operations that carry risk.  
- The exemption is **conditional** on exclusivity: the entity must serve **only** the parent company or its group members.  
- The exemption does **not extend** to investments in entities that are not service-oriented or that engage in external financial activities.

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.  
- This means that the exemption becomes active immediately upon official publication, allowing companies to begin applying the provisions without delay.

### **Regulatory Context and Significance**

- This regulation reflects a broader trend in financial regulation toward **flexibility in intragroup transactions**, especially in the insurance sector, where operational efficiency and cost-sharing among subsidiaries are critical.  
- It balances the need for **risk management** with the practical realities of large, complex insurance groups.  
- By limiting the scope of risk exposure (to only internal services), the regulator ensures that the exemption does not lead to systemic or market-wide risks.  
- It reinforces the principle that **internal group services** should not be subject to the same scrutiny as external financial activities.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations provide a clear, risk-based exemption from the requirement for prior approval for life companies and insurance holding companies to invest in or acquire control of service entities within their corporate groups — **provided** that the entities' financial intermediary activities are strictly limited to serving internal group members. This promotes operational efficiency, reduces administrative burdens, and maintains regulatory oversight by ensuring that only non-risk-exposed, internal services are exempted.

The regulation is a key tool in enabling effective internal governance and service integration within the Canadian insurance sector, while upholding financial stability and risk controls.
