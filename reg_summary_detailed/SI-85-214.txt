**Detailed Summary of the Government and Long-Term Corporate Debt Obligation Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Government and Long-Term Corporate Debt Obligation Remission Order* (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4) is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act**, specifically **section 17**, by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council. It was enacted to address a specific tax issue related to the treatment of interest income from government and long-term corporate debt obligations, particularly in the context of a legislative technical error involving the year "1986" in the *Income Tax Act*.

This Order provides for the **remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of certain income taxes** that were or would have been payable by non-resident individuals and entities in respect of interest received from government or long-term corporate debt instruments. The remission is granted based on a comparison of tax liabilities under two hypothetical scenarios: one based on the original provisions of the Act (using "1986") and another where the reference to "1986" is read as "1987."

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order was introduced to correct a technical inconsistency in the *Income Tax Act* that affected the taxation of interest income from debt obligations. Specifically, certain tax rules in Part XIII of the Act (which governs the taxation of interest income from debt) contained references to the year **1986**, which may have led to an overstatement of tax liability for non-residents when calculating tax on interest payments.

By adjusting the reference from "1986" to "1987," the government effectively reduces the tax liability for interest income under these provisions. The remission Order allows taxpayers to recover the difference between the tax they would have paid under the original rule (1986) and the tax that would have been due under a corrected version (1987), thereby correcting what is considered a **non-intentional overtaxation**.

This action is justified as being in the **public interest**, as it ensures fairness and consistency in the tax treatment of interest income from government and corporate debt, particularly for non-resident entities that were not at fault for the legislative error.

### **Key Provisions and Scope**

#### **1. Remission for Non-Resident Persons**

- **Who is covered?**  
  Any **non-resident person** who is liable for tax under **Part XIII of the Income Tax Act** (which deals with the taxation of interest income from debt).

- **What constitutes eligibility?**  
  The remission applies to any amount that was:
  - Paid or credited to the non-resident person **as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of, interest** from:
    - Government debt obligations (e.g., bonds issued by the federal or provincial government)
    - Long-term corporate debt obligations (e.g., bonds issued by corporations with maturities exceeding a certain period)

- **How is the remission calculated?**  
  The remission is equal to the **difference** between:
  - The tax that would have been payable under Part XIII of the Act **on the interest amount** (original rule with reference to "1986")
  - The tax that would have been payable **if the references to "1986" in subparagraphs 212(1)(b)(ii) and (vii)** of the Act were **read as "1987"**

  In simpler terms:  
  > *Remission = (Tax under 1986 rule) – (Tax under 1987 rule)*  
  If the tax under the 1986 rule is higher, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of the difference.

- **Important Note:**  
  The remission only applies where the tax under the 1986 rule exceeds the tax under the 1987 rule. If the tax is lower or equal, no remission is granted.

#### **2. Remission for Tax Deductors/Withholders**

- **Who is covered?**  
  Any **person required to deduct or withhold** tax under Part XIII of the Act from interest payments made to a non-resident (e.g., banks, financial institutions, or other payers).

- **What is the remission?**  
  If the person responsible for withholding tax (e.g., a bank paying interest to a non-resident) has already paid the full amount of tax that would have been due under Part XIII, then they are entitled to a remission of the **excess tax** paid.

- **How is the remission calculated?**  
  The remission is equal to the difference between:
  - The tax actually paid by the deductor/withholder under the original 1986 rule
  - The tax that would have been payable **if the references to "1986" were read as "1987"**

  > *Remission = (Tax paid under 1986 rule) – (Tax payable under 1987 rule)*

- **Note:**  
  This provision ensures that entities that acted in good faith and paid the full tax under the original rule are not penalized due to a technical error in the legislation.

### **Legal Basis**

- The Order is made under **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) to make orders related to the administration of public finances, including tax remissions.

- The authority to issue such a remission is grounded in the principle of **administrative fairness and correction of legislative errors** that do not reflect the intent of Parliament.

---

### **Key Legislative Context**

- The *Income Tax Act* (specifically **subparagraphs 212(1)(b)(ii) and (vii)**) governs the taxation of interest income from debt instruments. These provisions contain a reference to the year **1986**, which may have been intended to apply to a specific tax rate or threshold.

- By changing "1986" to "1987," the government effectively adjusts the tax base — lowering the tax rate or threshold — which results in a **reduction in the tax liability** for interest income from debt.

- This adjustment is not a change in policy or a broad tax reduction, but a **technical correction** to reflect a change in the fiscal year used in the tax computation.

### **Implications and Effects**

1. **Tax Relief for Non-Residents**  
   Non-resident investors or holders of government or corporate bonds may receive a refund of taxes that were overpaid due to the 1986 reference.

2. **Reduction in Withholding Burden**  
   Financial institutions and other payers may recover over-withheld taxes, reducing their compliance costs and improving efficiency.

3. **Administrative Clarity**  
   The Order provides a clear, rule-based mechanism for resolving tax liabilities that arose from a technical inconsistency in the Act.

4. **No Broad Tax Reduction**  
   The remission is limited in scope and only applies to interest income from specific debt instruments and under specific conditions.

5. **Limited to Interest from Debt**  
   The Order does not apply to other types of income (e.g., dividends, capital gains, or business profits).

### **Citation and Title**

- **Title:** Government and Long-Term Corporate Debt Obligation Remission Order  
- **Citation:** S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4  
- **In this Order:** "Act" refers to the *Income Tax Act*; "Remission" refers to the cancellation or refund of tax liability under the specified conditions.

### **Conclusion**

The *Government and Long-Term Corporate Debt Obligation Remission Order* is a targeted, corrective measure designed to address a technical inconsistency in the *Income Tax Act* that resulted in overtaxation of interest income from government and long-term corporate debt for non-resident taxpayers and their withholding agents.

By adjusting the reference from "1986" to "1987," the Order reduces tax liability in a fair and equitable manner, ensuring that taxpayers are not penalized for a legislative error. It reflects a commitment to administrative fairness and fiscal accuracy, while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.

This Order is not a general tax reduction but a **specific, rule-based remission** tied to a technical correction in the tax legislation. It remains a significant example of how administrative powers under the Financial Administration Act can be used to correct unintended outcomes in tax law.
