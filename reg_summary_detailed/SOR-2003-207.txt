**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations Respecting the Fees for the Examination of Instruments and the Provision of Tables"**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
- The regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue**.
- It is enacted under **paragraph 304(1)(j) of the Excise Act, 2001a**, which grants the Minister the authority to establish fees related to the examination of instruments and the provision of tables for licensing and compliance purposes.

**Regulatory Text and Key Provisions:**

1. **Fee for Examination of an Instrument:**
   - The fee for the examination of an instrument under **subsection 148(2) of the Excise Act, 2001** is **$25**.
   - This fee applies to any formal document (e.g., application, licence, or other instrument) that is submitted for review or approval by the relevant regulatory authority under the Excise Act.
   - The examination process likely involves verifying the accuracy, compliance, and completeness of the instrument, such as an application for an alcohol licence or related documentation.

2. **Fees for Provision of Tables:**
   - A fee is charged for each **copy of the tables** listed in **Column 1 of the chart** attached to the regulation.
   - The specific fee amount for each table is specified in **Column 2 of the chart** (not included in the provided text, but referenced in the regulation).
   - **Exemption Clause:** No fee is payable when tables are provided to an **alcohol licensee or licensed user at the time their licence is issued**.
     - This exemption ensures that initial licensing recipients receive necessary regulatory information (such as compliance tables, pricing guides, or reporting formats) free of charge, reducing administrative burden on new entrants to the alcohol licensing system.

3. **Effective Date:**
   - These regulations come into force on **July 1, 2003**.
   - All fees and provisions outlined in the regulation apply from this date onward.

**Purpose and Context:**
- The regulation establishes a clear, transparent, and standardized fee structure for:
  - Administrative processing of licensing applications (via instrument examination).
  - Provision of official reference tables (used for compliance, reporting, or operational purposes).
- The fee structure is designed to:
  - Recoup administrative costs associated with reviewing documents and providing reference materials.
  - Ensure fair and consistent application of fees across all applicants.
  - Support the regulatory function of the Ministry of National Revenue in monitoring compliance with excise and alcohol licensing laws.

**Key Implications:**
- **Cost to Applicants:** Applicants must pay $25 for the examination of their instrument. Additional fees may apply depending on the number of tables requested.
- **Benefit to Licensees:** New alcohol licensees receive essential tables at no cost when their licence is issued, promoting accessibility and reducing entry barriers.
- **Transparency:** The regulation provides a clear fee schedule (though the full chart is not provided here), allowing applicants to anticipate costs.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation sets out a formal, enforceable fee regime for administrative services related to alcohol licensing under the Excise Act, 2001a. It balances the need for revenue generation in administrative operations with equitable access for new licensees, ensuring that essential regulatory information is available at no cost during the initial licensing phase. The regulation remains in effect as of July 1, 2003, and continues to serve as a foundational component of the licensing and compliance framework.
