**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Hydro Nuclear Facilities Exclusion from Part II of the Canada Labour Code Regulations (Occupational Health and Safety)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

This regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Labour** and after **consultation with the Atomic Energy Control Board**, under **section 159a of the Canada Labour Code**.

- **Legal Basis**: Section 159a of the *Canada Labour Code* empowers the federal government to exclude certain types of employment from the application of Part II of the Code (which governs occupational health and safety) where there are unique risks or regulatory frameworks that require specialized oversight.
- The regulation specifically applies to **nuclear facilities in Ontario**, recognizing that the safety and security of nuclear operations fall under a distinct regulatory regime governed by federal and provincial nuclear laws.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose is to **exclude employment at nuclear facilities from the general occupational health and safety requirements of Part II of the Canada Labour Code**, while ensuring that **core safety and security standards are still maintained** through other applicable laws.

- This exclusion acknowledges that nuclear facilities present **unique, high-risk environments** requiring a different, more specialized approach to occupational safety and health than typical workplaces.
- It ensures that **nuclear safety is governed by the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)** and its associated regulations, which are considered more appropriate and comprehensive for such operations.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

#### **Act**
- Refers to the *Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act)*, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.
- **Exclusions**: Subsections 16(6) and (7) and Sections 17 to 19 of the OHS Act are **excluded** from this regulation. These sections deal with specific administrative or procedural matters that are not relevant or applicable to nuclear operations.

#### **Employment**
- Defined as employment with:
  - **Ontario Hydro**, or
  - A **"person referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of nuclear facility"** (i.e., a facility that may have been transferred or operated by another entity but was previously or temporarily under Ontario Hydro’s ownership or operation).

#### **Nuclear Facility**
- A nuclear facility in Ontario that:
  - Is subject to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)* or its regulations, **or**
  - Was **owned and operated by Ontario Hydro on the day these regulations came into force**, or **after that date**, even if ownership changed later.
- This definition ensures that **any facility under nuclear regulatory oversight** is covered, regardless of current ownership, as long as it falls within the NSCA jurisdiction.

> **Note**: The inclusion of facilities that were once operated by Ontario Hydro (even after transfer) ensures continuity and consistency in safety oversight.

### **4. Exclusion from Part II of the Canada Labour Code**

- **Employment on or in connection with a nuclear facility is excluded from the application of Part II of the Canada Labour Code**, **except for sections 158 to 160**.
  
  - This means that **most occupational health and safety provisions** (such as those related to hazard communication, risk assessments, emergency procedures, and worker training) **do not apply** to workers at nuclear facilities.
  - However, **sections 158 to 160** (which relate to reporting of incidents, investigations, and certain workplace safety obligations) **remain in force** and are still applicable.

> **Implication**: Workers at nuclear sites are not subject to standard OHS Code requirements (e.g., duty to report hazards, safety training, or inspections) unless specifically required under the NSCA or its regulations.

---

### **5. Applicability of the OHS Act and Regulations**

- Despite the exclusion from Part II, **the OHS Act and its regulations (as amended from time to time)** **apply to the extent that they are relevant** to employment at nuclear facilities.
- This means that **any OHS provision that is compatible with nuclear safety standards** may still be applied — for example, provisions related to emergency preparedness, personal protective equipment, or medical monitoring — **if they do not conflict** with the NSCA framework.

> **Example**: A provision requiring medical surveillance for radiation exposure may still apply, even if it is not in Part II, because it is relevant and consistent with nuclear safety.

---

### **6. Amendments to References in the OHS Act**

To align with the nuclear regulatory framework, specific references in the OHS Act are **reinterpreted or replaced**:

| Original Reference | Revised Reference |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| "Section 158 of the Provincial Offences Act" in subsection 54(2) of the OHS Act | → "Section 487 of the Criminal Code" |
| "Sections 159 and 160 of the Provincial Offences Act" in subsection 56(5) of the OHS Act | → "Sections 488.1, 489.1, and 490 of the Criminal Code" |
| "A person employed in, or a member of, a police force to which the Police Services Act applies" in paragraph 43(2)(a) of the OHS Act | → Expanded to include "a member of an on-site nuclear response force, as defined in section 1 of the Nuclear Security Regulations" |

> **Purpose**:
> - These changes ensure that **penalties and enforcement mechanisms** for violations related to workplace safety at nuclear sites are governed by **federal criminal law**, which is better suited to address serious safety breaches in nuclear environments.
> - It also recognizes the **special role of on-site nuclear response forces** (e.g., emergency response teams) as having duties similar to police or security personnel, thus extending their protection and accountability under the relevant legal framework.

### **7. Precedence in Case of Conflict**

- If there is an **inconsistency between**:
  - Provisions of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA) and its regulations (relating to occupational safety and health), **and**
  - The provisions of these Regulations (this exclusion),
- Then **the NSCA and its regulations prevail** to the extent of the inconsistency.

> **Key Principle**: The **nuclear safety regime takes priority** over general workplace safety rules when there is a conflict. This reflects the higher level of risk and regulatory scrutiny required in nuclear operations.

---

### **8. Effective Date**

- These regulations **came into force on April 1, 1998**.

> This date marks the official implementation of the exclusion for all nuclear facilities in Ontario, ensuring a clear transition and enforcement timeline.

---

### **9. Key Implications and Significance**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Specialized Safety Framework** | Nuclear facilities operate under a **separate, more stringent regulatory regime** than general workplaces, reflecting the unique risks of radiation, nuclear accidents, and public safety. |
| **Legal Clarity** | Provides clear guidance on which laws apply, reducing ambiguity and potential legal disputes. |
| **Enforcement Alignment** | Aligns penalties and enforcement with federal criminal law, which is better equipped to handle serious safety violations in nuclear settings. |
| **Worker Protection** | While general OHS rules are excluded, **specialized safety measures** (e.g., radiation monitoring, emergency drills, medical surveillance) remain in place through the NSCA. |
| **Continuity of Oversight** | Ensures that even if ownership of a nuclear facility changes, the safety standards and legal obligations remain consistent. |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a **legally recognized exclusion** of nuclear facility employment from the general occupational health and safety provisions of the *Canada Labour Code*, with the exception of certain sections. It ensures that **nuclear operations are governed by a specialized, risk-appropriate regulatory framework** under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*, which is better suited to manage the unique hazards associated with nuclear energy.

By excluding Part II of the Canada Labour Code (except sections 158–160), the regulation maintains a **clear separation between general workplace safety and nuclear-specific safety**, while preserving necessary safety obligations through federal nuclear legislation. The alignment with criminal law provisions and the primacy of the NSCA in case of conflict further reinforce the high standard of safety required in the nuclear sector.

---

**Final Note**: This regulation is a foundational piece of policy in Ontario’s approach to nuclear safety and worker protection, reflecting a balanced recognition of both worker rights and the exceptional safety requirements inherent in nuclear operations.
