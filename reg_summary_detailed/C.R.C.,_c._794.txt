**Detailed Summary of the Syncrude Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The *Syncrude Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by the Government of Alberta (in consultation with federal authorities) to provide tax relief to participants involved in the Syncrude Project — a major oil sands extraction initiative operating on Government of Alberta Bituminous Sands Leases No. 17 and 22. The Order grants a **remission (exemption)** of certain income taxes under the *Income Tax Act* for specific transactions related to the project, with strict conditions and time limits.

This Order may be cited as the **Syncrude Remission Order** and is designed to address economic hardship caused by changes in fiscal policies affecting the Syncrude Project.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Barrels**  
   Refers to barrels of synthetic crude oil derived from Leases 17 and 22 under the Syncrude Project.

2. **Condition**  
   A defined economic hardship scenario where the existing fiscal programs (taxes, royalties, rentals) applicable to the Syncrude Project have been **revised in a way that causes significant adverse economic effects** on the project. This condition triggers the revocation of the remission if it occurs.

3. **Crown**  
   Refers to *Her Majesty in right of the Province of Alberta*, the legal entity representing the provincial government.

4. **Leased Substances**  
   All substances recovered by participants from Leases 17 and 22 through the Syncrude Project.

5. **Leases 17 and 22**  
   Official government leases for bituminous sands, excluding a portion of Lease No. 17 that was subleased to Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited under agreements dated September 20 and 26, 1972. Includes any extensions or additional documents that prolong the lease duration.

6. **Participant**  
   Entities directly involved in the Syncrude Project, including:
   - Canada-Cities Service Ltd. (head office: Calgary)
   - Imperial Oil Limited (head office: Toronto)
   - Gulf Oil Canada Limited (head office: Toronto)
   - The Crown (represented by Alberta’s Minister of Energy and Resources)
   - Her Majesty in right of Canada (represented by the federal Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources)
   - Ontario Energy Corporation (head office: Toronto)

   *Note:* Any successor or assignee that retains a share in the Syncrude Project is also included.

7. **Royalty Provisions**  
   Specific provisions in the *Income Tax Act*:
   - Paragraphs 12(1)(o) and 18(1)(m)
   - Subsections 69(6) to (10)

   These provisions normally impose royalties, taxes, or rentals on income derived from oil sands operations — particularly on amounts payable to the Crown or property received in lieu of such payments.

8. **Syncrude Project**  
   The overall scheme by which participants recover leased substances from Leases 17 and 22.

9. **Synthetic Crude Oil**  
   A liquid mixture primarily composed of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, derived from crude bitumen, which may contain sulfur compounds. It is measured at the time of volume estimation or measurement.

### **Main Provision: Tax Remission**

**Under Section (1)**, the Order grants a **full remission (exemption)** of any income tax payable by a participant for a taxation year under *Part I of the Income Tax Act*, **if** the tax arose due to the application of the royalty provisions in the following three situations:

1. **Amounts Receivable or Fair Market Value of Property Received by the Crown**  
   - Includes any royalty, tax, rental, or levy payable to the Crown as a result of the Syncrude Project.
   - Also includes any amount reasonably regarded as being in lieu of such payments (e.g., compensation or alternative benefits).

2. **Dispositions of Leased Substances to the Crown**  
   - When a participant sells or transfers (disposes) the leased substances (e.g., synthetic crude oil) to the Crown.

3. **Acquisitions of Leased Substances from the Crown**  
   - When a participant purchases leased substances directly from the Crown.

> **Important Note**: This remission applies only to taxes resulting from the *royalty provisions*, not to other types of income or taxes.

### **Conditions for Remission (Time Limit and Termination Clause)**

Remission is **not granted** for any taxation year that begins after **the first of the following events occurs**, whichever comes first:

| Event | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| **1.1 billion barrels recovered** | If the condition (adverse fiscal impact) exists before reaching this threshold |
| **Recovery between 1.1B and 2.1B barrels** | If the condition exists *after* 1.1B but *before* 2.1B barrels are recovered |
| **2.1 billion barrels recovered** | If the condition exists after 2.1B barrels |
| **December 31, 2003** | A fixed deadline, regardless of recovery levels |

> **Key Interpretation**:  
> - The remission is **automatically revoked** by the Governor in Council (the federal or provincial cabinet-level authority) **if the "condition" is satisfied**, based on a report from the Minister of Finance.
> - The "condition" means that the original fiscal programs (royalty, tax, rental structures) have been **significantly altered in a way that harms the economic viability of the Syncrude Project**.
> - The revocation can occur **before** the 1.1 billion barrel threshold, **after** 1.1B but before 2.1B, or **after** 2.1B barrels — but **only if the condition is met**.
> - However, **remission cannot be granted beyond December 31, 2003**, even if the condition has not yet been triggered.

### **Key Implications and Purpose**

1. **Economic Protection for Syncrude**  
   The Order was introduced to **protect the financial viability** of the Syncrude Project during a period when fiscal reforms (such as increased royalty rates or changes in revenue-sharing) could have made operations economically unfeasible.

2. **Temporary Relief**  
   The remission is **not permanent** and is time-bound. It is intended as a **temporary measure** to stabilize the project until the fiscal environment stabilizes or new arrangements are made.

3. **Fiscal Policy Sensitivity**  
   The "condition" clause ensures that the remission is **not available indefinitely** — it is tied to the actual economic impact of fiscal changes. If the government determines that the project is now facing significant financial strain due to policy changes, the remission is revoked.

4. **Barrel-Based Milestones**  
   The 1.1 billion and 2.1 billion barrel thresholds reflect the **scale and growth** of the Syncrude Project. These benchmarks indicate the project's maturity and the point at which it may be more vulnerable to fiscal pressures.

5. **Final Deadline (December 31, 2003)**  
   This cap ensures that the remission **does not extend beyond a specific date**, even if the project continues to grow or if the condition is not yet triggered. This provides a clear endpoint for the policy.

### **Who Is Affected?**

- All **participants** listed in the Order, including:
  - Canadian and provincial energy companies
  - The federal and provincial governments (as participants)
- Their **successors or assignees** who still hold an interest in the Syncrude Project.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- The Order operates under the authority of the *Income Tax Act*, specifically the royalty provisions (12(1)(o), 18(1)(m), and sections 69(6)–(10)).
- It reflects a **cooperative fiscal arrangement** between federal and provincial governments to support large-scale energy development in Alberta’s oil sands.
- It is a **fiscal relief mechanism** used during periods of uncertainty or transition in energy policy.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Syncrude Remission Order** is a targeted, time-limited tax exemption designed to shield the Syncrude Project from adverse economic consequences caused by changes in royalty or fiscal policies. It provides relief for:
- Royalty payments to the Crown,
- Disposals of leased substances to the Crown,
- Acquisitions of leased substances from the Crown.

However, this relief is **not perpetual** and is **automatically revoked** if:
- The "condition" (significant adverse fiscal impact) arises,
- Or if the project reaches 1.1 billion or 2.1 billion barrels of synthetic crude recovered,
- Or if the date exceeds **December 31, 2003**.

This Order underscores the government’s recognition of the economic importance of the Syncrude Project and its intent to balance fiscal responsibility with the need for sustainable energy development in Alberta.

> **Final Note**: This Order is a historical document reflecting early oil sands policy in Canada. As of 2024, it is no longer in effect due to the expiration of the December 31, 2003 deadline and the evolution of modern oil sands fiscal frameworks. However, it remains significant as a precedent for future royalty and tax relief measures in the energy sector.
