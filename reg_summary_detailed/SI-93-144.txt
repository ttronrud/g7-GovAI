**Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers and Amalgamation of Departments**

**1. Legal Authority and Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, specifically under two provisions:

- **Paragraph 2(a)**: Grants the power to transfer the powers, duties, and functions currently held by the **Minister of Forestry** to the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**.
- **Paragraph 2(b)**: Authorizes the **amalgamation** (merging) of two existing government departments — the **Department of Energy, Mines and Resources** and the **Department of Forestry** — under the unified structure of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, with administrative oversight provided by the **Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**.

**2. Key Provisions and Impacts**

- **Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions**:  
  All responsibilities, statutory authority, policy-making powers, and operational duties previously exercised by the Minister of Forestry — including those derived from any Act of Parliament — are now transferred to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. This includes responsibilities related to forest management, conservation, timber production, land use planning, and environmental protection within forested areas.

- **Amalgamation of Departments**:  
  The two departments — the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources and the Department of Forestry — are formally merged into a single, integrated department. This consolidation aims to streamline governance, reduce duplication, improve coordination, and enhance efficiency in managing natural resources.

- **Administrative Oversight**:  
  The **Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources** will now serve as the head of the combined department, responsible for day-to-day management, implementation of policies, and coordination between the former functions of both departments.

**3. Purpose and Rationale**  
The primary objectives of this regulatory action are:

- To improve interdepartmental coordination between energy, mining, and forestry sectors.
- To create a more cohesive and strategic approach to natural resource management.
- To ensure that forestry-related policies and operations are aligned with broader national goals in energy, economic development, and environmental sustainability.
- To reduce administrative overhead by eliminating redundant structures and reporting lines.

**4. Legal and Constitutional Implications**  
- The transfer of powers is valid under the authority granted by paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows for the reassignment of ministerial responsibilities.
- The amalgamation under paragraph 2(b) is consistent with the principle of public service efficiency and is subject to constitutional and legal safeguards ensuring that no rights or obligations are unfairly altered.

**5. Effective Date and Implementation**  
While not explicitly stated in the text, such regulations typically take effect immediately upon publication in the official government gazette or upon formal notification. Implementation would involve the development of new organizational structures, policy integration, staff reallocation, and interdepartmental training.

**6. Stakeholder Impact**  
- **Government Agencies**: Will operate under a unified department with shared goals and reporting lines.
- **Public and Industry Stakeholders**: May experience changes in service delivery, policy development, and regulatory oversight related to forestry and natural resource management.
- **Employees**: May undergo reassignments, role changes, or organizational restructuring within the new department.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation represents a significant structural reform within the federal government’s natural resource management framework. It consolidates forestry responsibilities into the existing energy and mining ministry, ensuring greater strategic alignment and operational efficiency. By transferring and amalgamating the functions of the former Minister of Forestry and Department of Forestry, the government seeks to build a more integrated, responsive, and effective system for managing Canada’s natural resources.
