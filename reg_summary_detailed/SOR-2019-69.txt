### 1. **Legal Background**

The *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act* (2011) is a Canadian law enacted to enable the Government of Canada to freeze the assets of foreign officials who are found to have committed serious corrupt acts, particularly those involving fraud, bribery, or abuse of power. The Act provides a legal framework for the temporary freezing of assets of such individuals, with the goal of deterring corruption and supporting international anti-corruption efforts.

Under **Section 6** of the Act, the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) may extend the application of specific regulations — such as the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Ukraine) Regulations* — for a specified period, typically to ensure that measures remain effective in the face of evolving geopolitical or legal circumstances.

### 2. **Specific Regulation: Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Ukraine) Regulations (SOR/2014-44)**

- **Purpose:**  
  These regulations implement the Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act in relation to **Ukrainian officials** who are found to have committed acts of corruption that are considered serious and that threaten Canada’s national interests or international cooperation.

- **Scope:**  
  The regulations authorize Canadian authorities to freeze the assets (including bank accounts, real estate, and other financial holdings) of Ukrainian officials who are:
  - Found to have engaged in serious corruption,
  - Involved in bribery or fraud,
  - And who are identified as having acted in a manner that undermines international standards of governance or public trust.

- **Application Conditions:**  
  The freezing of assets is not automatic. It requires:
  - A formal determination by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (or a designated official),
  - Evidence of corrupt conduct,
  - A finding that the individual is a foreign official and that the corruption involves a breach of international norms or Canadian interests.

### 3. **Extension of the Regulation (as of March 6, 2019)**

- **Action Taken:**  
  On **March 6, 2019**, the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, extended the application of the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Ukraine) Regulations* for a **five-year period**.

- **Effective Date:**  
  The extension began on **March 6, 2019**, and was set to expire on **March 5, 2024**.

- **Rationale for Extension:**  
  The extension was justified due to:
  - Ongoing concerns about corruption in Ukrainian political and public institutions,
  - The need to maintain Canada’s ability to act decisively in response to corrupt foreign officials,
  - The importance of supporting Ukraine’s transition to a more transparent and accountable governance system,
  - The continued relevance of targeting corrupt officials in international relations and economic cooperation.

- **Legal Authority:**  
  The extension was authorized under **Section 6** of the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*, which allows the government to extend the scope and duration of such regulations when appropriate and in the public interest.

### 4. **Key Principles and Implications**

- **Targeted and Proportional:**  
  The measures are targeted at individuals found to have committed serious corruption, not applied broadly or arbitrarily.

- **International Cooperation:**  
  The regulations are part of Canada’s broader international anti-corruption strategy and are often coordinated with international bodies such as the United Nations, the OECD, and the European Union.

- **Transparency and Accountability:**  
  The process includes public reporting and oversight mechanisms. While the identities of individuals may be protected, the government is required to provide public justification for actions taken under these regulations.

- **Human Rights and Legal Concerns:**  
  Critics have raised concerns about potential violations of international human rights standards, particularly regarding due process and the right to property. However, the Canadian government maintains that the measures are narrowly tailored and consistent with international law, especially under the *UN Convention against Corruption*.

---

### 5. **Current Status (as of 2024)**

- The five-year extension expired on **March 5, 2024**.
- As of now, the regulations may have been **renewed or replaced** through a new regulatory instrument, depending on developments in Ukraine and international anti-corruption efforts.
- Any future extensions would require new legislative or regulatory action under the same Act and would again need to be recommended by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and approved by the Governor in Council.
