Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the **Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Regulations**, as published under the *Aeronautics Act* and effective from July 8, 2010 (for land titles) and July 16, 2010 (for registry lands).

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Zoning Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Purpose**
These regulations were established under **subsection 5.5(1)a of the Aeronautics Act** (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s.1; R.S., c. A-2), following a formal public consultation process. A notice of the proposed regulations was published in:
- Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (March 15 and 22, 2008),
- The *Ottawa Citizen* and *Le Droit* (March 26, 29, May 2, 3, 2008).

This provided **interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to make representations** to the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

#### **Primary Objectives**:
1. To **prevent land adjacent to or near the airport** from being used or developed in a way that would:
   - Compromise the **safe operation of aircraft** at the airport.
2. To **prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications**, including those used by aircraft and airport facilities (e.g., radar, navigation systems).

### 🔹 **Scope of Application**
- Applies to **all land**, including public road allowances, that is:
  - Adjacent to or in the **vicinity of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport**.
  - Within the **outer limit** defined in **Part 6 of the Schedule**.

> ⚠️ *Note: The regulations do not apply to lands outside this designated area.*

### 🔹 **Key Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport, located in the City of Ottawa, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | Two specific points (A and B) near the center of the airport, used as reference for measuring elevation and spatial boundaries. |
| **Bird Hazard Zone** | A designated area around the airport where activities that attract birds (a known aviation hazard) are prohibited. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface above and around the airport, defining the upper limit for development. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary surface extending above the runways in a specific direction (for take-off/landing), based on runway orientation. |
| **Take-off/Approach Surface** | An inclined surface rising from each end of a strip surface, designed to ensure aircraft have a clear path during take-off and landing. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined surface extending from the lateral edges of the strip and take-off/approach surfaces, ensuring a smooth transition between the airport and surrounding land. |

> ✅ All elevations are referenced to the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum — CGVD28**.  
> ✅ Grid coordinates use the **1927 North American Datum (1974 adjustment), UTM Zone 18**.  
> ✅ A combined average scale factor of **0.9996160** is applied to ensure accurate positioning.

### 🔹 **Regulatory Prohibitions**

#### 1. **Building and Structure Restrictions**
> No person may:
- Erect or construct a building, structure, or object (or an addition to an existing one) on land subject to these regulations **if any part of it exceeds**:
  - The **take-off/approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**,
  - The **transitional surface**, or
  - The **strip surface**.

> ❗ *This applies to all structures, including towers, antennas, trees, or even small sheds.*

#### 2. **Interference with Aeronautical Signals**
> No owner or lessee of land **within the outer surface** may:
- Use or develop land in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft,
  - Airport facilities (e.g., radar, radio navigation systems).

> This ensures reliable communication and navigation safety.

#### 3. **Natural Growth Restrictions**
> No owner or lessee may allow any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vines) on land to grow **above the elevation** of any of the following surfaces:
- Take-off/approach surface,
- Outer surface,
- Transitional surface,
- Strip surface.

> ⚠️ Even tall trees or vegetation must not exceed these elevation limits.

#### 4. **Bird Hazard Zone Prohibitions**
> No owner or lessee within the **bird hazard zone** may:
- Conduct or permit **activities that attract birds** (e.g., open fields, water features, feeding areas, waste dumping), which could pose a **risk to aviation safety**.

> This is critical for preventing bird strikes — a major cause of aviation accidents.

### 🔹 **Airport Reference Points (ARPs) – Coordinates and Description**

Defined precisely in **Part 1 of the Schedule** using UTM coordinates (Zone 18, NAD 1974):

#### **Airport Reference Point A**:
- Start: Intersection of runways 07L-25R and 14-32  
  → Grid: **447,841.99 E, 5,018,054.69 N**
- Thence:
  - Northwesterly along runway 14-32 for **975.36 m**
  - Northeasterly perpendicular to runway 14-32 for **304.80 m**
- Final coordinates: **447,243.76 E, 5,018,882.67 N**

#### **Airport Reference Point B**:
- Start: Same intersection (447,841.99 E, 5,018,054.69 N)
- Thence:
  - Southeasterly along runway 14-32 (projected centreline) for **1,737.36 m**
  - Northeasterly perpendicular to projected centreline for **304.80 m**
- Final coordinates: **449,415.16 E, 5,017,258.42 N**

> These points serve as **geographic anchors** for calculating all other surfaces.

### 🔹 **Take-off/Approach Surfaces (Detailed Descriptions)**

These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have **clear visibility and safe clearance** during take-off and landing.

Each surface has a specific **slope ratio** and **horizontal extent**, rising from the end of the runway.

| Runway | Surface Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| **07R–25L** (ends at 07R and 25L) | Ratio: 1:60 (first 3,000 m), then 1:50 (beyond). Height: 290 m above strip end. Outer edge: 2,400 m wide on each side. |
| **07L–25R** (ends at 07L and 25R) | Same as above: 1:60 → 1:50, height 290 m, width 2,400 m. |
| **07C–25C** (ends at 07C and 25C) | Same slope, but outer edge is **2,616.390 m** wide due to longer runway alignment. Height: 290 m. |
| **14–32** (ends at 14 and 32) | Ends at 14: 1:60 → 1:50. Height: 50 m at 3,000 m, then rises to **boundary with Quebec** (outer edge). At 32 end: same as others (290 m, 2,400 m wide). |
| **04–22** (ends at 04 and 22) | Unique slope: 1:25 (steeper than others). Height: 100 m at 2,500 m. Outer edge: 280 m wide on each side. |

> All surfaces rise **vertically** from the runway end at a defined rate, with **distinct transition points** at 3,000 m and 15,000 m.

### 🔹 **Outer Surface**
- A broad, imaginary surface that defines the **maximum allowable elevation** for all development.
- Extends beyond the runways and take-off surfaces.
- Used to set **overall height limits** for all structures and vegetation.

> This surface is critical for **preventing visual obstructions** that could interfere with flight operations.

---

### 🔹 **Transitional Surface**
- An inclined surface that extends **from the lateral edges** of the strip and take-off/approach surfaces.
- Ensures a **smooth transition** between the airport and surrounding areas.
- Prevents sudden changes in terrain or height that could affect aircraft approach or departure
