**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 60 (Import of Arms Permit)**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, under **Section 5 of the Import Permit Regulations**.
- It is authorized by **Order in Council P.C. 1978-3738**, dated December 14, 1978, which provides the legal framework for issuing import permits for certain controlled goods.
- The permit is formally published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **November 4, 1986**, under **SOR/79-5**.

---

### **Official Designation**
- The permit is officially titled: **"The Import of Arms Permit"**.
- It is referred to as **General Import Permit No. 60**.

---

### **Scope of the Permit**
The permit authorizes the import into Canada of specific items classified as **arms, ammunition, and implements or munitions of war**.

These items are specifically listed in **Items 70 to 73 of the Import Control List**.  
*(Note: While the full list of items is not included in this excerpt, these items typically include weapons such as firearms, explosives, artillery, and related military equipment, as defined under Canadian import control laws.)*

---

### **Authorized Importing Entities**
The permit allows importation to be conducted by one of the following designated government entities:

1. **The Minister of National Defence**  
2. **The Minister of Supply and Services**  
3. **The Solicitor General of Canada**

Additionally, the **Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)** may import such goods **on behalf of** the persons named in paragraph (a) above.

> This means that while the CCC is a commercial entity, it can act as an authorized importer **only when importing goods for the benefit of the government bodies listed in paragraph (a)** — not for commercial sale or private use.

---

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**
- The permit operates under **Canada’s broader import control regime**, designed to prevent the illegal flow of weapons and military-related items into the country.
- By granting a general import permit, the government streamlines the process for legitimate, authorized military or government-related imports, reducing bureaucratic delays while maintaining compliance with international arms control obligations.
- The restriction to government entities (and the CCC acting on their behalf) ensures that only **authorized, non-commercial, and non-private** imports are permitted — thereby preventing misuse or illicit trafficking.

---

### **Purpose and Context**
- The permit reflects Canada’s commitment to:
  - Maintaining national security.
  - Ensuring that military equipment and weapons are imported only for legitimate defense, supply, or governmental purposes.
  - Complying with international agreements and arms control frameworks (e.g., UN arms embargoes, bilateral agreements).

---

### **Limitations and Conditions**
Although not explicitly detailed in this excerpt, the permit likely includes implicit conditions such as:
- Proof of legitimate use (e.g., for defense, training, or official government operations).
- Compliance with Canadian and international arms control laws.
- Reporting requirements to the Department of National Defence or relevant authorities.
- Restrictions on transfer, sale, or private possession of the imported items.

### **Conclusion**
General Import Permit No. 60 is a legally binding instrument that enables the **authorized importation of specific arms, ammunition, and military equipment** into Canada **only for government purposes**. It is issued by the federal government through designated ministers or the Canadian Commercial Corporation acting on their behalf. The permit serves as a critical tool in balancing national defense needs with strict regulatory oversight to prevent the proliferation of weapons.

This regulation underscores Canada’s approach to arms control: **strictly regulated, government-centric, and aligned with international standards**.
