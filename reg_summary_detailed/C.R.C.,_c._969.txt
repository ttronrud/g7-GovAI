**Detailed Summary of the Enterprise Development Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Enterprise Development Regulations* (EDR) are a set of administrative rules designed to support Canadian manufacturers and other enterprises in adapting to international trade challenges, particularly those arising from global trade agreements such as the **Tokyo Round**. The primary objective is to **promote economic competitiveness, preserve jobs, and ensure the sustainability of Canadian manufacturing** by providing financial assistance through **loans, insurance, and capital contributions**.

These regulations were originally introduced to address the negative impacts of trade liberalization — especially increased foreign competition — and have evolved over time. However, it is important to note that **many provisions have been revoked or superseded**, particularly those related to the **Board** and **letter of credit**, which were removed by statutory amendments (e.g., SOR/83-708 and SOR/79-335).

This summary focuses on the **active, relevant, and still applicable portions** of the regulations as they pertain to **loans, insurance, restructuring, eligibility, and administrative procedures**.
