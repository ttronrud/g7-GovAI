**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, hereby transfers from the **Privy Council Office (PCO)** to the **Treasury Board** the control and supervision of the portion of the federal public administration within the Privy Council Office known as the **Regulatory Affairs and Orders in Council Secretariat**, **with the exception of the Orders in Council Division**, effective **July 1, 2006**.

**Legal Authority:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign functions, responsibilities, and administrative control within the federal public service. This provision facilitates structural realignments to improve efficiency, accountability, and governance.

**Scope of the Transfer:**  
- The **Regulatory Affairs and Orders in Council Secretariat** (a component of the Privy Council Office) is being transferred in whole, except for the **Orders in Council Division**.  
- This means that all functions, administrative responsibilities, personnel management, budgetary oversight, and policy implementation related to the Secretariat — *excluding the Orders in Council Division* — are now under the **control and supervision of the Treasury Board**.

**Key Excluded Component:**  
- The **Orders in Council Division** remains under the authority and jurisdiction of the **Privy Council Office**.  
- This division is responsible for the preparation, drafting, and issuance of Orders in Council, which are formal instruments used by the Crown (on the advice of the government) to implement legislation or policy without requiring parliamentary approval. Its continued presence in the PCO reflects its constitutional and procedural significance.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfer becomes effective on **July 1, 2006**. All administrative, operational, and reporting responsibilities related to the transferred functions are to be managed by the Treasury Board from that date onward.

**Purpose and Implications:**  
- **Enhanced Oversight:** The Treasury Board, as a central body responsible for managing the operations and accountability of federal departments and agencies, now has greater oversight of regulatory policy development and implementation.  
- **Improved Coordination:** The move aims to strengthen coordination between regulatory policy and departmental operations by aligning regulatory affairs more closely with fiscal and administrative governance.  
- **Separation of Functions:** By keeping the Orders in Council Division within the Privy Council Office, the government ensures that constitutional and formal executive processes remain under the proper institutional guard, preserving the ceremonial and procedural integrity of Orders in Council.  
- **Administrative Efficiency:** The restructuring streamlines the federal public service by reducing duplication and improving interdepartmental alignment.

**Context and Background:**  
This transfer was part of broader efforts in the early 2000s to modernize and reorganize the federal public service, improving transparency, accountability, and the effectiveness of regulatory policy. The *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22) provided the legislative framework for such realignments, allowing for the reassignment of functions to better serve government objectives.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation marks a significant shift in the administrative structure of the Canadian federal government. It transfers key regulatory functions from the Privy Council Office to the Treasury Board, enhancing the Treasury Board’s role in public administration and policy implementation, while preserving the constitutional role of the Orders in Council Division within the Privy Council Office. The change reflects a strategic effort to improve governance, accountability, and operational efficiency in the federal public service.
