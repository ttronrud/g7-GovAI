### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 2 of the Statutory Rules Order (SOR) /2016-191**.

- **SOR/2016-191** is the Statutory Rules Order issued in 2016, which contains amendments or repeals to existing regulations under the authority of the federal government in Canada.
- The section referenced — **section 2** of that order — specifically identifies the legal instrument or provision being repealed.
- The repeated entries suggest that the original regulation or provision in question was either:
  - A standalone rule or section,
  - Or multiple provisions (possibly under different headings or titles) that were all targeted for repeal under section 2 of SOR/2016-191.

### Interpretation:

The repeated notation does not indicate a detailed regulation itself, but rather a **status marker** — that a particular regulation (or set of regulations) has been officially removed from legal force. This means:

- The regulation no longer applies or is enforceable.
- Any legal obligations, penalties, or requirements previously established by that regulation are now void.
- The repeal may have been enacted to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated or redundant rules with new legislation.

### Contextual Note:

SOR/2016-191 is part of the Canadian federal regulatory framework. Without the full text of the original regulation being repealed, it is not possible to identify the exact subject matter (e.g., workplace safety, environmental standards, licensing, etc.). However, the repeal of a section under SOR/2016-191 typically occurs in response to:

- Legislative review,
- Changes in policy,
- Redundancy or overlap with other regulations,
- Alignment with new laws or international standards.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is **not a regulation itself**, but rather a **status note** indicating that a regulation (or section of one) has been **repealed** by **section 2 of SOR/2016-191**. The repetition of this note suggests that multiple provisions or a broad category of rules were affected. To fully understand the scope and impact of the repeal, one would need to consult the original regulation being repealed and the full text of SOR/2016-191.

👉 **In short**: This entry confirms that a specific regulation has been officially canceled and is no longer in effect due to a 2016 federal statutory rule.
