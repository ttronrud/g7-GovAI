**Detailed Summary of the Oil and Gas Spills and Debris Liability Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Regulatory Context**

The regulation is issued under **Section 12.1** of the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act* (the "Act"), which mandates that proposed regulations concerning limits of liability for oil and gas-related spills, authorized discharges, and debris must be published in *Canada Gazette, Part I* to provide a reasonable opportunity for public input.

- The proposed regulations were published on **January 3, 1987**.
- The government invited interested parties (including industry stakeholders, environmental groups, Indigenous communities, and the public) to submit representations or comments on the proposed rules.
- **No representations have been received** from any interested parties to the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources or the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

Given that no public feedback was submitted, the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendations of both Ministers, **proceeds to adopt the proposed regulations** under **Section 12** of the Act. This section authorizes the government to finalize and implement proposed regulations when no objections or representations have been made.

### **2. Legal Authority and Citation**

- **Legal Basis**: The regulations are made under the authority of:
  - *Section 12.1* of the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act* (provisional publication and public consultation)
  - *Section 12* of the same Act (final adoption of regulations without public objection)

- **Statutory Citation**:  
  S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 81, s. 78 (regulatory power)  
  S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 81, s. 77 (reference to the Act)

- **Regulation Title**:  
  **Oil and Gas Spills and Debris Liability Regulations**  
  (May be cited as such)

### **3. Key Definitions and Interpretation**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act*.

### **4. Limits of Liability – Detailed Breakdown**

These regulations establish **maximum financial liability limits** for spills, authorized discharges, and debris arising from oil and gas exploration or production activities. The limits vary depending on the geographic location and specific conditions of the affected area.

| **Area or Condition** | **Limit of Liability** | **Explanation** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Areas referred to in paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act (AWPPA)** | **$40 million** (amount by which $40 million exceeds the AWPPA’s prescribed limit for such activities) | Applies to areas covered under the AWPPA’s definition of "area of land or submarine area" in paragraph 6(1)(a). The liability is set at $40 million *above* the amount specified in section 9 of the AWPPA for activities involving persons described in that paragraph. This provides a higher cap than the AWPPA baseline, likely to reflect the sensitivity of Arctic environments and the potential for significant environmental damage. |
| **Submarine areas north of the 60th parallel of north latitude (where paragraph (a) does not apply)** | **$40 million** | Applies to all submarine areas located north of 60°N latitude, regardless of whether they fall under AWPPA provisions. This is a fixed cap of $40 million, indicating a strong environmental protection framework in the Arctic. |
| **Areas within Yukon Territory or Northwest Territories that are within 200 meters of a river, stream, lake, or other inland body of water (where paragraph (a) does not apply)** | **$25 million** | Reflects a more restricted and sensitive environment—proximity to water bodies increases the risk of contamination and ecological harm. The lower cap of $25 million acknowledges the heightened environmental vulnerability in these zones. |
| **Areas within Yukon or Northwest Territories where neither paragraph (a) nor (c) applies** | **$10 million** | Applies to less sensitive or remote areas within the territories that are not near water bodies and not covered by the more protective provisions. This is a significantly lower limit, suggesting a reduced risk assessment or lower environmental sensitivity. |
| **All other areas where the Act applies and no other specific limit is set** | **$30 million** | A default cap for general oil and gas operations outside the more specific or sensitive zones. It provides a balanced, moderate liability ceiling applicable to most onshore or offshore activities not explicitly covered by the above categories. |

### **5. Purpose and Policy Implications**

- **Environmental Protection**: The tiered liability structure reflects a risk-based approach, with higher caps in ecologically sensitive or remote areas (e.g., Arctic, near water bodies) to ensure adequate financial responsibility for potential environmental damage.
  
- **Risk-Based Liability**: The limits are not uniform—they are designed to reflect the actual risk of pollution and environmental harm in different regions.

- **Alignment with National Environmental Frameworks**: The inclusion of the *Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act* (AWPPA) shows integration with broader federal environmental protection policies, particularly in the Arctic.

- **Clarity and Predictability**: By clearly defining liability limits based on geographic and environmental criteria, the regulations provide legal certainty for oil and gas operators, insurers, and regulators.

- **Public Consultation and Finalization**: The absence of public representations allows the government to proceed without delay, but also underscores that the regulations were developed in a context where stakeholder input was not received.

---

### **6. Key Observations and Considerations**

- **No Public Input**: The absence of representations raises questions about transparency and stakeholder engagement. While legally permissible, it may be seen as a limitation in democratic accountability or environmental justice.

- **Arctic Focus**: The emphasis on areas north of the 60th parallel and near water bodies indicates a strong policy commitment to protecting Arctic ecosystems, which are particularly vulnerable to oil and gas operations.

- **Territorial Sensitivity**: The $25 million cap near inland water bodies and the $10 million cap in remote areas show a nuanced understanding of local environmental risks.

- **Financial Responsibility**: The regulations ensure that operators are financially accountable for spills and discharges, reducing the risk of unremedied environmental harm and promoting responsible development.

### **Conclusion**

The *Oil and Gas Spills and Debris Liability Regulations* establish a **tiered, geographically sensitive framework** for liability in the event of oil and gas-related spills, discharges, or debris. The limits range from **$10 million to $40 million**, depending on location and environmental sensitivity. These caps are designed to balance economic feasibility for industry with environmental protection, particularly in ecologically fragile regions like the Arctic and near freshwater systems.

While the regulations were adopted without public comment, they represent a significant regulatory tool for managing environmental risk in Canada’s oil and gas sector. They remain in force as a key component of Canada’s environmental and resource management policy under the *Oil and Gas Production and Conservation Act*.
