**Detailed Summary of the *Eligibility of Certain Former Members of the Canadian Forces Regulations* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12, 13)**

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, made under **section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, establish specific eligibility criteria for **former members of the Canadian Forces** who meet certain service and administrative conditions. The primary objective is to allow these individuals to participate in internal public service appointment processes and to make complaints under the Act—while ensuring equitable treatment in accordance with employment equity principles—**until April 1, 2029**.

The regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Public Service Commission** and the **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**, reflecting a policy decision to support the transition of former military personnel into civilian public service roles.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Public Service Employment Act* (PSEA), which governs the employment, rights, and responsibilities of public servants in Canada.

2. **"Eligible Person"**  
   A person qualifies as an *eligible person* if all of the following conditions are met:
   
   - **Not currently employed in the public service for an indeterminate period**  
     → This excludes individuals who are in indefinite-term public service positions (e.g., permanent or indefinite appointments), ensuring that only those transitioning out of the public service are considered.
   
   - **Completed their third year of service in the Canadian Forces**  
     → The individual must have served at least three full years in the Canadian Forces (CF), beginning on **November 13, 2020**, and ending on **January 18, 2024**.  
     → This three-year service requirement is time-bound and specific to that period, meaning only those who served in the CF during this window qualify.
   
   - **Was honourably released**  
     → The individual must have been released from service in an honourable manner, as defined in regulations made under the *National Defence Act*.  
     → "Honourable release" typically means discharge due to retirement, transfer, or other non-disqualifying reasons, excluding discharges due to misconduct, disciplinary action, or failure to meet standards.
   
   - **Created an account in the Public Service Resourcing System (PSRS) on or before January 18, 2024**  
     → This is a technical administrative requirement to ensure that eligible individuals can access internal appointment processes and related systems.  
     → The PSRS is the digital platform used by the Public Service of Canada to manage job postings, applications, and workforce planning.

### **Rights and Benefits for Eligible Persons (Until April 1, 2029)**

1. **Participation in Advertised Internal Appointment Processes**  
   - An eligible person may **participate in internal appointment processes** (e.g., promotions, transfers, or new positions) **as if they were currently employed in the public service**.  
   - This means they are treated the same as active public servants in terms of eligibility, access to applications, and evaluation during the selection process.  
   - This provision supports the integration of former military personnel into the public service, recognizing their experience, discipline, and professional development.

2. **Right to Make Complaints Under Section 77 of the PSEA**  
   - Eligible persons may **file complaints** under **section 77** of the Public Service Employment Act.  
   - Section 77 allows employees to complain about discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment in the workplace.  
   - This right is critical for ensuring accountability and protecting the rights of former military personnel who may face barriers in the public service environment.

3. **Employment Equity Criteria (Section 34 of the PSEA)**  
   - If an advertised internal appointment process involves a **criterion related to belonging to a designated group** under the *Employment Equity Act* (e.g., women, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, visible minorities, persons with disabilities), then:
     - The eligible person **must meet that criterion** to be eligible for the position.  
     - For example, if a job posting requires applicants to be a member of a designated group (e.g., a visible minority), the eligible person must also belong to that group.  
   - This ensures compliance with employment equity laws while maintaining fairness and transparency in hiring.

### **Duration of the Regulations**

- These regulations are **effective upon registration** in the Canada Gazette.  
- They remain in force **until April 1, 2029**.  
- After that date, the provisions will expire, and eligible persons will no longer be entitled to participate in internal appointments or file complaints under section 77 of the PSEA in the same manner.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

- **Supports Transition of Military Personnel**: Recognizes the unique skills, leadership, and discipline of former Canadian Forces members and facilitates their transition into civilian public service roles.
- **Promotes Inclusion and Equity**: By allowing participation in internal processes, the regulations help reduce barriers to entry for individuals with military experience.
- **Ensures Compliance with Employment Equity Laws**: The requirement to meet designated group criteria ensures that employment equity obligations are upheld, even when former military members apply.
- **Provides Legal Clarity and Predictability**: Clearly defines who qualifies and what rights they have, reducing ambiguity in the application process.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Not all former military members qualify**—only those who meet the specific service, release, and registration criteria.
- **Eligibility is time-bound**: The three-year service window (Nov. 13, 2020 – Jan. 18, 2024) is fixed and cannot be extended or adjusted.
- **No automatic employment**: Participation in internal processes does not guarantee employment—only that the individual is treated as a public servant during the selection process.
- **No rights beyond April 1, 2029**: After that date, the provisions cease, and former military members will no longer have these special rights.

### **Conclusion**

The *Eligibility of Certain Former Members of the Canadian Forces Regulations* is a targeted, time-limited policy designed to support the integration of qualified former military personnel into the Canadian public service. By granting them rights to participate in internal appointments and to file complaints under the PSEA—while respecting employment equity requirements—the regulations promote fairness, inclusion, and recognition of military service. However, their effectiveness is confined to a specific time frame (until April 1, 2029), and eligibility is contingent on strict service and administrative criteria.

This regulation reflects a broader government initiative to value the contributions of military veterans and to build a more diverse, skilled, and inclusive public service workforce.
