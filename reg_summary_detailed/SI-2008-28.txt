**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Sale of the Digby Fisherman’s Wharf Remission Order  

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11). This provision allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities and the Treasury Board) to remit (i.e., forgive or cancel) certain public debts when it is determined to be in the public interest.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of this order is to provide a public interest remission of a debt owed by the Maritime Harbours Society to Her Majesty’s Government. The remission is specifically tied to the successful transfer and sale of the Digby Fisherman’s Wharf, a public asset, as part of the broader *Port Divestiture Program*.

**Key Details of the Debt Remission:**  
- **Debtor:** Maritime Harbours Society  
- **Amount Remitted:** $480,500  
- **Origin of Debt:** A debt arising from an agreement signed on **October 21, 1999**, under the framework of the *Port Divestiture Program*. This program was designed to transfer ownership of certain port facilities from government-controlled entities to private or community-based organizations to promote efficiency, accountability, and private sector involvement in port operations.  
- **Nature of the Debt:** The debt represents a financial obligation incurred by the Maritime Harbours Society in connection with the management or operation of the Digby Fisherman’s Wharf prior to its divestiture.

**Condition for Remission:**  
The remission of the $480,500 debt is **not unconditional**. It is contingent upon the Maritime Harbours Society providing **evidence** to the Minister of Transport that:  
> The Digby Fisherman’s Wharf has been **sold to the Digby Harbour Port Association**.

This condition ensures that the remission is tied directly to the successful completion of the divestiture process. It serves as a safeguard to confirm that the public interest objective—transferring the asset to a responsible, community-based entity—has been achieved.

**Public Interest Justification:**  
The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the public interest to grant this remission. This likely reflects a broader policy goal of supporting the privatization or community ownership of port infrastructure, ensuring long-term sustainability, and reducing the government’s financial burden in connection with completed divestiture agreements.

**Significance and Implications:**  
- This order exemplifies how public financial administration can support strategic policy outcomes (such as port reform) by enabling the release of public funds in exchange for verifiable outcomes.  
- It reinforces accountability: the government only forgives the debt if the asset has been successfully transferred to a new, designated entity (the Digby Harbour Port Association), which may be better positioned to manage and operate the wharf.  
- It also demonstrates the use of targeted financial relief to encourage compliance with divestiture objectives.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation grants a debt remission of $480,500 to the Maritime Harbours Society, in recognition of its role in the Port Divestiture Program and the successful transfer of the Digby Fisherman’s Wharf. However, the remission is conditional upon the society providing formal documentation confirming the sale of the wharf to the Digby Harbour Port Association. The decision reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and public policy goals, ensuring that financial relief is tied to verifiable, positive outcomes in the management of public assets.
