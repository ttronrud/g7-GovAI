- **Effective Date**: The fees prescribed in this Order came into effect on **1 April 1982**.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish a clear and standardized fee structure** for private sector entities that request access to **Broadcast Technical Data Services** provided by the Canadian government (specifically, the Department of Communications or its successor agency).

These services are technical in nature and support broadcasting operations, such as receiving, processing, or utilizing technical data related to radio and television transmissions.

---

### **Key Provisions**

#### 1. **Eligibility and Application**
- Any **private entity or individual** that applies to the Minister of Communications for a service listed in **Column I** of the Schedule to this Order must pay the applicable fee **before** the service is provided.

#### 2. **Fee Structure Based on Service Type**
The fees are categorized depending on the nature of the service requested:

| Service Type | Fee Determination |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Initial Subscription** | A one-time fee set in **Column II** of the relevant schedule item. This applies when a user first accesses a technical data service. |
| **Renewal or Update** | A fee set in **Column III** of the schedule item. This applies when a user requests to continue or update an existing subscription. |
| **Special Request** | A fee set in **Column IV** of the schedule item. This applies to non-standard, ad hoc, or custom requests not covered by routine subscriptions or renewals. |

> Example: A company applying to receive technical data on broadcast frequencies for the first time would pay the fee in Column II. If it later requests updated data, it would pay the renewal fee in Column III. If it requests a one-off analysis of a specific transmission, it would pay the special request fee in Column IV.

---

### **Scope of the Services**
- The services are detailed in the **Schedule** attached to the Order.
- The Schedule lists specific technical data services (e.g., transmission parameters, signal coverage, frequency allocations, etc.) and the corresponding fees for each service type.
- The services are intended to support the operations of private broadcasters, broadcasters' affiliates, researchers, and other stakeholders requiring access to official technical data.

---

### **Administrative and Enforcement Implications**
- The Minister of Communications is responsible for:
  - Receiving applications for services.
  - Assessing the nature of the request.
  - Charging the appropriate fee based on the service type (initial, renewal, or special).
- The fees are **non-refundable** unless otherwise specified in the Order or by policy.
- The Order does not require prior approval of the service content; only the payment of the prescribed fee is required before service provision.

---

### **Revocation**
- This Order was **revoked** on **24 June 1985**, under **SOR/85-461, Section 2**.
- The revocation indicates that the regulatory framework for Broadcast Technical Data Services was superseded or replaced by a new policy or legislation, likely due to changes in the broadcasting sector, technological advancements, or shifts in government policy.

---

### **Significance and Historical Context**
- This Order reflects a period in Canadian broadcasting policy when the government maintained direct oversight of technical data provision to ensure equitable access and fair revenue collection.
- It demonstrates early efforts to **commercialize or monetize government technical data**, allowing the public sector to manage costs while enabling private sector participation in broadcasting infrastructure.
- The revocation in 1985 suggests that the model was either outdated, ineffective, or replaced by a more flexible or open-access framework (such as the later development of open data policies or the transition to digital broadcasting).

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Broadcast Technical Data Services Fees Order* (SI/81-19) established a formal, fee-based system for private access to broadcast technical data services, with differentiated charges based on the type of service (initial, renewal, or special request). While it provided clarity and consistency in fee collection, it was ultimately **revoked in 1985**, signaling a shift in how such services were managed—likely toward more open access, digital sharing, or integration into broader regulatory frameworks.

> **Note**: This Order is no longer in force. Any current fees for broadcast technical data would be governed by updated regulations, policies, or service agreements under current broadcasting authorities (e.g., the CRTC or Industry Canada).

**Final Status**: **Revoked (as of 24 June 1985)** – Not applicable in current regulatory practice.
