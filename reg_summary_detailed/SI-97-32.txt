### 6. **Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

#### A. **Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Creditable Periods**
- If a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan during a period of residence in the Philippines:
  - That period is counted as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Philippine employment).
- Conversely, if a person is subject to Philippine legislation during a period of residence in Canada:
  - That period is **not counted** as residence in Canada for the person or their dependants (unless covered by CPP or provincial plan).

#### B. **CPP – Contribution Years**
- A calendar year with **at least 3 months of contributions** under Philippine legislation is considered **one year of CPP contributions**.

#### C. **Philippine Retirement Benefits**
- A CPP creditable year = **12 months of Philippine contributions**.
- A month of OASA creditable period (not part of a CPP year) = **1 month of Philippine contributions**.

> These rules allow for **totalization** of contributions across borders to determine eligibility and benefit amounts.

---

### 7. **Determining Benefit Entitlement**
If a person does **not** meet the minimum creditable period requirement (less than one year):

> The competent institution **shall not be required** to award benefits based solely on periods accumulated under the agreement.

#### For individuals entitled to benefits **only via totalization**:
- **Canada’s calculation method**:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based only on **pensionable earnings under CPP**.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Prorated using the ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period.
    - Maximum ratio = 1 (i.e., no more than full benefit).

- **Philippines’ calculation method**:
  - First, calculate the **theoretical benefit** based on the **minimum required creditable periods**.
  - Then, multiply that by the **ratio of actual completed creditable periods** to the required minimum.

> This ensures **proportional and fair benefit determination** based on actual contributions.

---

### 8. **Minimum Residence Requirements for OASA Benefits**
> A person outside Canada may receive an **Old Age Security (OAS) pension only if**:
- Totalized residence periods (including those under the totalization rules) meet or exceed the **minimum residency requirement** in Canada (e.g., 40 years or 40 months, depending on rules).

> **Spouse’s allowance and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**:
- Paid only to the extent allowed under the OASA (i.e., subject to residency and income limits).

---

### 9. **Administrative Cooperation and Communication**
- The competent authorities must:
  - **Share necessary information** (subject to confidentiality).
  - **Lend good offices** and assist each other in determining or paying benefits, as if it were their own legislation.
  - **Communicate promptly** about legislative changes or administrative measures affecting the agreement.

> **Free of charge** (except where reimbursement is agreed in an administrative arrangement).

> **Confidentiality**: All information exchanged is **confidential** and used **only for implementing the agreement**.

---

### 10. **Tax and Document Exemptions**
- Any **tax, legal dues, consular fees, or administrative charges** provided for in legislation (e.g., for issuing certificates) are **extended** to documents required for the other country’s legislation.

- Communication may occur in **either official language** (English or Filipino).

---

### 11. **Claims and Appeals**
- A claim, notice, or appeal that should have been filed with a competent authority in one country but is filed with the other **within the prescribed time limit** is treated as if it were filed with the **first country**.
- A claim made **after March 1, 1997**:
  - Is deemed to be a claim under the **other country’s legislation**, **if**:
    - The applicant explicitly requests it, or
    - Provides information indicating creditable periods under the other country’s legislation.
