**Detailed Summary of the Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**
These regulations were issued under the authority of **section 637a** and **paragraph 668(a)(b)** of the *Bank Act* (Canada), by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. The regulations were first enacted as part of **S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 42(2)** and **s. 64(1)**, and are further referenced in **S.C. 1991, c. 46**.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and prescribe what constitutes "supervisory information"** related to banks and their affiliates under the *Bank Act*. This information is considered sensitive and confidential, and its disclosure is strictly regulated to protect the integrity of the banking system and ensure sound financial oversight.

---

### **Core Provisions: What Is Prescribed Supervisory Information?**

#### **1. Information Regarding a Bank’s Financial Condition and Risk Ratings**
- **Rating assigned by the Superintendent** of the Bank of Canada to assess the bank’s financial condition.
- Any **other rating** that is **substantially based on information obtained from the Superintendent**, such as credit ratings, liquidity assessments, or risk exposure evaluations.

> *Purpose:* To enable regulators to monitor the health and stability of banks and to identify institutions that may be at risk.

---

#### **2. Stage of Intervention**
- The **stage of intervention** assigned to a bank under the *Guide to Intervention for Federal Financial Institutions*.
- This guide outlines a progressive framework (e.g., early warning, corrective measures, restructuring, or takeover) that banks may be placed into based on deteriorating financial performance or governance issues.

> *Purpose:* To provide transparency into the level of regulatory intervention being applied, allowing for early detection of systemic risks.

---

#### **3. Regulatory Orders, Agreements, and Directions**
- Any **order made under subsection 485(3) of the Bank Act**, which typically involves enforcement actions (e.g., restrictions on dividends, asset sales, or operations).
- Any **prudential agreement** entered into by the bank under **section 644.1** of the *Bank Act* (e.g., agreements to strengthen capital, liquidity, or risk management).
- Any **direction issued under section 645** of the *Bank Act* (e.g., operational or compliance directives).

> *Purpose:* To ensure that banks are aware of and comply with formal regulatory actions, including corrective or restrictive measures.

---

#### **4. Reports and Recommendations from the Superintendent**
- Any **report prepared by or at the request of the Superintendent**, including annual or special examinations, risk assessments, or stress tests.
- Any **recommendation made by the Superintendent** as a result of such reviews.
- Includes **correspondence** between the Superintendent and the bank’s directors or officers.

> *Purpose:* To preserve the confidentiality of internal supervisory findings and ensure that sensitive review outcomes are not prematurely disclosed to the public or third parties.

---

#### **5. Deposit Insurance Premiums (Repealed Provision)**
- *Previously included:* A bank’s classification under the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Differential Premiums By-law**, including:
  - The **category** (e.g., low, medium, high risk),
  - The **premium rate** assigned,
  - The **annual premium** determined.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This provision was **repealed** by **SOR/2011-196, s. 4**. Therefore, **it is no longer applicable** under current regulations.

### **Application to Affiliates of Banks**

These regulations also define supervisory information applicable to **affiliates of banks**, provided the affiliate falls within specific regulatory categories:

| Affiliate Type | Relevant Regulation |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Authorized Foreign Bank (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* |
| Cooperative Credit Association (subject to Cooperative Credit Associations Act) | *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* |

| Bank Holding Company (subject to Bank Act) | *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* |
| Insurance Holding Company (subject to Insurance Companies Act) | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* |

> *Purpose:* To extend supervisory confidentiality requirements to related entities that are subject to similar regulatory regimes, ensuring consistent oversight across the financial group.

---

### **Confidentiality Obligations**

#### **General Prohibition on Disclosure**
- **Subject to sections 3 and 4**, a bank **shall not directly or indirectly disclose** any information prescribed under section 1 (i.e., the supervisory information listed above).

> *Implication:* Banks are prohibited from sharing such information with the public, media, investors, or even non-authorized internal staff without explicit exception.

---

#### **Permitted Disclosure to Specific Parties**
A bank may disclose supervisory information to the following parties **only if** it ensures that the information remains **confidential**:

- **Affiliates** of the bank
- **Directors, officers, employees**
- **Auditors**
- **Securities underwriters**
- **Legal advisors**
- **Those of its affiliates**

> *Condition:* The disclosure must be **limited to necessary purposes** (e.g., internal governance, audit, or legal compliance) and must not result in public exposure.

---

#### **Exception for Material Facts (Securities Law Compliance)**
- A bank or its affiliate may disclose information under **paragraph 1(1)(c)** (specifically, information related to intervention stages, ratings, or orders) **if**:
  - The information contains a **material fact** or **material change**,
  - And such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., Canadian securities regulators or foreign markets).

> *Purpose:* To balance regulatory confidentiality with transparency obligations under securities legislation, ensuring investors are not misled.

---

### **Enforcement and Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- They are subject to **sections 3 and 4** of the *Bank Act*, which typically govern procedural matters such as interpretation, exemptions, and enforcement.

> *Note:* Sections 3 and 4 are not fully detailed here but generally provide for:
> - Interpretation of terms,
> - Exemptions or exceptions,
> - Enforcement mechanisms (e.g., penalties for non-compliance).

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Financial Stability** | By limiting public disclosure of sensitive financial and risk assessments, the regulations help prevent market panic or mispricing due to speculative or premature information. |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Ensures that supervisory findings and interventions are properly managed and protected from misuse or distortion. |
| **Transparency with Accountability** | While confidentiality is maintained, disclosure to auditors, legal advisors, and directors allows for proper internal governance and compliance. |
| **Market Integrity** | The exception for material facts under securities laws ensures that investors receive timely, accurate information when required by law. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations* establish a clear and legally binding framework for **what constitutes confidential supervisory information** related to Canadian banks and their affiliates. The regulations:

- Define specific types of information (ratings, intervention stages, orders, reports) that must remain confidential;
- Allow limited disclosure to internal stakeholders and advisors under strict confidentiality conditions;
- Include a critical exception for disclosures required by securities laws when material facts are involved;
- Are designed to protect the integrity of the banking system while maintaining necessary transparency for accountability and compliance.

These rules are a cornerstone of Canada’s **prudential regulatory framework**, supporting both **financial stability** and **effective oversight** by the Bank of Canada and other financial regulators.

> 🔍 **Important Note:** The provision on CDIC differential premiums has been **repealed** (as of SOR/2011-196, s. 4), so it is **no longer part of the current regulations**. This reflects evolving policy priorities in deposit insurance and risk-based pricing.
