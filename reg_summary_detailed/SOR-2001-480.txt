**Detailed Summary of the *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The *Supervisory Information (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **sections 956a and 978a of the Bank Act**.  
- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183 (amending the Bank Act)  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 46 (original enabling provision)

These regulations establish the types of **supervisory information** that must be treated as confidential and are subject to strict disclosure restrictions for **bank holding companies (BHCs)** and their **affiliates**.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary objective is to **protect sensitive supervisory information** collected by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** (SFI) during regulatory oversight of bank holding companies. This ensures that:
- The financial health, risk profile, and compliance status of BHCs remain confidential.
- Regulatory decisions (e.g., interventions, ratings, enforcement actions) are not exploited for competitive or public advantage.
- The integrity of the supervisory process is preserved.

This aligns with broader prudential and financial stability goals under the Bank Act.

### **3. Prescribed Supervisory Information for Bank Holding Companies (Section 1)**

Under **section 956 of the Bank Act**, the following information is designated as **prescribed supervisory information** in relation to a bank holding company:

#### **(a) Ratings Assigned by the Superintendent**
- Any **rating assigned by the Superintendent** to assess the **financial condition** of the bank holding company.
- Also includes **any other rating** that is **substantially based on information obtained from the Superintendent** (e.g., risk ratings, creditworthiness assessments).

> *Rationale*: Ratings provide critical insight into the stability and risk profile of a BHC and are used to inform regulatory decisions. Public disclosure could distort market perceptions or lead to unfair competitive advantages.

#### **(b) Stage of Intervention**
- Any **stage of intervention** assigned to the bank holding company, based on the **principles outlined in the Guide to Intervention for Federal Financial Institutions**.

> *Intervention stages* may include:
> - Monitoring
> - Warning
> - Restructuring
> - Liquidation
> - Other corrective measures

> *Rationale*: These stages signal the severity of regulatory concern and indicate the level of intervention required. Disclosure could undermine the effectiveness of early warning systems and prompt adverse market reactions.

#### **(c) Regulatory Orders, Agreements, or Directions**
- Any **order made** under **subsection 949(3) of the Bank Act** (e.g., enforcement orders).
- Any **prudential agreement** entered into under **section 959** (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, governance agreements).
- Any **direction issued** under **section 960** (e.g., operational, financial, or governance directives).

> *Rationale*: These instruments represent formal regulatory actions that may affect the BHC’s operations, capital structure, or governance. Disclosure could compromise compliance, deter cooperation, or expose the BHC to reputational harm.

#### **(d) Reports and Recommendations from Supervisory Examinations**
- Any **report prepared by or at the request of the Superintendent**.
- Any **recommendation made** by the Superintendent as a result of:
  - Annual or special examinations
  - Other supervisory reviews
- Includes **related correspondence** with the **directors or officers** of the BHC.

> *Rationale*: These documents contain detailed findings, risk assessments, and recommendations that are central to the regulatory process. Sharing them prematurely could mislead stakeholders or impair the BHC’s ability to respond appropriately.

### **4. Supervisory Information for Affiliates of Bank Holding Companies**

For **affiliates** (subsidiaries or related entities) of a bank holding company, the regulations specify that the following **applicable supervisory information regimes** apply:

| Affiliate Type | Applicable Regulations |
|---------------|------------------------|
| A **bank** to which the Bank Act applies | *Supervisory Information (Banks) Regulations* |
| An **authorized foreign bank** under the Bank Act | *Supervisory Information (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations* |
| A **cooperative credit association** under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* | *Supervisory Information (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* |
| An **insurance company** (company, society, foreign, or provincial) under the *Insurance Companies Act* | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Companies) Regulations* |
| An **insurance holding company** under the *Insurance Companies Act* | *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* |
| A **trust and loan company** under the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* | *Supervisory Information (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* |

> *Rationale*: Since bank holding companies often own or control multiple financial institutions, this ensures that **supervisory information relevant to each affiliate is also protected**, consistent with the regulatory framework applicable to that entity.

---

### **5. Disclosure Restrictions**

#### **General Prohibition (Section 3)**
- **A bank holding company shall not directly or indirectly disclose** any information referred to in **section 1** (i.e., the prescribed supervisory information) **without authorization**.

> *This is a blanket confidentiality requirement* designed to prevent unauthorized public dissemination of sensitive financial and regulatory data.

#### **Permitted Disclosures (Section 4)**
With certain exceptions, disclosure is allowed under the following conditions:

1. **To Affiliates, Directors, Officers, Employees, Auditors, Securities Underwriters, or Legal Advisors**  
   - A BHC may disclose the information to:
     - Its **affiliates**
     - Its **directors, officers, employees**
     - **Auditors**
     - **Securities underwriters**
     - **Legal advisors**
     - Or to those of its affiliates  
   - **Condition**: The BHC must ensure that the information **remains confidential** and is used solely for internal, compliance, or governance purposes.

2. **Disclosure of Material Facts or Changes (Paragraph 1(1)(c))**  
   - A BHC or its affiliate may disclose information under **paragraph 1(1)(c)** (orders, agreements, directions, reports, recommendations) **if**:
     - The information contains a **material fact** or **material change**.
     - Such disclosure is **required by the securities laws** of the relevant jurisdiction (e.g., Canadian securities regulators like the SEC or provincial securities commissions).

> *Example*: If a prudential agreement requires a capital increase, and that increase is a material fact under securities law, it may be disclosed to investors or the public.

> *Note*: This exception is narrowly defined and only applies when disclosure is **legally mandated** by securities legislation.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.

> *This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication*, allowing regulators and financial institutions to comply promptly.
