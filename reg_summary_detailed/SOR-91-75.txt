**Key Condition:**  
- The investment in each such new corporation (i.e., the amount of capital or equity contributed) must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets at the end of its 1990 financial year**.

> ✅ *Example:* If Petro-Canada’s 1990 consolidated gross assets were $10 billion, the maximum investment allowed in any one new subsidiary would be $50 million (0.5%).

---

**Key Condition:**  
- The investment in each such acquisition must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets as of the end of 1990**.

> ✅ *Example:* A share purchase valued at $50 million would be permitted only if Petro-Canada’s 1990 gross assets were at least $10 billion.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The acquisition must be directly related to Petro-Canada’s business objectives.

---

> ✅ *Example:* A $50 million asset purchase is allowed only if the 1990 gross assets of Petro-Canada were $10 billion or more.

- The **proceeds** from each such sale or disposition must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets at the end of 1990**.

> ✅ *Example:* A $50 million sale of a subsidiary’s shares is allowed if Petro-Canada’s 1990 gross assets were $10 billion.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This applies only to sales of shares in wholly-owned subsidiaries, not to third-party investments.

**Key Condition:**  
- The **net worth** (i.e., total assets minus total liabilities) of each subsidiary being dissolved or amalgamated must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets at the end of 1990**.

> ✅ *Exception:* This condition **does not apply** to:
> - Petro-Canada Inc.
> - ICG Propane Inc.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This ensures that only small, low-value subsidiaries are dissolved or merged — protecting larger, core operations.

---

#### 6. **Disposal by Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

**Permitted Activity:**  
Wholly-owned subsidiaries of Petro-Canada may sell or otherwise dispose of:
- Their own shares, or
- All or substantially all of their assets.

- The **proceeds** from each such sale or disposition must **not exceed 0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets at the end of 1990**.

> ✅ *Example:* A subsidiary selling its assets for $50 million is allowed only if Petro-Canada’s 1990 gross assets were $10 billion.

> ⚠️ *Note:* This gives subsidiaries some autonomy to manage their own operations, as long as the financial exposure remains within the cap.

---

### **Key Financial Threshold**

All transactions are governed by a **uniform cap**:
- **0.5% of Petro-Canada Limited’s consolidated gross assets as of the end of its 1990 financial year**.

This cap acts as a **fiscal safeguard** to:
- Prevent large-scale or speculative investments.
- Ensure that any transaction remains within a manageable and predictable financial framework.
- Avoid overexposure or risk to the parent company’s balance sheet.

> 🔍 *Gross assets* typically include total assets such as property, plant, equipment, inventory, receivables, and cash — but exclude liabilities.

---

### **Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

The Order reflects a **pragmatic and risk-managed approach** to corporate governance. By authorizing limited transactions under strict thresholds, the government allows Petro-Canada to:
- Conduct necessary internal restructuring.
- Explore new business opportunities.
- Optimize asset utilization.
- Improve operational efficiency.

At the same time, it **prevents large-scale, uncontrolled expansions or acquisitions** that could pose financial or strategic risks to the federal government or national energy interests.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No authorization** is granted for:
  - Transactions involving third-party investments beyond the 0.5% cap.
  - Acquisitions or sales exceeding the financial thresholds.
  - Transactions not directly related to Petro-Canada’s core business objectives.
- **Exclusions from net worth limits**:
  - Petro-Canada Inc.
  - ICG Propane Inc.

This suggests that these two entities are considered strategically significant and are not subject to the same financial constraints.

---

### **Duration and Applicability**

- The authorization is **limited to the year 1991**.
- It applies only to **Petro-Canada Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiaries**.
- The Order does **not extend** to affiliated companies or non-wholly-owned entities.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Petro-Canada Limited Transactions Authorization Order, 1991** is a targeted, risk-controlled regulatory instrument that enables Petro-Canada to manage internal corporate affairs efficiently and strategically during a specific fiscal period. By setting a clear, uniform financial cap (0.5% of 1990 consolidated gross assets), the Order ensures that all transactions remain financially prudent, transparent, and aligned with public interest and corporate governance standards.

It balances operational flexibility with fiscal responsibility — a hallmark of sound regulatory policy in publicly accountable corporate entities.
