### **3. Prohibited Classes of Applicants**

Effective **June 27, 1985**, the Commission is **prohibited from issuing or renewing** broadcasting licences to applicants belonging to the following **three classes**:

1. **Her Majesty in right of any province**  
   → The provincial Crown itself cannot operate or own a broadcasting licence.

2. **Agents of Her Majesty in right of any province**  
   → Any entity acting on behalf of the provincial government (e.g., Crown agencies) is ineligible.

3. **Municipal governments**  
   → Local governments (e.g., city councils) are barred from holding broadcasting licences.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This prohibition applies to both **initial licensing** and **renewals**.

---

### **4. Exceptions and Exceptions to the Prohibition**

Despite the general ineligibility, **two exceptions** are provided under **section 3** (as referenced in the regulation):

#### ✅ Exception 1: Distribution Undertaking Licences
- The Commission **may issue or renew** a **distribution undertaking licence** (not a broadcasting licence) to:
  - An applicant from the class described in paragraph 3(c) (i.e., an "independent carrier" meeting the independence criteria), **or**
  - An applicant that is **directly controlled by a municipal government’s governing body**, **if**:
    1. A refusal to issue or renew would be **contrary to the public interest**, and  
    2. The programming under the licence would provide a **reasonable opportunity for the expression of differing views on matters of public concern**.

> This exception allows for **limited municipal involvement** in distribution, particularly if it serves public interest and promotes diversity of opinion.

#### ✅ Exception 2: Public Interest Justification
- The Commission retains discretion to grant licences when **public interest** outweighs the general rule.

---

### **5. Limitations and Scope of the Direction**

- **No Limitation on Other Classes:**  
  The Direction **does not restrict** the Governor in Council from:
  - Prohibiting broadcasting licences for **other classes of applicants** (e.g., private companies, foreign entities).
  - Making decisions to **refuse licences or renewals** for any applicant not falling under the defined ineligibility classes.

- **Commission’s Authority Remains Intact:**  
  The CRTC retains full power to:
  - Refuse to issue or renew broadcasting licences for any applicant,
  - Make decisions based on public interest, diversity, and editorial independence.

> This ensures that the CRTC is not bound by the ineligibility rules in all cases—only that **provincial and municipal governments** (and their agents) are barred from direct ownership or operation of broadcasting services.

### **6. Key Policy Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Preserve Editorial Independence** | Prevents government-owned or -controlled broadcasters from having unchecked editorial power, which could compromise media diversity and free expression. |
| **Promote Public Interest and Diversity** | Encourages independent, non-governmental broadcasters to serve public needs, especially in education and community programming. |
| **Protect Educational Programming** | Supports specialized educational content through independent corporations, which are subject to oversight by provincial authorities. |
| **Avoid Government Monopoly in Broadcasting** | Prevents provinces and municipalities from using broadcasting as a tool for political influence or control. |
| **Balance Public Service and Government Control** | Allows limited exceptions (e.g., distribution licences) when public interest demands it. |

---

### **7. Historical Context and Significance**

- The original direction (C.R.C., c. 377) was issued in **1985** and was based on concerns about **government control** of media.
- This revision **modernizes and clarifies** the rules, especially in light of:
  - The evolution of telecommunications (e.g., the *Telecommunications Act* of 1996),
  - The rise of digital media and public service broadcasting,
  - Growing concerns about **media independence and bias**.
- The distinction between **independent carriers** and **municipal governments** reflects a nuanced approach: some forms of municipal involvement are allowed if they meet strict **independence and editorial freedom** criteria.

---

### **8. Practical Impact**

- **Broadcasting companies owned by provinces or municipalities** cannot apply for new or renewed broadcasting licences.
- **Private companies** and **independent corporations** remain eligible.
- **Educational programming** can be delivered through independent corporations, under provincial oversight.
- **Distribution rights** (e.g., cable or satellite distribution) may still be granted to municipal entities under strict conditions.

---

### **9. Citation and Legal Status**

- The new direction may be cited as:  
  **Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility to Hold Broadcasting Licences)**  
- It is binding on the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)**.
- It operates **in addition to** the general powers of the CRTC under the *Broadcasting Act*.

## ✅ Summary in One Paragraph

This regulation revokes an outdated directive and establishes a new rule under the *Broadcasting Act* that **prohibits the issuance or renewal of broadcasting licences to Her Majesty in right of any province, agents of the Crown, and municipal governments**, effective June 27, 1985. It defines key terms such as "independent carrier" and "independent corporation" to allow exceptions when editorial independence and public interest are preserved. While provincial and municipal entities are barred from owning broadcasting stations, limited exceptions exist for **distribution undertakings** where a refusal would harm the public interest and where diverse public views are promoted. The regulation ensures media independence, supports educational programming, and preserves the CRTC’s authority to act in the public interest, while clearly delineating who may and may not operate in the broadcasting sector.
