### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **fee remission** (i.e., a reduction or waiver of fees) for certain export certificate fees in Canada, specifically for export certificates issued between **October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2011**. The remission is introduced because the collection of the full fees associated with these certificates was deemed **unreasonable and unjust** by the government.

The objective is to provide **financial relief** to exporters and stakeholders who may have been disproportionately affected by the cost of export certification, particularly in light of the economic conditions and administrative burdens during that period.

### **Scope of the Remission**

The remission applies to the **portion of the fee that exceeds $75.00** for specific export certificate fees. This means:

- If a fee under the applicable provisions of the *Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) Fees Notice* (Part 11, Table to Part 11) was **greater than $75.00**, the **excess amount above $75.00** is waived.
- The remission **does not apply** to the base $75.00 portion; only the amount above that threshold is remitted.

#### **Specific Fee Provisions Covered:**
The remission applies to fees under the following sections or items of the CFIA Fees Notice, specifically in Part 11:

- Paragraph 21(4)(a) or (6)(a)  
- Subparagraph 21(6)(b)(i)  
- Subitem 22(3) or (5)  
- Subsection 23(2) or (5)  
- Subsection 24(4) or (5)  
- Subsection 25(3), (4), or (7)  
- Subsection 26(3)  
- Item 29 of the table in Part 11  

These provisions relate to fees associated with the issuance of export certificates for agricultural and food products, such as meat, dairy, poultry, and other animal products.

### **Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to a **key condition**:

> The inspection on the basis of which the export certificate is issued **must be carried out by an accredited veterinarian**, as defined in **Section 2 of the Health of Animals Regulations**.

This ensures that only certificates issued based on **valid, compliant, and officially recognized veterinary inspections** are eligible for the remission. It maintains the integrity of the certification process and ensures that the waived fees do not apply to certificates issued without proper oversight.

---

### **Time Period of Application**

The remission applies **only to export certificates issued during the period:**

- **October 1, 2009, to September 30, 2011**

This is a **limited-time policy**, indicating that the remission is a one-time or transitional measure to address concerns about fee fairness during that specific timeframe. It does not extend to certificates issued before or after this period.

---

### **Key Implications**

1. **Financial Relief:** Exporters and certifying bodies are relieved of the excess fee burden, which may have otherwise been a significant cost, especially for small or medium-sized businesses.
2. **Regulatory Integrity:** The requirement that the inspection be conducted by an accredited veterinarian ensures that the remission does not undermine food safety or animal health standards.
3. **Policy Justification:** The government explicitly recognizes that collecting the full fees during this period was **unreasonable and unjust**, reflecting a policy shift toward fairness and affordability in export processes.
4. **Targeted Application:** The regulation is narrowly focused—only specific fees, specific product categories, and a defined time frame are covered—ensuring it does not broadly affect other regulatory fees.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally based fee remission designed to correct what was deemed an unjust financial burden on exporters during a specific period. By waiving the portion of export certificate fees above $75.00—only when the inspection is conducted by an accredited veterinarian—it balances economic fairness with regulatory compliance and food safety standards.

It reflects a proactive approach by the federal government to ensure that agricultural export processes remain accessible and equitable, particularly during periods of economic or operational stress.
