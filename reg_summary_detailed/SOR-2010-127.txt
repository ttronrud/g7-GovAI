## 🌍 **Establishment of the NORDREG Zone**

The **Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone (NORDREG Zone)** is established to enhance maritime safety, environmental protection, and traffic management in remote and challenging northern waters.

It includes the following areas:

1. **Shipping Safety Control Zones**  
   – As prescribed in the *Shipping Safety Control Zones Order* (existing zones with defined traffic control).

2. **Waters outside shipping safety control zones** in:
   - **Ungava Bay**
   - **Hudson Bay**
   - **Kugmallit Bay**

3. **James Bay**

4. **Koksoak River**, from Ungava Bay to Kuujjuaq

5. **Feuilles Bay**, from Ungava Bay to Tasiujaq

6. **Chesterfield Inlet** (excluding areas within shipping safety control zones), and **Baker Lake**

7. **Moose River**, from James Bay to Moosonee

> ✅ This zone covers a vast, sparsely populated, and environmentally sensitive region of northern Canada, where navigation presents unique challenges due to ice, weather, and remote infrastructure.

## 🚢 **Classes of Vessels Subject to Reporting Requirements**

Vessels that fall into **any of the following categories** are required to comply with reporting obligations under **sections 126(1) and (126(3))** of the *Canada Shipping Act*:

1. **Vessels of 300 gross tonnage (GT) or more**  
2. **Towing or pushing vessels** where the **combined gross tonnage** (vessel + towed vessel) is **500 GT or more**  
3. **Vessels carrying:**
   - A **pollutant** or **dangerous goods** as cargo, or
   - A vessel being towed/pushed that carries such cargo

> ⚠️ These vessels are considered high-risk due to environmental, safety, or operational concerns.

---

## 📝 **Reporting Obligations for Vessels in the NORDREG Zone**

All vessels of the prescribed classes must comply with specific reporting requirements. Each report must:

- Begin with the prefix **"NORDREG"**
- Be followed by one of the following **report type indicators**:
  - **SP** = Sailing Plan Report  
  - **PR** = Position Report  
  - **FR** = Final Report  
  - **DR** = Deviation Report  

---

### 📄 1. **Sailing Plan Report (SP)**

**When Required:**
- When a vessel is **about to enter** the NORDREG Zone  
- **More than one hour but not more than two hours before departure** from a berth within the zone (unless moving to another berth in the same port)  
- **Immediately before getting underway** if:
  - The vessel has been **stranded**
  - Has **stopped due to a breakdown** in main propulsion or steering system
  - Has been **involved in a collision**

**Required Designators (by scenario):**
| Scenario | Required Designators |
|--------|------------------------|
| Entry into zone (1a) | A, B, C or D, E, F, G, H, I, L, O, P, Q, S, T, W, X |
| Departure from berth (1b) | A, B, C or D, H, I, L, O, P, Q, S, T, W, X |
| After breakdown/stranding/collision (1c) | A, B, C or D, I, L, O, P, Q, S, T, W, X |

**Exemptions:**
- If entering directly from the **Eastern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone** and has a **clearance under paragraph 126(3)(a)** of the Act → **O, Q, T** are not required  
- If no change from the previous SP report → **O, P, Q, S, T, W, X** are not required (only if information has not changed)

**Additional Information Required in SP Report:**
- **Amount of oil** on board (for fuel or cargo)
- **Arctic Pollution Prevention Certificate** (if held by owner or master)

**Additional Reports (as soon as feasible):**
If the vessel becomes aware of any of the following **within or approaching** the NORDREG Zone:
- Another vessel in **apparent difficulty**
- An **obstruction to navigation**
- An **aid to navigation** that is:

  - Damaged
  - Out of position
  - Missing
- **Hazardous ice or weather conditions**
