**Detailed Summary of the Hampton Place and Taylor Way Remission Order**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The Hampton Place and Taylor Way Remission Order is issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders for the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of taxes in the public interest, particularly when it serves to promote economic or social objectives.

This specific order is part of **S.C. 1991, c. 24, section 7(2)**, which establishes the legal foundation for the remission of certain excise taxes in relation to the purchase of condominium units.

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this remission order is to provide **tax relief** to purchasers of specific condominium units located on leased strata lots in designated areas. The remission applies only to the **excise tax component** of the tax payable under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which generally relates to the taxation of certain property transactions, including the purchase of residential real estate.

The remission is intended to **promote housing affordability and access**, particularly in specific urban or high-demand areas such as those along Hampton Place and Taylor Way, where property prices may be high and the cost of ownership burdensome.

**Scope of the Remission:**

- **Eligible Purchasers**: The remission applies to the **purchaser of a condominium unit**.
- **Location Requirements**:
  - The condominium unit must be located at a **municipal address** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** attached to the Order.
  - The unit must be situated on a **leased strata lot** as indicated in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- **Tax Component Covered**: The remission covers the **amount of excise tax** that would have been payable under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** in respect of the purchase of that unit.
- **Key Condition**: The remission is **only granted if no tax was payable** in the first place. That is, the purchaser was not required to pay the excise tax under Part IX—meaning the tax amount being remitted is zero or otherwise non-applicable.

> *Clarification*: The phrasing "for which no tax was payable" suggests that the remission applies only to transactions where the excise tax under Part IX was not due—possibly due to exemptions, thresholds, or other statutory provisions. This may indicate a targeted policy to support low- or moderate-income buyers or those purchasing in specific types of strata properties.

**Conditions for the Remission:**

1. **No Prior Rebate or Credit**:
   - The purchaser must **not have previously received** any rebate, credit, or remission of the same tax amount. This ensures that the remission is not double-applied or used as a form of repeated financial benefit.

2. **Timely Written Claim**:
   - A **written claim** for the remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue**.
   - The claim must be made **within two years** of the date the Order comes into effect.

> This time limit ensures administrative feasibility and accountability, and prevents claims from being made decades later without justification.

---

**Key Implications:**

- The remission is **not a refund of the tax** in the traditional sense; rather, it is a **formal cancellation or forgiveness** of a tax obligation that was never due or was otherwise non-applicable.
- It is a **one-time, targeted benefit**, limited to specific properties and specific transaction types.
- The Order reflects a **public interest justification**, emphasizing affordability and accessibility in housing markets.
- It is **not available to all condominium buyers**—only those meeting the exact geographic and property criteria outlined in the schedule.

---

**Limitations and Exclusions:**

- The remission does **not apply to**:
  - Purchases of units not listed in the schedule.
  - Units not on leased strata lots.
  - Transactions where excise tax under Part IX was actually payable.
- It does **not extend to other taxes** such as property tax, income tax, or capital gains tax.
- The benefit is **non-transferable**—it applies only to the purchaser of the unit.

**Conclusion:**

The Hampton Place and Taylor Way Remission Order is a targeted, one-time tax relief measure designed to support affordability in specific residential real estate transactions. It provides a formal remission of the excise tax under Part IX of the Excise Tax Act for qualifying purchasers of condominium units located on leased strata lots in specified areas, provided that no tax was originally due and a claim is submitted within two years. The Order underscores the federal government’s role in using fiscal policy to promote equitable access to housing, particularly in urban centers where property costs are high. It operates within a clear legal framework and includes safeguards to ensure fairness, transparency, and fiscal accountability.
