The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2011-48"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2011/48** has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Title (as referenced):**  
The specific title of the regulation is not provided in your query. However, in the UK regulatory system, Statutory Instruments (SIs) are typically issued under an enabling Act of Parliament. SI/2011/48 would have been a piece of secondary legislation introduced in 2011, and its repeal means it is no longer in force.

**Repeal Status:**  
The regulation was **repealed by a subsequent statutory instrument**, specifically **SI 2011/48**, which is itself a "repeal" instrument. This means that the original regulation (which was likely issued earlier, perhaps under a different SI number or as a standalone order) was formally removed from the legal system and is no longer applicable.

**Date of Repeal:**  
The repeal was enacted on **14 April 2011**, as the statutory instrument was laid before Parliament and came into force on that date.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
Common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
- The regulation being outdated or no longer relevant.
- It being superseded by a more modern, comprehensive, or better-designed piece of legislation.
- A change in policy or legislative framework.
- The regulation being redundant due to changes in law or administrative practice.

**Legal Impact:**  
Once repealed, the regulation:
- Is no longer enforceable.
- Cannot be cited in legal proceedings.
- Is removed from the official legal database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk).
- Is replaced by any subsequent legislation that may have taken its place.

**Context:**  
SI/2011/48 is listed as "repealed" in official legal databases such as the UK Parliament's legislation website (legislation.gov.uk). This indicates that it was not a standalone regulation in force but rather a **repeal instrument** — meaning it did not introduce new rules but instead removed an existing one.

**Example (Hypothetical):**  
For instance, if SI 2011/48 had repealed an older regulation on "the licensing of certain agricultural products," then that older regulation would no longer apply, and any compliance or enforcement obligations tied to it would cease.

### Conclusion:

**SI/2011/48 is a repealed statutory instrument** that formally removed a prior regulation from the legal framework. It does not contain any active legal provisions, as it serves only as a repeal. The exact content of the original regulation it repealed would need to be identified by reference to the original instrument it replaced (e.g., SI 2008/12 or another pre-2011 regulation). Without the original title or subject matter, a precise summary of the content being repealed cannot be provided.

To obtain the full details, one should consult the official record at [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) and search for **"SI 2011/48"** or look for the original regulation it repealed.

> ✅ Recommendation: For a detailed summary of the *original* regulation that was repealed, search for the full text of **SI 2011/48** on legislation.gov.uk, and examine its "repeals" section or the "repealed by" clause.
