#### Key Reasons for the Order:

- This reflects the **legal and policy imperative to protect Aboriginal rights and title**, particularly in relation to land use and control in the South Slave Region.

> The Order specifically targets the **Central and Eastern Portions of the South Slave Region**, a geographically and culturally significant area with deep ties to Indigenous communities, especially the **Athabasca Denesuline**.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under:
- **Section 58 of the Northwest Territories Act**, which empowers the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to consult with relevant parties before making land-related decisions.
- **Paragraph 56(b) of the NWT Act**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council to make orders restricting the issuance of interests in public lands when such restrictions are necessary for the settlement of Aboriginal land claims or implementation of agreements.

Additionally, the Minister has **consulted**:
- The **member of the Executive Council responsible for public lands**.
- **Any affected Aboriginal party**, including the Athabasca Denesuline and other Indigenous groups.

This consultation ensures **legitimacy, transparency, and respect for Indigenous rights** and is a key component of the **modern reconciliation framework** in Canada.
