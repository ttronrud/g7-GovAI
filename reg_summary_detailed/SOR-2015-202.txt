**Detailed Summary of the Red Tape Reduction Regulations (S.C. 2015, c. 12)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Red Tape Reduction Regulations*, made under **section 7 and 10 of the Red Tape Reduction Act (RTRA)**, provide a detailed framework for assessing, measuring, and managing the administrative burden imposed by federal regulations on businesses. These regulations establish a systematic and transparent method for calculating the cost of administrative compliance, mandate timely review and potential amendment or repeal of burdensome regulations, and require reporting on regulatory changes that reduce or increase such burdens.

The goal is to promote **efficiency, transparency, and accountability** in regulatory governance by ensuring that new or amended regulations do not impose excessive or unnecessary administrative costs on businesses—particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

## **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

### **1. Definitions**

- **Activity**:  
  Any task or process that a business must perform to demonstrate compliance with a regulation.  
  *Examples*: Submitting forms, conducting audits, maintaining records, reporting data, or attending meetings.

- **Period**:  
  A defined interval of time during which a business is expected to complete an activity in accordance with a regulation.  
  *Example*: A quarterly reporting period or a fiscal year.

---

### **2. Calculation of Total Number of Periods**

To determine the total number of periods over which an activity is expected to occur, the following formula is applied:

> **Total number of periods = (Number of times per year the activity is required) × 10**

This means the calculation spans **10 years** from the date the regulation is registered.  
*Purpose*: This provides a long-term, realistic view of the cumulative administrative burden over a meaningful business lifecycle.

---

### **3. Formula for Calculating Administrative Burden Cost**

The **cost of administrative burden** (as defined under section 5 of the Act) is calculated as the sum of the costs of all activities expected to be completed in the first 10 years after a regulation is registered.

For each specific period, the cost is calculated using this formula:

> **Activity Cost = (Labour Hour Cost) × (Hours Required) × (Number of Businesses) × (Period Factor)**

Where:

- **Labour Hour Cost** = Estimated hourly wage required to complete the activity, **adjusted to 2012 price levels** using the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** published by Statistics Canada (CANSIM Table 326-0021), updated periodically.  
  *Purpose*: Ensures cost comparisons are inflation-adjusted and consistent over time.

- **Hours Required** = The estimated number of hours a business needs to spend per period to complete the activity successfully.

- **Number of Businesses** = The estimated number of businesses that must complete the activity during that period.

- **Period Factor** = A multiplier based on the specific period (out of the total 10-year period) being evaluated.  
  *Example*: If the regulation is registered in 2015, and we are assessing the cost for the first year (2015), the period factor is 1/10.

- **Times per year** = How frequently the activity is required (e.g., annually, quarterly).

- **Year of Registration** = The year the regulation comes into force.

> **Total Administrative Burden Cost** = Sum of activity costs across all periods (from Year 1 to Year 10).

*This cost is used to assess whether a regulation imposes an excessive administrative burden on businesses.*

### **4. Timeline for Regulatory Review and Action**

- **Mandatory Review Period**:  
  A regulation that imposes a **new administrative burden** must be **amended or repealed within 24 months** of its registration date.

- **Offsetting Burdens**:  
  If a prior regulation was **amended or repealed** before a new one is introduced, and that prior change **offsets or reduces** the cost of the new burden, then **no further amendment or repeal is required** under section 5(1) of the Act.

- **Repeal of Prior Regulation**:  
  If a regulation was **repealed before** a new one imposing a burden is introduced, then **no new repeal is required** under section 5(2) of the Act.

> *Rationale*: Prevents redundant or overlapping regulatory actions and avoids unnecessary regulatory churn.

---

### **5. Scope of Application**

- Section 5 of the Act applies to **any regulation that is made, amended, or repealed after March 31, 2012**.

> *Note*: This ensures the framework is applied to modern regulatory activity, aligning with the intent of the Red Tape Reduction Act to modernize and streamline regulation post-2012.

---

### **6. Exemptions from Section 5**

The **Treasury Board** may exempt a regulation from the application of section 5 of the Act (i.e., from the cost calculation and 24-month review requirement) if:

1. **Tax or Tax Administration**:  
   The regulation relates to taxation or tax administration (e.g., income tax reporting, GST/HST compliance).

2. **International or Legal Obligations**:  
   Her Majesty in Right of Canada has **no discretion** to modify the regulation due to:
   - International obligations (e.g., trade agreements, international sanctions)
   - Legal requirements (e.g., Supreme Court of Canada decisions)
   - Implementation of international sanctions

3. **Emergency, Unique, or Exceptional Circumstances**:  
   If compliance with section 5 would:
   - Compromise **public health**
   - Threaten **public safety**
   - Harm the **Canadian economy**

> *Note*: Exemptions are narrowly defined and require justification. They are intended to protect critical national interests from being undermined by overly burdensome compliance requirements.

---

### **7. Annual Reporting Requirements**

The **annual report** (as required under section 9 of the Act) must include:

1. A **summary of changes** in the total cost of administrative burden resulting from regulatory changes made under section 5 of the Act during the **12-month period ending March 31** of the year in which the report is published.

   - This includes both **increases** and **decreases** in administrative costs.
   - The report must clearly show trends and identify major shifts.

2. The **number of regulations** that were:
   - Amended
   - Repealed
   - As a result of regulatory changes under section 5 of the Act

> *Purpose*: Increases transparency and accountability. Stakeholders (e.g., businesses, industry groups, the public) can assess whether the government is effectively reducing red tape.

### **8. Entry into Force**

These Regulations come into force on the **day they are registered**.

## **Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reduce Administrative Burden** | Quantifies the cost of compliance to identify and eliminate unnecessary or excessive regulatory requirements. |
| **Improve Regulatory Transparency** | Provides a clear, standardized method for calculating and reporting regulatory costs. |
| **Encourage Proactive Reform** | Mandates timely review and potential repeal of burdensome regulations within 24 months. |
| **Protect Critical Areas** | Exemptions for tax, international obligations, and emergencies ensure essential functions are not disrupted. |
| **Enhance Accountability** | Annual public reporting ensures stakeholders can monitor progress and outcomes. |

## **Practical Implications for Businesses and Regulators**

- **For Businesses**:  
  Can now better estimate and compare the administrative costs of complying with different regulations. Helps in strategic planning and resource allocation.

- **For Regulators (Treasury Board, Departments)**:  
  Must conduct cost-benefit analyses before introducing new rules. Must document and justify any exemptions. Must track and report changes annually.

- **For Public Accountability**:  
  The annual report allows civil society, industry associations, and the media to evaluate the effectiveness of red tape reduction efforts.

## **Conclusion**

The *Red Tape Reduction Regulations* represent a significant step toward **modern, evidence-based, and business-friendly regulation** in Canada. By introducing a rigorous, standardized, and transparent method for measuring and managing administrative burden, the regulations ensure that federal regulations are not only legally sound but also economically efficient and responsive to the needs of Canadian businesses.

The framework balances the need for regulatory oversight with flexibility in exceptional circumstances and protects essential areas such as taxation and international commitments. Combined with mandatory reporting, it creates a powerful tool for continuous improvement in regulatory governance.
