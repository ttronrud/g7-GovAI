**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Orders, Decorations and Medals Directive, 1998 (SI/90-161)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Canadian Orders, Decorations and Medals Directive, 1998* (SI/90-161), made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, establishes a **formal and hierarchical order of precedence** for the wearing of Canadian and foreign orders, decorations, and medals. This directive provides clear guidelines for how these honors are worn on uniforms, in official settings, and in public recognition, ensuring consistency and respect across the Canadian civil service, military, police, and provincial institutions.

The directive was issued to **standardize the display of honors** and to clarify the **relative precedence** among various awards — both domestic and international — particularly in cases where individuals may have received multiple honors from Canada and other countries.

Importantly, this directive **repeals the previous version** of the Canadian Orders, Decorations and Medals Directive, which had been issued in 1967, and replaces it with a more comprehensive, updated, and clearly structured framework.
