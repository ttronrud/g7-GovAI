**Detailed Summary of the Agents’ Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations (S.C. 1986, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Agents’ Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations* (commonly referred to as the "Agents’ Regulations") were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, under subsection 10(3) of the *Customs Act*. These regulations came into force upon the coming into effect of subsection 10(3) of the *Customs Act*, which was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on March 22, 1986.

The purpose of these regulations is to **define and restrict the circumstances under which a person may act as an agent for the accounting of imported goods and the payment of customs duties** under Section 32 of the *Customs Act*. The regulations establish clear eligibility criteria to ensure that only qualified and properly authorized individuals or entities can perform such duties, thereby maintaining compliance, accountability, and integrity in Canada’s customs system.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### **1. Eligibility to Act as an Agent Under Section 32 of the Customs Act**

Under the regulations, a person may **only account for goods and pay duties** under Section 32 of the *Customs Act* **if one of the following two conditions is met**:

##### **Condition 1: Licensed Customs Broker**
- The person must be **licensed to transact business as a customs broker** under subsection 9(1) of the *Customs Act*.
- This means the individual or entity must have obtained formal authorization from the Minister of National Revenue to operate as a customs broker.
- Licensing ensures that the agent has the necessary knowledge, training, and compliance history to handle import documentation, duty calculations, and customs procedures.

> *Rationale*: Licensing provides a regulatory safeguard to ensure that only professionals with the required expertise and accountability can manage customs-related financial and administrative obligations.

##### **Condition 2: Casual, Uncompensated Service**
- A person may act as an agent **on a casual basis** (i.e., not regularly or systematically) **without receiving any compensation, fee, or charge**.
- This provision allows individuals to assist with import duties in limited, ad hoc situations — for example, a friend or family member helping with a one-time shipment.
- However, this exception is strictly limited:
  - The assistance must be **temporary and incidental**.
  - No financial benefit (such as a fee, commission, or reimbursement) can be derived from the service.
  - The agent must not be engaged in a recurring or commercial role.

> *Rationale*: This exception prevents abuse of the system by individuals who may otherwise exploit the agent role for personal gain, while still allowing limited, non-commercial assistance.

### **Exclusion of Other Agents**

The regulations **explicitly exclude** individuals or entities who:
- Are not licensed customs brokers, and
- Are providing services on a regular, ongoing, or commercial basis (even if they are not charging fees).

Such persons **cannot legally account for imported goods or pay duties** under Section 32 of the *Customs Act*.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations are made **pursuant to subsection 10(3) of the Customs Act**, which grants the Minister of National Revenue the authority to prescribe rules governing the accounting and payment of duties.
- The decision to adopt these regulations followed a **public consultation process**:
  - A draft version of the proposed regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on March 22, 1986.
  - Interested parties (e.g., businesses, legal professionals, customs stakeholders) were given a **reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections**.
  - The Minister of National Revenue reviewed these submissions and recommended the final version to the Governor General in Council for approval.

This procedural step ensures transparency, stakeholder engagement, and accountability in the legislative process.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The regulations came into force **on the date that subsection 10(3) of the Customs Act came into effect**.
- This ensures that the rules are implemented in alignment with the broader amendments to the *Customs Act* that enabled the agent-based duty payment framework.

### **Significance and Purpose**

1. **Enhanced Accountability**  
   By restricting who can act as an agent for duty payment, the regulations reduce the risk of fraud, misrepresentation, or improper financial dealings in the import process.

2. **Professional Standards**  
   Requiring licensing for customs brokers ensures that only trained and regulated professionals handle high-stakes customs matters, including duty calculations and compliance.

3. **Prevention of Abuse**  
   The casual, uncompensated exception is narrowly defined to prevent individuals from using the agent role for personal profit or to circumvent regulatory requirements.

4. **Clarity and Legal Certainty**  
   The regulations provide clear, unambiguous criteria for who can legally act as an agent, reducing ambiguity in commercial and legal practice.

---

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- The regulations **do not apply** to all types of import activities. For example, duties may still be paid directly by the importer or owner of the goods under other provisions of the *Customs Act*.
- The "casual basis" exception is not intended to create a general license for unlicensed individuals to act as agents — it is a narrow, exceptional provision.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Agents’ Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations* serve as a critical component of Canada’s customs framework by:

- Establishing a clear legal boundary for who may act as an agent in the accounting and payment of import duties,
- Ensuring that only licensed professionals or individuals acting without financial benefit can perform these functions,
- Maintaining the integrity of the customs system through accountability, transparency, and compliance.

These regulations remain a foundational rule in Canada’s customs administration and continue to inform how agents operate within the import process today, especially in relation to licensing and duty payment obligations.

**Note**: While the regulations were enacted in 1986, they remain relevant in modern customs practice, particularly in defining the scope of agent authority and the requirements for customs brokerage. Subsequent amendments or updates may have been introduced in later years, but the core principles established in this regulation remain influential.
