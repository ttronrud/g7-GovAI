**Detailed Summary of the Mobile Offshore Drilling Units Remission Order, 2004**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The *Mobile Offshore Drilling Units Remission Order, 2004* was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 1997, c. 36). This provision allows for the granting of remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duties on certain temporary imports of specific types of equipment.

---

### **2. Scope of the Order: Definition of "Mobile Offshore Drilling Units"**
The Order defines *mobile offshore drilling units* as follows:

- **Drilling platforms** classified under **tariff item 8905.20.10** of the Customs Tariff.
- **Jack-ups, drill ships, and semi-submersibles** classified under **tariff item 8905.90.10** of the Customs Tariff.

These units are considered essential for offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities.

> *Note:* The term "unités mobiles de forage au large" is the French translation of the definition, indicating the bilingual nature of Canadian regulatory language.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Remission**
The primary objective of this Order is to **grant remission of customs duties** (after any applicable reductions under the *Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations*) on the **temporary importation** of mobile offshore drilling units into Canada.

This remission is intended to:
- Support Canada’s offshore energy sector by reducing financial barriers to entry.
- Encourage exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in Canadian waters.
- Promote economic activity related to oil and gas in a temporary, non-permanent import context.

### **4. Conditions for Remission**
Remission is **not automatic** and is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

#### **Condition 1: Use Restriction**
The mobile offshore drilling units must be used **exclusively** for:
- **Exploration**
- **Delineation** (i.e., drilling a conduit or well *after* an initial exploration well to determine the size, volume, and extent of a hydrocarbon reservoir)
- **Development** of an offshore project

> *Clarification:* "Delineation" is specifically defined as drilling a well *after* an exploration well to define the reservoir’s characteristics. This ensures that the activity is directly tied to resource assessment and planning.

#### **Condition 2: Timeframe of Temporary Importation**
The units must be **temporarily imported into Canada** during the period:
- **From May 4, 2004, to May 4, 2014**, inclusive.

This 10-year window reflects a targeted policy to support offshore drilling activities during a critical phase of Canada’s energy development.

#### **Condition 3: Evidence Requirement**
Importers must **file evidence** with the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** to demonstrate eligibility for remission. This may include:
- Proof of the unit’s intended use (exploration, delineation, or development)
- Documentation showing the temporary nature of the import
- Compliance with the defined usage restrictions
- Any other information required by the CBSA to verify eligibility

#### **Condition 4: Claim Deadline**
A **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** **before May 4, 2016**.

> *Note:* This deadline provides a clear, fixed window for claim submission, ensuring accountability and administrative closure of the remission program.

---

### **5. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which typically occurs shortly after its publication.

---

### **6. Key Implications and Context**
- **Temporary Importation**: The units are not permanently imported; they are brought in for a specific, time-limited purpose (exploration, delineation, or development), and must be exported again after their use.
- **Duty Reduction**: The remission applies *after* any reductions provided under the *Vessel Duties Reduction or Removal Regulations*, meaning it does not fully eliminate duties but significantly reduces them.
- **Economic and Strategic Rationale**: The Order supports Canada’s strategic interests in offshore energy by reducing the cost of entry for drilling equipment, thereby encouraging investment in offshore hydrocarbon projects.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: The requirement for evidence and a claim submission ensures that the remission is not misused and remains targeted to legitimate offshore exploration activities.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The remission **does not apply** to units used for non-offshore or non-drilling purposes.
- It is **not available** for imports outside the specified time frame (2004–2014).
- The claim must be filed within a strict deadline (before May 4, 2016), meaning that any importation after that date is no longer eligible.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Mobile Offshore Drilling Units Remission Order, 2004* is a targeted, time-limited regulatory measure designed to facilitate the temporary importation of offshore drilling equipment into Canada. By exempting qualifying units from customs duties during a defined period (2004–2014), the Order supports Canada’s offshore energy development goals while ensuring that the benefits are used for legitimate exploration and reservoir delineation activities. The conditions—specific use, time limits, evidence submission, and claim deadlines—ensure that the remission is both effective and accountable.

This Order remains a key instrument in Canada’s approach to managing temporary imports of specialized industrial equipment for energy exploration.
