The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2015-98" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 98 of 2015 has been officially repealed.

However, without the full title or content of the original regulation (which would normally be included in the reference), a detailed summary cannot be provided. Statutory instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation introduced under the authority of an Act of Parliament, and SI/2015-98 would have been one such piece of legislation.

When a regulation is marked as "Repealed," it means that it is no longer in force. The repeal is typically enacted by a subsequent statutory instrument or by amendment to a primary law. The repeal may be due to:

- Obsolescence (the regulation is no longer relevant)
- Legislative consolidation (to simplify or streamline laws)
- Inconsistency with newer legislation
- A decision to replace it with a more modern or effective version

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

1. The full title of the statutory instrument (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2015 (SI 2015/98)")
2. The enabling Act (the primary legislation under which it was made)
3. The subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.)
4. Key provisions or objectives of the original regulation
5. The date of repeal and the instrument that repealed it (if known)

Since only "Repealed, SI/2015-98" is provided, and no further details are available in the query, the most accurate summary is:

**Summary:**

SI/2015-98 is a statutory instrument that has been formally repealed. This means the regulation is no longer in force and does not apply. The repeal was enacted through another statutory instrument or legislative action, likely to remove outdated, redundant, or conflicting provisions. Without the full title or content of the original regulation, a detailed analysis of its provisions, scope, or impact cannot be offered. To obtain a precise summary, the original title and content of SI/2015-98 must be accessed through official legislative databases such as the UK Statutory Instruments database (https://www.legislation.gov.uk) or the relevant national legislation repository.

If you can provide the full title or subject of SI/2015-98 (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2015"), I would be able to offer a detailed and accurate summary.
