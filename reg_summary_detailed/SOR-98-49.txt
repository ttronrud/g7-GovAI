**Detailed Summary of the NAFTA Marking Determination, Re-determination and Further Re-determination Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations are part of Canada’s implementation of the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**, specifically addressing the **marking requirements** for goods imported from NAFTA countries (Canada, the United States, and Mexico). The regulations were developed to ensure that imported goods are properly marked with required information, as mandated under the **Customs Act**.

- The regulations are **not required to be published** under subsection 164(3) of the Customs Act because they give effect to a public announcement made on **October 27, 1997**, and are therefore exempt by virtue of **paragraph 164(4)(a.2)a** of the Act. This exemption allows for a faster administrative process without the need for a formal publication in the Canada Gazette.

- The regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, pursuant to:
  - Subsection **57.01(1)c** of the Customs Act (authority to determine marking of goods),
  - Subsection **61(2)d** of the Customs Act (authority to make re-determinations or further re-determinations),
  - Paragraph **164(1)(i)e** of the Customs Act (general authority to make regulations).

### **2. Scope and Purpose**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish a clear process for determining whether goods imported from NAFTA countries have been properly marked** in accordance with **section 35.01 of the Customs Act**. This section requires that goods imported from a NAFTA country be marked with the **name of the country of origin** (e.g., "Made in Mexico") or the **name of the country of origin** in a way that is clearly visible and legible.

The regulations define the **authorities, procedures, and sources of information** that customs officers may use when evaluating whether marking requirements have been met.

### **3. Determination of Proper Marking**

An officer designated by the Minister may determine whether goods are properly marked by reviewing and analyzing any of the following materials:

1. **Advance rulings** issued under section 43.1 of the Customs Act or by the customs administration of a NAFTA country (other than Canada), which provide guidance on marking requirements.

2. **Previous determinations, re-determinations, or further re-determinations** made under the Customs Act regarding:
   - Marking,
   - Tariff classification, or
   - Origin of goods imported from a NAFTA country.

3. **Judicial decisions** from:
   - The **Canadian International Trade Tribunal**,
   - The **Federal Court**, or
   - The **Supreme Court of Canada**,  
   in cases involving goods from NAFTA countries.

4. **Reports prepared by an officer** during the initial examination of goods under subsection 99(1) of the Customs Act.

5. **Samples of the goods** taken by an officer during examination under subsection 99(1).

6. **Information provided by the person who accounted for the goods**, as required under section 32 of the Customs Act (i.e., the importer, exporter, or producer).

7. **Any other relevant information** provided by the importer, exporter, or producer regarding the marking of the goods.

> This comprehensive list ensures that customs officers have access to both administrative and judicial precedents, as well as factual evidence, to make informed decisions about compliance with marking requirements.

### **4. Notification Requirements**

- The officer responsible for making a marking determination **must provide written notice** to:
  - The **importer**,
  - The **exporter**, and
  - The **producer** of the goods.

- This notification ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to understand whether their goods meet the marking requirements and to take corrective action if necessary.

- For **re-determinations or further re-determinations** (i.e., when a previous marking determination is changed), the **Deputy Minister** is responsible for providing notice to the same parties (importer, exporter, producer).

> These notification requirements promote accountability and provide a mechanism for parties to respond to any changes in marking status.

### **5. Repeal Clause**

The regulations contain a **repeal clause** indicating that they **replace or supersede any previous regulations** on the same topic that may have existed prior to their enactment.

### **6. Effective Date**
