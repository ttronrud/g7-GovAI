**Detailed Summary of the Non-Public Funds Staff Exclusion Approval Order**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

This regulation, formally titled the *Non-Public Funds Staff Exclusion Approval Order*, is a statutory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission (PSC). Its primary purpose is to **exclude certain employees and positions within the "Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces" from the scope of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**.

The PSC determined, after careful review, that:

- It is **not practicable** to apply the full provisions of the Public Service Employment Act to the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces.
- It is **not in the best interests of the Public Service** to do so.
- Applying the PSEA in these cases would create operational, administrative, or strategic challenges that would undermine the unique nature and functions of the Canadian Forces’ non-public funds staff.

Therefore, the PSC concluded that a **specialized regulatory framework** is required to govern the appointment, employment, and management of these personnel.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is issued under two specific provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:

- **Section 39**: Grants the Governor General in Council the authority to **approve or ratify decisions** made by the Public Service Commission regarding the exclusion of certain positions or employees from the application of the PSEA.
- **Subsection 35(1)**: Authorizes the Commission to **make regulations** concerning the appointment of individuals to positions within the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces.

These provisions provide the legal foundation for both the **exclusion** of these employees from the PSEA and the **creation of specific appointment rules** tailored to this unique group.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **A. Exclusion from the Public Service Employment Act**

- **Scope of Exclusion**: All positions and employees of the *Staff of the Non-Public Funds, Canadian Forces* are **exempted from the operation of the Public Service Employment Act**.
- **Effective Date**: The exclusion takes effect immediately upon issuance of the Order.
- **Nature of Exclusion**: This is not a blanket dismissal or termination of employment, but rather a **determination that the PSEA does not apply** due to structural, functional, or operational differences between the Canadian Forces’ non-public funds staff and the general public service.

> *Note*: The exclusion applies to all positions and employees within the Staff of the Non-Public Funds, which typically includes personnel involved in financial, administrative, or support functions that operate outside of the traditional public service budget and oversight mechanisms (e.g., funds managed by the Department of National Defence that are not subject to the Public Service Budget or Treasury Board controls).

#### **B. Appointment Regulations**

- The Order includes **annexed regulations** that establish specific rules governing:
  - The **eligibility criteria** for appointment to positions in the Staff of the Non-Public Funds.
  - The **process for recruitment and selection**, including qualifications, experience, and background checks.
  - The **terms and conditions of appointment**, which may differ from those under the PSEA (e.g., tenure, promotion, performance evaluation).
  - **Procedural safeguards** to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in appointments.
- These regulations are designed to ensure that appointments are made in a manner consistent with the **unique mission, structure, and operational needs** of the Canadian Forces, while still maintaining standards of integrity and merit.

### **4. Strategic Rationale**

The decision reflects a recognition that:

- The Canadian Forces operate under a **distinct institutional framework** with different accountability structures, mission priorities, and operational demands.
- The Staff of the Non-Public Funds often manages sensitive financial or logistical operations that require **greater flexibility and autonomy** than what the PSEA provides.
- Applying the PSEA in these areas could:
  - Impede operational efficiency.
  - Create administrative burdens.
  - Undermine military command and operational decision-making.

By excluding these positions from the PSEA, the government affirms that the **Canadian Forces’ non-public funds staff are governed by a separate, mission-specific framework** that better serves national security and operational effectiveness.

---

### **5. Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Separation of Public Service and Military Functions**: This Order reinforces a clear distinction between the civilian public service and the military, particularly in financial and administrative roles.
- **Accountability**: While excluded from the PSEA, these employees are still subject to **other applicable laws and oversight mechanisms**, such as military discipline, internal audit, and financial regulations.
- **Transparency and Fairness**: The annexed appointment regulations ensure that appointments are made through **transparent, merit-based processes**, even outside the PSEA framework.
- **Potential for Future Review**: The exclusion is not permanent and may be reviewed periodically by the Public Service Commission to assess whether changes in circumstances warrant reapplication of the PSEA.

---

### **6. Citation and Enforcement**

- The Order is officially cited as:  
  **The Non-Public Funds Staff Exclusion Approval Order**.
- It is enforceable under the authority of the Public Service Employment Act and is binding on all relevant departments and agencies responsible for appointments and employment within the Canadian Forces’ non-public funds staff.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order represents a **strategic and administrative decision** to tailor employment governance to the unique context of the Canadian Forces’ non-public funds staff. By excluding these positions from the Public Service Employment Act and establishing specific appointment regulations, the government ensures:

- Operational effectiveness and flexibility in the military.
- Compliance with legal and institutional standards.
- A clear, principled boundary between civilian public service employment and military administrative functions.

It reflects a balance between **operational necessity** and **public service accountability**, demonstrating how public service law can adapt to the distinct needs of specialized government institutions.
