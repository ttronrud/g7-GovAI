**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled the **Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Levies Order** and may be cited as such. It establishes a framework for the collection of marketing levies on hogs marketed for slaughter in Saskatchewan.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency in its application:

- **Act**: Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972* of Saskatchewan (Loi), which provides the legal foundation for the regulation and the operation of the hog marketing system.

- **Assembly Yard**: Premises where producers can deliver their hogs for temporary holding, processing, or auctioning. These are central to the distribution and marketing chain.

- **Assembly Yard Operator**: The individual or entity that owns or operates an assembly yard. They play a role in collecting and remitting levies when hogs are auctioned.

- **Commission**: The **Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Commission**, established under the Act and the associated Marketing Plan. The Commission is responsible for administering the levy system, collecting funds, and ensuring compliance.

- **Hog**: Any member of the species *Sus scrofa L.* (domestic pig) produced in Saskatchewan. This includes all stages of pig development from birth to slaughter.

- **Plan**: The *Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the rules, service charges, and operational guidelines for hog marketing, including the structure of levies.

- **Processor**: Any person engaged in processing hogs (e.g., butchering, rendering) or using hogs in manufacturing processes.

- **Producer**: Broadly defined to include:
  - Individuals or businesses engaged in producing or feeding hogs and making them available for slaughter;
  - Leasers or agreement holders who are entitled to a share of hogs produced or fed by a producer;
  - Individuals who take possession of hogs under a security agreement (e.g., for debt repayment).

- **Small Processor**: A processor that, in the prior calendar year, processed **less than 2% of all hogs slaughtered in Saskatchewan**, based on reports published by the **Department of Agriculture of Canada**. This category is treated differently in terms of levy collection.

---

### **3. Levy Structure and Payment Obligations**

#### **(a) Producer Levies**
- Every **producer** who markets a hog for slaughter must pay an additional **marketing levy of $0.80 per hog**.
- This levy is **in addition to** any service charges outlined in the Marketing Plan.
- The levy is **deducted directly from the payment** the producer receives from the Commission.

> *Purpose*: To generate revenue for the Commission to support market stability, research, and marketing efforts related to hog production in Saskatchewan.

#### **(b) Small Processor Obligations**
- A **small processor** that purchases hogs **directly from a producer** must:
  - Deduct the $0.80 levy per hog from the payment due to the producer.
  - Remit the full levy amount to the Commission **on a monthly basis**.

> *Rationale*: Ensures small processors contribute to the marketing fund without disrupting the producer’s income stream. Monthly remittance improves transparency and timely collection.

#### **(c) Assembly Yard Operator Obligations**
- Any **assembly yard operator** who conducts an **auction of sows** must:
  - Deduct the levy (at $0.80 per sow) from the proceeds paid to the producer.
  - Remit the collected levy to the Commission **on a monthly basis**.

> *Note*: The levy applies to sows, not to marketable hogs. This reflects the Commission’s interest in managing breeding stock and ensuring long-term sustainability of the hog industry.

### **4. Exemptions**

The levy **does not apply** to producers in the following situations:

1. **Holding a Dispensation Certificate**  
   - Producers who hold a certificate issued under **Section 8 of the Saskatchewan Hog Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations** are exempt.  
   - This typically applies to producers engaging in interprovincial or export sales under special arrangements.

2. **Slaughtering Hogs for Personal Consumption**  
   - A producer may slaughter a hog for their own personal use (e.g., family consumption). No levy applies.

3. **Selling to a Consumer for Consumption**  
   - If a producer sells a hog directly to a consumer for personal consumption, the levy is waived.

4. **Selling to a Commission-Designated Research Processor**  
   - Hogs sold to a processor specifically designated by the Commission for **research purposes** are exempt.

5. **Marketing Specific Classes of Hogs**  
   The levy does **not apply** to any of the following classes of hogs:
   - **Breeding stock** (e.g., sows and boars used for reproduction)
   - **Weanling pigs** (young pigs that have been weaned)
   - **Feeder pigs** (pigs raised for growth before slaughter)
   - **Boars** (male pigs used for breeding)

> *Note*: These exemptions are designed to protect the breeding and rearing stages of the hog lifecycle, which are critical for long-term industry sustainability and genetic management.

### **5. Key Provisions and Implications**

- **Revenue Generation**: The levy system ensures a stable, predictable revenue stream for the Commission to fund marketing, research, and industry development initiatives.
  
- **Fair Distribution**: The levy is collected at the point of sale or delivery (via processors or assembly yards), ensuring that all market participants contribute based on their involvement in the supply chain.

- **Exemptions Protect Core Industry Functions**: By excluding breeding stock and feeder pigs, the regulation avoids penalizing producers who are investing in future production cycles.

- **Compliance Mechanism**: The requirement to deduct and remit levies monthly ensures accountability and transparency in the collection process.

- **Small Processor Inclusion**: Recognizing that small processors may have limited capacity, the regulation provides a clear, manageable process for them to contribute.

---

### **6. Legal and Regulatory Context**

- This Order operates **under the authority of the Natural Products Marketing Act, 1972**, and is aligned with the broader **Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Plan**.
- It is a **subordinate regulation** that implements specific financial and operational rules within the framework of the Act.
- The Commission has the authority to interpret and enforce this Order, including determining eligibility for exemptions.

### **Conclusion**

The **Saskatchewan Hog Marketing Levies Order** establishes a structured, equitable, and industry-responsive system for collecting marketing levies on hogs marketed for slaughter. It ensures that producers, processors, and assembly yard operators contribute to the sustainability and development of Saskatchewan’s hog industry while protecting critical aspects of pig production such as breeding and early-stage rearing. The exemptions are carefully targeted to avoid disrupting essential agricultural functions and to support both economic efficiency and long-term industry health.

This regulation plays a vital role in maintaining market stability, funding research, and promoting responsible hog marketing practices in Saskatchewan.
