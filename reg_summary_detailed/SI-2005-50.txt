**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47)**

---

**Regulation Background and Purpose:**

The regulation, found in *Statutes of Canada 1991, Chapter 24, Section 47*, is a directive issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board) under **section 157a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. Its primary purpose is to **discontinue the requirement** for certain annual reports to be prepared and laid before either House of Parliament.

This action is taken because the information contained in these specific reports is either:

- **Already included** in the Public Accounts of the Government, or  
- **Already available** in the official estimates of expenditures submitted to Parliament.

In other words, the reports in question do not provide new or additional information that Parliament needs to assess government spending, financial accountability, or performance. Since their content is redundant or redundant in substance, they are deemed unnecessary and therefore discontinued.

**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Applicable Documents:**  
   The regulation specifically targets two annual reports:
   - *Annual Report on the Operations of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency*  
     (under the *Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act*, S.C. 1997, c. 6, s. 23)
   - *Annual Report on the Operations of the Parks Canada Agency*  
     (under the *Parks Canada Agency Act*, S.C. 1998, c. 31, s. 34)

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   The directive is issued pursuant to **section 157a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council to determine which documents required by statute to be laid before Parliament may be discontinued if they contain no additional information beyond what is already available in the Public Accounts or expenditure estimates.

3. **Effect of the Regulation:**  
   - The two annual reports listed in the schedule are **discontinued**.  
   - No further preparation or submission of these reports is required.  
   - These reports are **no longer required to be laid before either House of Parliament**.

4. **Reasoning:**  
   The Governor in Council finds that the information in these reports is either:
   - **Identical** to that contained in the Public Accounts or  
   - **Less comprehensive** than the information already provided in those official documents.

   This redundancy undermines the efficiency of parliamentary oversight and increases administrative burden without adding value to transparency or accountability.

**Implications and Significance:**

- **Streamlining Parliamentary Oversight:**  
  By eliminating redundant reports, the government reduces duplication and ensures that Parliament receives only the most essential and distinct financial and operational information.

- **Cost and Efficiency Gains:**  
  The discontinuation saves public sector resources in terms of preparation, review, and legislative processing.

- **Accountability and Transparency:**  
  While the reports are discontinued, the underlying operations of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Parks Canada are still subject to oversight through other mechanisms, such as:
  - Annual reports submitted to the Minister (not to Parliament)
  - Budgetary and performance reporting in the Public Accounts
  - Ongoing audits and reviews by the Auditor General

- **Legal Compliance:**  
  The regulation ensures compliance with the Financial Administration Act by ensuring that only documents providing *new or necessary information* are required to be presented to Parliament.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a practical and fiscally responsible decision to eliminate redundant parliamentary reporting. It reflects a broader trend in government accountability reform—where efficiency and relevance are prioritized over volume. By discontinuing two annual operational reports that duplicate existing information in the Public Accounts, the federal government enhances transparency, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures that Parliament receives only the most valuable and actionable financial and performance data.

The directive remains valid and enforceable under the Financial Administration Act and continues to serve as a model for future reviews of statutory reporting requirements.
