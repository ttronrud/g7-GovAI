**Detailed Summary of the *Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and are designed to implement the *Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Act* (Act), establishing the rules governing contributions, payment plans, default, and benefit provisions for former Lieutenant Governors who served prior to December 2, 1975.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Act* (Loi).  
- **Minister**: The President of the Treasury Board, responsible for administering the regulations.  
- **Prior Service**: Service as a Lieutenant Governor of a province *prior to December 2, 1975*. This is the only service period covered under these regulations.

---

### **3. Payment of Contributions for Prior Service**

#### **(a) Election to Pay in Instalments**
- A contributor (former Lieutenant Governor) may choose to pay contributions for prior service in **monthly instalments** instead of a single lump sum.
- **First instalment**: Due at the end of the month in which the contributor submits their election to the Minister.
- **Subsequent instalments**: Paid monthly thereafter during the contributor’s lifetime.
- **Final instalment**: May be less than previous ones (no requirement for equal payments at end).

#### **(b) Total Payment Requirement**
- The total amount owed must be fully paid within **20 years**, calculated using the **Canadian Life Tables 1970–72**.
- Interest is charged at **4% per annum** on the outstanding balance during this period.

#### **(c) Amendments to Payment Plans**
Contributors may amend their payment plan at any time, provided the following conditions are met:
1. The **total amount** is still paid within the 20-year period using Canadian Life Tables (1970–72), with **4% interest**.
2. The amendment may take one of three forms:
   - Pay any remaining instalments in a **lump sum**;
   - Increase monthly instalments (on a recalculated basis as of the amendment date); or
   - Combine a lump sum with monthly instalments (on a recalculated basis), and pay within the **same or a shorter period** than previously agreed.

> *Note: Amendments must maintain the 20-year payment window and 4% interest.*

#### **(d) Increasing Instalments with Medical Certification**
If a contributor chooses to increase monthly payments, they must:
- Ensure the **total amount** is paid within 20 years (using 1970–72 Life Tables) with 4% interest; **and**
- Pass a **medical examination** within the time frame prescribed by the Minister.

> This provision allows flexibility for contributors in better health or with higher income, but requires medical validation to justify increased payments.

---

### **4. Default on Payment**

If a contributor fails to pay an instalment:
- The amount in default **plus 4% interest per annum** must be paid:
  - **In a lump sum upon demand**, or
  - **In monthly instalments** for the **lesser of**:
    - The contributor’s life; or
    - The remaining duration of the original 20-year payment period.
- Payments are calculated using the **Canadian Life Tables 1970–72**, and interest continues to accrue at 4% per annum.

> *Default is treated seriously, with immediate enforcement options.*

---

### **5. Election Deadline and Default Procedure**

- If a contributor **fails to make an election within 30 days** of a demand for payment (under section 4(a)), the default payment method applies (i.e., lump sum or monthly instalments as elected by the contributor).

---

### **6. Benefit Reservations When Pension is Received**

If a contributor becomes entitled to a benefit (e.g., pension) **before** all instalments are paid:
- The unpaid instalments may be **reserved out of the benefit**:
  - In the case of a **lump sum benefit**: Reserved as a lump sum immediately.
  - In the case of **any other benefit** (e.g., pension):
    - Reserved as a lump sum immediately, or
    - Reserved via monthly instalments for the **lesser of**:
      - The contributor’s life; or
      - The remainder of the original 20-year payment period.
- The contributor chooses the method of reservation.

> This ensures that the full financial obligation is met even if the benefit is received early.

---

### **7. Death and Posthumous Payment**

If a contributor dies and the amount due (with interest) remains unpaid:
- The **personal representative** of the contributor must pay the amount **immediately** upon demand.
- If not paid, the Minister may **recover the amount** from the **surviving spouse** who receives a pension under the Act:
  - By **lump sum immediately**, or
  - By **installments for a term set by the Minister**, as the spouse elects.
- Interest continues to accrue at **4% per annum** from the date of demand.

> This protects the state’s financial interest in the event of death.

---

### **8. Interest on Late Payments**

- Any amount paid **after the due date** incurs **4% interest per annum** from the due date until the date of payment.
- **Exceptions to interest**:
  - If the full amount is paid **before a demand is made** under sections 4–6 → **no interest**.
  - If the amount (including interest) is paid in full **within 30 days of demand** → **no interest**.
  - If a contributor authorizes deductions from their benefit and those deductions are **not made**, and this causes default → **no interest** on the amount not deducted.

> These exceptions provide relief in cases of timely or proactive payment or administrative oversight.

---

### **9. Timing of Demand**

- A demand by the Minister is deemed to have been made on the **day the letter is placed in the mail** (not the day it is received).

---

### **10. Flexibility in Payment**

- A contributor is **not prohibited** from paying any amount **before it is due**.
- Early or voluntary payments are allowed and encouraged.

---

### **11. Medical Examination Requirement**

- Before becoming entitled to a pension under the Act due to **disability**, a contributor must undergo a **thorough physical examination**.

> This ensures that pension entitlements are only granted to those who meet health standards.

---

### **12. Forms for Elections**

Two official forms are provided in **Schedules I and II**:

#### **Schedule I – Election to Contribute (Prior Service)**
- Form to elect to contribute to the superannuation fund for prior service.
- Allows the contributor to:
  - Elect to contribute for the **full period** of prior service, or
  - Elect for **part of the most recent period** of service (specifying dates or duration).
- Specifies the payment method:
  - Lump sum, or
  - Monthly instalments of a specified dollar amount deducted from salary.
- Must be signed and witnessed by the Lieutenant Governor.

#### **Schedule II – Election Not to Contribute**
- Form to **opt out** of contributing under the Act.
- Key points:
  - The contributor **loses eligibility** for benefits under the Act (except for a **return of contributions** under sections 4, 5, or 13 — without interest).
  - The election is **irrevocable**.

> This gives a clear, final choice for those who do not wish to participate in the superannuation scheme.
