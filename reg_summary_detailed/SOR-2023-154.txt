**Detailed Summary of the Administrative Monetary Penalties (Motor Vehicle Safety) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The *Administrative Monetary Penalties (Motor Vehicle Safety) Regulations* are made under the authority of **paragraphs 16.1(a)a and (b)a of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act (MVA)**. This authority enables the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to establish a formal administrative penalty regime for violations of specific provisions of the Act and its associated regulations or orders.

These regulations **complete and operationalize** the administrative monetary penalty (AMP) scheme established in the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The scheme allows for the imposition of financial penalties (fines) on individuals or organizations that contravene designated safety-related provisions without requiring a criminal prosecution.

### **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Motor Vehicle Safety Act* (S.C. 1993, c. 16; S.C. 2018, c. 2, s. 15).
- The regulations apply to **contraventions** of specific provisions listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**.
- These contraventions may be treated as **"violations"** under **Sections 16.13 to 16.23** of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which govern the administrative penalty process.
- The regulations also include certain **orders made under specific sections** of the Act (e.g., sections 8.1(1), 10(2.1), 10(4), 10.1(4), 10.1(7), 10.4(4), 10.5, 10.6(1), 10.61(1), 13(1), 13.1, 15(4)(e), and 15.1) as being eligible for penalty under the same administrative framework.

### **3. Penalty Structure (Maximum Fines)**

The maximum penalty amounts depend on whether the violator is an **individual** or a **corporation/company**:

| **Type of Violator** | **Maximum Penalty** |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Individual**       | The amount specified in **Column 2** of the Schedule |
| **Corporation or Company** | The amount specified in **Column 3** of the Schedule |

> ⚠️ **Note**: The penalty amounts in Column 2 and Column 3 are not explicitly listed in the provided text, but they are referenced as being part of the schedule. These amounts are typically set at lower levels for individuals and higher levels for businesses, reflecting the principle of proportionality.

### **4. Special Provisions with Fixed Maximum Penalties**

In addition to the general schedule-based penalties, the regulations specify a **fixed maximum penalty** for certain specific provisions of the Act or its orders. For these, the maximum penalty is:

- **Individual**: **$4,000**
- **Corporation or Company**: **$200,000**

These fixed penalties apply to violations arising from:
- Orders made under:
  - Subsections 8.1(1), 10(2.1), 10(4), 10.1(4), 10.1(7), 10.4(4)
  - Section 10.5
  - Subsections 10.6(1), 10.61(1)
  - Section 13(1)
  - Section 13.1
  - Paragraph 15(4)(e)
  - Section 15.1

> This indicates that for these particular types of orders (e.g., those related to vehicle inspections, safety compliance, or enforcement actions), the penalty framework is more clearly defined and capped, ensuring transparency and predictability.

### **5. Enforcement and Process**

- Violations under these regulations are processed through the **administrative penalty process** outlined in **Sections 16.13 to 16.23** of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
- This process typically involves:
  - A notice of violation
  - An opportunity to respond or defend
  - A hearing (if required)
  - A decision by an authorized officer or body
  - Payment of the penalty if found liable

This process is designed to be **efficient, cost-effective, and accessible**, allowing for swift resolution of safety-related non-compliance without the need for court involvement.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force **90 days after the day they are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.

> As noted in the text, these regulations were **in force as of October 3, 2023**, which implies they were published in the Gazette in early September 2023.

### **7. Regulatory Context and Significance**

- These regulations **enhance enforcement** of motor vehicle safety standards by introducing a clear, predictable, and proportionate penalty system.
- They support the government’s broader goals of:
  - Ensuring road safety
  - Promoting compliance with vehicle safety standards
  - Reducing the risk of accidents due to unsafe vehicles
- The use of administrative penalties helps to **reduce the burden on the justice system** while maintaining accountability for safety violations.
