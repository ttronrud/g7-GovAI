### **Detailed Summary of the Industrial Hemp Regulations (S.C. 2018, c. 16)**

These regulations, made under **subsection 139(1) of the Cannabis Act**, establish the framework for the legal cultivation, processing, importation, exportation, and commercialization of **industrial hemp** in Canada. Industrial hemp is defined as a cannabis plant — or any part of it — in which the concentration of **delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)** is **0.3% w/w or less** in the flowering heads and leaves. Importantly, this determination must account for the **potential conversion of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) to THC**, ensuring that the final THC level remains within the legal limit.
