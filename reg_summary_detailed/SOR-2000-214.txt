**Detailed Summary of the Stranded Steel Wire Remission Order (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Stranded Steel Wire Remission Order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**. This section empowers the federal government to grant remissions (i.e., refunds or waivers) of customs duties for specific goods under certain conditions, typically to support economic or industrial interests.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (refund) customs duties** that were previously paid or were payable under the Canadian Customs Tariff for a specific type of imported steel product. Specifically, the remission applies to:

- **Non-alloy steel stranded wire**  
- With a **diameter of 5 mm or less**  
- Classified under **subheading 7312.10** of the Customs Tariff  
- Imported into Canada during a defined period:  
  **From July 10, 1996, to June 16, 1999**  
- **Intended solely for use in the manufacture of tires**

This targeted relief recognizes the importance of stranded steel wire in the tire manufacturing industry and aims to reduce costs for Canadian producers in this sector during a specific timeframe.

---

**3. Scope and Eligibility**  
The remission applies **only** to:
- Goods meeting the exact product description (non-alloy steel stranded wire, ≤5 mm diameter)
- Imported within the specified period (July 10, 1996 – June 16, 1999)
- Used exclusively in the **manufacture of tires**

The Order does not extend to other types of wire, other diameters, or other end uses (e.g., construction, electrical applications).

---

**4. Conditions for Claiming Remission**  
To qualify for the remission, importers must satisfy two key conditions:

**a. Timely Claim Submission**  
An importer must **file a claim for remission with the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.  
- The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (not necessarily the date of publication).  
- This two-year window is critical—claims submitted after this period will not be accepted.

**b. Submission of Required Evidence**  
Importers must provide **evidence to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)** to verify their eligibility. This may include:
- Import documentation (e.g., invoices, bills of lading)
- Proof of use in tire manufacturing (e.g., production records, material usage logs)
- Certification from the manufacturer or supplier confirming the product’s use in tire production

The CCRA may request additional documentation to confirm that the wire was used in tire manufacturing and not diverted to other purposes.

---

**5. Financial Impact**  
The remission results in a **refund of customs duties** that were originally assessed and paid on the imported stranded steel wire. This provides financial relief to companies involved in tire manufacturing, potentially improving their competitiveness and reducing production costs.

---

**6. Duration and Limitations**  
- The remission is **not retroactive** beyond the specified import period (July 10, 1996 – June 16, 1999).  
- It is **not available for future imports** or for goods imported outside the defined period.  
- The Order is **limited in scope** to the specific product, diameter, tariff subheading, and end use.

---

**7. Enforcement and Oversight**  
- The **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)** is responsible for verifying claims and ensuring compliance with eligibility criteria.  
- The CCRA may audit or investigate claims to confirm that the imported wire was actually used in tire manufacturing.  
- Failure to meet the conditions (e.g., late claim or lack of supporting evidence) will result in denial of remission.

---

**Conclusion**  
This Stranded Steel Wire Remission Order is a targeted, time-limited fiscal measure designed to support the Canadian tire manufacturing industry by refunding customs duties on a specific imported material. It reflects a balance between regulatory oversight and economic support, ensuring that only eligible, properly documented claims are processed. The two-year deadline for claim submission underscores the importance of timely action by importers and reinforces the need for accurate record-keeping.

This Order remains a relevant example of how Canadian customs policy can be used to support specific industrial sectors through targeted duty relief.
