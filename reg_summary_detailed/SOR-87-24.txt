The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2007-128, section 408**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2007-128**, specifically **section 408** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect in **2007**, as indicated by the year in the statutory instrument reference (SOR/2007-128).
- **Nature of the Regulation**: While the specific content of the original regulation is not provided in the text, the repeated references suggest that this was a provision (likely a rule or directive) previously issued under a broader regulatory framework—possibly related to licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—commonly found in provincial or federal regulatory statutes in Canada.
- **Reason for Repeal**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, regulations are often repealed for reasons such as:
  - Obsolescence (outdated or no longer relevant),
  - Merger with another regulation,
  - Replacement by a more modern or comprehensive rule,
  - Legislative amendment or streamlining of regulatory frameworks.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated lines (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2007-128, s. 408]") are likely a formatting or technical error in the original source, possibly due to a copy-paste issue or data duplication.
- The fact that the same line is repeated 11 times does not imply multiple distinct regulations or different provisions—it simply indicates that the repeal applies to a specific section (section 408) of a statutory instrument.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** as of 2007 under **SOR/2007-128, section 408**. As such, it is **no longer in force** and should not be applied or referenced in current legal or administrative practice. Any legal or compliance obligations previously derived from this regulation are now superseded by subsequent legislation or regulations.
