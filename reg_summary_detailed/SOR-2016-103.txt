**Detailed Summary of the Cigarette Ignition Propensity (Consumer Products) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The *Cigarette Ignition Propensity (Consumer Products) Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. This provision empowers the government to establish regulations related to the safety of consumer products, including cigarettes, to protect public health and safety.

**Regulation Number and Citation**  
The regulations are formally published as **S.C. 2010, c. 21**, and came into force on **November 17, 2016**, following a 180-day registration period after their publication.

### **Definition of "Cigarette"**  
The term *cigarette* is defined in the regulations as:  
> "any roll or tubular construction that contains tobacco, has a wrapper or cover made of paper and is consumed through the inhalation of the products of combustion."

**Exclusions**:  
- The regulations **do not apply** to:  
  - **Bidi**  
  - **Cigar**  
  - **Little cigar**  
  - **Kretek**  

These products are excluded because they are not considered cigarettes under the regulatory definition.

### **Scope of Application**  
The regulations apply to **all commercially sold cigarettes** in Canada, regardless of brand or size. However, there are **specific exclusions**:

1. **Cigarettes imported for research, laboratory testing, or analysis** are exempt from these regulations.  
   - This means that organizations conducting scientific or quality control testing may import cigarettes without being subject to the ignition propensity requirements.

2. **All cigarettes of every size and brand must meet the ignition propensity standard** when tested under specified conditions.

### **Ignition Propensity Standard**  
The core safety requirement is that **cigarettes must burn their full length no more than 25% of the time** during standardized testing.

#### Testing Methodology:
- The test is conducted according to the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 12863**, titled:
  > *Standard test method for assessing the ignition propensity of cigarettes*  
- The standard is applied as amended from time to time (i.e., updated versions remain valid).
- The test uses **10 layers of filter paper** to simulate real-world conditions and assess how easily a cigarette ignites during normal use.

#### Key Requirements:
- **All cigarettes tested in a single determination must be of the same size and brand.**  
  - This ensures consistency and fairness in testing and prevents manipulation of results through size or brand variation.
- The term *determination* in this context is defined **exactly as in ISO 12863**, meaning a single, controlled test run under standardized conditions.

### **Enforcement and Compliance**  
- Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of cigarettes must ensure that their products meet the ignition propensity standard before they are placed on the market.
- Compliance is mandatory for all cigarettes sold to consumers in Canada.
- The standard aims to reduce the risk of unintended ignition (e.g., during storage, handling, or use), which could lead to fire hazards or burns—particularly in homes or public spaces.

---

### **Effective Date**  
The regulations came into force **180 days after the day of registration**.  
- Registration occurred on **November 17, 2010** (based on the S.C. 2010, c. 21 citation).  
- Therefore, the effective date was **March 17, 2011**.  
- However, the note in the document states: *"Regulations in force November 17, 2016"* — this likely reflects a **renewal or clarification of enforcement**, or a date when the regulations were officially implemented or reaffirmed in practice. This may indicate that the regulations were re-activated or made fully operational on that date, possibly due to policy updates or enforcement priorities.

---

### **Purpose and Public Health Rationale**  
The primary goal of these regulations is to **enhance consumer safety** by preventing cigarettes from igniting easily during normal use.  
- A cigarette that ignites prematurely or frequently poses a fire hazard, especially in homes, vehicles, or public areas.  
- By limiting ignition to no more than 25% of the time, the regulations aim to reduce the risk of accidental fires and protect property and people.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Cigarette Ignition Propensity (Consumer Products) Regulations* represent a significant step in Canada’s effort to ensure that consumer tobacco products are not only safe for use but also safe in terms of fire risk. By setting a clear, measurable standard based on internationally recognized testing protocols, the regulations provide a robust framework for public safety, while allowing flexibility for legitimate research and development activities. The regulations reflect a balance between consumer protection and industry compliance, grounded in scientific standards and public health principles.
