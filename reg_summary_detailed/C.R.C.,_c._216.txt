**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Levies Order**

---

**Title of the Regulation:**  
*Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Levies Order*

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
This regulation establishes a system of **marketing levies** imposed on cream producers in Ontario who sell or deliver cream in excess of a specified quota. The primary objective is to ensure fair market participation, support the financial sustainability of the cream marketing system, and generate revenue for the Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Board (the "Commodity Board") to manage and regulate the cream and dairy industry.

**Key Definitions in the Order:**

1. **Commodity Board**  
   - Refers to *The Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Board*, established under the authority of the *Milk Act of Ontario* by Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.  
   - Role: Acts as the governing body responsible for setting quotas, managing marketing, and collecting levies on cream sales.

2. **Cream**  
   - Defined as cream that is delivered to a plant for processing into *creamery butter*.  
   - Excludes cream intended for other uses (e.g., whipping, cooking), as only cream destined for butter production is subject to this levy.

3. **Plant**  
   - Any facility involved in the processing of milk or cream, including:  
     - Cheese factories  
     - Concentrated milk plants  
     - Cream receiving stations  
     - Creameries  
     - Dairy facilities  
     - Milk receiving stations  
   - These are the entities where cream is processed into butter or other dairy products.

4. **Producer**  
   - A person or entity engaged in the actual production of cream.  
   - This includes farmers or dairy operations that produce cream as part of their milk production process.

5. **Quota**  
   - A predetermined amount (in pounds of milk fat) allocated to each producer by the Commodity Board.  
   - The quota is based on the producer’s historical sales and volume of cream delivered.  
   - It represents the maximum amount of butterfat a producer is allowed to sell or deliver without incurring levies.

**Core Provision – Marketing Levies:**

- **Levy Amount:**  
  Every producer must pay a levy of **$1 per pound of butterfat** sold or delivered to a plant **in excess of their allocated quota**.

- **Application of the Levy:**  
  - The levy applies **only to sales or deliveries beyond the quota**.  
  - If a producer sells exactly or below their quota, **no levy is due**.  
  - The levy is a direct cost associated with exceeding the allocated milk-fat volume.

- **Levy Collection Mechanism:**  
  - The **plant operator** (i.e., the entity operating the processing facility) is responsible for collecting the levy from the producer at the time of payment.  
  - The plant operator must **deduct the levy amount** from the payment the producer would otherwise receive for the cream delivered.

- **Payment Deadline:**  
  - The plant operator must **pay the collected levies directly to the Commodity Board** not later than the **15th day of the month following the month in which the cream was delivered or sold**.  
  - Example: If cream is delivered in March, the levy is due by April 15.

**Key Implications and Effects:**

1. **Incentive to Stay Within Quota:**  
   - Producers are financially incentivized to keep their butterfat sales within their allocated quota to avoid paying levies.  
   - This helps maintain balance in the cream market and prevents over-supply.

2. **Revenue for the Commodity Board:**  
   - The levies generate revenue for the Commodity Board to fund marketing, research, quality control, and administrative functions related to the cream and dairy sector.

3. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   - The levy system is transparent, with clear rules on who pays, when, and how much.  
   - The plant operator acts as an intermediary, ensuring accurate tracking and timely remittance.

4. **Alignment with Broader Marketing Plan:**  
   - This levy is applied in addition to other fees, such as *licence fees*, under the *Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing-for-Processing Plan*.  
   - This ensures a comprehensive and structured financial model for the cream industry.

---

**Enforcement and Compliance:**

- The regulation is enforceable through the Commodity Board’s authority under the *Milk Act*.  
- Non-compliance (e.g., failure to pay levies or delay in remittance) could result in penalties or administrative action, though specific penalties are not detailed in this excerpt.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Ontario Cream Producers’ Marketing Levies Order* establishes a clear, market-based mechanism to manage cream production and distribution in Ontario. By charging a $1-per-pound levy on butterfat sales exceeding a producer’s quota, the regulation promotes equitable market access, supports industry stability, and ensures that the Commodity Board has the financial resources needed to manage the cream marketing system effectively. It reflects a balanced approach to price stability, producer responsibility, and collective industry governance.
