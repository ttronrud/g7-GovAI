### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Levy on Excess Sales (Section 3)**  
- Every **producer** who sells turkeys **in excess of their market allotment** must pay a **marketing levy**.
- **Rate of Levy**: **$0.05 per pound of live weight** of the turkey sold beyond the allotment.
- This levy applies to **all types of sales**, including:
  - Intra-provincial sales (within Ontario)
  - Inter-provincial sales (to other provinces)
  - Export sales (to foreign countries)

> **Example**: If a producer has a market allotment of 1,000 pounds and sells 1,200 pounds, the levy applies to the 200-pound excess at $0.05 per pound = **$10.00** in levies.

---

#### **2. Responsibility of Buyers (Purchasers)**  
- Any person who **buys turkeys from a producer** must:
  - **Deduct the applicable levy** from the total payment made to the producer.
  - **Pay the full levy amount directly to the Commodity Board**.
- **Where to Pay**: The Commodity Board’s office at **29 Wellington Street South, St. Marys, Ontario**.
- **Deadline for Payment**: **No later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

> **Example**: If turkeys are sold in June, the buyer must pay the levy to the Commodity Board by **July 15**.

---

#### **3. Responsibility of Producers (When Buyers Fail to Deduct or Pay)**  
- If a producer **sells turkeys** in excess of their allotment and the buyer **fails to deduct or pay the levy**, the producer is **personally responsible** for paying the levy.
- The producer must:
  - Pay the full levy amount directly to the Commodity Board.
  - Pay it **by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

> This ensures that levies are collected regardless of whether a buyer chooses to deduct them — protecting the financial integrity of the marketing system.

---

### **Key Administrative and Enforcement Features**

- **Collection Mechanism**: The Commodity Board collects all levies through a centralized office in St. Marys, Ontario.
- **Monthly Deadlines**: All levies must be paid by the **15th day of the following month** after the sale month.
- **Enforcement**: The regulation is enforceable under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*, which gives the Commodity Board the authority to monitor compliance, assess penalties, and ensure fair distribution of marketing resources.

---

### **Underlying Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Market Stabilization**: By limiting total supply through market allotments and imposing levies on excess sales, the system prevents market saturation and price crashes.
2. **Revenue Generation**: The levies generate funds that may be used to support:
   - Marketing and promotion of Ontario turkey
   - Research and development
   - Quality control
   - Producer support programs
3. **Equity and Fairness**: Ensures that producers who sell beyond their quota contribute to the system, preventing free riders.
4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Clear rules on who pays, when, and how ensure transparency in the marketing process.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation requires Ontario turkey producers to pay a **$0.05 per pound levy** on any turkeys they sell that exceed their approved market allotment. If a buyer purchases the turkey, they must **deduct the levy and pay it directly to the Commodity Board** by the 15th of the following month. If the buyer fails to do so, the **producer must pay the levy themselves** by the same deadline. All payments go to the Commodity Board at 29 Wellington Street South, St. Marys, Ontario.

This system ensures that only producers who sell within their fair share benefit from the marketing plan, while those who exceed their limits contribute financially to support the broader turkey industry.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Ontario Turkey Marketing Levies Order* is a critical component of Ontario’s agricultural marketing framework. It balances supply management with fair financial accountability, promoting sustainable turkey production and ensuring that the industry remains viable and competitive in both domestic and international markets.
