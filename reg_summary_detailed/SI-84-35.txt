**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Authorization for the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs to Prescribe Fees for Contractor and Homeowners Registration Courses under the Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**. Specifically, it empowers the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and the Treasury Board) to authorize the Minister to prescribe fees for specific courses under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Authority to Prescribe Fees:**  
   The Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs is authorized to issue an order setting the fees to be charged for:
   - **Contractor Registration Courses**
   - **Homeowners Registration Courses**

   These courses are required under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*, which regulates the use of urea-formaldehyde insulation in buildings to protect public health and safety by ensuring that products are properly labeled, installed, and maintained.

2. **Purpose of the Fees:**  
   The fees are intended to:
   - Cover the administrative and operational costs associated with delivering and administering the registration courses.
   - Support the education and training of professionals (contractors) and homeowners on the safe and compliant use of urea-formaldehyde insulation.
   - Ensure that only qualified individuals are registered to handle or install such materials, thereby minimizing health and safety risks.

3. **Legal Framework:**  
   The regulation operates within the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*, which was originally enacted in 1980 and is codified in *S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 119*. This Act establishes a regulatory framework to control the use of urea-formaldehyde insulation, which has been linked to potential health concerns (e.g., formaldehyde emissions) when not properly managed.

4. **Governor in Council’s Role:**  
   The Governor in Council (the federal government’s representative) formally approves the authorization based on the recommendations of:
   - The **Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs**, who is responsible for overseeing consumer protection and corporate regulation.
   - The **Treasury Board**, which ensures that fees are reasonable, transparent, and consistent with fiscal and administrative policies.

5. **Flexibility and Future Adjustments:**  
   The Minister has the discretion to adjust fees as needed—based on cost changes, inflation, or changes in course delivery methods—through future orders. This ensures that the fee structure remains appropriate and sustainable over time.

6. **Transparency and Public Access:**  
   While not explicitly stated in this summary, such fee orders are typically published in the Canada Gazette and made available to the public, ensuring transparency in pricing and regulatory decision-making.

**Significance of the Regulation:**

- Ensures that individuals involved in the installation or handling of urea-formaldehyde insulation are properly trained and registered.
- Provides a mechanism for funding the training programs necessary to promote safe practices.
- Balances regulatory oversight with administrative feasibility by allowing the Minister to set fees based on actual costs and market conditions.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation establishes a formal, legally sound process by which the federal government can determine and enforce fees for contractor and homeowner registration courses under the *Urea Formaldehyde Insulation Act*. It reflects a practical approach to regulatory compliance, combining public health protection with efficient administrative management through clearly defined fee structures. The authority is exercised with oversight from both the Minister and the Treasury Board, ensuring accountability and fiscal responsibility.
