### **Regulatory Summary: Designation of the Joint Public Inquiry into the Nova Scotia April 2020 Tragedy as a Department under the Financial Administration Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically:
  - **Section 2**, which defines key terms including "department" and "appropriate Minister."
  - The authority is exercised by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.

#### **2. Key Provisions and Their Meaning**

**Paragraph (a): Designation as a "Department"**
> *"Pursuant to paragraph (b)a of the definition 'department' in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act, designates the commission that is named the Joint Public Inquiry into the Nova Scotia April 2020 Tragedy as a department for the purposes of that Act."*

- **Interpretation**:
  - The **Joint Public Inquiry into the Nova Scotia April 2020 Tragedy** (commonly referred to as the "Nova Scotia Tragedy Inquiry") is formally recognized as a **"department"** under the Financial Administration Act.
  - This designation is significant because the FAA provides a legal framework for the financial administration and accountability of federal institutions and entities.
  - By classifying the Inquiry Commission as a "department," it gains certain **statutory rights and responsibilities**, including:
    - Access to federal funding and financial resources.
    - The ability to be subject to financial reporting, budgeting, and audit requirements under the Act.
    - Formal recognition as a distinct, accountable body within the federal administrative structure.

- **Purpose of the Designation**:
  - To ensure that the Inquiry has the **necessary financial and administrative standing** to carry out its mandate effectively.
  - To provide **legal clarity** and legitimacy in its operations, particularly in relation to financial management, procurement, and oversight.

**Paragraph (b): Designation of the "Appropriate Minister"**
> *"Pursuant to paragraph (b)c of the definition 'appropriate Minister' in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act, designates the Prime Minister as the appropriate Minister with respect to the commission named in paragraph (a)."*

- **Interpretation**:
  - The **Prime Minister** is formally designated as the **"appropriate Minister"** for the Joint Public Inquiry.
  - This means that:
    - The Prime Minister has **official responsibility** for the commission’s operations, including oversight, reporting, and accountability.
    - The Prime Minister is the point of contact for federal financial and administrative matters concerning the Inquiry.
    - The designation allows the Inquiry to receive financial support, make expenditures, and operate under the administrative framework governed by the FAA, with the Prime Minister serving as the designated ministerial authority.

- **Rationale**:
  - The Inquiry is a **non-partisan, independent public body** investigating a major public safety and emergency response failure.
  - Although independent in its investigation, it operates within the federal administrative system, and thus requires a designated minister to ensure coordination with the government and to facilitate access to resources.
  - The Prime Minister’s designation ensures **high-level political and administrative accountability**, while preserving the Inquiry’s independence in its findings and recommendations.

#### **3. Legal Basis and Citation**
- The regulation is cited as:
  - **S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 69(3)** – This refers to the **Statutes of Canada, 1992, Chapter 1 (the Financial Administration Act)**, specifically section 69(3), which authorizes such designations.
  - **R.S., c. F-11** – Refers to the **Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter F-11**, which is the current version of the Financial Administration Act.
  - **S.C. 1992, c. 1, s. 69(1)** – Likely provides the general authority or enabling clause for the Governor General in Council to make such designations upon ministerial recommendation.

#### **4. Context and Background**
- The **Nova Scotia April 2020 Tragedy** refers to a **major incident** involving a **fire at a residential building** in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries. The incident raised serious questions about emergency response, public safety, and government oversight.
- The **Joint Public Inquiry** was established to investigate:
  - The causes and circumstances of the fire.
  - Failures in emergency response and communication.
  - The adequacy of public safety protocols and government accountability.
- This regulatory designation ensures that the Inquiry has **formal status, financial capacity, and ministerial oversight** to fulfill its mandate effectively and transparently.

#### **5. Implications and Significance**
- **Financial and Administrative Standing**: The Inquiry can now access federal financial mechanisms, including budgetary allocations, procurement processes, and financial reporting obligations.
- **Accountability**: The Prime Minister’s role as the "appropriate Minister" ensures that the Inquiry remains accountable to the federal government and the public.
- **Independence**: Despite ministerial designation, the Inquiry maintains its **independence in conducting investigations**, issuing reports, and making recommendations.
- **Legal Precedent**: This designation sets a precedent for how other public inquiries may be formally recognized under the FAA, especially those involving major public safety or systemic failures.

#### **6. Conclusion**
This regulation formally establishes the **Joint Public Inquiry into the Nova Scotia April 2020 Tragedy** as a **federally recognized department** under the Financial Administration Act, with the **Prime Minister designated as the appropriate Minister**. This provides the Inquiry with the necessary **financial, administrative, and legal framework** to conduct a thorough, transparent, and accountable investigation into a major public safety failure.
