**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-430 and Designation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs as Minister under the Export and Import Permits Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, under the definition of "Minister" in subsection 2(1) of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (R.S., c. E-19).

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2025-430 (March 14, 2025):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2025-430, which was issued on March 14, 2025. This order had previously established or designated a different individual or body as the Minister responsible for administering the *Export and Import Permits Act*.  
   - By repealing this order, the Government removes the prior designation and any associated administrative or procedural implications tied to that earlier arrangement.  
   - This action effectively ends the legal validity of the prior ministerial assignment under the Act.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs as the Minister under the Act:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** as the official "Minister" for the purposes of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (R.S., c. E-19).  
   - This designation is made pursuant to subsection 2(1) of the Act, which defines who qualifies as a "Minister" in the context of the Act’s administration.  
   - The Minister of Foreign Affairs is recognized as the principal government official responsible for overseeing the administration, implementation, and enforcement of the Act, including the granting, refusal, or review of export and import permits.

---

**Purpose and Significance:**

- **Administrative Clarity:** The change ensures that the responsibilities related to export and import controls are now clearly assigned to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position that traditionally holds primary responsibility for international trade policy, sanctions, and foreign economic relations.  
- **Policy Alignment:** This designation aligns the permit regime with broader foreign policy and national security objectives, particularly in areas such as non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and trade compliance.  
- **Continuity and Stability:** By repealing a previous order, the Government ensures a consistent and current framework for permit administration, avoiding ambiguity or overlapping responsibilities.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is grounded in the *Export and Import Permits Act* (R.S., c. E-19), specifically subsection 2(1), which defines the term "Minister" as referring to a person designated by the Governor in Council as having authority under the Act. This provision allows for ministerial appointments or designations to be adjusted as needed to reflect current government priorities or structural changes.

---

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such regulatory changes typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon the date of the order's issuance. The effective date is generally considered to be the date of publication or the date of the Governor in Council's formal decision.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation streamlines the administrative structure of the *Export and Import Permits Act* by removing an outdated ministerial designation and formally assigning responsibility for the Act’s administration to the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**. This move enhances coherence between trade policy and export control mechanisms, ensuring that decisions on permits are made by the appropriate minister with relevant expertise in international affairs and national security.
