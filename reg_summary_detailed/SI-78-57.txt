**Detailed Summary of the Cruiser Remission Order**

---

### **Overview**

The **Cruiser Remission Order** is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically **Section 17**, by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board. This Order provides for the **remission (exemption) of customs duties and sales tax** on certain types of **water-borne pleasure cruisers** imported into or taken out of Canadian warehouses.

The primary objective of the Order is to **support the domestic production of cruisers** in Canada by reducing the cost burden associated with importing or manufacturing these vessels, thereby encouraging investment and job creation in the Canadian marine industry. It distinguishes between two types of manufacturers — **Class A** and **Class B** — and establishes different eligibility criteria, calculation methods, and timeframes for remission.

## **Manufacturer Overhead Expenses (Canada)**

This includes a detailed list of allowable costs **attributable to production**, such as:

- Light, heat, power, water  
- Materials used in production (not incorporated in final product)  
- Workmen’s compensation, unemployment insurance, group insurance, pension contributions  
- Taxes on land and buildings  
- Rent for factory premises  
- Fire and insurance premiums for inventory and factory  
- Maintenance and repairs of buildings, machinery, equipment  
- Tools, jigs, dies, fixtures (non-permanent)  
- Engineering services, product development, experimental work  
- Indirect and non-production labour  
- Miscellaneous factory expenses  

### **Exclusions from Overhead:**
- Royalties or payments analogous to royalties  
- Warranty-related payments  
- Advertising or sales expenses  

> **Note:** A **10% annual capital cost allowance** is applied to the cost of buildings, machinery, and equipment used in production.

## **Remission of Customs Duties**

### **Section 4 – Remission for Class A and Class B Manufacturers**

**Eligibility:**
- **Class A manufacturers**: All calendar years after **December 31, 1976**
- **Class B manufacturers**: All calendar years after their **base year**, *unless otherwise excluded*

**Condition for Remission:**
Remission is granted on cruisers whose **aggregate duty value** does not exceed the difference between:

> **(A)** The sum of:  
> - Canadian value added in cruisers in the claim year  
> - The lesser of:  
>   - Canadian value added in boats in the claim year  
>   - Canadian value added in boats in the base year  

> **(B)** The sum of:  
> - Canadian value added in boats in the base year  
> - Canadian value added in cruisers in the base year  

👉 **In simpler terms**: Remission is available only if the manufacturer has **increased value-added production** in cruisers (and boats) relative to their base year.

> This ensures that remission is not granted when the manufacturer is simply importing more cruisers without increasing domestic value-added production.

---

### **Section 5 – Special Remission for Class B Manufacturers (Initial Production Period)**

**Eligibility:**
- A Class B manufacturer must **make an election** to claim remission for **the initial production period** (three years after base year)
- Remission applies to cruisers imported or taken out of warehouse **before January 1, 1998**

**Condition for Remission:**
Remission is granted if the aggregate duty value does not exceed the difference between:

> **(A)** The sum of:  
> - Canadian value added in cruisers during the initial production period  
> - The lesser of:  
>   - Canadian value added in boats during the initial production period  
>   - **Three times** the Canadian value added in boats in the base year  

> **(B)** Three times the sum of:  
> - Canadian value added in boats in base year  
> - Canadian value added in cruisers in base year  

👉 This allows for a **more generous threshold** during the early years of entry into cruiser production, recognizing that new manufacturers may need time to build capacity.

---

### **Prohibition on Excessive Remission in a Single Year**

> **Section 5(3)**  
> If, during any year of the initial production period, the **aggregate value of cruisers** for which remission could be granted **exceeds one-third** of the total duty value that would have been remitted *if not for this restriction*, then **no remission** is granted for the **remainder of that year**.

👉 This prevents abuse or overuse of the benefit in a single year and ensures that remission is used proportionally.

---

## **Time Limits for Claiming Remission**

- **Class A manufacturers**: Must file a claim **within 3 years** after the calendar year for which remission is claimed.
- **Class B manufacturers**:
  - Must file a claim **within 3 years** after the claim year (for Section 4)
  - Must **make an election** to claim remission **during the initial production period** (for Section 5)

> ⚠️ **No remission is granted unless the claim is submitted within the prescribed time limit.**

---

## **Election and Withdrawal of Claim (Class B Manufacturers)**

- A Class B manufacturer may **elect** to claim remission for the initial production period by submitting a **written notice to the Minister**.
- This election must be made **before the end of the initial production period**.
- The election can be **withdrawn at any time** before the end of the period.
- If withdrawn, remission is then determined under **Section 4** (standard rules) for each year of the initial production period.

👉 This provides flexibility but requires proactive engagement and accountability.

---

## **Sales Tax Remission**

- A **sales tax remission** is granted on each cruiser for which customs duty is remitted.
- The amount equals the **difference** between:
  - Sales tax calculated on the **duty-paid value** of the cruiser  
  - Sales tax calculated on the **value for duty** of the cruiser  

👉 This effectively reduces the total tax burden on the final consumer by offsetting the sales tax based on the duty exemption.

---

## **Security Requirements (Guaranteed Bond)**

To ensure compliance with the conditions of remission, manufacturers must provide a **financial guarantee** to the Minister.

### **For Section 4 (Class A & Class B)**:
- A bond or security of amount equal to:
  - **Customs duties + sales tax** payable on the imported goods, **or**
  - **$250,000**, whichever is **lesser**

### **For Section 5 (Initial Production Period – Class B)**:
- A bond or security of amount equal to:
  - **Customs duties + sales tax** payable, **or**
  - **$500,000**, whichever is **lesser**

> The amount is **estimated by the Minister** and serves as a financial safeguard to ensure the manufacturer fulfills its obligations under the Order.

---

## **Reporting Obligations**

Manufacturers must submit to the Minister:
- **Reports and other information** as required for the **proper administration** of the Order.

👉 This ensures transparency, auditability, and compliance with the conditions of remission.
