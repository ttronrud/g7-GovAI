### **Detailed Summary of the Regulations Limiting Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Natural Gas-Fired Generation of Electricity**

These regulations, enacted under **section 330(3.2)d** and **subsection 93(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, establish a binding framework to **limit carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions** from **natural gas-fired electricity generation** in Canada. The regulations were introduced in response to growing environmental concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and were developed after a public consultation and review by the National Advisory Committee.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**

- The regulations were proposed on **February 17, 2018**, in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, and made final by **Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**.
- The process followed CEPA 1999 provisions:
  - **Subsection 332(1)a**: Allows the Minister to publish proposed regulations.
  - **Subsection 93(3)**: Provides for public and advisory input from the **National Advisory Committee**.
  - **Subsection 93(4)**: Confirms that the proposed rules do not conflict with other environmental or health legislation and provide sufficient protection to human health and the environment.

Thus, the regulations are legally valid and enforceable under CEPA 1999.

## **2. Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to **electricity generation units** that use **natural gas combustion**, either alone or in combination with other fuels (excluding coal), with specific thresholds and conditions.

### **Applicable Units**

#### **A. Boiler Units (Thermal Power Plants)**
- Must have a **capacity of 25 MW or more**.
- Must begin generating electricity **on or after January 1, 2019**.
- Must meet **all three conditions** during a calendar year:
  1. More than **30% of heat input** comes from natural gas.
  2. **Heat-to-electricity ratio ≤ 0.9** (i.e., not more than 90% of thermal energy is used to generate electricity).
  3. Electricity is **sold or distributed to the electric grid**.

> *Exception*: Applies retroactively to units that:
> - Generated electricity **before January 1, 2019**;
> - Were **moved to a new facility** on or after that date;
> - Were previously registered under the coal emissions regulations and ceased using coal.

#### **B. Combustion Engine Units (Gas-Turbine Plants)**
- Must have a **capacity of 25 MW or more**.
- Must begin generating electricity **on or after January 1, 2021**.
- Must meet:
  1. More than **30% of heat input** comes from natural gas.
  2. **At least 33% of potential electrical output** is sold or distributed to the grid.
    - *Exception*: If temporary replacement engines (up to 90 days) are installed during repairs, this threshold is waived.

> *Exception*: Applies retroactively to units where:
> - More than **50% of total engine capacity** consists of engines installed **on or after January 1, 2021** (unless they are ≤150 MW replacing pre-2021 engines).

## **3. Definitions Key to Interpretation**

Important definitions clarify what constitutes a "unit" and how emissions are measured:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Natural Gas** | A gaseous hydrocarbon mixture (≥70% methane) with a heating value between 35–41 MJ/m³. Excludes landfill gas, refinery gas, sour gas, and gases with variable sulfur content. |
| **Unit** | An integrated system including boilers or engines, heat recovery systems, turbines, generators, and emission controls. |
| **Heat-to-Electricity Ratio** | Total useful thermal energy (in GWh) / Total electricity generated (in GWh). Must be ≤0.9 for boiler units. |
| **Potential Electrical Output** | Maximum electricity that could be generated if the unit operated at full capacity continuously. |
| **Useful Thermal Energy** | Steam or hot water used for non-electric purposes (e.g., heating, industrial processes). |
| **Standard Conditions** | 15°C and 101.325 kPa. All volumes are expressed at these conditions (standard m³). |
| **Responsible Person** | Owner or operator of the unit. |
| **Auditor / Performance Test Verifier** | Independent third parties with expertise in emission monitoring and quality assurance. |

> **Note**: In interpreting incorporated documents, "should" means "must"; recommendations are treated as obligations.

> Any standards from **ASTM**, **Gas Processors Association**, or **API** incorporated by reference are effective as amended.

## **4. Emission Intensity Limits**

The core of the regulation is a **cap on CO₂ emissions per unit of electricity generated** (in tonnes of CO₂ per GWh):

| Unit Type | Emission Limit (t CO₂/GWh) |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **All boiler units** (except those under special rules) | **420 t CO₂/GWh** |
| **Combustion engine units with >150 MW engines** | **420 t CO₂/GWh** |
| **Combustion engine units with ≤150 MW engines** | **550 t CO₂/GWh** |

> These limits apply **only when the unit meets the eligibility conditions** in subsections 3(1) and 3(2).

---

## **5. Special Provisions for Units with High Initial Emissions (Subsection 3(4))**

For **boiler units** that meet the eligibility criteria but have **high initial CO₂ emissions**, additional restrictions are imposed **after the end of their useful life** to ensure long-term emissions reductions.

These apply only if the **initial performance test** shows emissions intensity exceeding certain thresholds:

| Initial Emission Intensity | Limit Triggered | Year After End of Useful Life |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| >600 t/GWh | **420 t/GWh** | Year 1 |
| >550 t/GWh and ≤600 t/GWh | **420 t/GWh** | Year 6 |
| >480 t/GWh and ≤550 t/GWh | **420 t/GWh** | Year 9 |
| ≤480 t/GWh | **420 t/GWh** | Year 11 |

> This ensures that even as units age, they do not emit disproportionately high levels of CO₂.

---

## **6. Performance Testing Requirements**

To determine actual CO₂ emissions, **performance tests** must be conducted annually.

### **Initial Performance Test**
- Must be conducted within **12 months** of:
  - January 1, 2019, if the unit ceased using coal before that date.
  - The first day the unit sold electricity to the grid (if it ceased using coal on or after Jan 1, 2019).
- Conducted in the presence of an **independent performance test verifier**.
- Must last **at least 2 hours** and not exceed **100% of the unit’s capacity**.
- Follows the **Reference Method (2012)** published by the Department of the Environment.

### **Annual Performance Tests**
- Required annually while the unit remains under the regulation.
- Must also last at least 2 hours and not exceed 100% capacity.
- Must show a **maximum 2% increase** in CO₂ emissions intensity compared to the previous year.

> **Exclusion Clause**: If a combustion engine is temporarily replaced (for repairs), emissions during the **90-day replacement period** are excluded from calculations.

## **7. Exemptions During Emergencies**

Under **emergency circumstances**, a responsible person may apply for a temporary exemption from emission limits.

### **Eligible Emergency Circumstances**
- An **extraordinary, unforeseen, and irresistible event** (e.g., extreme weather, grid failure).
- A **government-issued measure** under the *Regulations Prescribing Circumstances for Granting Waivers Pursuant to Section 147 of CEPA*.

### **Application Requirements**
- Must be submitted to the **Minister of the Environment** within **15 days** of the emergency.
- Must include:
  - Unit registration number (if available),
  - Date of emergency,
  - Explanation and supporting documentation showing the emergency condition.

### **Minister’s Response**
- If satisfied, the Minister must:
  - **Grant the exemption** within **30 days**,
  - Assign a registration number if none exists,
  - Notify the responsible person.

### **Duration of Exemption**
- Begins on the day of the emergency.
- Ends on the **earliest of**:
  - 90 days after the emergency,
  - A date specified by the Minister,
  - The day the emergency ends.

> This ensures that emergency measures are temporary and do not become permanent.

## **8. Exemptions for Non-Eligible Years**

- A unit **not meeting eligibility conditions** (e.g., heat input from natural gas <30%, or heat-to-electricity ratio >0.9) is **not subject to emission limits** for that calendar
