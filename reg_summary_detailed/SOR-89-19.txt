### **Overview**

The *Manitoba Vegetable Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order*, issued on **December 19, 1988**, under the authority of the *Manitoba Vegetable Producers’ Marketing Board* (Commodity Board), **revokes the previous Manitoba Root Crop Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations** (C.R.C., c. 159) and replaces them with a new, more specific regulatory framework governing the **interprovincial and export marketing of certain vegetables** produced in Manitoba.

This Order is made pursuant to **Section 3 of the Manitoba Vegetable Order**, which itself was established under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure fair, transparent, and controlled marketing of key root vegetables in Manitoba, particularly when they are sold outside the province or exported, while protecting producers' interests through equitable distribution of proceeds.

### **Core Provisions and Key Restrictions**

#### 1. **Prohibition on Unauthorized Sales or Purchases**
- **No person may buy or purchase vegetables** from any source other than the **Commodity Board**.
- **No producer may sell vegetables directly** to any buyer outside the Commodity Board’s system.
  
> *Rationale*: Ensures that all sales are channeled through a centralized, regulated body to maintain market stability, prevent price manipulation, and ensure equitable returns to producers.

#### 2. **Controlled Distribution of Proceeds**
- The Commodity Board may **conduct pools** (centralized accounts) for all monies received from vegetable sales.
- After deducting **necessary and proper disbursements and expenses**, and after **allowing reserves approved by the Manitoba Natural Products Marketing Council**, the remaining funds must be distributed to producers:
  - In a manner **proportional to the quantity, quality, variety, grade, class, or size** of vegetables delivered.
- The Board may make:
  - An **initial payment upon delivery** of vegetables.
  - **Subsequent payments** until all proceeds are distributed.

> *Rationale*: Guarantees producers receive fair compensation based on their actual contribution to the market, preventing exploitation and ensuring transparency.

#### 3. **Packaging and Marketing Tag Requirements**
- Vegetables **must be packed in containers** and **must have a marketing tag attached**:
  - If packed in **one container** → tag must be on the container.
  - If packed in **two or more containers** → tag must be on the **outermost container**.
- **Exception**: Bulk transportation of vegetables by a person acting under a **written direction from the Commodity Board** is exempt from this requirement.

> *Rationale*: Ensures traceability, accountability, and prevents unauthorized or unregulated movement of goods in the supply chain.

#### 4. **Transportation and Delivery Controls**
- A producer **may not transport or deliver vegetables** unless the Commodity Board has issued a **delivery order** to that producer.
- **Exception**: A producer who delivers vegetables to a **transporter retained by the Commodity Board** is exempt from requiring a delivery order.

> *Rationale*: Prevents unauthorized or uncoordinated movement of produce, ensuring that only authorized producers and logistics partners participate in the distribution chain.

#### 5. **Exemption for Specific Manufacturing Arrangements**
- The **J.R. Simplot Company** is designated as an **exempt manufacturer** for **potatoes** sold to it for processing at its plant in **Grand Forks, North Dakota, USA**.
- This exemption applies **only if**:
  - A written contract of purchase and sale is signed **before planting**.
  - The potatoes are used exclusively for manufacturing at the Simplot plant in Grand Forks.

> *Rationale*: Allows for flexibility in export-oriented production and processing, supporting international trade while maintaining control over other market channels. This exemption ensures that producers can sell potatoes to a major processor without violating the core marketing restrictions.

   - Provides a clear, structured pathway for Manitoba vegetables to enter the national and international markets.

By centralizing control over sales, transportation, and distribution, it protects producers from exploitation, ensures fair returns, and supports stable interprovincial and export trade.

This regulation remains a cornerstone of Manitoba’s agricultural marketing policy, reflecting a long-standing commitment to producer support and market integrity in the vegetable sector.
