- **Repeal Section**: Section **11** of that order specifically identifies the regulation being repealed.
- **Frequency of Repeats**: The entry "[Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]" appears 13 times, which is likely a formatting or technical error (e.g., duplication in a document or database), but does not alter the factual content — it still reflects the same repeal.

### Implications:

- The regulation referenced **no longer exists** in current law.
- Any legal obligations, definitions, requirements, or procedures previously governed by this regulation are **no longer in effect**.
- Legal or administrative actions based on this regulation would be invalid or unenforceable.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory modernization, streamlining, or consolidation effort, as is common in legislative processes.

### Conclusion:

This summary confirms that **the regulation was formally repealed on or after the date of SOR/2014-293**, and as such, it is **no longer part of the current legal framework**. There is **no active content** or enforceable provisions associated with the regulation due to its repeal.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original regulation's title or subject matter, a more detailed functional summary (e.g., what it governed, who it applied to, or what it required) cannot be provided. The repealing order (SOR/2014-293, s. 11) only confirms the *status* of repeal, not the substance of the original regulation.

To understand the original scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2014-293.
