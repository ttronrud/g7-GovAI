### **Summary of the Regulation (S.C. 2002, c. 29):**

> *"Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, acknowledges receipt, on the making of this Order, of the assessments done pursuant to subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act, by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) with respect to the species set out in the annexed schedule."*

### **Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Legal Authority and Source**:
   - The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically under **subsection 23(1)**.
   - It is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of the Environment**.
   - This means the government formally adopts and implements decisions based on scientific assessments, with the Minister providing the official recommendation.

2. **Purpose of the Provision**:
   - The regulation serves as an **official acknowledgment** that the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** has completed and submitted scientific assessments for certain species listed in the annexed schedule.
   - These assessments are required under SARA to determine the **status** (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern, etc.) of wildlife species in Canada.

3. **COSEWIC’s Role**:
   - COSEWIC is the independent scientific body responsible for assessing the **status of wildlife species** at risk in Canada.
   - Its assessments are based on scientific data, including population trends, habitat conditions, threats, and ecological information.
   - Under SARA, COSEWIC’s assessments are **mandatory** for the Minister to consider when determining whether a species should be listed under the Act.

4. **Trigger for the Order**:
   - The regulation is **made upon receipt** of the assessments. That is, it comes into effect when the Minister receives the completed COSEWIC evaluations for the species listed in the schedule.
   - This formalizes the government’s recognition of the scientific findings and marks a critical step in the process of species protection.

5. **Species Covered**:
   - The species subject to this regulation are specifically listed in the **annexed schedule** attached to the order.
   - The schedule may include species that have been assessed by COSEWIC and are now formally recognized as being at risk, such as:
     - Endangered
     - Threatened
     - Special Concern
     - Extirpated or Extinct (in some cases)

6. **Implications and Next Steps**:
   - Upon the making of this Order, the species listed in the schedule are now formally recognized as having undergone a **status assessment** under SARA.
   - This is a **preliminary step** before potential listing decisions by the Minister.
   - If a species is found to be at risk, the Minister may proceed to:
     - List the species under SARA
     - Develop a recovery strategy
     - Implement protection measures
     - Designate critical habitat

### **Context within the Species at Risk Act (SARA):**

- **Section 23(1)** of SARA requires the Minister to consider COSEWIC assessments when determining the status of a species.
- The regulation ensures that the government **officially acknowledges** the completion of these assessments, thereby initiating the formal process of species protection under the Act.
- It demonstrates the integration of **scientific assessment** with **government action**, a core principle of SARA.

---

### **Significance of the Regulation:**

- It provides **formal recognition** of scientific expertise in wildlife conservation.
- It ensures **transparency and accountability** in the decision-making process.
- It establishes a clear **legal pathway** from scientific evaluation to regulatory action.
- It supports the **proactive protection** of biodiversity in Canada.

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation (S.C. 2002, c. 29) is a foundational administrative step under the Species at Risk Act. It formally acknowledges the completion of COSEWIC assessments for specific species, marking the beginning of a potential listing and protection process under federal law. It underscores Canada’s commitment to science-based conservation and the protection of biodiversity through legally binding, evidence-driven policy.
