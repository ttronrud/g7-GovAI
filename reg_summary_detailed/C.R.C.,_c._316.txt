## **Detailed Summary of the Adjustment Assistance Regulations (Textile and Clothing Workers)**

These regulations establish a system of **pre-retirement benefit assistance** for textile and clothing workers in Canada who have been laid off due to industry-specific job losses. The program is designed to provide financial support to eligible employees who are unable to find suitable employment and are approaching retirement age, particularly those with long-term experience in the sector.

---

### **1. Purpose and Scope**

- The regulations provide **pre-retirement benefit payments** to textile and clothing workers who have been laid off and meet specific eligibility criteria.
- The benefit is intended to bridge the gap between unemployment and retirement, especially for workers aged 54 to 65 who face no realistic prospect of re-employment.
- The program applies only to **lay-offs resulting from operations in the textile and clothing industry** and only to individuals who were employed by **Canadian producers** of textile and clothing goods.

> **Key Citation**: "These Regulations may be cited as the Adjustment Assistance Regulations (Textile and Clothing Workers)."

### **3. Eligibility Criteria for Pre-retirement Benefit**

An employee must meet **all of the following conditions** to qualify for a pre-retirement benefit period:

#### **(a) Employment History**
- Must have been employed by a Canadian producer for **at least 10 of the 15 years immediately before the lay-off**.
- Must have earned **at least 1,000 hours of pay per year** in each of those 10 years.

#### **(b) Age Requirement**
- Must be **at least 54 years old but less than 65 years old** on the date of lay-off.

#### **(c) Residency and Employment Prospects**
- Must be certified by the Commission as:
  - A **resident in Canada**, and
  - Either:
    - **No present prospect of employment** (with or without training or relocation assistance), **or**
    - Has accepted employment with earnings **less than their average weekly insurable earnings**.

> This condition ensures that the benefit is only provided to those who are genuinely unable to re-enter the workforce.

---

### **4. Certification and Review Process**

- The **Commission** is responsible for:
  - Receiving applications.
  - Determining eligibility.
  - Issuing certifications.
  - Reviewing cases at least **once every 12 months**.

#### **Review Requirement**
- If, during a review, an employee no longer meets the eligibility criteria (e.g., finds new employment or becomes eligible for other income), the **certification is suspended**.

> This ensures the benefit remains targeted and does not continue indefinitely for those who regain employability.

---

### **5. Application and Submission Rules**

- Applications must be submitted **within the qualifying period**.
- If an employee submits an application **after the qualifying date** but can show **good cause**, the application may be treated as if it were submitted on the qualifying date.
- Applications are processed under the rules in **Section 39 of the Unemployment Insurance Regulations**.

#### **Commission’s Decision Process**
- If the Commission determines a benefit period is established:
  - It **declares eligibility**.
- If not:
  - It **declares ineligibility**, stating which requirement was not met, **or**
  - It **refers the case to a Board of Referees within 14 days** (if practicable).

> This ensures a fair and timely decision process with appeal rights.

---

### **6. Disqualification and Misrepresentation**

- If an employee makes a **false or misleading statement** (e.g., about age, earnings, or employment status), the Commission may:
  - Disqualify the employee from receiving benefits.
  - Impose a **disqualification period of up to three weeks** (the first three weeks after the determination date).
- Disqualification applies only to **weeks in which the false statement was made**.

> This protects the integrity of the program and prevents fraud.

---

### **7. Duration of Benefit**

- The **pre-retirement benefit period** begins on the **date the employee’s unemployment insurance benefit ends**.
- It ends when:
  - The employee **reaches age 65**, **or**
  - They become eligible for a **retirement pension** under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or **Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)** — whichever comes first.

> The benefit is **not paid beyond retirement age**, ensuring it serves as a transitional bridge.

---

### **8. Benefit Amount and Calculation**

- The **maximum weekly benefit** is:
  - **66⅔% (66.67%)** of the employee’s **average weekly insurable earnings**.
  - This amount is **rounded to the nearest cent**.

> Example: If average weekly earnings = $500 → Benefit = $333.33

#### **Insurable Earnings for Agreements**
- For work under **section 37 of the Act** (e.g., part-time or temporary work), insurable earnings are:
  - The amount the employee would have earned in a full week, **or**
  - The maximum weekly insurable earnings under the Act — whichever is **lower**.

---

### **9. Deductions from Benefits**

During the benefit period, the following **deductions are made** from each dollar of benefit:

| Source of Income | Deduction Rate |
|------------------|----------------|
| Earnings from employment or self-employment | $0.66⅔ per dollar |
| Pension benefits from employer plans | $0.66⅔ per dollar |
| Vacation pay | $0.66⅔ per dollar |
| Other income (e.g., dividends, interest) | $0.66⅔ per dollar |
| Unemployment insurance benefits received during the period | $1.00 per dollar |

> These deductions ensure that the benefit is not a pure handout and reflects the employee’s current income.

> **Note**: Deductions apply only to income **received during the pre-retirement benefit period**.

---

### **10. Annual Adjustment of Benefit**

- The benefit amount is **adjusted annually** to reflect changes in the cost of living.
- The new monthly amount is calculated as:

> **New Benefit = (Original Monthly Benefit) × (Pension Index for Current Year / Pension Index for Lay-off Year)**

- **Pension Index**: Defined in **Section 43.1 of the CPP Regulations** — a measure of inflation used to adjust pensions and benefits.

> This ensures the benefit keeps pace with inflation over time.

---

### **11. Adjustment Rules for Fractions (Rounding Procedures)**

To ensure consistency and fairness in calculations, specific rounding rules apply:

#### **For the Product (Benefit × Index Ratio):**
- If the product has a fractional part of $1:
  - Express it as a **decimal with at least 3 digits**.
  - If the **third digit is less than 5**, drop it.
  - If the **third digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **second digit by 1**, then drop the rest.

> Example: $333.334 → $333.33; $333.335 → $333.34

#### **For the Quotient (Index Ratio):**
- If the ratio is less than 1:
  - Express it as a **decimal with 4 digits**.
  - If the **fourth digit is less than 5**, drop it.
  - If the **fourth digit is 5 or greater**, increase the **third digit by 1**, then drop the rest.

> Example: 0.9876 → 0.987
