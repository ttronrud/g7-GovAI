### **Detailed Summary of the Weyburn Airport Zoning Regulations (1991)**

The **Weyburn Airport Zoning Regulations**, enacted on **January 31, 1991**, are a set of legally binding rules established under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada. These regulations define spatial constraints and land-use restrictions around **Weyburn Airport** in the Province of Saskatchewan to ensure aviation safety, particularly by controlling the elevation and use of structures and natural features near the airport.

---

## **1. Legal Authority and Process**

- **Section 5.5 of the Aeronautics Act** required that a proposed zoning regulation be published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 15 and 22, 1990**, and also in two issues of the *Weyburn Review* on **January 23 and 30, 1991**.
- This publication provided **reasonable opportunity** for interested parties (e.g., landowners, aviation stakeholders, community members) to submit written representations to the **Minister of Transport**.
- Based on this public consultation, **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, **formally adopted** the regulations under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**.

> ✅ The regulation is now legally enforceable and may be cited as the **Weyburn Airport Zoning Regulations**.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Weyburn Airport, located in the vicinity of Weyburn, Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport’s centerline of runway 12-30, located **609.5 meters from the threshold of runway 12**, at an elevation of **586.5 meters above sea level**. This point serves as the origin for all elevation-based measurements. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 12 and 30). It rises at a **1:30 vertical-to-horizontal ratio** (1 meter rise per 30 meters run) to a horizontal line **2,500 meters** from the end of the runway. The outer ends of this line are **295 meters** from the runway centerline, and the horizontal line is **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation (586.5 m = 631.5 m AGL)**. However, if this plane would be less than **9 meters above ground level**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or impractical enforcement. |
| **Strip** | The active runway area associated with runway 12-30, measuring **90 meters in width** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,339 meters in length**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects with the outer surface. |

## **3. Application Scope**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Weyburn Airport**, including **public road allowances**.
- The exact boundaries of the affected land are defined in **Part VI of the schedule**, using a detailed legal description based on **surveyed sections, roads, and registered land plans** (e.g., Township 9, Range 14, Section 13, etc.).

> 🔍 This boundary description spans a large area around the airport and includes major roads like **Eaglesham Avenue, Eighteenth Street, Warren Avenue, Douglas Road, McLelland Street**, and others, forming a closed polygon that defines the outer limits of regulated land.

## **4. Key Prohibitions and Restrictions**

### **A. Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**
- **No person may erect or construct** any building, structure, or object — or add to an existing one — such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> ⚠️ This means that any structure (e.g., trees, poles, buildings) must remain below the defined elevation limits to prevent interference with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

### **B. Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses) grows above any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require the owner or occupier** to:
  - Remove or trim the excessive growth.

> 🌳 This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards to aircraft operations due to obstruction or bird attraction.

### **C. Prohibition of Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**
- No owner or occupier may allow land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> 🐦 This is a critical safety measure to prevent bird strikes — a major aviation hazard — by eliminating food sources that attract birds to the airport area.

---

## **5. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: Prevent obstacles (natural or man-made) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
2. **Flight Path Integrity**: Maintain clear visibility and unobstructed flight paths by enforcing strict elevation limits.
3. **Environmental Stewardship**: Reduce bird activity near the airport by eliminating food sources.
4. **Public and Stakeholder Engagement**: Ensure transparency through public notice and opportunity for comment before final adoption.

---

## **6. Regulatory Basis and Reference Plans**

- All surface definitions are derived from the **Weyburn Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2702**, dated **November 14, 1988**.
- The plan provides the foundational design for:
  - Runway alignment (12–30),
  - Approach surfaces,
  - Transitional and outer surfaces,
  - Land boundaries.

> The 1991 regulations **formally adopt and enforce** the spatial parameters defined in this zoning plan.

---

## **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Require removal of overgrown vegetation,
  - Issue enforcement notices,
  - Take administrative action against non-compliance.
- Compliance is mandatory for all landowners and occupiers within the defined boundaries.

> ⚖️ Violations may result in fines, orders to remove structures, or other legal remedies under the Aeronautics Act.

## **8. Summary Table: Key Elevation and Distance Parameters**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | 586.5 m above sea level; located 609.5 m from runway 12 threshold along centerline |
| **Approach Surface (Runway 12 & 30)** | 1:30 slope; rises to 83.3 m above end of runway at 2,500 m horizontal distance; outer ends 295 m from centerline |
| **Outer Surface** | 45 m above ARP (631.5 m AGL); capped at 9 m above ground if below that level |
| **Transitional Surface** | 1:7 slope from strip edges to outer surface |
| **Runway Strip** | 90 m wide (45 m each side), 1,339 m long (runway 12–30) |
| **Boundary Area** | Defined by a detailed legal description across 10+ land parcels and roads in Weyburn |

## **Conclusion**

The **Weyburn Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and legally grounded framework for managing land use and development around a key regional airport. By setting clear, measurable elevation limits and prohibiting hazardous activities (like bird-attracting waste), the regulations enhance aviation safety, protect public health, and ensure responsible land use in a sensitive aviation environment.

These rules remain in force and continue to serve as a model for how Canadian airports manage their surrounding zones under federal aeronautical law.

📌 **Key Takeaway**:  
This regulation is not merely about building restrictions — it is a **safety-critical tool** to protect aircraft from visual and physical obstructions during flight operations, grounded in precise geometric and elevation parameters derived from a formal land-use plan.
