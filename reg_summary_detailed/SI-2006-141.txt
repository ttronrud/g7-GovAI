The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-148, section 14**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **Statutory Instrument 2008-148**, specifically **section 14** of that instrument.
- **Legal Effect**: As a result of this repeal, the regulation no longer applies, has no legal force, and is not enforceable. Any prior provisions or obligations derived from it are nullified.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Statutory instruments like SI 2008-148 are typically introduced to modernize, streamline, or correct outdated or obsolete legislation. The repeal of this regulation suggests that it was either:
  - Outdated or redundant,
  - Contradicted by newer laws,
  - Superseded by more effective or comprehensive provisions,
  - Or no longer necessary for regulatory purposes.
- **Implication**: Any reference to this regulation in legal, administrative, or operational contexts must now be treated as obsolete. Authorities or individuals relying on it would need to consult current, active legislation for compliance or guidance.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SI/2008-148, s. 14]" appearing multiple times) do not indicate multiple regulations or different versions — they simply emphasize the repealing action.
- The absence of any substantive content (such as the original regulation’s name, scope, or provisions) means that **the specific details of the repealed regulation cannot be reconstructed or summarized** from this information alone.
- To fully understand the nature of the repealed regulation, one would need to refer to:
  - The original text of the regulation (if archived),
  - The explanatory notes or objectives of SI 2008-148,
  - Relevant legislative history or government publications.

### Conclusion:
The provided information confirms that a specific regulation has been **officially repealed** by **SI 2008-148, section 14**. However, **no substantive details about the regulation itself are included** in the text. Therefore, while the legal status (repeal) is clear, a detailed summary of its content, scope, or purpose cannot be provided without further documentation.

> Recommendation: To obtain a detailed summary of the repealed regulation, consult the full text of the original regulation or the explanatory materials accompanying SI 2008-148.
