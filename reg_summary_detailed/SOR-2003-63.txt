Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the *Information Technology Activities (Canadian Societies) Regulations*, enacted under the *Insurance Companies Act*.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Canadian Societies) Regulations**

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- **Enacted by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Legal Authority:** Sections 560a and 1021b of the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA).
- **Statutory References:**
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 437
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465
  - S.C. 1991, c. 47

> These regulations establish specific restrictions on Canadian societies (non-profit organizations, including charitable and social organizations) regarding their involvement in information technology (IT) activities that may pose financial or systemic risks to the insurance and financial sector.

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA). |
| **Balance sheet value** | The value reported on a society’s balance sheet for its shares and ownership interests, calculated on an **unconsolidated basis**. This is the key metric used to assess exposure. |
| **Book value** | *Repealed* by SOR/2008-168, section 19 — no longer applies. |

> The definition of "balance sheet value" is critical: it reflects the market value of equity holdings as shown in financial statements, not fair market value or book value (which has been removed from use).

---

### **3. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Activity" in IT?**

A **prescribed activity** under paragraph 554(2)(f) of the ICA includes:
> Developing, designing, holding, managing, manufacturing, selling, or otherwise dealing with any:
- Data transmission system,
- Information site,
- Communication device,
- Information platform or portal,

**That is used to provide information services.**

> Example: A society cannot acquire control of or make a substantial investment in a company that operates a website, app, or digital communication platform providing services like online customer support, data analytics, or digital advertising.

### **4. Prohibited Actions – Threshold for Substantial Investment**

A society **may not**:
- Acquire control of,
- Hold, acquire, or increase a substantial investment in,

an entity engaged in a prescribed IT activity **if the sum of the following exceeds 5% of the society’s regulatory capital**:

#### ✅ Components of the 5% Threshold:
1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests the society and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity (under paragraph 554(2)(f)).
2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the society and its subsidiaries in **other entities** engaging in prescribed IT activities that the society controls or holds a substantial investment in.
3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the society and its subsidiaries to entities engaged in prescribed IT activities that the society controls or holds a substantial investment in.

> 🔍 **Key Point:** The 5% threshold is not a simple ownership percentage. It is a **risk-based, financial exposure threshold** calculated using balance sheet values and loan amounts across all related IT entities.

> ⚠️ Exceeding this 5% limit triggers a **prohibition** on acquiring control or increasing a substantial investment in such an entity.

### **5. Additional Prohibitions – Types of Activities That Make IT Entities Off-Limits**

Even if the IT activity itself is compliant, a society **cannot** invest in or control an entity that engages in **any of the following prohibited activities**:

| Prohibited Activity | Explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Accepting deposit liabilities** | Entities that take deposits (e.g., savings accounts) are excluded. This prevents societies from indirectly engaging in banking-like functions. |
| **Activities restricted under sections 466, 469, or 478 of the ICA** | These sections restrict certain financial activities for companies and property/casualty insurers. Societies cannot invest in entities doing such restricted activities. |
| **Financial intermediary activities exposing the entity to material market or credit risk** | Includes activities of: <br> - Finance entities <br> - Factoring entities <br> - Financial leasing entities <br> These activities involve significant exposure to credit or market fluctuations. |
| **Specialized financing entities** | Entities that provide specialized financing (e.g., bridge loans, structured lending) are excluded. |
| **Dealing in securities** | Except where permitted under: <br> - Paragraph 554(2)(e) of the ICA (limited exceptions), or <br> - Paragraph 440(2)(b) of the ICA (for certain companies). |
| **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** | Prohibited under subsection 441(3) of the ICA, unless explicitly permitted under subsection (1). |
| **Acquiring control of or investing in another entity** | Only permitted if: <br> - The entity is **controlled by the society**, and the society itself is permitted under **Part XII of the ICA** to invest in that entity, **or** <br> - The entity is **not controlled by the society**, and the society itself is permitted under: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subsection 552(2), <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Paragraph 552(3)(b) or (c), or <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• Subsection 554(1) or (2) of the ICA. |

> 🚫 These prohibitions ensure that societies do not become involved in activities that could create systemic financial risks or conflicts of interest.

### **6. Exemption from Subsections 554(4) and (5) of the ICA**

> For the purpose of determining whether a society is permitted to acquire a substantial investment in another entity under **552(2), 552(3)(b)/(c), or 554(1)/(2)**, **subsections 554(4) and (5)** of the ICA **do not apply**.

> 🔍 This means that when assessing whether a society can invest in a related entity, the more restrictive provisions of 554(4) and (5) — which may otherwise limit investment based on risk or capital adequacy — are **excluded** from consideration.

> This creates a **more permissive pathway** for societies to make investments in affiliated IT entities, provided they meet the other conditions (e.g., under 552 or 554).

---

### **7. Effective Date**

> These regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication.

## 🔍 Key Objectives & Rationale

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | Prevents Canadian societies from becoming exposed to financial risks associated with IT businesses that involve credit risk, market volatility, or securities trading. |
| **Systemic Stability** | Avoids unintended overlap between non-profit societies and financial intermediaries that could destabilize the insurance or broader financial system. |
| **Clarity in Investment Limits** | Provides a clear, measurable threshold (5% of regulatory capital) to guide investment decisions in IT sectors. |
| **Sectoral Protection** | Protects the integrity of the insurance and financial sectors by limiting non-financial entities from entering or influencing high-risk financial activities. |

## 📌 Practical Implications for Societies

1. **Due Diligence Required:** Societies must conduct thorough financial assessments before considering any investment in IT entities.
2. **Ownership & Loan Tracking:** Must track both equity holdings and loan exposures across all affiliated IT entities to ensure the total does not exceed 5% of regulatory capital.
3. **Prohibited Activities List:** Any IT entity engaging in finance, deposits, securities, or leasing is off-limits.
4. **Investment in Subsidiaries:** A society may only invest in a related IT entity if it itself is legally permitted under the ICA to do so.
5. **No Automatic Permissibility:** Even if an IT platform appears benign, it is prohibited if it engages in financial intermediation or deposit-taking.
