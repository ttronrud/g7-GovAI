**Detailed Summary of the *Disclosure on Account Opening by Telephone Request (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (the "Act"). The legal authority for these regulations is derived from:

- **Section 429** of the Act  
- **Section 431(6)a** of the Act  
- **Section 531b** of the Act  

This legislative framework ensures that trust and loan companies comply with transparency and consumer protection standards when opening deposit accounts, particularly through telephone-based account opening processes.

The regulations came into force on the day they were registered with the Government of Canada.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **ensure clear, timely, and accurate oral disclosure** of key account terms and conditions to customers during the initial account opening process — especially when the process occurs over the telephone. This helps protect consumers by:

- Preventing misinformation or misrepresentation  
- Ensuring customers understand fees, interest rates, and account closure rights  
- Providing a structured and standardized format for verbal communication  

These rules apply specifically to **deposit accounts** opened via telephone, and are designed to meet the requirements of **subsection 431(3)** and **subsection 431(4)** of the Trust and Loan Companies Act.

### **3. Key Information to Be Disclosed Orally (Under Subsection 431(3))**

When a customer opens a deposit account over the phone, the company must orally disclose the following information:

#### **(a) Partial Disclosure of Charges and Terms**
- The customer must be informed that **only part of the information** about deposit account charges and terms is being provided verbally.
- The **full written disclosure** will be sent to the customer within **seven business days** after the account is opened.

> *Rationale*: This prevents customers from being overwhelmed by detailed financial information during a phone call and ensures they receive a complete written record.

#### **(b) Right to Close the Account Without Charge**
- The customer has the right to **close the account without charge** within **14 business days** of opening.
- If the account is closed within this period, the customer is **entitled to a refund** of any charges related to account operations, **except interest charges**.
- This includes fees for:
  - Monthly statements  
  - Passbook updates  
  - Cash withdrawals  
  - Cheque withdrawals  
  - Debit card purchases  
  - Preauthorized debits  
  - Bill payments  
  - Transfers between accounts  
  - Cheque orders (if offered at account opening)

> *Rationale*: This gives customers a short window to evaluate the account and exit if needed, promoting financial autonomy and reducing risk of unintended commitments.

#### **(c) Interest Rate Information (Fixed-Rate Accounts)**
For a **fixed-rate interest-bearing deposit account**:
- The **current interest rate** applicable to the account must be disclosed.
- The **method of calculating interest** must be explained (e.g., daily compounding, annual percentage yield, etc.).

> *Example*: "Your account earns 2.5% per year, compounded monthly, with interest calculated on the daily balance."

#### **(d) Interest Rate Information (Variable-Rate Accounts)**
For a **variable-rate interest-bearing deposit account**:
- The **current interest rate** must be disclosed.
- The **method of calculating interest** must be explained.
- The customer must be informed **how they can obtain future interest rate updates** (e.g., through a website, email, or statement).

> *Rationale*: Variable rates can change over time; customers must know how and when they will be informed of changes.

#### **(e) Charges for Accounts Without a Fixed Monthly Service Package**
For accounts **without a fixed monthly service charge**:
- The following charges must be disclosed:
  - Monthly statements  
  - Passbook updates  
  - Cash withdrawals  
  - Cheque withdrawals  
  - Debit payment purchases  
  - Preauthorized debits  
  - Bill payments  
  - Transfers between accounts  
  - Cheque orders (if offered at opening)

> *Note*: These are all **per-transaction or per-service fees**, not bundled.

#### **(f) Charges for Accounts With a Fixed Monthly Service Package**
For accounts that have a **fixed monthly service charge**:
- The **principal features of the service package** must be disclosed, including:
  - The **monthly charge amount**
  - The **number and types of permitted transactions per billing cycle** (e.g., up to 10 cash withdrawals per month)
- The **applicable charges for additional transactions** beyond the package must also be disclosed.

> *Example*: "Your monthly fee is $15, which includes up to 5 cash withdrawals per month. Any additional withdrawals will incur a $2 fee."

#### **(g) Grouping of Similar Transactions**
- A company may **group similar transactions** under a **generic term** (e.g., “additional transactions”) if all such transactions carry the **same fee**.
- This allows for clarity and simplicity in verbal communication without requiring exhaustive listing.

> *Example*: Instead of saying “each cash withdrawal beyond the limit costs $2,” a company may say, “additional cash withdrawals are charged at $2 each.”

### **4. Interpretation of Mail-Based Disclosure (Subsection 431(4))**

- If a company sends the **agreement and written information** (required under subsection 431(1)) to the customer by **mail**, then:
  - The information is **deemed to have been provided** to the customer on the **fifth day after the postmark date**.

> *Rationale*: This establishes a clear and consistent timeline for when the customer is considered to have received the full written disclosure, regardless of when it physically arrives.

This provision ensures that even if the mail takes longer than expected, the customer is legally considered to have received the information by a defined date, which supports compliance with disclosure timelines.

---

### **5. Repealed Provisions**

- A provision related to **cheque order charges** was **repealed** by **SOR/2021-126, section 1**.
- This means that the specific mention of **cheque orders** in the original disclosure list is no longer applicable.
- The remaining content still applies, but the reference to cheque orders being charged is now obsolete.

> *Note*: This reflects evolving product offerings or regulatory simplifications in the banking and financial services sector.

---

### **6. Key Compliance Requirements for Financial Institutions**

Trust and loan companies must ensure that:

- All verbal disclosures during telephone account openings are **accurate, complete, and clearly presented**.
- Customers are explicitly informed about:
  - The **partial nature** of verbal disclosures
  - The **seven-business-day deadline** for receiving full written disclosure
  - The **14-business-day right to close the account** and receive a refund (excluding interest)
  - The **interest rate structure** (fixed or variable)
  - The **fees and transaction limits** (especially for service packages)
- Written disclosures are **sent within seven business days** of account opening.
- If sent by mail, the **fifth day after postmark** is treated as the effective date of delivery.

---

### **7. Consumer Protection and Transparency Implications**

These regulations enhance consumer protection by:

- Promoting **transparency** in fee structures and interest rates  
- Giving customers **clear rights** to exit an account without penalty  
- Ensuring **consistent, standardized disclosure** across institutions  
- Reducing the risk of hidden or unexpected charges  
- Supporting informed decision-making during account selection  

They align with broader financial consumer protection goals in Canada, including those set by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and the Canadian Banking Act.

### **Conclusion**

The *Disclosure on Account Opening by Telephone Request (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* establish a clear, enforceable framework for how financial institutions must communicate critical account terms during telephone-based account openings. By mandating specific oral disclosures and setting timelines for written follow-up, the regulations ensure that consumers are fully informed and empowered to make sound financial decisions. The rules are both practical and protective, balancing operational efficiency with consumer rights.

These regulations remain in effect as of their registration date and are a key component of the regulatory oversight of trust and loan companies in Canada.
