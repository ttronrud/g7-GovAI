**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order (SOR/67-267)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, officially titled the *Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order*, was issued on **June 14, 1967**, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (Ontario). It **revokes** the earlier *Ontario Hog Producers’ Marketing Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1967-1033, dated May 25, 1967), and replaces it with a new, updated marketing order specifically focused on the regulation of hog marketing in Ontario.

The new Order is now known as the **Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order** and serves as the legal framework governing the marketing of hogs within Ontario, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

### **Key Provisions and Legal Framework**

#### **1. Governing Legislation**
- The Order is enacted under the authority of the **Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (Act), which provides the legal basis for regulating the marketing of agricultural commodities, including hogs.
- The Act empowers the government to establish marketing boards and regulate trade to ensure fair pricing, market stability, and equitable returns for producers.

#### **2. Key Entities Involved**
- **The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario (Board)**: A provincial body responsible for overseeing the marketing of agricultural products across Ontario.
- **The Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)**: A specialized board established under the Act to manage the marketing of hogs specifically. It operates under the broader authority of the Board but has specific powers related to pork/hog marketing.

> These two bodies are jointly authorized to regulate the marketing of hogs in **interprovincial and export trade**, and they may exercise **all or any powers** that the Board has over local hog marketing within Ontario.

### **Core Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted specific authority to regulate the marketing of hogs in out-of-province and international markets. Its powers include:

#### **(a) Fixing and Imposing Levies or Charges**
- The Commodity Board may, by **order**, **establish and impose levies or charges** on persons engaged in the **production or marketing of hogs** within Ontario.
- These levies are **not uniform**—they are applied based on **classification of producers** into different groups (e.g., small-scale farmers, large producers, feeders, etc.).
- The amount of levy or charge depends on the group to which a producer belongs.
- This classification system allows for **proportional and equitable** financial contributions from different types of producers.

#### **(b) Use of Collected Funds**
The revenues collected from these levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize markets or provide financial cushioning during downturns),
- **Payment of expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of hogs (e.g., price drops, market fluctuations),
- **Equalization or adjustment of returns** among hog producers.
  
> In particular, the Commodity Board may use the funds to **equalize income** among producers during periods when market prices fluctuate. For example, if prices fall, the board may distribute funds to producers to compensate for reduced earnings, ensuring fair market outcomes and reducing economic hardship.

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

The primary objectives of this marketing order are:
1. **Market Stability**: To prevent sharp price volatility in hog markets by creating mechanisms for price support and risk-sharing.
2. **Fair Returns for Producers**: To ensure that hog producers receive equitable returns, especially during periods of low demand or poor market conditions.
3. **Interprovincial and Export Trade Regulation**: To provide a structured and transparent system for managing the movement and sale of hogs outside Ontario, protecting both producers and consumers.
4. **Financial Resilience**: To build reserves and manage financial risks through a system of levies and redistribution.

### **Scope and Application**

- The term **"hogs"** refers specifically to hogs **produced in Ontario**.
- The Order applies to all persons (individuals, cooperatives, businesses) engaged in **hog production or marketing** within the province.
- The **Plan** (a marketing plan established and amended over time) and any **regulations made under the Act** are integral to the operation of this Order and guide its implementation.

### **Significance and Historical Context**

This Order represents a **modernization and refinement** of earlier hog marketing regulations. The 1967 revision:
- Replaced outdated language and structure,
- Introduced a more **flexible and producer-responsive levy system**,
- Strengthened the ability of the Commodity Board to manage market risks,
- Improved transparency and equity in how producers are treated in interprovincial and export markets.

It reflects a shift toward **producer protection** and **market stabilization** through financial mechanisms rather than purely price controls.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Order* is a foundational piece of agricultural policy that enables the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board to:
- Regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of hogs,
- Implement fair and equitable levies based on producer type,
- Use collected funds to create financial buffers, manage losses, and ensure stable returns for producers.

By doing so, it supports a **resilient, sustainable, and fair hog marketing system** in Ontario, balancing the interests of producers, the market, and the broader agricultural economy.
