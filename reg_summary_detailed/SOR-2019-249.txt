**Detailed Summary of the International Financial Assistance Regulations (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 659)**

---

### **Overview**

The *International Financial Assistance Regulations* are a set of rules established under **section 8 of the International Financial Assistance Act (IFA Act)**, and are made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** and the **Minister for International Development**, with the **concurrence of the Minister of Finance**. These regulations provide detailed guidelines for how Canada administers financial assistance to foreign governments and entities, particularly in the form of **loans and guarantees**, ensuring transparency, fiscal responsibility, and alignment with international development standards.

The regulations came into force on **June 25, 2019**, and are designed to ensure that Canada’s international financial assistance is:

- Targeted toward countries that meet specific development and financial criteria,
- Structured to promote debt sustainability,
- Subject to strict limits on total exposure to avoid overextension,
- Monitored and approved by key financial and policy ministers,
- Aligned with international standards (e.g., OECD DAC List, IMF reserve currencies).

---

## **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *International Financial Assistance Act*.
- **OECD DAC List**: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee List of Official Development Assistance (ODA) Recipients. This list identifies countries and territories that are eligible for official development assistance. Only countries on this list are eligible for Canadian loans and guarantees under these regulations.

## **Loan Provisions (Under Paragraph 3(1)(a) of the IFA Act)**

### 1. **Creditworthiness Requirement**
A loan may only be made if:
- The recipient or guarantor is deemed **creditworthy**, based on assessments from the **World Bank** and the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** regarding **debt sustainability**.
- The recipient is a government of a country or territory **included in the OECD DAC List**.
- The recipient is a **borrowing member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)**, part of the World Bank Group.

- **20% of all outstanding loans** made under paragraph 3(1)(a) by the competent minister,  
*whichever is greater.*

> *Example*: If total Canadian loans under this paragraph are $600 million, then the cap per country is 20% of $600 million = $120 million. If total loans are $500 million, the cap is $100 million (20% of $500 million), so the higher of the two ($120 million) applies.

> *Purpose*: Prevents overexposure to any one country and ensures risk diversification.
