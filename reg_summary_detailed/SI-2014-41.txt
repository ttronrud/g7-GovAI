The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-94"** — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered **2015/94** has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**Statutory Instrument Number:** SI 2015/94  
**Status:** Repealed  
**Date of Repeal:** Not explicitly stated in the reference, but typically such repeals are enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument or amendment. The fact that it is listed as "Repealed" implies that the instrument is no longer in force and has been superseded or removed by another piece of legislation.

### Background:
Statutory Instruments (SIs) in the United Kingdom are secondary legislation used to implement primary legislation (such as Acts of Parliament). SI 2015/94 was likely a regulation introduced to implement or amend a specific area of law—such as environmental standards, health and safety, consumer protection, or administrative procedures—depending on the subject matter of the original instrument.

However, **no specific details about the original content or subject matter of SI 2015/94 are provided in the reference**. This means that without further context (e.g., the parent Act or the title of the regulation), it is not possible to determine the exact provisions, purpose, or scope of the regulation that was repealed.

### Implications of Repeal:
- The legal effect of SI 2015/94 is now null and void.
- Any obligations, duties, or rules established by the regulation are no longer enforceable.
- Any references to the regulation in existing legal instruments, court decisions, or administrative procedures must be updated or replaced with current legislation.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Improve legal clarity by removing outdated or redundant rules.
  - Align with new legislation or policy objectives.
  - Correct inconsistencies or errors in the original regulation.

### How to Find More Information:
To obtain the full details of what SI 2015/94 originally regulated, one should consult:
- The **UK Statutory Instruments database** (e.g., legislation.gov.uk)
- The **official title and summary** of SI 2015/94
- The **parent Act** that originally authorized the regulation
- The **repealing instrument** (e.g., SI 2015/XXX or another Act) that formally removed it

> Example: If SI 2015/94 had been a regulation under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, it may have dealt with emissions standards or waste disposal. Its repeal would mean those standards are now governed by updated or different regulations.

### Conclusion:
**SI 2015/94 is a repealed statutory instrument.** While it was once in force, it is no longer applicable. The exact content, purpose, and subject matter of the regulation cannot be determined from the given reference alone. To understand the full context, one must consult the official legislative record or the parent Act and the instrument that repealed it.

👉 **Recommendation:** To proceed with further analysis, identify the full title of SI 2015/94 (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2015 (SI 2015/94)") and check it on legislation.gov.uk or through the UK government’s legislative database.
