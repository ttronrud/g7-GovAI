### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**

The **Canada–Nova Scotia Offshore Area Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** (the "Regulations") are a comprehensive set of occupational health and safety (OHS) rules developed under the **Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act** (the "Act"). These Regulations were enacted to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of workers involved in offshore petroleum operations in the shared offshore area between Canada and Nova Scotia.

This summary provides a detailed breakdown of the regulation’s **context, purpose, definitions, key provisions, and enforcement mechanisms**.

---

## **1. Background and Legislative Authority**

### **Legal Basis**
- The Regulations are made under:
  - **Section 210.127(1)a** of the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*, which authorizes the Minister of Natural Resources to make regulations for offshore occupational health and safety.
  - **Paragraphs 153(1)(f)e and 210.001(3)(a)a** of the Act, which empower the Governor in Council to adopt regulations with the recommendation of relevant ministers.
- The Minister of Natural Resources consulted:
  - The **Minister of Labour** (on overall OHS framework),
  - The **Minister of Transport** (on marine-specific issues),
  - The **Nova Scotia Minister of Labour** (on general OHS matters),
  - The **Provincial Minister for Nova Scotia** (specifically on **Part 33**, which relates to diving operations).

All consulted parties approved the proposed regulations, confirming their alignment with provincial and national standards.

> This process ensures **cooperative governance**, **multi-jurisdictional alignment**, and **procedural transparency** before final adoption.

## **2. Scope and Application**

### **Applicability**
- Applies to all **offshore petroleum installations**, including platforms, vessels, and mobile units operating in the **shared offshore area** between Canada and Nova Scotia.
- Covers **all employees, contractors, and workers** engaged in activities related to exploration, drilling, production, maintenance, and support operations.

### **Key Regulatory Framework**
- Operates under **Part III.1 of the Act**, which establishes the framework for occupational health and safety in offshore operations.
- Supplements and supersedes **Nova Scotia’s Offshore Petroleum Installations Regulations** and **Drilling and Production Regulations**, where there is conflict — **these Regulations prevail**.

## **4. Key Provisions and Requirements**

### **A. Occupational Health and Safety Policy (Section 210.011)**
The operator must include in its OHS policy:
- A **commitment to cooperate** with health and safety committees or coordinators.
- An **overview of duties** under Part III.1 of the Act for all personnel.

> This promotes **accountability, transparency, and shared responsibility**.

---

### **B. Occupational Health and Safety Management System (Section 210.015)**

The system must establish procedures for:
1. **Setting and reviewing goals** for workplace safety:
   - Annual review of goals and targets.
   - Measurable outcomes for improvement.
2. **Employee Competency and Awareness**:
   - All employees must be **competent persons** for their tasks.
   - Must be informed of activities or events that could impact their health or safety.
   - Must be supervised to ensure safe performance.
3. **Access to Documents**:
   - Latest versions of all safety-related documents must be readily available.
4. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Collect, manage, and analyze data on:
     - Hazards
     - Occupational diseases
     - Accidents and incidents
     - Trends
   - Identify patterns and risks.
