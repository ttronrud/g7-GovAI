**Detailed Summary of the Withdrawal of Entities Regulations (S.C. 1999, c. 34, s. 92(6))**

---

### **Overview**

The *Withdrawal of Entities Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under specific provisions of two key federal statutes:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(v.7)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**

These regulations govern how **public service employees** are treated in terms of **superannuation (pension) rights** when their employer — a government entity or part of an entity — is formally **removed from the public service** through an order under subsection 42(4) of the PSSA.

This process, known as a "withdrawal of an entity," typically occurs when a government department, agency, or entity is dissolved, merged, or restructured, and is no longer considered a participating employer in the public service pension system.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (PSSA), which establishes the rules for public service pension plans and benefits.

2. **Withdrawing Employer**:  
   An entity or portion of an entity that has been **removed from Part I or II of Schedule I of the PSSA** by a formal order under subsection 42(4) of the Act.  
   → This means the employer is officially "withdrawn" from the public service pension system.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These Regulations apply **only to individuals** who meet **both** of the following conditions:

1. **Ceased to be employed in the public service** for the purposes of the Act (i.e., their employment status under the PSSA has ended),  
   **and**  
2. Were **employed by the withdrawing employer on the day the order under subsection 42(4) of the PSSA was made**.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> The Regulations **do not apply** to individuals who later become re-employed by the withdrawing employer after their initial separation.

---

### **Application of PSSA Sections (Sections 12 to 13.01)**

Once a person ceases to be employed by the withdrawing employer, the relevant provisions of the PSSA (specifically **Sections 12 to 13.01**) apply **on and after the day of cessation of employment**.

This ensures continuity in pension rights, even after the employer is removed from the pension system.

---

### **Specific Provisions and Their Implications**

#### 1. **Death Benefit (Section 12(8))**
- If a person **dies while employed by the withdrawing employer**, their **survivor and children** are entitled to a **return of contributions** (i.e., a death benefit equal to the amount of contributions made).
- This benefit is **not contingent on future re-employment** and applies even if the employer is later withdrawn.

#### 2. **Survivor and Child Allowances (Section 13(3))**
- Survivors and children of a deceased employee are entitled to **allowances** specified in **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the PSSA.
- These allowances are subject to the **limitations** set out in **subsections 12(4) and (5)** of the Act (e.g., age thresholds, number of dependents, etc.).

> Example: A surviving spouse may receive a survivor pension, and children may receive child allowances, based on the employee’s contribution history.

#### 3. **Child Allowance for Children Born or Adopted During Employment Termination (Section 26(2))**
- A child born to, adopted by, or who becomes a stepchild of the employee **during the period** that runs from:
  - The day the employee **ceases to be employed in the public service**,  
  - To the day they **cease to be employed by the withdrawing employer**,  
  is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA**.
- This ensures that children born or adopted during a transitional period are not excluded from pension benefits.

> Example: If an employee leaves on May 1, 2024, and a child is born on May 15, 2024, the child qualifies for a pension allowance under Part I.

#### 4. **One-Year Period for Re-employment (Section 10(5))**
- The **one-year period** referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the PSSA (which relates to re-employment rights or benefits) begins on the day the person **ceases to be employed by the withdrawing employer**.
- This is critical for determining eligibility for re-employment benefits or transitional protections.

#### 5. **Pensionable Service Period (Sections 12 and 13)**
- **Pensionable service** includes the period of employment with the withdrawing employer that:
  - Begins on the day the person **ceases to be employed in the public service**,  
  - And ends on the day they **cease to be employed by the withdrawing employer**.
- This means that the final days of employment with the withdrawing employer are counted as pensionable service, even if the employee was not formally hired or employed for those days.

> This is a key point — it recognizes the final period of service as part of the employee’s pension record.

#### 6. **Age at Cessation of Employment**
- For purposes of determining pension eligibility (e.g., retirement age), the **age of the employee is taken as their age on the day they cease to be employed by the withdrawing employer**.
- This ensures that age-based pension calculations are based on the actual date of separation.

#### 7. **Group 1 Contributor Status**
- Any person to whom these Regulations apply is considered a **Group 1 contributor** under the PSSA.
- Group 1 contributors are typically those who are employed in the federal public service and are subject to the standard pension plan provisions.
- This classification ensures that such individuals are treated consistently with other public service employees in terms of pension rights and contribution rules.

### **Effective Date**

These Regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal regulations).

This ensures that the rules are immediately operational upon formal adoption.

---

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

The primary objectives of these Regulations are:

1. **To provide legal certainty** for employees whose employer is withdrawn from the public service.
2. **To protect pension rights** during transitions, including:
   - Death benefits,
   - Survivor and child allowances,
   - Pensionable service,
   - Re-employment periods.
3. **To ensure fairness** in treatment of employees who lose their employment due to organizational changes (e.g., mergers, closures, restructuring).
4. **To maintain continuity** of benefits even when an employer is no longer part of the public service pension system.
