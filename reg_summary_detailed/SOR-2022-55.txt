- **Legal Authority**:
  - Paragraph **11(2)(g)a** of the Act empowers the Board to make by-laws.

### **2. Purpose of the By-law**

The primary purpose of this by-law is to **define and prescribe a class of eligible financial contracts** (referred to as "eligible financial contracts") that are **subject to the application of specific provisions of the Act**, particularly those governing **actions by parties to a contract** that could affect the financial stability or solvency of a federal member institution.

These provisions include **subsections 39.15(7.1) to (7.104) and (7.11)** of the Act — which outline the **rights and obligations of parties** in financial contracts, including the **conditions under which CDIC may intervene or provide insurance** in the event of a financial distress or default.

---

### **3. Key Definitions and Classes**

#### **A. Class of Federal Member Institutions**

- The by-law **prescribes the class of all federal member institutions** (as defined in the Bank Act) for the purpose of subsection **39.15(7.4)** of the Act.
- This means that **all institutions** that are members of the federal banking system (e.g., chartered banks, credit unions, trust and savings banks) are included in this scope.

#### **B. Class of Eligible Financial Contracts**

For each federal member institution, the by-law defines a **specific class of eligible financial contracts** that fall within the scope of subsection 39.15(7.4) of the Act — that is, contracts to which the institution is a party and which may trigger CDIC’s insurance or intervention mechanisms.

A contract qualifies for this class **only if it meets all of the following conditions**:

---

##### **Condition 1: Provisions Permitting Action Under Paragraphs 39.15(7)(a), (b), or (f)**

The contract must contain **provisions that allow a party to take certain actions** — specifically, those listed in paragraphs **39.15(7)(a), (b), or (f)** of the Act — **by a party other than**:

- Her Majesty in right of Canada  
- The government of a foreign country  
- A central bank  
- A clearing house (as defined in subsection 39.15(9) of the Act)  
- A central counter-party (as defined in section 2 of the *Payment Clearing and Settlement Act*)

👉 **Interpretation**: This means that **only parties other than these high-level or systemic entities** can take actions (such as initiating a claim, triggering a default, or exercising a right to terminate) that would be subject to CDIC’s regulatory oversight or insurance provisions.

---

##### **Condition 2: Contract Not Governed by Canadian Law or Key Party Status**

The contract must **not be governed by Canadian law**, or **at least one of the other parties to the contract** must **not be**:
- An individual who is **resident in Canada**, or  
- A **Canadian entity** (as defined in section 2 of the *Bank Act*)

👉 **Interpretation**: This excludes contracts involving purely domestic parties or those governed by Canadian law. It is designed to **exclude domestic, low-risk contracts** and focus on **cross-border or international financial instruments** where the risk profile is more complex or systemic.

---

##### **Condition 3: Contract Meets One of the Following Criteria**

The contract must meet **at least one** of the following:

1. **Entered into, amended, or renewed on or after October 1, 2023**, and at least one of the other parties is:
   - A **federal member institution** or an **affiliate of a federal member institution**, **OR**
   - An institution identified by the **Financial Stability Board (FSB)** as a **global systemically important bank (G-SIB)** or an affiliate of such an institution.

2. **Entered into, amended, or renewed on or after October 1, 2024** (a future date).

3. **Part of a broader contract structure** where:
   - At least one other party and the federal member institution are **together parties to another contract** that is **also part of a class prescribed by this section**.

👉 **Interpretation**:
- This creates a **tiered approach** to risk classification:
  - Contracts from **2023 onwards** involving G-SIBs or affiliated institutions are automatically included.
  - Contracts from **2024 onwards** are included regardless of the counterparty, signaling a **phased-in expansion** of coverage.
  - Contracts that are **linked to other qualifying contracts** (e.g., through a master agreement or linked derivatives) are also included, ensuring **systemic risk exposure is captured even in indirect forms**.

---

### **4. Obligations of Federal Member Institutions**

Every federal member institution must:

- Ensure that **all eligible financial contracts** that fall within the class prescribed for it under this by-law:
  - Contain **clear provisions** stating that the parties **agree to the application of subsections 39.15(7.1) to (7.104) and (7.11)** of the Act.
  - These provisions must specifically apply to **actions taken by parties other than** those listed in paragraphs 39.15(7)(a) to (f) (i.e., excluding the listed entities such as central banks or foreign governments).

👉 **Key Requirement**: The inclusion of such **agreement clauses** ensures **transparency, legal clarity, and enforceability** of CDIC’s insurance and intervention rights in the event of a financial crisis.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

- The by-law **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government.
- Registration is expected to occur shortly after the date of issuance (March 2, 2022), though the exact date will be published in the *Canada Gazette*.

### **6. Significance and Implications**

#### **Why This By-law Matters**:

1. **Expands CDIC’s Regulatory Reach**:
   - Moves beyond traditional deposit insurance to cover **financial contracts** that may pose systemic risk, especially those involving **international or high-risk counterparties**.

2. **Addresses Systemic Risk**:
   - By including contracts with G-SIBs and those entered into after 2023/2024, the by-law helps CDIC **monitor and manage exposure to global financial instability**.

3. **Improves Risk Disclosure and Governance**:
   - Requires institutions to **explicitly agree** to CDIC’s provisions, promoting **accountability and transparency** in financial arrangements.

4. **Aligns with Global Financial Standards**:
   - The inclusion of FSB-designated G-SIBs reflects alignment with international frameworks (e.g., Basel III, FSB guidelines) on financial stability and cross-border risk management.

5. **Phased Implementation**:
   - The staggered timeline (October 1, 2023 and 2024) allows institutions time to **update their contracts** and comply with new obligations without sudden disruption.

---

### **7. Limitations and Exclusions**

- Contracts governed by **Canadian law** involving **domestic residents or Canadian entities** are **excluded** from this class.
- Contracts involving **central banks, clearing houses, or central counterparties** are excluded from triggering CDIC’s provisions.
- The by-law **does not apply to deposits or traditional banking services** — only to **financial contracts** with specific structural or risk characteristics.

---

### **Conclusion**

This by-law represents a **significant step in modernizing CDIC’s regulatory framework** to address the evolving nature of financial risk in a globalized economy. By clearly defining which financial contracts are subject to CDIC’s insurance and intervention mechanisms — especially those involving international or systemically important institutions — it enhances **financial stability, transparency, and accountability**.

It ensures that federal member institutions are **proactively managing their exposure** to systemic risks through contractual agreements, and that CDIC can respond effectively to financial distress in a timely and legally sound manner.
