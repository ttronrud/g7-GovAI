The regulation you provided is a legal instrument issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, and is rooted in the *Financial Administration Act*. Here is a detailed and clear summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Remission of Tax Amounts Pursuant to Interpretation of the Indian Income Tax Remission Order

**Legal Basis:**  
- The regulation is issued under **subsection 23(2)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (F.A.A.).  
- It is based on a recommendation from the **Minister of National Revenue**.  
- The Governor General in Council, acting on this recommendation, exercises a discretionary power to remit certain tax amounts.

**Core Provision:**  
The regulation provides for the **remittance of amounts** that would have been remitted *if* the *Indian Income Tax Remission Order* had included a reference to a provision in a relevant Act that is analogous to **subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act**.

**Key Interpretation:**  
- The *Indian Income Tax Remission Order* (a prior order that allows for tax remission for certain individuals or circumstances) currently refers to subsection 87(1) of the *Indian Act*.  
- Subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act generally provides that certain Indigenous individuals (e.g., members of recognized Indian bands) may be exempt from certain taxes or obligations under specific conditions.  
- However, the regulation acknowledges that the *remission order* does not explicitly reference a similar provision in another Act (e.g., a federal tax or income-related statute) that could be considered functionally equivalent.  
- The Governor General in Council, upon recommendation, determines that **remittances should be made as if such a similar provision existed** in a cited Act — thereby ensuring consistency and fairness in tax treatment for individuals who may fall under analogous circumstances.

**Purpose and Public Interest:**  
- The action is taken **in the public interest**, as stated in the preamble.  
- The goal is to ensure that individuals who are subject to tax obligations under circumstances similar to those covered by subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act are not disadvantaged due to a lack of explicit reference in the remission order.  
- It promotes **equity and consistency** in tax treatment, particularly for Indigenous peoples who may have unique legal and historical status under the Indian Act.

**Legal Effect:**  
- The regulation **remits tax amounts** that would have been remitted had the Indian Income Tax Remission Order included a comparable provision in another Act.  
- This means that individuals who meet the criteria of the original remission order — and who would have been entitled to remission under a similar provision in another law — are now entitled to the same tax remission, even in the absence of an explicit reference.

**Source and Citation:**  
- The regulation is found in **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)**.  
- This refers to the *Indian Income Tax Remission Order, 1991*, which is a statutory instrument that grants tax relief to certain individuals, particularly those with Indigenous status.

**In Plain Terms:**  
This regulation ensures that individuals who would have been eligible for tax remission under a similar legal provision in another federal Act (like the Indian Act) are now being treated fairly and consistently. Even though the original remission order only references the Indian Act, the government is retroactively adjusting the application of the order to include comparable rights under other relevant legislation — all to uphold fairness and public interest.

---

**Significance:**  
- It reflects a broader principle of **equity in Indigenous rights and tax policy**.  
- It demonstrates the government’s recognition that certain Indigenous individuals may be subject to tax obligations that are analogous to those covered by the Indian Act.  
- It reinforces the importance of **legal consistency** in tax relief orders, particularly when dealing with Indigenous communities.

**Note:**  
This regulation is not a new tax policy but rather a **corrective or interpretive measure** to ensure that tax remission is applied fairly and consistently across different legal frameworks. It does not create new tax benefits but rather clarifies the scope of existing ones.

--- 

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a technical and principled interpretation of tax remission provisions, ensuring that individuals with status or circumstances similar to those in subsection 87(1) of the Indian Act are not excluded from tax relief due to a lack of explicit reference in the remission order. It serves the public interest by promoting fairness, consistency, and equity in the application of tax law.
