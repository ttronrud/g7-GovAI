### **Overview**

This regulation formally transfers control and supervision of a specific administrative unit within the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) — the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** — to the **Department of Transport**. The transfer specifically applies to the portions of the Crown Corporation Secretariat that relate to two major federal Crown corporations:  

1. The **Royal Canadian Mint**  
2. The **Canada Post Corporation**

This transfer was not a reorganization of the entire CRA, nor did it affect the CRA’s core tax administration functions. Instead, it involved a shift in administrative oversight and management responsibility for the operational and administrative support functions related to these two Crown corporations.

### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Subject Matter of the Transfer**  
   - The transfer pertains to the **Crown Corporation Secretariat** within the Canada Revenue Agency.  
   - This secretariat provides administrative, financial, and operational support services to federal Crown corporations.  
   - The specific functions transferred are those related to the **Royal Canadian Mint** and the **Canada Post Corporation**.

2. **Nature of the Transfer**  
   - The regulation establishes a transfer of **control and supervision**, not ownership or operational management.  
   - This means that the Department of Transport assumes responsibility for policy direction, administrative oversight, and management of the secretariat’s functions related to the two Crown corporations.  
   - The CRA retains its legal and financial responsibilities for these entities, but the day-to-day administrative oversight and supervision are now under the Department of Transport.

3. **Effective Date**  
   - The transfer becomes effective on **February 6, 2006**.  
   - All administrative functions, reporting lines, and policy decisions related to the Crown Corporation Secretariat for these two entities are to be implemented from this date.

4. **Legal Authority**  
   - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.  
   - This provision allows the federal government (via the Governor General in Council, on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign administrative responsibilities between departments, provided it serves the public interest and maintains the integrity of public service operations.

5. **Rationale (Implied Context)**  
   - The transfer likely reflects a broader government strategy to align administrative oversight with the operational and strategic priorities of the entities involved.  
   - The **Royal Canadian Mint** and **Canada Post Corporation** are both national institutions with significant public-facing roles.  
   - The Department of Transport may have been chosen due to its existing oversight of transportation-related infrastructure and services, or due to a perceived need for more coherent governance of Crown corporations with public service mandates.  
   - This move may also have been part of a broader effort to streamline Crown corporation governance and reduce bureaucratic overlap.

### **Impact and Implications**

- **For the Royal Canadian Mint:**  
  - The mint’s administrative support functions (e.g., human resources, financial reporting, policy coordination) previously managed by the CRA are now under the supervision of the Department of Transport.  
  - The mint continues to operate as a Crown corporation under the Department of Finance, but its administrative oversight is now coordinated through a different department.

- **For Canada Post Corporation:**  
  - Similar administrative oversight functions are now managed under the Department of Transport.  
  - Canada Post remains a Crown corporation under the Department of Finance, but the secretariat-level support is now aligned with Transport’s administrative framework.

- **For the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA):**  
  - The CRA retains its core tax administration responsibilities.  
  - The CRA’s role in managing Crown corporations is now reduced to a technical or advisory capacity, with the operational supervision being transferred.

- **For Public Service Efficiency:**  
  - The transfer aims to improve coordination and accountability in managing national institutions.  
  - It may also enhance strategic alignment between government departments and Crown corporations.

### **Limitations and Clarifications**

- The transfer **does not** affect the legal status, funding, or operational autonomy of the Royal Canadian Mint or Canada Post Corporation.  
- The transfer is limited to **control and supervision** — not the day-to-day management of operations.  
- The CRA continues to have a role in financial oversight, compliance, and reporting, as required by law.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal public service. By transferring the oversight of the Crown Corporation Secretariat related to the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Post Corporation from the Canada Revenue Agency to the Department of Transport, the government aims to improve governance, accountability, and strategic alignment for these key national institutions. The move underscores the flexibility of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act in enabling departments to realign administrative responsibilities based on policy and operational needs, all while maintaining the integrity and stability of public services.

This transfer was effective as of **February 6, 2006**, and marked a shift in administrative responsibility without altering the fundamental roles or legal status of the Crown corporations involved.
