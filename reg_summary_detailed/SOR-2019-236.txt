**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Barrens Willow (Salix jejuna) Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Framework**  
This regulation is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, a federal law in Canada designed to protect and recover wildlife species at risk. The Order is grounded in **subsection 58(4) and (5)** of SARA, which empower the Minister of the Environment to designate and regulate the critical habitat of endangered species.

---

**2. Species at Stake: Barrens Willow (Salix jejuna)**  
- The Barrens Willow (*Salix jejuna*) is a plant species classified as **endangered** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act*.  
- This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Designation**  
- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Barrens Willow was developed and is **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to track species at risk and their conservation status.  
- This recovery strategy identifies the **specific areas (critical habitat)** essential for the survival and recovery of the species.  
- The critical habitat is defined as the area that is **essential for the survival and recovery** of the species, including the physical and biological conditions necessary for its life cycle (e.g., soil type, moisture, sunlight, and proximity to water sources).

---

**4. Jurisdictional Considerations**  
- The Order specifies that **no portion of the designated critical habitat lies within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.  
  - Subsection 58(2)b of SARA refers to areas that are **prohibited from being used for certain activities** (such as development or resource extraction) because they are critical habitat.  
  - By confirming that the critical habitat is not located in such a restricted zone, the Order avoids potential conflicts with existing environmental protections or land-use designations.

---

**5. Consultation with Relevant Minister**  
- The Minister of the Environment has determined that **some portions of the designated critical habitat fall under the authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**.  
- In accordance with **subsection 58(9)** of SARA, the Minister of the Environment **consulted with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** before issuing the Order.  
- This consultation ensures that the interests of federal departments managing different land or resource jurisdictions are considered and that any potential impacts on MFO-managed areas are addressed.

---

**6. Purpose and Legal Effect of the Order**  
- The Order formally **designates the specific geographic areas** as the **critical habitat** for the Barrens Willow (*Salix jejuna*).  
- By doing so, it legally **prohibits or restricts certain activities** (such as development, logging, or habitat alteration) that could degrade or destroy the habitat, unless authorized under specific exemptions or permits.  
- The Order is binding and enforceable under SARA, and any person or entity planning activities in the designated area must comply with the requirements of the Act.

---

**7. Effective Date**  
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette, the official journal of federal laws.  
- This ensures transparency and legal certainty, allowing stakeholders to begin compliance planning promptly.

---

**8. Key Implications**  
- **Conservation Focus**: The Order reinforces the protection of the Barrens Willow’s ecological requirements, contributing to its long-term survival.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: The consultation with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans demonstrates interdepartmental coordination and respect for jurisdictional boundaries.  
- **Legal Accountability**: The designation strengthens enforcement mechanisms and provides a legal basis for challenging activities that threaten the species’ habitat.  
- **Public Access**: The inclusion of the recovery strategy in the Species at Risk Public Registry ensures transparency and public awareness of conservation efforts.

---

**Conclusion**  
This Critical Habitat Order is a formal, legally binding step in the recovery of the endangered Barrens Willow. It reflects a comprehensive application of SARA, combining scientific assessment, intergovernmental consultation, and legal enforcement to protect a vital component of Canada’s biodiversity. The Order serves as a foundational tool for habitat protection, ensuring that the Barrens Willow has the necessary conditions to survive and recover in the wild.
