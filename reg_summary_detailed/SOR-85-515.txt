### **Detailed Summary of the Toronto Island Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1984, c. 40, s. 2)**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Authority**
These regulations are enacted under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**.  
- The regulations are formally titled: **"Toronto Island Airport Zoning Regulations"**.
- Their primary objective is to **ensure aviation safety** at Toronto Island Airport by establishing strict **height and land-use restrictions** around the airport to prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the Toronto Island Airport located on Toronto Island, within the City of Toronto and the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to establish elevation and spatial coordinates. It is located 35 meters northerly at right angles from a point 610 meters easterly along the centerline of runway 08–26. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (runway 08–26). These surfaces define the maximum allowable height for structures near the runway ends during approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **76 meters above sea level** (or 9 meters above ground if lower), forming the upper boundary of the zone. This ensures that no structure exceeds a safe altitude above the airport reference point. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, specifically the **runway 08–26**, measuring **150 meters in width** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,280 meters in length**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface. This ensures a smooth transition from the runway edges to the outer safety zone. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 76 meters above sea level.

#### **3. Scope of Application**
The regulations apply to **all lands**, including public road allowances, **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, as precisely defined in **Part VI of the schedule**.

The boundary of the regulated zone is described in detail using **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates** and directional bearings (azimuths), forming a complex, geometric boundary that encompasses areas surrounding the airport. This boundary includes:
- The airport reference point,
- Runway ends,
- Approach surfaces,
- Transitional surfaces,
- And surrounding land parcels.

The zone is designed to protect critical flight paths and ensure visibility and clearance for aircraft.

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

**No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land if the highest point of that object exceeds any of the following surfaces:**

1. **Approach Surface** – for each end of the runway (08 and 26).
2. **Outer Surface** – a flat surface at 76 m above sea level (or 9 m above ground if the ground is lower).
3. **Transitional Surface** – rising from the sides of the strip and approach surfaces to meet the outer surface.

> This means that **all structures (buildings, trees, towers, antennas, etc.) must remain below the specified surfaces** to prevent interference with aircraft operations.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vines) on regulated land **exceeds** any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may issue a direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.
- This provision ensures that even vegetation does not pose a hazard to aircraft.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

- **No owner or occupier** of regulated land may allow the land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.
- This is a critical measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation safety risk.

#### **7. Description of Key Surfaces (Detailed)**

##### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located 35 meters north of a point 610 meters east along the centerline of runway 08–26.
- UTM Coordinates: **N 4,831,752.70; E 629,357.45**

##### **B. Approach Surfaces**
- **Runway 08 Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined plane with 1:50 slope (1 meter rise per 50 meters horizontal).
  - Rises to a horizontal line 7,927 meters from the end of the strip.
  - Outer ends of this line are 1,264.05 meters from the centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **158.54 meters above** the elevation at the end of the strip.

- **Runway 26 Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined plane with 1:20 slope (1 meter rise per 20 meters horizontal).
  - Same horizontal distance (7,927 meters) from the end of the strip.
  - Outer ends are also 1,264.05 meters from the centerline.
  - The horizontal line is **396.35 meters above** the elevation at the end of the strip.

> These surfaces are designed to provide **clearance for aircraft during final approach**, especially in the critical final 10–20 km before landing.

##### **C. Outer Surface**
- A flat surface at **76 meters above sea level**.
- **Exception**: Where the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, the outer surface is defined as **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that even on low-lying terrain, the height restriction is not violated.

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces** to meet the outer surface.
- These surfaces ensure that the height restriction smoothly transitions from the runway edges to the outer safety zone.

#### **8. Boundary Description (Key Land Parcel)**

The regulated land boundary is defined by a precise sequence of bearings and distances from the ARP, using UTM coordinates. Key segments include:

1. Start at the ARP.
2. Move 35 meters on azimuth 160°11′36″ to the centerline of runway 08–26.
3. Proceed 640 meters west along the centerline to the western edge of the strip.
4. Move 607 meters on azimuth 340°11′36″ to the northern limit of the northern transitional surface.
5. Continue east along the northern limit of the northern transitional surface (azimuth 70°11′36″) to 1,280 meters.
6. Proceed to the intersection with the northern limit of the 26 approach surface.
7. Continue east along the northern limit of approach surface 26 (azimuth 61°39′45″) to its northeast corner.
8. Travel south along the eastern limit of approach surface 26 (azimuth 160°11′36″) to its southeast corner.
9. Move west along the southern limit of approach surface 26 (azimuth 258°43′27″) to an arc of 4,000 meters from ARP.
10. Follow a circular arc (radius 4,000 meters) to intersect the southern limit of the southern transitional surface.
11. Proceed west along the southern limit of the southern transitional surface to its intersection with the southern limit of approach surface 08.
12. Travel west along the southern limit of approach surface 08 to its southwest corner.
13. Move north along the western limit of approach surface 08 (azimuth 340°11′36″) to its northwest corner.
14. Proceed east along the northern limit of approach surface 08 (azimuth 78°43′27″) to intersect the northern limit of the northern transitional surface.
15. Finish by continuing east along the northern limit of the northern transitional surface back to the starting point.

> This creates a **closed, irregular polygon** that defines the full area subject to height and land-use controls.

#### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue **directions** requiring removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height limits and waste disposal rules.
- Violations could result in **fines, demolition orders, or legal action**.

#### **10. Significance and Impact**

- These regulations are a **critical component of aviation safety infrastructure** in Canada.
- They ensure that:
  - Aircraft have **clear visual and physical access** to the runway during takeoff and landing.
  - There are **no obstructions** (natural or man-made) that could interfere with flight paths.
  - The risk of **bird strikes** is minimized by
