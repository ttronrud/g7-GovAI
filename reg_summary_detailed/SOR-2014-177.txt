### **Detailed Summary of the Disposal at Sea Permit Application Regulations (Canada)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Disposal at Sea Permit Application Regulations** are issued under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically:

- **Subsection 332(1)a**: Allows the Minister of the Environment to publish proposed regulations in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing public notice and an opportunity for comment or objection.
- **Subsection 135(3)c**: Authorizes the Minister to adopt and promulgate the proposed regulations after receiving public feedback, including objections that may trigger a board of review.

On **December 14, 2013**, the Minister published a proposed version of these regulations in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*. This allowed stakeholders—including industry, environmental groups, and the public—to submit comments or file **notices of objection**, which could lead to a formal review by a board of review.

On **July 7, 2014**, the Minister formally adopted and enacted the regulations, effective upon the coming into force of **subsection 161(3)** of the *Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act* (2012), or upon registration if that date had passed.

> **Note**: These regulations came into force on **September 24, 2014**, as per SI/2014-6.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **establish a standardized, transparent, and environmentally protective framework** for the application, approval, and renewal of permits to dispose of certain substances at sea. The regulations ensure that:

- Disposal at sea is only permitted when no safer alternatives exist;
- Environmental and human health risks are thoroughly assessed;
- All relevant scientific, technical, and economic factors are considered;
- The disposal activity complies with CEPA’s environmental protection principles.

#### **3. Key Provisions and Requirements**

##### **A. Application Forms and Submission Requirements**

Two distinct application forms are required:

| Type of Application | Form | Required Information |
|--------------------|------|------------------------|
| **Initial Permit Application** | Schedule 1 | All information required in the form, including substance details, chemical composition, physical properties, alternatives assessment, disposal site data, and emergency provisions (if applicable). |
| **Renewal Application** | Schedule 2 | Updated information on the same parameters as the initial application, with emphasis on ongoing environmental performance, compliance history, and changes in operations or waste streams. |

> Applications must be submitted in the prescribed format and include:
> - Completed form with all required fields;
> - Application fee;
> - All supporting documentation.

Applications must be sent to the **nearest regional Disposal at Sea Program office of Environment Canada**.

---

##### **B. Mandatory Environmental and Health Assessment (Alternatives Analysis)**

A **comprehensive comparative assessment** of disposal at sea versus **practicable alternatives** is required. This assessment must address the following five key areas:

1. **Environmental Impact**  
   - Effects on marine ecosystems, including benthic and epibenthic communities, sediment quality, and water column health.

2. **Risk to Human Health**  
   - Potential exposure to contaminants via seafood, water, or air (especially for coastal communities).

3. **Hazards (including accidents)**  
   - Risks during treatment, packaging, transport, and disposal (e.g., spills, fires, structural failures).

4. **Economics (including energy costs)**  
   - Cost-benefit analysis of disposal vs. alternatives such as landfilling, recycling, or onshore treatment.

5. **Conflicting Use of Resources**  
   - Competition with other uses (e.g., fishing, shipping, recreation, habitat conservation).

> For **incineration**, additional details are required in **Part 2 of Appendix 1**, including combustion products, emission controls, and stack testing.

---

##### **C. Substance-Specific Information Requirements**

The regulations require detailed data depending on the type of waste being disposed of.

###### **1. Soil or Sediment**
- Indicate relative presence of:
  - Boulders and cobble
  - Gravel
  - Sand
  - Silt
  - Clay
  - Peat and organic components
  - Other materials (e.g., wood waste, seaweed)

###### **2. Rock**
- Indicate relative presence of:
  - Sedimentary rock
  - Metamorphic rock
  - Igneous rock

###### **3. Chemical Information (for soil/sediment/pore water)**
Must report:
- Cadmium
- Mercury
- Other metals (via full metal scan)
- Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
- Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
- Total organic carbon
- Any other chemicals specified by the Minister under **Schedule 6 of CEPA**

> These contaminants are of particular concern due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity.

###### **4. Physical Information**
- Grain size distribution of soil or sediment
- Any other physical data specified by the Minister (e.g., pH, moisture content)

---

##### **D. Vessels or Aircraft to be Disposed Of**

If disposing of a vessel or aircraft, the following must be provided:

- Species/type of waste (e.g., shells, offal)
- Source of waste
- Name, registry, model/official number, dimensions, dead weight tonnage (DWT)
- Principal materials of construction
- Owner’s name and address
- Seaworthiness status

###### **Cargo, Fuel, and Hazardous Materials**
- Description of any cargo, fuel, or hazardous chemicals left on board

###### **Last Cargo, Engine Type, and Ballast**
- Last cargo carried
- Type of engine (if remaining)
- Nature and weight of ballast (e.g., water, oil)

---

##### **E. Incineration-Specific Requirements (Under Section 128 of CEPA)**

If the disposal involves **incineration** (especially in emergencies), the application must include:

###### **1. Substance to be Incinerated**
