  - By **SOR/2017-110, section 2** (likely due to policy or regulatory modernization)
  - Also previously by **SOR/2000-104, section 1**
- This means **no current legal obligation** exists under this regulation.
- It may have been replaced by newer environmental or fuel reporting frameworks (e.g., under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)** or **Fuel Additive Regulations** under the **Ministry of Environment and Climate Change**).

---

## 📚 Conclusion

Although this regulation has been **officially repealed**, it historically governed:

- Mandatory reporting of **fuel production and importation** (above 400 m³ per quarter)
- **Additive disclosures** (for non-lead additives) when a cumulative volume of 400 m³ is reached
- Strict **timelines** (60 days for new additives, 60 days for changes)
- **Electronic submission** with official authentication

> 📌 **Status Today**: **Repealed** — Not currently in effect.  
> 🔍 **Replacement**: Likely replaced by more modern or comprehensive fuel reporting systems under CEPA or other environmental statutes.

---

## ✅ Recommendation

If you are a fuel producer, importer, or regulator reviewing compliance:

- **Verify current applicable regulations** under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)** or the **Federal Fuel Additive Regulations**.
- Consult the **Government of Canada’s Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)** website for up-to-date reporting requirements.
