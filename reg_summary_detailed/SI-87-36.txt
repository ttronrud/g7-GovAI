This official notice formally announces that the **Canada–People’s Republic of China Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income** has officially come into force.

Key Points:

1. **Agreement in Force:**  
   The Canada-China Income Tax Agreement, which was signed between Canada and the People’s Republic of China, entered into force on **December 29, 1986**. This means that the legal and tax provisions outlined in the agreement have become effective and binding on both countries as of that date.

2. **Purpose of the Agreement:**  
   The primary objectives of the agreement are:
   - To **avoid double taxation** of income earned by individuals and businesses in either country.
   - To **prevent fiscal evasion** (tax avoidance or fraud) through the use of tax treaties and mutual cooperation.
   - To provide clarity and certainty for taxpayers, investors, and financial institutions operating across the two jurisdictions.

3. **Scope of the Agreement:**  
   The treaty applies to taxes on income, including:
   - Income from employment (wages, salaries)
   - Business profits
   - Dividends, interest, and royalties
   - Capital gains (in certain cases)
   - Other forms of income derived from sources in either country

4. **Legal Framework:**  
   The agreement is enacted and administered under **Section 18 of the Canada-China Income Tax Agreement Act, 1986**, which empowers the Minister of Finance to issue notices confirming the entry into force of the treaty. This statutory provision ensures that the treaty’s implementation is properly documented and recognized under Canadian law.

5. **Significance of the Notice:**  
   This notice serves as formal public confirmation that:
   - The treaty is now in effect.
   - Canadian tax authorities can apply the treaty’s provisions (e.g., tax credits, exemptions, and rules on residence and source of income).
   - Taxpayers from China and Canadians with income from China can rely on the treaty to avoid being taxed twice on the same income.

6. **Implications for Taxpayers:**  
   - Individuals and companies with income from the other country may be eligible for **tax relief** (e.g., foreign tax credits or exemptions) under the treaty.
   - The treaty establishes **rules on tax residency**, **source of income**, and **determination of tax liability** to ensure fairness and consistency.

7. **Administrative and Enforcement Role:**  
   The Minister of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) are responsible for implementing, interpreting, and enforcing the treaty provisions in accordance with Canadian tax law and international tax standards.
