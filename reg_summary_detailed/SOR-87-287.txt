The regulation you have referenced — repeatedly listed as "[Repealed, SOR/2015-72, s. 1]" — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Regulation SOR/2015-72, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The specific regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed under **Section 1 of SOR/2015-72**, which is a *Supplemental Regulation* issued by the Government of Canada. SOR stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Regulations" and is part of the official list of federal regulations.

**What SOR/2015-72 Does:**  
SOR/2015-72, titled *"Regulation respecting the use of certain substances in the manufacture of certain products"*, was introduced to address the use of specific substances in manufacturing processes. However, **Section 1** of this regulation explicitly **repeals** (cancels) a previously existing regulation — the one referenced in your query.

**Key Details of the Repeal:**  
- The repealed regulation was likely a prior rule governing the handling, use, or labeling of certain substances (e.g., in industrial or consumer products).  
- The repeal was enacted to modernize or simplify the regulatory framework, eliminate outdated or redundant provisions, or align with new safety, environmental, or health standards.  
- The repeal does not imply that the substance or activity was banned — rather, it means that the specific rules previously governing its use are no longer applicable and have been replaced, amended, or superseded by other legislation or regulations.

**Implications:**  
- Any legal or operational obligations tied to the repealed regulation are now obsolete.  
- Stakeholders (such as manufacturers, importers, or regulatory bodies) must refer to current, active regulations for compliance.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory review or consolidation effort to improve clarity and reduce administrative burden.

**Conclusion:**  
There is **no active, enforceable regulation** in the list you provided. The content of the regulation has been **officially canceled** by SOR/2015-72, section 1. Therefore, it cannot be summarized as a live rule, as it no longer applies.

👉 **Recommendation:**  
To understand the current regulatory framework, consult the **current version of SOR/2015-72** or related statutes such as the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA)* or other relevant federal legislation, depending on the context of the substance or activity in question.

If you can provide more context (e.g., the subject matter — chemicals, food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), I can help identify the current applicable regulation.
