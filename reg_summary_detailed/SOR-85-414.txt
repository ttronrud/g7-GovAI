## 💰 Fee Structure (by Service Type)

### 1. **Landing Charges**
Landing fees are calculated **per 1,000 kg (or fraction)** of the aircraft’s **maximum permissible take-off weight**.

#### A. Domestic Flights
- **Applicable for airports in Schedule I**:
  - For aircraft in the specified weight ranges (in column I), charge is set in column II of the table.
- **Applicable for airports south of the 60th parallel of north latitude, not in Schedule I**:
  - For aircraft in specified seating capacity ranges (in column I), charge is set in column II of Schedule II.
- **Minimum charge**:
  - Must not be less than the **minimum flight landing charge** listed in:
    - Section 1 or 2 of Schedule I (for airports in Schedule I).
    - Section 1 of Schedule II (for airports south of 60°N).

> Example: Minimum domestic landing charge for jet/turboprop aircraft = **$15.73** (varies slightly across versions — likely a typographical or version inconsistency).

#### B. International Flights
- **Applicable for airports in Schedule I**:
  - For aircraft in weight ranges (column III), charge is in column IV.
- **Applicable for airports south of 60°N, not in Schedule I**:
  - For aircraft in seating capacity ranges (column I), charge is in column II of Schedule III.
- **Minimum charge**:
  - Must not be less than the applicable minimum listed in:
    - Section 1 or 2 of Schedule I.
    - Section 1 of Schedule III.

> Example: Minimum international landing charge = **$16.18** (for jet/turboprop).

> 📝 **Note**: The text includes multiple repeated lines with inconsistent minimum charges (e.g., $18.49, $21.56, $16.25, $23.00). This appears to be a **formatting or typographical error** in the original document. The most consistent and likely intended minimums are:
- Domestic: **$15.73**
- International: **$16.18**

> ⚠️ These values may have been updated over time via amendments, but the 1985 version reflects the base minimums.

  - Based on seating capacity ranges (column I of Schedule V) → charge in column III.

#### B. International Flights OR Domestic Flights with Customs Requirements
- Applies when crew or passengers must present themselves to customs.
