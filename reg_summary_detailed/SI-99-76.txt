### 6. **Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

#### a) **Totalization of Creditable Periods**
If a person does not meet the required creditable periods under one Party’s legislation, their entitlement is determined by **totalizing**:
- Creditable periods under both Parties,
- Creditable periods under a **third State** with which both Parties have a separate social security agreement (totalization allowed).

> This enables individuals to build up sufficient contribution history across borders.

#### b) **Application of Totalization to Specific Benefits**

##### i) **Old Age Security Act (OASA) – Canada**
- **Periods in Trinidad and Tobago**:
  - If a person is subject to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan during a period in Trinidad and Tobago, that time counts as **residence in Canada** for the person and their spouse/dependants (who are not covered by Trinidad and Tobago employment/self-employment).
- **Periods in Canada**:
  - If a person is subject to Trinidad and Tobago legislation during a period in Canada, that time **does not** count as residence in Canada for the person or their dependants (unless covered by CPP or provincial plan).
- **Exception for Persons from Trinidad and Tobago**:
  - If a Trinidadian resident works in Canada and is subject to CPP or provincial plan, that period counts as **residence in Canada** for purposes of OASA.

##### ii) **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) – Canada**
- A **calendar year** in which the person has at least **13 creditable weeks** under Trinidad and Tobago’s legislation is considered as **one year of contributions** under the CPP.

##### iii) **Trinidad and Tobago Retirement Benefits**
- **Year 1972** (creditable under CPP): counts as **40 weeks** of contributions under Trinidad and Tobago legislation.
- **Years from January 1, 1973 onward** (creditable under CPP): count as **52 weeks** of contributions under Trinidad and Tobago legislation.
- **Weeks under OASA (post-April 10, 1972)** not part of CPP creditable periods: count as **one week** of contributions under Trinidad and Tobago legislation.

##### iv) **Survivors’ Benefits (Trinidad and Tobago)**
- Same rules as retirement benefits:
  - 1972: 40 weeks
  - 1973 onwards: 52 weeks

> These rules ensure that contributions made in Canada (especially pre-1973) are recognized as equivalent to contributions in Trinidad and Tobago.

#### c) **Limitations on Totalization**
- Creditable periods under Canada are **only counted to the extent necessary** to establish entitlement to a benefit under Trinidad and Tobago legislation.
- **Exception**: Totalization does **not apply** for:
  - Disability pensions under the Canada Pension Plan.
  - Invalidity benefits under Trinidad and Tobago legislation.

> This protects the integrity of disability and invalidity systems.

### 7. **Minimum Period Requirement and Benefit Payments**

#### a) **No Benefit for Less Than One Year of Creditable Periods**
- If a person has **less than one year** of creditable periods under a Party’s legislation, and no right to a benefit exists under that legislation, **no benefit is payable under this Agreement** based solely on those periods.

> This prevents minimal or non-contributory claims.

#### b) **Partial Pensions and Allowances**
- If a person is entitled to an **Old Age Security (OAS)
