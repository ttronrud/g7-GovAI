Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Industrial and Regional Development Regulations*, S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 160, as amended and in force at the time of its publication (with note on revocations).

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Industrial and Regional Development Regulations**

### 🔹 **Overview**
These regulations, made under the **Industrial and Regional Development Act (Act)** and the **Financial Administration Act**, establish the framework for how the federal government can provide financial assistance—such as grants, contributions, and repayable loans—to eligible commercial operations and individuals in order to promote industrial growth, technological advancement, and regional economic development across Canada.

The regulations define key terms, outline eligibility criteria, specify types of projects eligible for support, set contribution limits based on regional tiers, and include detailed conditions for repayment and evaluation.

## 🔍 I. Key Definitions and Interpretations

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Industrial and Regional Development Act* (Loi). |
| **Applicant** | An individual, partnership, business, or commercial operation that submits a formal application under the Act. |
| **Application** | A written request submitted to the Minister for financial assistance under the Act. |
| **Capital Costs** | Direct costs associated with design, acquisition, construction, expansion, modification, conversion, transportation, installation, and insurance of assets. Includes related infrastructure development. **Excludes**: land, depreciation charges, motor vehicles not used on-site, goodwill, and asset costs exceeding fair market value. |
| **Commencement of Commercial Production** | Occurs when a facility has been used for at least 30 continuous working days for commercial production or marketable services, and more than 50% of the capital costs funded by the Minister are used in that facility and will remain so in the foreseeable future. |
| **Control Period** | A 24-month period (or longer, as specified by the Minister) beginning from the commencement of commercial production. During this time, performance and financial compliance are monitored. |
| **Equity** | The net worth of an applicant, calculated from share capital, surplus, deficit accounts, and subordinate loans (subject to Ministerial discretion to prevent overstatement). |
| **Facility** | Any physical structure, machine, equipment, or component required to operate a commercial activity. |
| **Infrastructure Development** | Activities that support commercial operations—such as roads, sewers, water treatment plants. **Not eligible for direct funding** under the regulations. |
| **Manufacturing or Processing Operation** | Activities involving transformation of raw materials into marketable goods or products. Includes advanced software systems, mineral processing, papermaking, chemical modification, and biological processing. **Excludes**: harvesting, mining, energy production (unless integral), mixing concrete/asphalt for paving, mobile operations, repair work, fossil fuel production, or initial hydrocarbon processing. |
| **Party** | Includes individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, or trustees. Excludes foreign government-owned entities unless they are expected to contribute significantly to regional development. |
| **Repayable Contribution** | A contribution that must be repaid if the project achieves commercial success. |
| **Tax Credit** | An investment tax credit under the Income Tax Act (subsection 127(9)). |
| **Trade Show** | A Canadian event aimed at promoting Canadian-made machinery, technology, or products to domestic businesses. |
| **Unemployment Insurance Beneficiaries to Population Ratio** | A ratio measuring the proportion of unemployed individuals (excluding certain categories) among the working-age population (15–64 years), based on Statistics Canada data. |

## 🔎 II. Regional Tiering System – Development Index

To prioritize funding and allocate resources efficiently, the Minister establishes **Tier Groups** for districts based on a **Development Index**, calculated using three variables:

### Formula:
> **Q = E × Y × R**

Where:
- **Q** = Development Index (overall ranking)
- **E** = Employment Measurement
- **Y** = Income Measurement
- **R** = Revenue Measurement (fiscal capacity of province)

---

### A. Employment Measurement (E)
> E = (EP) × (1 – U)

- **EP** = Scaled average employment-to-population ratio (from Statistics Canada), averaged over the last three years.
- **U** = Scaled average unemployment rate (same period and source), scaled to reflect relative levels.

> *Scaling formula*:  
> $ X_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{X - \text{minimum}}{\text{range}} $

---

### B. Income Measurement (Y)
> Y = (I / D) / T

- **I** = Total income per capita (income tax returns divided by population).
- **D** = Total income minus taxes (for non-Quebec provinces) or income minus taxes (federal + provincial) for Quebec.
- **T** = Transfer payments (e.g., unemployment insurance, CPP, OAS) as a percentage of total income.

> All variables (I, D, T) are scaled using the same formula as above.

---

### C. Revenue Measurement (R)
> R = Average of provincial fiscal capacity indices for specified fiscal years.

Fiscal capacity index is calculated as:

> $ \text{Index} = 100 \times \left( \frac{\text{Revenue Base (Bp)} \times \text{Tax Rate (T)}}{\text{Population (Pp)}} \right) / \left( \frac{\text{Aggregate Base (B10)} \times \text{National Avg. Rate (T)}}{\text{Aggregate Population (P10)}} \right) $

- **Bp** = Provincial revenue base for a given source
- **T** = National average tax rate
- **Pp** = Provincial population
- **B10 & P10** = Aggregated values across all provinces

> **Stipulated Fiscal Years**:
> - First tiering: current year + immediately prior year
> - Subsequent tierings: current year + two prior years

> **Scaling applies** to all variables (E, Y, R) to normalize values across regions.
