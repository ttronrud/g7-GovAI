**Detailed Summary of the Cree-Naskapi Long-Term Borrowing Regulations, 1986**

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**
The *Cree-Naskapi Long-Term Borrowing Regulations, 1986* were introduced by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, under two specific provisions of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*:

- **Section 98** of the Act: Grants the Governor General the authority to make or revoke regulations related to the governance and financial affairs of the Cree and Naskapi bands.
- **Subsection 198(2)**: Authorizes the making of regulations concerning long-term borrowing by Indigenous bands under the Act.

These Regulations **revoke** the earlier *Cree-Naskapi Long-Term Borrowing Regulations* made by Order in Council **P.C. 1985-793** on March 14, 1985, and replace them with updated, more detailed rules governing long-term borrowing by the Cree bands and the Naskapi band in Quebec.

The Regulations came into force on **April 1, 1986**, and are officially cited as:  
**Cree-Naskapi Long-Term Borrowing Regulations, 1986**  
(Statutory Citation: S.C. 1984, c. 18; SOR/85-248, 1985 Canada Gazette Part II, p. 1580)

### **Key Provisions of the Regulations**

#### **1. Requirements for a Valid By-law Authorizing Long-Term Borrowing**
Under **subsection 97(1)** of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*, any by-law authorizing a long-term borrowing must include, in addition to standard information, the following specific details:

- **Name and address of the lender**  
  The borrowing must clearly identify the individual, corporation, or institution providing the funds.

- **Interest, commissions, premiums, and other similar costs**  
  All financial charges associated with the loan—such as interest rates, loan origination fees, administrative costs, or other charges—must be explicitly stated. This ensures transparency and accountability.

- **Source of revenue and repayment mechanism**  
  The by-law must specify:
  - The **source of revenue** (e.g., land lease income, resource royalties, tourism revenues) from which the borrowing will be repaid.
  - The **specific portion of that revenue** that will be allocated to repay the loan and cover associated costs.

- **Security (if any)**  
  If the band is providing any form of collateral (such as land, assets, or future revenue rights), this must be clearly outlined in the by-law. This includes details on what is pledged and under what conditions.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The regulation emphasizes that the borrowing must be strictly tied to a defined and verifiable revenue stream to ensure financial sustainability and prevent misuse.

#### **2. Obligation to Use Revenue for Repayment**
A band is **legally required** to apply **sufficient funds** from the revenue source specified in the by-law to:
- Repay the long-term borrowing
- Cover all related costs (e.g., interest, commissions, administrative expenses)

This obligation is not discretionary. The band must ensure that the designated revenue is used solely for these purposes.

---

#### **3. Prohibition on Misuse of Borrowing Funds**
No council member, officer, employee, or agent of the band may:
- **Knowingly apply or assist in applying** funds from the specified revenue source to anything other than the repayment of the long-term borrowing and related costs.

This includes:
- Using funds for personal benefit
- Allocating them to non-essential expenditures
- Paying for unrelated operations or projects

> 🚫 **Violation = Misuse of funds for purposes other than repayment.**  
> This provision establishes a strict accountability framework to protect Indigenous financial autonomy and prevent corruption or financial mismanagement.

---

#### **4. Penalties for Violations**
The Regulations specify penalties for contravention of **Section 4**, which deals with the improper use of borrowing funds or failure to comply with the requirements of the by-law.

- **Maximum fine**: $2,000  
- **Maximum term of imprisonment**: 6 months  

These penalties are enforceable under **Section 198** of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*, which provides the legal basis for administrative and criminal sanctions.

> 💡 The penalties are designed to deter misconduct and ensure compliance with the financial governance framework established by the Act.
