### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a **tax remission** (i.e., a reduction or exemption from tax liability) for the **Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (the "Commission")**, specifically under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which imposes excise taxes on certain goods and services.

The purpose is to **recognize and compensate** the Director of the Commission for the excise tax paid during a specific period, by **remitting (offsetting) the excess tax paid** over what would have been payable if the Director had been entitled to the same diplomatic exemptions as those granted under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Commission**  
   Refers to the *Commission for Environmental Cooperation*, established under Article 8(1) of the *North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation* (NAACE), which was:
   - Concluded on **September 14, 1993**
   - Came into force on **January 1, 1994**

   The Commission is a trilateral body involving:
   - The Government of Canada
   - The Government of the United States of America
   - The Government of the United Mexican States  
   Its mandate is to promote environmental cooperation among the three nations.

2. **Tax**  
   Refers to the excise tax imposed under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which typically applies to certain fuels, vehicles, or other goods. In this context, it specifically applies to the Director of the Commission.

### **Core Provision: Tax Remission**

The regulation grants a **remission of excise tax** to the Director of the Commission under the following conditions:

- The remission is equal to the **difference between**:
  - The actual amount of excise tax paid by the Director **during the period from September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997**, and  
  - The amount of excise tax that would have been payable **if the Director had been granted diplomatic exemptions** comparable to those available under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Agents**.

> In simpler terms:  
> If the Director had been treated as a diplomatic agent (like a foreign ambassador), they would have been exempt from excise taxes under international diplomatic rules. Since they were not granted such exemptions, they paid more tax than they otherwise would have. This regulation **remits (returns)** the difference in tax paid.

### **Legal Basis**

- The regulation is made under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to:
  - Make orders for the remission of taxes
  - Where it is in the public interest to do so
- The public interest justification is tied to the **international role and status** of the Commission, which operates as a multilateral environmental body with diplomatic and policy functions.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Recognition of Diplomatic Status**  
   Although the Commission is not a traditional diplomatic mission, it functions in a manner similar to a diplomatic body due to its international mandate and role in environmental policy. This remission acknowledges its **special status** and the **need to avoid undue financial burden** on a body that operates in a quasi-diplomatic capacity.

2. **Fairness and Consistency**  
   The regulation ensures that the Director of the Commission is not taxed at a rate inconsistent with international norms, especially since diplomatic agents are generally exempt from such taxes under the Vienna Convention. This promotes **fairness and consistency** in tax treatment for international organizations.

3. **Support for Environmental Cooperation**  
   By reducing the financial burden on the Commission, the government supports the operational effectiveness of the body, which plays a critical role in promoting environmental protection across North America.

4. **Limited Scope**  
   The remission applies **only to the Director** of the Commission and **only for the specific period** from **September 4, 1994, to September 22, 1997**. It does not extend to other officials or future periods unless further orders are issued.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted, legally sound measure that provides **tax relief to the Director of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation** by remitting the excise tax paid during a defined period. The relief is based on the principle that the Director should be treated similarly to diplomatic agents under international law, and it reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and the public interest in supporting international environmental cooperation.

It underscores the Canadian government’s recognition of the Commission’s unique role and its commitment to ensuring that international environmental institutions are not unduly burdened by domestic tax regimes.
