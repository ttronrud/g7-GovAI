### **Detailed Summary of the Letter Definition Regulations (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 54)**

---

#### **Overview**
The *Letter Definition Regulations* are a set of official rules established by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Honourable André Ouellet, pursuant to **Section 17 of the Canada Post Corporation Act**. These regulations define the term **"letter"** for the purposes of postal services in Canada, specifically to determine what qualifies as a letter under postal classification and postage requirements.

The regulations were proposed in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **February 12, 1983**, providing interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit comments or representations. After public consultation, the final version was approved and came into force on **September 1, 1983**.

These regulations are essential for determining which items are eligible for standard letter postage rates and which are excluded from such classification—thereby affecting how postal services classify, process, and price mail.

#### **Legal Basis and Citation**
- **Legal Authority**: Section 17 of the *Canada Post Corporation Act* empowers the Governor General in Council to approve regulations made by the Canada Post Corporation.

#### **Definition of "Letter"**
For the purposes of the *Canada Post Corporation Act* and any regulations made thereunder, the term **"letter"** means:

> **One or more messages or information in any form**, the total mass (weight) of which, **if any**, does **not exceed 500 grams**, whether or not enclosed in an envelope, that is:
> - **Intended for collection or for transmission or delivery** to any addressee as **one item**.

This definition establishes a clear threshold for what constitutes a letter in terms of **weight, form, intent, and delivery context**.

---

#### **Exclusions from the Definition of "Letter"**

The following items are **explicitly excluded** from being classified as a "letter," even if they meet the weight and form criteria:

1. **Items Carried Incidentally by Friends**  
   - An item delivered to an addressee by a **friend or personal acquaintance** of the addressee, not as part of formal postal service.  
   - *Rationale*: To prevent abuse of postal classification for informal personal deliveries.

2. **Urgent Items with High Delivery Cost**  
   - Items of **urgent nature** carried by an employee where the **average salary cost** to the employer for delivery is **at least three times** the regular rate of postage payable for a similar 50g item.  
   - *Rationale*: To exclude high-cost, time-sensitive deliveries that would otherwise be misclassified as letters and charged at standard rates.

3. **Items with Generic Addresses**  
   - Items addressed only to expressions such as:
     - “householder”
     - “boxholder”
     - “occupant”
     - “resident”
     - or similar generic terms  
   - *Rationale*: To prevent the misclassification of undeliverable or non-specific mail as letters.

4. **Items Related to Diplomatic or Consular Functions**  
   - Messages or items related to the **official functions** of diplomatic or consular missions, covered under **international privileges and immunities**.  
   - *Rationale*: To respect international law and protect diplomatic communications from standard postal handling.

5. **Cheques, Money Orders, and Receiver General Instruments**  
   - Includes cheques, money orders, and payment instruments issued by the Receiver General.  
   - *Rationale*: These are financial instruments and require special handling and processing, not standard letter delivery.

6. **Electronic or Optical Storage Media**  
   - Includes tapes, microfilm, discs, or similar devices that store messages or information via **electronic or optical means**.  
   - *Rationale*: These are not physical letters and are typically processed differently (e.g., in data centers or digital systems).

7. **Periodicals and Printed Materials**  
   - Excludes:
     - Newspapers
     - Magazines
     - Books
     - Catalogues

   - Invoices or other documents that:
     - Are delivered **with goods** by the individual delivering them;
     - Are related to a **specimen for medical or scientific analysis**;
     - Are attached to **goods** when delivered by the sender.  
   - *Rationale*: These are transactional or commercial documents tied to physical goods and are not standalone messages.

9. **Invoices or Documents Delivered to Recipients at Specific Locations**

     - The individual who performed the services.

10. **Invoices Prepared on-Site at Delivery Location**  
    - Invoices or documents prepared **at the location of the addressee** at the time of delivery.  
    - *Rationale*: These are not pre-prepared or sent via postal channels.

      - Promissory notes
      - Drafts
      - Settlement vouchers
      - Money orders
      - Receiver General warrants  
    - When in transit between:

      - The Canadian Payments Association or its branches;
      - Any of the above locations for **processing, exchange, clearing, or settlement**.  
    - *Rationale*: These are part of financial systems and require secure, non-postal handling.

12. **Payment Orders Arising from Transaction Cards**  
    - Orders or instructions given to financial institutions for payment arising from:
      - Use of payment, debit, credit, charge, or account access cards.

#### **Definition of Electronic or Optical Transmission**
For the purposes of these regulations:

> A **transmission by electronic or optical means** begins at the **point of origin** (when the message is received) and ends at the **point of destination** when the message is:
> - Displayed
> - Printed
> - Or both

This clarifies the start and end points of electronic communication, ensuring that such transmissions are not considered "letters" under the definition, even if they involve digital content.

---

#### **Effective Date**
- The regulations came into force on **September 1, 1983**.

#### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarity in Classification** | Defines exactly what qualifies as a "letter" to ensure consistent application of postal rules and postage rates. |

#### **Practical Impact on Mailers and Recipients**

- **Personal correspondence** (e.g., letters between friends or family) is eligible for standard letter postage if under 500g and sent as a single item.
- **Commercial or financial documents** (invoices, cheques, payment orders) are **not** considered letters and are subject to different rules and pricing.
- **Electronic files or digital media** (e.g., CDs, tapes) are excluded and treated as separate categories.
- **Business-to-business mail** is often excluded due to delivery location or nature, meaning such mail may be subject to different postal rates or handling.

#### **Conclusion**

The *Letter Definition Regulations* provide a comprehensive and legally grounded framework for defining what constitutes a "letter" in Canada’s postal system. By setting clear weight, form, intent, and exclusion criteria, the regulations ensure fair, consistent, and legally defensible application of postal services and postage rates. They also reflect the evolving nature of communication—distinguishing between personal, commercial, and electronic forms of message transmission.

These rules remain foundational in shaping how Canada Post classifies mail, particularly in determining eligibility for standard letter rates and in managing the volume and cost of postal services.
