### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
- **Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.
- **Legal Authority:** Pursuant to **Section 610a of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**.
- **Regulatory Text Reference:**  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 447  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 47  
- **Definition:** In these regulations, "Act" refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**
- **Applies to:** Foreign life insurance companies and foreign property and casualty (P&C) or marine insurance companies operating in Canada.
- **Exclusions:**
  - These regulations **do not apply to associations** (e.g., mutual or non-profit associations).
  - Applies only to companies engaged in insurance business **in Canada**.

---

### **3. Core Requirement: Minimum Canadian Assets**
Every foreign insurance company must maintain **minimum assets in Canada** to ensure financial stability and protect policyholders. This requirement is **in addition to** the general "margin of assets over liabilities in Canada" mandated under **Section 608 of the Insurance Companies Act**.

> This ensures that foreign insurers have sufficient capital *within Canada* to meet their obligations, even if their operations are based abroad.

---

## **4. Asset Requirement by Insurance Class**

### **A. For Life Insurance, Accident and Sickness Insurance, Credit Protection Insurance, and Other Approved Products**
Foreign life companies must maintain Canadian assets equal to the **aggregate of the following**:

1. **Reserve for Actuarial and Other Policy Liabilities**  
   - Determined using the **same accounting principles** as those applied in the company’s annual return (specifically, **subsection 331(4) of the ICA**).  
   - This includes future claims and obligations arising from policies in force.

2. **Minus Advances Made Against Policy Values**  
   - Deduct the amount of **all advances** made by the company:
     - On the **security** of life policies, or  
     - Against the **cash surrender value** of life policies  
     - These are included in the annual return and are considered temporary liabilities.

3. **Provision for Unpaid Claims**  
   - Must include the **amount of provision for claims incurred but not yet paid** (i.e., outstanding claims).

4. **Other Liabilities**  
   - Includes all **other liabilities** related to the specified classes of insurance.

> ✅ **Formula (for life insurance classes):**  
> Total Canadian Assets ≥  
> (Reserve for policy liabilities – Advances) + (Provision for unpaid claims) + (Other liabilities)

---

### **B. For Insurance Classes Other Than Life, Accident, Sickness, Credit Protection, or Approved Products**
Foreign property and casualty or marine companies must maintain Canadian assets equal to:

1. **Reserve for Actuarial and Other Policy Liabilities**  
   - Determined using the same accounting principles as in the annual return.

2. **Other Liabilities**  
   - All other liabilities related to that class of insurance.

> ✅ **Formula (for non-life classes):**  
> Total Canadian Assets ≥  
> (Reserve for policy liabilities) + (Other liabilities)

> ❗Note: Unlike life insurance, **no deduction for advances or unpaid claims** is required in this category.

---

### **C. For Foreign Property and Casualty and Marine Companies**
These companies must maintain Canadian assets equal to:

1. **Reserve for Actuarial and Other Policy Liabilities**  
   - Determined using the same accounting principles as in the annual return.

2. **Other Liabilities**  
   - All other liabilities in respect of that class.

> ✅ Formula:  
> Total Canadian Assets ≥ (Reserve) + (Other liabilities)

> This requirement is **identical** to the one for non-life classes above.

---

## **5. Reduction of Required Assets (Allowable Exceptions)**

The total required assets may be **reduced** under certain conditions, as determined by the **Superintendent of Insurance**.

### **(a) Receivables from Agents, Brokers, and Policyholders**
- The required asset amount may be reduced by **any amounts receivable** from:
  - Insurance agents  
  - Insurance brokers  
  - Policyholders  
  - For policies currently in force  
- The Superintendent may determine which receivables qualify.

> This allows for a practical reduction if the company has outstanding receivables that are expected to be collected in Canada.

---

### **(b) Reinsurance Coverage (Reduction of Risk Exposure)**
If a foreign company is reinsured against **all or part** of the risks or claims, the required asset amount may be reduced by **subtracting** the amount of risks reinsured — **up to the value of the reinsured portion** — **if** the reinsurer meets one of the following criteria:

#### Eligible Reinsurers Include:
1. A **company, society, or provincial company**  
2. A **foreign company** that:
   - Has reinsured in Canada under an arrangement where the **reinsurer has no right of set-off** against the foreign insurer’s obligations **except those related to insurance business in Canada**  
3. A **body corporate incorporated under provincial laws** and **approved by the Superintendent**  
4. The **Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC)**  
5. The **Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation (MPIC)**  
6. **Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI)**  
7. **Export Development Canada (EDC)**  
8. An entity that:
   - Maintains **assets in Canada** of a nature and under an arrangement that the **Superintendent has determined to be satisfactory**

> ⚠️ Important:  
> - The reduction is **limited to the amount of risks or claims that are reinsured**.  
> - The reinsurer must be **legally and financially credible**, and the arrangement must be **transparent and risk-protective**.

> ❌ **Not eligible:** Reinsurers with rights of set-off against the foreign insurer’s obligations outside of insurance business in Canada.

## **6. Repeal and Legal Status**

- **Section 31 (life insurance reduction)** and **Section 32 (non-life insurance reduction)** were **repealed** by **SOR/2009-296, s. 31 and s. 32**.  
- **Section 33 (P&C/marine reduction)** was also **repealed** by **SOR/2009-296, s. 33**.  
- **Section 35 (reinsurance reduction)** was **repealed** by **SOR/2009-296, s. 35**.

> 🔍 **Interpretation:**  
> The original provisions allowing reductions due to reinsurance or receivables have been **removed or superseded** by subsequent amendments.  
> This suggests that the **current version of the regulations is outdated or no longer in force**.

> ✅ **Final Status:**  
> These regulations were **repealed** and are **no longer valid law** as of the date of repeal.

---

## **7. Effective Date**
- **Come into force:** **January 1, 2003**

> However, due to the **repeal in 2009**, the regulations are **not currently in effect**.

## **Critical Observations and Implications**

1. **Outdated and Repealed:**  
   - Despite being issued in 2001 and effective in 2003, the regulations were **fully repealed in 2009** (SOR/2009-296).  
   - This means the **current regulatory framework for foreign insurers' asset requirements is different**.

2. **Repeal of Key Provisions:**  
   - The provisions allowing reductions due to reinsurance or receivables were **removed**, suggesting a more conservative or stricter approach to capital requirements in current law.

3. **Focus on Financial Stability:**  
   - The original intent was to ensure foreign insurers maintain **sufficient Canadian assets** to meet policyholder obligations, reducing systemic risk.

4. **Accounting Basis:**  
   - All reserve and liability calculations are based on **accounting principles under subsection 331(4) of the ICA**, ensuring consistency with financial reporting.

5. **Exclusion of Associations
