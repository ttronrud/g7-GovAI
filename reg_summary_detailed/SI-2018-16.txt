**Purpose and Significance:**  
- This designation ensures continuity and accountability in the administration of investment policy.  
- By assigning the Minister for International Trade to lead the Invest in Canada Act, the government aligns investment promotion with Canada’s international trade objectives, such as attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), supporting export growth, and strengthening global partnerships.  
- It provides a clear administrative structure for implementing investment incentives and monitoring their impact.  

**Additional Notes:**  
- The regulation is part of a broader legislative framework introduced under the **Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1**, which was designed to support economic growth and investment in Canada.
