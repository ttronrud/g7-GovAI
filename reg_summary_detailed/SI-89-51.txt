**Detailed Summary of the Bridgestone Remission Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
The *Bridgestone Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**. It was enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendations of three key federal ministers:
- The **Minister of Finance**
- The **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**
- The **Treasury Board**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., cancel or refund) certain customs duties and a portion of the federal sales tax** on tires imported by **Bridgestone/Firestone Canada Inc.** during a specified period. This action is justified as being in the **public interest**, particularly in support of the development and sustainability of the Canadian tire manufacturing industry.

### **2. Official Designation**
The Order is officially titled the **Bridgestone Remission Order** and may be cited by that name.

---

### **3. Definition of "Tires"**
The term *"tires"* in this Order is defined **with specific exclusions**:
- **Excluded types**:
  - Solid press-on tires  
  - Solid pneumatic-shaped tires  
  - Pneumatic tires for forklift trucks  
  - Off-the-road bias ply tires in sizes greater than **11.00 × 24**

- **Included types**:
  - All other tires (i.e., standard passenger vehicle tires, truck tires, etc., not falling into the above categories)

This ensures that the remission applies only to tires relevant to mainstream automotive and commercial vehicle use in Canada.

### **4. Scope of Duty Remission**
#### **Customs Duty Remission**
- A **full remission** of customs duties is granted for tires imported by or through **Bridgestone/Firestone Canada Inc.** (or any company associated with it) during the period:
  - **From May 1, 1988, to December 31, 1997**

This means that any customs duties originally paid or that would have been payable on those tires are **forgiven or refunded**.

#### **Sales Tax Remission**
In addition to customs duty remission, a **partial remission of federal sales tax** is granted on the same goods (tires), but only in a specific amount:
> The amount of sales tax remitted =  
> **(Sales tax actually paid)**  
> −  
> **(Sales tax that would have been paid if the duty-paid value had been reduced by the amount of the customs duty remission)**

In simpler terms:
- The sales tax is reduced by the **difference** between what was originally paid and what would have been paid if the customs duty had been refunded.
- This adjustment ensures that the **overall tax burden on the imported tires is reduced** in proportion to the customs duty relief.

This mechanism prevents a double tax burden and aligns the tax calculation with the actual reduction in the duty-paid value of the goods.

### **5. Conditions for Remission**
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to several key conditions:

#### **(a) Continued Manufacturing in Canada**
- Bridgestone/Firestone Canada Inc. must **continue to manufacture tires in Canada** after the remission period.
- This condition ensures that the policy supports **domestic manufacturing capacity** and is not used to benefit foreign operations or non-Canadian production.

#### **(b) Caps on Total Duty Remission**
To prevent excessive financial benefit, the total amount of customs duty remission is capped:
- **For the five-month period beginning May 1, 1988**:  
  Maximum remission = **$1.1 million**

- **For each of the four twelve-month periods beginning October 1, 1988**:  
  Maximum remission = **$7.7 million per period**

> Note: The period starting October 1, 1988, is a key threshold. The caps apply to each of the four full 12-month periods from that date onward (i.e., October 1, 1988; October 1, 1989; October 1, 1990; October 1, 1991).  
> This structure suggests a phased, limited relief to ensure fiscal responsibility.

#### **(c) Timely Claim Submission**
- A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date of importation of the tires in question.
- This establishes a **strict deadline** to ensure accountability and timely administration of the remission.

### **6. Key Policy Objectives**
The Order reflects broader economic and industrial policy goals, including:
- **Supporting Canadian manufacturing** by reducing the cost of imported tires used in domestic production.
- **Encouraging investment** in tire manufacturing by lowering initial capital and operational costs.
- **Balancing fiscal responsibility** through clear caps and conditions to avoid overuse of government financial resources.
- **Promoting fair competition** by ensuring that a key domestic manufacturer receives targeted relief without undermining broader tax and trade principles.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**
- The Order is a **targeted intervention** in trade and tax policy, aimed at a single company (Bridgestone/Firestone Canada Inc.) during a defined historical window.
- It represents a **temporary, conditional relief** mechanism rather than a permanent policy change.
- The inclusion of a **sales tax adjustment** shows an effort to ensure that the relief is both **fiscal and equitable**, avoiding unintended tax distortions.
- The requirement that the company **maintain Canadian manufacturing** ensures that the benefit is tied directly to **local industrial development**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Bridgestone Remission Order* is a carefully structured, limited, and conditionally based fiscal policy designed to:
- Support Canadian tire manufacturing during a critical period (1988–1997),
- Reduce the financial burden on a key domestic producer,
- Maintain fiscal accountability through clear caps and time limits,
- And ensure that public funds are used only in service of national industrial interests.

It serves as a case study in how governments may use targeted remission orders under the Financial Administration Act to promote economic development while maintaining fiscal discipline and regulatory oversight.
