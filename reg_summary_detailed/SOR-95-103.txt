The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> **[Repealed, SOR/2009-316, s. 105]**

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or withdrawn) by **Regulation SOR/2009-316, section 105**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**Status of the Regulation:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It was officially repealed on or around the date of the publication of **SOR/2009-316**, which is the *Supplemental Regulation 2009-316* issued by the Government of Canada. Section 105 of that regulation specifically designated the repeal of the previously listed rule or provision.

**What Does "Repealed" Mean?**  
Repeal means that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework. Any legal effect, obligations, or requirements previously imposed by the regulation are **no longer applicable**. Entities, individuals, or institutions that previously relied on it must now refer to current, active regulations.

**Reason for Repeal (Implied):**  
While the original text of the repealed regulation is not included in the provided input, the repeal under SOR/2009-316 likely occurred due to one or more of the following common reasons:
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
- It was superseded by a more modern, comprehensive, or effective rule.
- It created administrative or legal complexity.
- It was inconsistent with current policy or legislation.
- It was found to be overly restrictive or impractical.

**Relevant Legal Authority:**  
- **SOR/2009-316** is a statutory instrument (a regulation made under the authority of a parent act, such as the *Canada Shipping Act* or another relevant statute).  
- Section 105 of that regulation specifically contains the repeal clause.  
- The repeal is formally recorded in the *Supplemental Orders and Regulations* (SOR) database, which is the official repository of Canadian federal regulations.

**Impact:**  
- No current legal obligations exist under this regulation.  
- Any reference to it in legal documents, contracts, or administrative processes must be updated to reflect current regulations.  
- Legal or compliance officers should verify that the applicable rule is now a current, active provision.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the repeated entries is **fully repealed** and **no longer valid**. Its removal was formalized under **SOR/2009-316, section 105**, and therefore, it does not apply to any current legal, administrative, or operational context. To ensure compliance, stakeholders should consult the current version of the relevant legislation or regulation.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Without the original text of the regulation being repealed, a detailed summary of its content (e.g., scope, requirements, penalties) cannot be provided. The summary above is based solely on the status and legal mechanism of repeal. For substantive content, the original regulation would need to be retrieved from the official government records (e.g., through the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations.gov* database).

If you can provide the original regulation or its title (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of fishing vessels"), I can offer a more detailed analysis of its former content and purpose.
