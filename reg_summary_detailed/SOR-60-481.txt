**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Apple Growers’ Marketing Order**

---

### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The regulation is issued under the **Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (the "Act"), which empowers the **Governor in Council** (the federal government) to grant authority to provincial boards or agencies to regulate the **interprovincial and export marketing** of agricultural products — even outside their home province — provided those boards are already authorized to regulate such products locally under provincial law.

This specific Order grants the **Quebec Apple Growers’ Marketing Board** (the "Growers’ Board") the power to regulate the marketing of apples **outside Quebec**, including in interprovincial trade and export markets.

#### **A. Grant of Authority**
- The **Quebec Apple Growers’ Marketing Board** is authorized to:
  - Regulate the **marketing of apples grown in Quebec** outside the province.

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a **key piece of federal-provincial cooperation** in agricultural marketing. It extends the authority of a provincial marketing board to manage the **interprovincial and export trade** of apples from Quebec, enabling producers to achieve better market outcomes while preserving the integrity of local marketing rules. However, it does so with **defined boundaries**, notably excluding two specific obligations from the original plan, ensuring that the extension of powers remains focused, practical, and legally sound.

This regulation exemplifies how federal legislation supports provincial economic development in agriculture through structured, rule-based marketing frameworks.
