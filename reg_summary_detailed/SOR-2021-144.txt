### **Detailed Summary of the CCFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Enactment**
The regulation is enacted by **His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council**, based on the following recommendations:
- **Minister of Finance** and **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (for provisions other than Section 1)
- **Minister of Finance alone** (for Section 1)

This enactment is authorized under:
- **Subsection 164(1.1)a of the Customs Act**  
  This provision allows the government to adopt rules of origin for trade agreements, enabling the determination of whether goods qualify for preferential treatment under a free trade agreement (FTA), such as the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA).

Additional statutory authority is drawn from:
- **S.C. 2017, c. 6, s. 85** – Provides the legislative basis for implementing rules of origin under the CCFTA.
- **R.S., c. 1 (2nd Supp.)** – Refers to the *Regulations of the Customs Tariff*, specifically:
  - **Subsection 16(2)c** – Authorizes rules of origin for certain trade agreements.
  - **Subsection 16(4)d** – Allows for the application of rules of origin in determining eligibility for tariff preferences.
- **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** – Grants powers to the government to implement rules of origin for trade agreements.
- **S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 186** – Confirms the continued validity and application of rules of origin in trade agreements.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – Likely refers to the original enabling legislation for the CCFTA or related trade frameworks.

#### **2. Application of CCFTA Provisions in Canada**
The following provisions of the **Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)** are given **the force of law in Canada**:
- **Articles D-01 to D-03** – General principles of the agreement, including definitions, scope, and the concept of "originating goods."
- **Paragraph 1 of Article D-04** – Specifies the conditions under which goods may be considered to have originated in Canada or Chile.
- **Articles D-05 to D-13** – Detailed rules of origin, including specific thresholds (e.g., value-added thresholds, processing requirements, and regional value content) for determining whether a product qualifies as originating.
- **Articles D-16 and D-17** – Address special rules for certain products (e.g., agricultural goods, manufactured goods, and products from specific sectors).
- **Annexes D-01, D-03.1, and D-03.2** – Provide technical details and product-specific rules of origin, including:
  - Annex D-01: Lists of products covered by the agreement.
  - Annex D-03.1: Rules for certain manufactured goods (e.g., textiles, machinery).
  - Annex D-03.2: Rules for specific agricultural and food products.

> ✅ These provisions are now **binding and enforceable** in Canadian law, meaning customs officers and trade officials can apply them to determine whether goods are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the CCFTA.

---

#### **3. Repeal of Previous Regulations**
- The **prior CCFTA Rules of Origin Regulations (SOR/97-340)** are **fully repealed**.
- This indicates a **major update or revision** of the rules, reflecting changes in the agreement, trade policy, or economic realities since 1997.

> This repeal ensures that Canada’s rules of origin are aligned with the **current, updated terms of the CCFTA**, improving accuracy and consistency in the application of preferential tariff treatment.

---

#### **4. Effective Date**
- These new **CCFTA Rules of Origin Regulations come into force on the 120th day after the day of registration** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- This is a standard delay period used in Canadian regulatory development to allow for:
  - Public notice and comment
  - Industry consultation
  - Customs and trade sector preparation

> This gives stakeholders (importers, exporters, customs officials, trade associations) time to adapt to the new rules before they are applied in practice.

### **Purpose and Significance**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:
1. **To implement the rules of origin** established in the CCFTA so that Canadian and Chilean goods can benefit from **preferential tariff treatment** (e.g., reduced or eliminated tariffs).
2. **To ensure transparency and consistency** in determining whether goods are "originating" under the agreement.
3. **To promote trade** between Canada and Chile by reducing trade barriers for eligible products.
4. **To align Canadian law with international trade obligations**, ensuring compliance with the CCFTA and WTO principles.

### **Key Implications for Stakeholders**

- Repealing outdated rules (SOR/97-340),
