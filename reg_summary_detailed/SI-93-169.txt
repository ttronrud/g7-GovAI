- **Inmate Appeals with Legal Aid**: If legal aid is granted after an inmate appeal has begun, the appellant must file a **new Form B notice within 15 days**. The inmate appeal is then **deemed withdrawn**, and standard rules apply.

> **Transcript Completion Notice**: The transcript must include a note of the **date it was ordered** and the **date it was completed**.

> **No Suspension Without Order**: Completion of the transcript cannot be suspended or canceled without a **judge’s or Registrar’s order**, unless the appeal is abandoned and the reporter is notified.

- The agreement must be:
  - In writing
  - Signed by both parties
