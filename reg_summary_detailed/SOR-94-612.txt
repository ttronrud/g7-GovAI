| **Division Annuity Deduction** | The CPP deduction portion of the division annuity, calculated similarly but using **post-1965 pensionable service**. |
| **Division Factor** | A multiplier (determined under subsection 19(1)) applied to calculate reductions in pension benefits due to division. |

## **3. Pensionable Service Accrual During the Period Subject to Division**

Pensionable service is calculated in a nuanced way to reflect actual contributions and service periods. It includes:

1. **Current Service**  
   - All service during the period subject to division, **excluding** leave without pay.

2. **Elective Service**  
   - Service where the member elected to contribute (e.g., voluntary service).  
   - Credit is proportional to the contributions paid during the period subject to division relative to total required contributions.

3. **Leave Without Pay**  
   - Service during leave without pay is credited in proportion to contributions made during the period subject to division versus total required contributions.

4. **Transfers from Other Pension Plans**  
   - Service credited due to transfers (e.g., reciprocal or pension transfer agreements).  
   - Credit is proportional to the period credited under the original plan during the period subject to division.

5. **Election under Clause 6(1)(b)(iii)(M) of the Public Service Superannuation Act**  
   - Service credited due to a transfer election.  
   - Proportional to the period of pensionable service included in the transfer value during the period subject to division, compared to the total period represented by that transfer value.

> ✅ This ensures that service is fairly attributed based on actual contribution patterns and plan rules.
