**Summary of the Regulation Status:**

The regulation in question has been **fully repealed** and is no longer in force. The repeals are listed as follows:

1. **Repealed by SOR/2001-419, section 2**  
   – This indicates that the regulation was formally removed from the legal framework on the date of publication of SOR/2001-419 (the Statutory Instrument of 2001, No. 419), under section 2 of that instrument. Section 2 typically contains provisions for repealing prior rules or sections of regulations.

2. **Repealed by SOR/2006-321, section 4**  
   – The regulation was again formally repealed through SOR/2006-321 (Statutory Instrument of 2006, No. 321), specifically under section 4. This repealer notice appears **three times** in the list, which may suggest redundancy or a typographical or editorial error. However, in legal terminology, a single repeal by a statutory instrument is sufficient to terminate a regulation, and multiple identical references do not imply multiple separate repeals.

**Interpretation:**

- The regulation was originally enacted and applied in the legal system of Canada (likely under a provincial or federal statute).
- It was first repealed in **2001** (SOR/2001-419, s. 2), and then again in **2006** (SOR/2006-321, s. 4), which may reflect either:
  - A legislative update or correction to earlier repeal language, or
  - A procedural or administrative error (the repetition of the same repealer).
- The **final repeal** is considered effective as of the date of SOR/2006-321, which is the most recent and authoritative repealer.

**Conclusion:**

The regulation referenced is **no longer valid or enforceable**. It has been officially and completely removed from the legal system through the repeal process under SOR/2006-321, section 4. Any references to this regulation in current legal or administrative contexts are obsolete and should be disregarded.

**Note:**  
Without the original text of the regulation, the specific subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, licensing, safety rules, etc.) cannot be identified. To determine the original purpose or scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original regulation or the explanatory notes in SOR/2001-419 or SOR/2006-321.

---

In short:  
✅ The regulation is **repealed**.  
✅ It was repealed in **2001** and **again in 2006** (with the 2006 repeal being final).  
✅ It is **no longer in effect**.  
✅ The repeated mention of SOR/2006-321, s. 4 is likely a duplication and does not alter the outcome.
