### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**
- **Issuing Body**: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada.
- **Legal Authority**: The regulation is issued under **Order in Council P.C. 2000-1723**, dated November 30, 2000.
- **Statutory Basis**: The power to make this regulation stems from **paragraph 19(1)(b)(b)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6).

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of this regulation is to establish a **mandatory fee** that must be paid by **foreign nationals** who participate in **international youth exchange programs** in Canada. This fee serves as a financial requirement to support the administrative costs associated with processing and managing applications for such programs.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulation includes two key definitions that clarify the scope and application of the fee:

- **International Youth Exchange Program**:  
  A reciprocal exchange program established through a formal agreement (arrangement) between Canada and a foreign country. These programs allow nationals of the foreign country to engage in **short-term work or study activities** in Canada.  
  *French equivalent*: "programme d’échanges internationaux visant la jeunesse"

- **National (in relation to a foreign state)**:  
  An individual who holds the nationality of that foreign state, as determined under the laws of that state.  
  *Note*: This definition ensures that only individuals legally recognized as nationals of the foreign country are subject to the fee.

---

### **4. Fee Amount and Applicability**
- **Fee Amount**:  
  Any foreign national who applies to enter Canada under an international youth exchange program must pay a **fee of $150** if their application is approved.

- **When the Fee Must Be Paid**:  
  The $150 fee is payable **upon approval of the application**. This means the fee is not required upfront or at the time of submission, but rather after the applicant has been granted entry to Canada under the program.

---

### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulation **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., the date of publication in the Canada Gazette or official register).  
  In this case, the regulation was issued on **November 30, 2000**, and thus became effective on that date.

---

### **6. Scope and Limitations**
- Applies **only** to foreign nationals participating in international youth exchange programs.
- Does **not apply** to other types of visitors, students, workers, or immigrants under different visa or immigration categories.
- Applies **only to programs** that are:
  - Reciprocal (i.e., mutual between Canada and a foreign state),
  - Established via formal bilateral agreements,
  - Involving short-term work or study in Canada.

---

### **7. Administrative and Financial Implications**
- The $150 fee is intended to cover administrative and processing costs associated with evaluating and approving applications for these youth exchange programs.
- The fee is **non-refundable** and is collected by the relevant immigration or foreign affairs authorities upon approval.
- It is **not a visa or entry fee**, nor is it part of the standard application process for study or work permits. It is a **separate, prescribed charge** tied specifically to participation in youth exchange programs.

---

### **8. Jurisdiction and Enforcement**
- The regulation is enforceable by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** through the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFIT).
- The fee is collected through the official application process, and failure to pay may result in the denial of entry or the rejection of the application.

---

### **9. Relevance and Context**
This regulation was introduced in the early 2000s as part of Canada’s efforts to:
- Strengthen international youth exchange initiatives,
- Ensure that such programs are financially sustainable,
- Provide a clear and consistent fee structure for foreign participants.

It reflects Canada’s policy of promoting international cultural and educational exchange while maintaining administrative accountability and transparency.
