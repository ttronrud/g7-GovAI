**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Flax Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Saskatchewan Flax Order*, made under the authority of **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, is a regulatory instrument issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**. This Order establishes specific rules and powers for the regulation of flax marketing in Saskatchewan, particularly in interprovincial and export trade.

It is a delegated regulation designed to support the sustainable development, marketing, and economic viability of flax (a fiber and seed crop) within the province, by enabling the Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission (the "Commission") to exercise powers similar to those granted under the broader *Agri-Food Act* and the *Saskatchewan Flax Development Plan*.

---

### **Key Definitions**
The Order defines key terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act*, Statutes of Saskatchewan, S.S. 1990–91, c. A-15.2 ("Loi"). This is the enabling legislation that provides the legal framework for the Commission’s operations.
  
- **Commission**: The *Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission*, established under the *Agri-Food Act*. This body is responsible for overseeing flax development, including marketing, research, and economic planning.

- **Flax**: Defined broadly to include all parts of the plant *Linum usitatissimum*, such as:
  - Seeds
  - Straw
  - Fiber
  - Shives (the processed residue after fiber extraction)
  - Any other part of the plant

- **Plan**: Refers to the *Saskatchewan Flax Development Plan*, established under *Regulation R.R.S. c. A-15.2 Reg 5*, as amended from time to time. This strategic plan outlines objectives, goals, and development strategies for the flax industry in Saskatchewan.

### **Powers Granted to the Commission**

#### **1. Regulatory Authority in Interprovincial and Export Trade**
The Commission is authorized to regulate the **marketing of flax** in:
- Interprovincial trade (sales between provinces)
- Export trade (sales outside of Canada)

For these purposes, the Commission may exercise **all or any powers** that it would otherwise have under:
- The *Agri-Food Act*
- The *Saskatchewan Flax Development Plan*

This includes powers related to setting standards, managing quality, regulating pricing, and overseeing market access — all aimed at ensuring fair, efficient, and sustainable flax marketing practices.

> **Note**: These powers are specifically limited to persons and property **situated in Saskatchewan**, meaning the Commission's regulatory reach is confined to activities occurring within the province.

---

#### **2. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**
The Commission has the power to:
- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in:
  - The **production** of flax
  - The **marketing** of flax (including processing, storage, and sale)

These levies are not general taxes but are targeted to support the flax industry and are applied based on the nature and scale of participation.

> **Classification of Participants**:  
The Commission may **classify persons** into different groups (e.g., producers, processors, exporters, cooperatives) and **set different levies or charges** for each group. This allows for equitable and differentiated financial contributions based on the level of involvement and impact on the industry.

---

#### **3. Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for:
- Supporting the **objectives of the Commission**
- Funding **flax development initiatives** (e.g., research, infrastructure, marketing programs)
- Establishing **reserves** (financial reserves to ensure long-term stability and future planning)

> These reserves are critical for managing financial risks, funding future projects, or responding to market fluctuations.

---

### **Effective Date**
This Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the *Statutes of Saskatchewan*. This means it becomes legally binding once officially published and registered, typically after being laid before the Legislative Assembly and approved.

---

### **Purpose and Context**
This Order is part of a broader policy framework designed to:
- Strengthen the economic base of Saskatchewan’s flax industry
- Ensure fair and stable marketing conditions for producers and processors
- Promote the sustainable development of flax as a valuable agricultural commodity
- Facilitate access to both domestic and international markets

By enabling the Commission to regulate interprovincial and export markets, and by allowing targeted levies, the Order helps ensure that the benefits of flax production are shared equitably among stakeholders while funding ongoing development and innovation.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Saskatchewan Flax Order* is a targeted, industry-specific regulatory measure that empowers the Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission to manage flax marketing effectively beyond provincial boundaries. It provides a clear mechanism for:
- Classifying participants
- Imposing fair and differentiated levies
- Using collected funds for strategic development and reserve building

This Order supports the long-term viability of Saskatchewan’s flax sector by promoting market stability, encouraging investment, and ensuring that the industry remains competitive and resilient in both domestic and international markets.
