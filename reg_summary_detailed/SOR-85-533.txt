     - Is raised **for purposes other than egg production**.
   - Includes **broiler**, **fryer**, and **roasting chickens**.

3. **Producer**  
   - Any individual or entity that:
     - Raises, keeps, prepares for slaughter, or slaughters chickens in Manitoba.
     - Includes the **employer** of such a person.
     - Includes individuals who have a **lease or agreement** entitling them to a share of the chickens raised.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Levy Rate**
- Every producer must pay a **marketing levy** of **$0.0076 per kilogram of live weight** on all chickens marketed.
- The levy applies **only to chickens marketed in interprovincial or export trade**.
- It does **not apply** to chickens marketed within Manitoba for local consumption (e.g., in retail or local food service settings), nor to chickens under 10 days old.

#### **2. Payment Deadline**
- Producers must pay the levies to the Commodity Board **no later than seven days after the last day of the week** in which the chickens were marketed.
- For example, if chickens are marketed on or before Friday, May 31, the levy must be paid by **Monday, June 3**.

#### **3. Deduction and Remittance by Purchasers**
- The levy can be **deducted from the purchase price** paid by the buyer (purchaser) of the chickens.
- If a purchaser deducts the levy, they are required to **remit the full amount** to the Commodity Board **within seven days after the last day of the week** in which the chickens were purchased.
- This mechanism ensures that the levy is collected even if the producer does not directly pay it, and helps streamline collection through the supply chain.

### **Purpose and Function of the Levy**
- The levy is intended to:
  - Support **marketing and promotion** of Manitoba-produced chicken.
  - Provide funding for **branding, advertising, and market development**.
  - Ensure **fair access** to interprovincial and international markets.

By imposing a small levy per kilogram of live weight on interprovincial and export sales, it enables the Commodity Board to support the promotion and economic development of Manitoba’s chicken industry while clearly defining who is liable and how payments are made.

This Order remains a foundational piece of agricultural marketing policy in Manitoba and reflects a balanced approach between producer responsibility and collective market development.
