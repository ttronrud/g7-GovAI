**Detailed Summary of the *Locally Engaged Staff Employment Regulations, 2024***  
*Made under Section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*  
*Registered in the Canada Gazette (SOR/2024-XX)*

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
These regulations establish a legal framework for the appointment, employment, and management of **locally engaged staff** — individuals who are employed outside Canada by the Government of Canada in diplomatic, consular, or military support roles. The regulations are introduced to provide clarity and consistency in how such staff are managed, while respecting the legal and operational realities of working in foreign jurisdictions.

The regulations are made under **Section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**, on the recommendation of the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada and the Public Service Commission. They replace the previous *Locally-Engaged Staff Employment Regulations* (SOR/95-152; SOR/98-13, s.1), which are formally repealed.

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Locally Engaged Staff (LES):**  
  Refers to individuals who:
  - Are **excluded from the scope of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** under Section 20 of that Act;
  - Are **appointed and employed outside Canada**;
  - Perform duties **directly related to diplomatic or consular operations** or to a **military support unit of the Government of Canada located outside Canada**;
  - Are **subject to the laws of the host country** where they are employed.

---

### **3. Role of Deputy Heads**

- A **deputy head** (i.e., the deputy head of DFATD for diplomatic/consular operations or DND for military units) is responsible for:
  - Making appointments of locally engaged staff;
  - Managing all employment-related matters under these regulations.

- **Deputy Head’s Authority:**  
  The deputy head may delegate any of their powers or functions to any person within their organization (e.g., a director, manager, or HR officer), provided that such delegation is properly authorized and documented.

---

### **4. Appointment on the Basis of Merit**

- All appointments of locally engaged staff must be made **on the basis of merit**.
- "Merit" means that the deputy head must be satisfied that the candidate:

  - These qualifications are defined and established by the deputy head prior to the start date of the appointment.

- The deputy head has discretion to:
  - **Establish the qualifications** required for the role;
  - Use either an **advertised or non-advertised appointment process**;
  - Apply **any assessment method** (e.g., interviews, written exams, performance reviews) deemed appropriate;
  - Make appointments for either:
    - A **specified period** (e.g., 1 year);
    - An **indeterminate period** (e.g., until a vacancy arises or duties cease).

- **No requirement to consider multiple candidates** for a merit-based appointment. A single candidate may be selected if they meet the established qualifications.

---

### **5. Temporary Staff Appointments**

- To address **short-term or immediate staffing needs**, a deputy head may appoint a person as **temporary staff** for a maximum of **125 working days in a calendar year**.

- **Key Provisions:**

  - The deputy head may **terminate the appointment at any time** by providing a **written notice**.
  - The notice must be given **at least one day before the effective date of termination**, or in accordance with **host country laws**, whichever results in the **longer notice period**.
  - The employment ends either:
    - At the end of the 125-day period; or
    - On the effective date specified in the written notice.

---

### **6. Lay-Off of Locally Engaged Staff**

- A deputy head may lay off a locally engaged staff member due to:
  - Lack of work;
  - Discontinuance of a function;
  - Transfer of work or functions **outside** a diplomatic/consular operation or military support unit.

- **Notice Requirements:**
  - A **written notice of lay-off** must be provided to the employee **one month before the effective date** of termination.

---

  - By giving notice in accordance with **host country laws**;
  - And by providing **written notice of resignation** to the deputy head.

### **10. Transition Provisions (Continuity from Previous Regulations)**

To ensure stability and avoid disruption during the transition, several provisions from the **former Locally-Engaged Staff Employment Regulations** are preserved:

| Provision | Continuation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Priority for appointment** under subsection 11(3) of former regulations | Continues for the period specified in the former rules |
| **Ongoing selection processes** underway on the day these regulations come into force | Continue under the former regulations as if these regulations had not come into force |
| **Results of selection processes** | Remain valid for **six months** after the coming into force date |
| **Employees served with lay-off notices** prior to the new regulations | Continue to be governed by the former regulations until the notice period expires |
| **Employees on probation** under the former regulations | Remain on probation until the end of the original probation period; applicable rules (10(2)-(4)) remain in force until then |
| **Employees occupying positions** under subsection 8(1) of former regulations | Remain subject to those rules until they are formally notified of termination under subsection 8(4) |
| **Pending inquiries** under the former regulations | Must be concluded and disposed of in accordance with the former regulations |

> These transitional measures ensure that ongoing processes and rights are not disrupted by the new regulations.

---

### **11. Repeal of Former Regulations**

- The **previous *Locally-Engaged Staff Employment Regulations*** (SOR/95-152; SOR/98-13, s.1) are **formally repealed** by this new regulation.

---

### **Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Merit-based appointments** | Ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability in staffing decisions, even in foreign operations. |
| **Host country law compliance** | Recognizes that locally engaged staff operate under foreign legal systems; employment terms must respect local laws. |
| **Flexibility for temporary needs** | Allows rapid response to urgent staffing demands without triggering full employment processes. |
| **Clear termination pathways** | Provides structured, predictable processes for lay-offs and resignations. |
| **Transitional protections** | Prevents disruption to existing appointments, processes, and employee rights. |
| **Accountability and oversight** | Requires regular reporting to the Public Service Commission, ensuring accountability and regulatory compliance. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Locally Engaged Staff Employment Regulations, 2024* represent a modernized, transparent, and legally sound framework for managing Canadian personnel working abroad. By clearly defining the roles of deputy heads, establishing merit-based selection, allowing flexibility for temporary staffing, and providing robust transition protections, the regulations balance operational needs with public service accountability and fairness.

This framework supports Canada’s international presence — in diplomacy, trade, and defence — while ensuring that the employment of staff outside Canada remains consistent with Canadian public service values and principles of merit, transparency, and equity.

---  
**Final Note:** These regulations are not a general employment law for all Canadian public servants, but are specifically tailored to a unique category of employees — those operating in foreign jurisdictions under host country laws. They reflect a pragmatic and adaptive approach to managing international operations within the Canadian public service.
