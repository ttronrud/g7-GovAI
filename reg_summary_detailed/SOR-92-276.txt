The provided text consists of three identical references to a repealed regulation:

**[Repealed, SOR/2013-124, s. 1]**

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (section 1 of the regulation published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on October 1, 2013, under the reference SOR/2013-124) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by the same document — *SOR/2013-124, section 1*.

#### Key Points:

1. **Repeal Status**:  
   The regulation in question is no longer in force. It was formally removed from the legal framework through a repeal order issued in SOR/2013-124, section 1. This means that any provisions previously set out in that section are no longer applicable or enforceable.

2. **Source of Repeal**:  
   The repeal was enacted as part of *SOR/2013-124*, which is a statutory instrument (a type of regulatory or legislative document) published in the Canada Gazette. This instrument typically contains amendments or repeals to existing regulations.

3. **Section 1 of SOR/2013-124**:  
   While the exact content of the original regulation being repealed is not provided in the query, section 1 of SOR/2013-124 likely contained the formal repeal of a prior regulation. For example, it might have repealed a rule related to:
   - Environmental standards,
   - Safety regulations,
   - Licensing procedures,
   - Product standards, or
   - Administrative processes — depending on the subject matter of the original regulation.

4. **Legal Implications**:  
   - Any legal obligations, compliance requirements, or enforcement actions based on the repealed regulation are no longer valid.
   - Regulatory bodies or individuals must refer to current, active regulations for guidance.
   - The repeal may have been implemented to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated rules with more effective or relevant ones.

5. **Public Access and Compliance**:  
   The repeal is publicly recorded in the Canada Gazette and is accessible through official government databases (such as the *Regulations and Codes* database or the *Canada Gazette* website). This ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to identify which rules are currently active.

### Conclusion:

The provided information does **not** contain the full text of the original regulation being repealed — only the notice of its repeal. Therefore, a detailed summary of the *substance* of the original regulation cannot be provided without additional context (e.g., the title of the regulation, its subject matter, or its prior content).

However, the summary of the **repeal notice** itself is clear:  
> A regulation (specifically, section 1 of SOR/2013-124) has been officially canceled and is no longer in effect. This repeal was enacted to remove outdated or obsolete provisions from the regulatory framework, and stakeholders must now refer to current regulations for applicable rules.

To obtain the original content of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2013-124 prior to the repeal, which is available through official government sources such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Canada Regulatory Database*.
