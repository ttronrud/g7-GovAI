**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a statutory designation issued under the **Pay Equity Act** (S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 416). Here is a detailed summary of its content, purpose, and implications:

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Procedural Background**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- This means that the Governor General, as the formal head of state, is exercising a constitutional role in accordance with the advice of the federal government’s leadership (the Prime Minister).
- The authority to designate a Minister under the Pay Equity Act is derived specifically from **Section 5 of the Pay Equity Act**, which empowers the Governor General to appoint a Minister to act as the "Minister for the purposes of the Act."

---

### **2. Designated Minister**
- The **Minister of Labour** is formally designated as the **Minister for the purposes of the Pay Equity Act**.
- This designation establishes the Minister of Labour as the official federal government representative responsible for administering, overseeing, and enforcing the provisions of the Pay Equity Act.

---

### **3. Purpose and Function of the Designation**
- The designation ensures that there is a clear, designated government official responsible for:
  - Implementing the Pay Equity Act.
  - Responding to complaints or inquiries related to pay equity.
  - Coordinating with federal departments, provinces, and territories on pay equity matters.
  - Ensuring compliance with the Act’s requirements, including the establishment of pay equity boards, the conduct of pay equity assessments, and the enforcement of equitable pay practices.
- It provides legal clarity and accountability by assigning responsibility to a specific Minister, which strengthens the operational framework of the Act.

---

### **4. Role of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**
- The Minister of Labour is a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal body of senior government officials appointed to advise the Crown.
- This membership is a procedural formality that confirms the Minister’s status as a senior official with the authority to act in the name of the Crown in matters of legislation and policy.
- It reinforces the legitimacy and constitutional validity of the designation.

---

### **5. Context and Significance**
- The Pay Equity Act was enacted to address historical and systemic gender-based pay disparities in the Canadian workforce.
- By designating the Minister of Labour as the responsible Minister, the government ensures that the Act is administered by a department with direct responsibility for labour standards, workplace equity, and employment policy.
- This designation is particularly important because the Pay Equity Act involves cross-sectoral implementation, requiring coordination with employers, unions, and other stakeholders.

---

### **6. Legal Effect**
- The designation is not a policy decision but a **formal legal appointment** that gives the Minister of Labour the authority to:
  - Issue directives, orders, or regulations under the Act.
  - Represent the federal government in legal or administrative proceedings related to pay equity.
  - Appoint and oversee the work of the Pay Equity Board (if established).
- The provision is effective as of the date of publication in the *Canada Gazette* (which occurred in 2018, as indicated by the Statute Citation S.C. 2018, c. 27).

### **Conclusion**
This regulation serves a foundational administrative function within the Pay Equity Act. By formally designating the Minister of Labour as the Minister for the purposes of the Act, the federal government ensures clear governance, accountability, and continuity in the implementation of pay equity policies. It is a critical step in institutionalizing the Act’s objectives and enabling effective enforcement and monitoring of equitable pay practices across Canada.

**In short:**  
This regulation legally appoints the Minister of Labour as the designated authority responsible for administering and enforcing the Pay Equity Act, ensuring that the Act has a clear, accountable, and operational structure within the federal government.
