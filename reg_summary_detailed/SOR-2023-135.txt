**Detailed Summary of the Squamish Nation Residential Tenancy Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 28, par. 188(d))**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

These regulations are a **federal legislative instrument** enacted under the **First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act (FNCIDA)**, specifically in accordance with:

- **Paragraph 5(1)(a)**: The Minister of Indigenous Services received a resolution from the **Squamish Nation Council** requesting that the Minister recommend the creation of regulations to apply certain provincial laws to specific reserve lands.
- **Paragraph 3(2)(b)**: The Minister is granted legislative authority to regulate commercial or industrial undertakings on designated reserve lands.
- **Paragraph 5(1)(b)**: An agreement exists between the **Minister of Indigenous Services**, the **Province of British Columbia**, and the **Squamish Nation** for joint administration and enforcement of these regulations.

As a result, **Her Excellency the Governor in Council** enacted the **Squamish Nation Residential Tenancy Regulations** under **Sections 3b and 4 of the FNCIDA**, making them effective upon registration.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to:

- **Harmonize the legal regime** governing residential tenancies (including manufactured home parks and rental units) on designated **project lands** (i.e., Squamish Nation reserve lands) with the **existing provincial legal framework** in British Columbia.
- Ensure that **provincial landlord-tenant laws** — specifically the *Manufactured Home Park Tenancy Act* and the *Residential Tenancy Act* — apply to these lands, **within the limits of federal constitutional authority**.
- Provide a clear, consistent, and enforceable legal structure that respects Indigenous governance while aligning with provincial standards.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **First Nation** | The First Nation named in Column 1 of Schedule 1 (Squamish Nation in this case). |
| **Project Lands** | The reserve lands described in Column 2 of Schedule 1. |
| **Incorporated Laws** | The statutes and regulations of British Columbia (as listed in Schedule 2), as amended and adapted by Sections 11–31 of these Regulations. |
| **Provincial Body / Official** | As defined in the FNCIDA Implementation Act (S.B.C. 2012, c. 21). These bodies/officers are empowered to enforce the incorporated laws. |

> Note: The term "commercial or industrial undertaking" is **expanded** to include **manufactured home parks** and **residential tenancy developments**.

---

### **4. Interpretation and Application of Provincial Laws**

- The **incorporated laws** are interpreted in accordance with the **British Columbia Interpretation Act (R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 238)**.
- References to "enactment" in that Act include the incorporated laws.
- Adaptations made in Sections 11–31 are **integrated into the incorporated laws** and are treated as part of them.
- The laws are only applied **to the extent permitted by federal constitutional authority** (e.g., not exceeding the division of powers between federal and provincial governments).

---

### **5. Commencement of the Regulations**

- The **Minister must, by order**, specify in **Column 3 of Schedule 1** the **date** on which the incorporated laws begin to apply to each project land.
- This date is not automatic — it must be formally ordered by the Minister.
- A provision of an incorporated law only applies if the **corresponding B.C. law is in force** at the time.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Procedural Conformity**

Unless otherwise specified, the following must conform to **British Columbia law**:

- Enforcement of incorporated laws
- Prosecution of offences
- Review or appeal of decisions or actions
- Notice and procedural requirements

> This ensures that legal processes (e.g., hearings, appeals) follow the same standards as in B.C. civil law.

---

### **7. Notification to Stakeholders (Before Application)**

Before the incorporated laws take effect, the **First Nation Council** must:

1. **Send written notice by mail** to:
   - All leaseholders on the project lands
   - All Indigenous persons lawfully in possession (under Section 20 of the *Indian Act*)

2. **Publish a notice** in the **local newspaper with the largest circulation** for **two consecutive weeks**, one day per week.

3. Provide **written notice of compliance** to the Minister.

> **Important Exception**:  
> If a leaseholder or occupant fails to receive notice, the **order is not invalid**, and **no legal action** can be brought against:
> - His Majesty in Right of Canada
> - The Minister
> - The Province of British Columbia
> - Any provincial official or body
> - The First Nation or its council

This protects the integrity of the regulatory process and avoids liability for procedural failures.

---

### **8. Registration and Record-Keeping**

Once the laws apply:
- The **Department of Indigenous Services officer** responsible for the land register must **add a notation** to the register indicating that the incorporated laws now apply to those project lands.

---

### **9. Scope of Applicable Laws**

- The statutes and regulations referenced in Sections 16–31 are **British Columbia laws**, unless otherwise stated.
- A reference to "person" in an incorporated law **includes the First Nation** as a party.

> **Exclusions from application**:
> - Spent provisions, commencement provisions, and consequential amendments
> - Provisions appointing individuals
> - Provisions authorizing the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make general regulations (except those required to implement Schedule 2)

> **Exception**: A person appointed under an incorporated law remains in that position **as long as they remain in office under B.C. law**.
