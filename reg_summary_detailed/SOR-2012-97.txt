### **Detailed Summary of the Clyde River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

These regulations are established under the **Aeronautics Act** (R.S., c. A-2, s. 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a), specifically pursuant to subsection **5.5(1)a**, which mandates that proposed zoning regulations for airports be publicly announced and subject to reasonable public comment before being finalized.

- A **notice of proposed regulations** was published in two successive issues of the *Nunatsiaq News* on **February 10 and 17, 2012**, and a copy of the proposed regulations was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 19 and March 26, 2011**.
- This provided interested parties (including local communities, developers, and aviation stakeholders) with a **reasonable opportunity to submit representations or objections** to the Minister of Transport.
- Based on this public consultation, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally enacted the **Clyde River Airport Zoning Regulations**.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **To ensure aviation safety** by preventing development or use of land adjacent to or near Clyde River Airport that could interfere with:
   - The safe operation of aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
   - Aircraft navigation, communication, or radar systems.

2. **To prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** between aircraft and ground-based facilities (such as air traffic control towers or communication stations).

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined and used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Clyde River Airport**, located near Clyde River, Nunavut. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | The geometric center of the runway thresholds at grid coordinates **7,820,133.667 N, 518,008.083 E** (latitude 70°29′09″ N, longitude 68°31′01″ W). Located 595.48 m from the end of runway 02–20’s strip surface, at an elevation of **27.96 m above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface extending from each end of the runway (runway 02 and 20) upward and outward. It rises at a **1:30 vertical-to-horizontal ratio** (1 m up for every 30 m horizontally) from a base elevation to a horizontal line 2,500 m away. Outer ends are 295 m from the runway centerline and 83.33 m above base elevation. |
| **Outer Surface** | A circular imaginary surface extending **4,000 meters** from the airport reference point. Maintains a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but is capped at **9 meters above ground level** where it would otherwise fall below this threshold. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary rectangular surface associated with the runway. For runway 02–20: <br> - Total width: **90 meters** (45 m on each side of the centerline) <br> - Length: **1,190.96 meters** <br> - Begins 60 m southwest of threshold 02 and ends 60 m northeast of threshold 20 <br> - Elevation varies gradually between the ends: 27.69 m at threshold 02 and 28.70 m at threshold 20 <br> - Azimuth of centerline: **N 17°30′47″ E** |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 m up per 7 m horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip surface and approach surfaces until it intersects the outer surface. Ensures a smooth transition from runway/airfield zones to the outer zone. |
| **Zoning Plan** | **Plan No. E 3264**, prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services, dated **December 1, 2008**. Serves as the foundational map for all spatial definitions in the regulations. |

#### **4. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Clyde River Airport** within a defined area:

- A **circle of 4,000 meters in radius**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This includes:
  - Land **under water** (e.g., lakes, rivers, or submerged areas near the airport).
  - **Public road allowances** (right-of-ways or access roads adjacent to the airport).

> *For greater certainty, the regulations cover not only surface land but also subsurface and water-based areas within this boundary.*

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities and Developments**

The following activities are **strictly prohibited** on or within the regulated lands:

##### **(a) Construction or Placement of Structures**
- No person may **place, erect, construct, or permit** the construction of:
  - Buildings, structures, or objects.
  - Additions to existing structures or objects.
- Any part of such structure or object **must not penetrate** any of the following surfaces:
  - Approach surface
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surface

> This includes any structure that extends vertically above the defined surfaces, such as towers, poles, or even large trees or shrubs.

##### **(b) Use or Development Causing Signal Interference**
- No person may **use or develop** land **under the outer surface** in a way that:
  - Causes **interference with signals or communications** between:
    - Aircraft and ground facilities
    - Aircraft and air traffic control systems

> This protects critical radio, radar, and communication links essential for safe flight operations.

##### **(c) Growth of Natural Objects**
- No person may **permit natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, or vegetation) to grow in a way that:
  - Penetrates any of the following surfaces:
    - Approach surface
    - Outer surface
    - Transitional surface

> This prevents vegetation from growing too tall or close to the runway or approach paths, which could pose a hazard during takeoff or landing.

##### **(d) Wildlife Attraction (Aviation Safety Hazard)**
- No person may use or permit the use of land for activities that **attract wildlife — especially birds** — which could:
  - Create a hazard to aircraft (e.g., bird strikes).
  - Compromise flight safety.

> This includes activities like feeding animals, leaving food waste, or creating habitats that attract birds.

---

#### **6. Exception: Temporary Open Water Reservoirs**

Despite the general prohibitions, a **specific exception** is allowed:

- A person may use land for an **open water storage reservoir** (e.g., for water supply or emergency use) **for a maximum of 48 hours or less**.

> This exception is intended to allow emergency or temporary needs without compromising aviation safety, as long as the reservoir is short-lived and does not create permanent structures or vegetation growth.

---

#### **7. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force** on the day when the requirements specified in **subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.

> As of the document’s note, these regulations were **in force as of April 2, 2013**.

---

#### **8. Coordinate and Elevation System**

To ensure precision in spatial planning and enforcement:

- **Grid coordinates** are in the **UTM Zone 19 (1983 North American Datum)**, with a combined average scale factor of **0.999600**.
- **Elevations** are based on the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28)**.
- All surfaces are defined using precise mathematical models and elevation gradients to ensure consistent and measurable boundaries.

#### **9. Summary of Key Spatial Features**

| Feature | Key Parameters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | Center of runway thresholds; 595.48 m from runway end; 27.96 m elevation |
| **Approach Surfaces** | 2,500 m horizontal distance; 1:30 slope; 83.33 m elevation at outer ends |
| **Outer Surface** | Radius of 4,000 m; constant elevation of 45 m above ARP; capped at 9 m above ground |

#### **10. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, especially if they compromise aviation safety or cause signal interference.
- Compliance is critical due to the remote and sensitive nature of the Arctic environment and the importance of safe air travel in Nunavut.
