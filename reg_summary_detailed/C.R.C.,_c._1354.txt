**Detailed Summary of the Safety or Security Positions Bargaining Direction**

**Title:**  
*Safety or Security Positions Bargaining Direction*

**Citation:**  
This Direction may be cited as the *Safety or Security Positions Bargaining Direction*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to protect the **safety and security of Canada and its allied or associated states** by restricting collective bargaining for certain sensitive positions within the Department of External Affairs (now known as Global Affairs Canada or a similar federal department).

The regulation applies specifically to employees holding specific job positions—identified by position numbers—within the Department of External Affairs. These positions are deemed to involve sensitive information, national security interests, or foreign policy functions that require strict control over access to collective bargaining processes.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Prohibition on Collective Bargaining:**  
   The Treasury Board (the federal government’s body responsible for managing public service affairs and collective agreements) is **prohibited from negotiating** with any bargaining agent (such as a union) or **entering into a collective agreement** for employees holding any of the listed positions.

2. **Applicable Positions:**  
   The following position numbers are explicitly excluded from collective bargaining:  
   1291, 1292, 1293, 1295, 1296, 1305, 1416, 1417, 1625, 1626, 1627, 1628, 1629, 1665, 1821, 2051, 2052, 2053, 2054, 2057, 2058, 3324, 3326, 3380, 3393, 3503, 3504.

   These position numbers are typically linked to roles in areas such as:
   - Diplomatic services
   - Intelligence and security operations
   - Foreign policy analysis
   - International relations and treaty negotiations
   - Security clearance functions
   - Access to classified or sensitive information

   The exact duties of each position may vary, but their inclusion reflects a classification as **security-sensitive or safety-critical**.

3. **Reason for Exclusion:**  
   The government asserts that allowing collective bargaining for these positions could:
   - Compromise national security
   - Lead to the disclosure of sensitive information
   - Create vulnerabilities in the handling of classified or confidential data
   - Undermine the operational independence or discretion required in foreign affairs and security-related roles

4. **Applicability:**  
   The restriction applies to:
   - All employees currently holding any of the listed positions
   - Any future employees who are assigned to these positions (as long as they fall within the scope of the direction)
   - The entire duration of the direction’s validity (unless revoked or amended)

5. **Bargaining Agent Exclusion:**  
   No union or representative organization may engage in collective bargaining activities (such as negotiations, consultations, or strikes) on behalf of employees in these positions.

6. **Legal Basis:**  
   This direction is issued under the authority of federal legislation governing the management of public service personnel, particularly the *Public Service Employment Act* or related regulations. It reflects the government’s power to impose restrictions on collective bargaining when national security is at stake.

**Implications:**

- **Lack of Union Representation:** Employees in these positions are not entitled to union representation or collective bargaining rights, which may affect their job security, working conditions, and pay negotiations.
- **Limited Employee Voice:** These individuals may have reduced opportunities to influence workplace policies, working hours, or benefits through formal channels.
- **Security and Operational Integrity:** The government maintains that such restrictions are necessary to ensure operational effectiveness and safeguard national interests.
- **Potential for Public Criticism:** The exclusion may be viewed by civil society, unions, or human rights advocates as a limitation on employee rights, especially when applied without clear public justification or transparency.

**Duration and Review:**  
While the regulation does not specify an expiry date, such directions are typically subject to periodic review by the Treasury Board or the Public Service Commission. They may be revised, suspended, or revoked if new information arises or if security concerns diminish.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *Safety or Security Positions Bargaining Direction* is a targeted administrative measure designed to preserve national security and the integrity of sensitive foreign affairs and security operations by legally preventing collective bargaining for specific positions within the Department of External Affairs. It reflects a balance between governmental security obligations and employee rights, prioritizing national safety over labor rights in high-risk roles. However, it also raises important questions about the scope of such restrictions and their consistency with broader labor rights protections.
