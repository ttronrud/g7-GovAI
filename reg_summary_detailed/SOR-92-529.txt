**Detailed Summary of the Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Framework and Authority**

The *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations* are made under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to two key provisions of the *Insurance Companies Act*:

- **Subsection 2(1)**: Defines "regulatory capital" as a specific measure used to assess the financial strength and solvency of insurance companies.
- **Section 703** of the *Insurance Companies Act*: Grants the regulatory power to define and determine the regulatory capital of insurance companies.

These regulations are formally cited as the **Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations**, and they came into force on **April 1, 1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 47).

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a **clear, standardized, and transparent formula** for calculating the **regulatory capital** of an insurance company. This capital serves as a key metric for:

- Assessing the financial stability of insurers,
- Ensuring solvency and protection of policyholders,
- Enabling consistent regulatory oversight across different insurance entities.

### **Key Definitions in the Regulations**

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the legal foundation for insurance regulation in Canada.

2. **"Designated Entity"**  
   This term was **repealed** by **SOR/2001-423, section 1**, and is no longer in effect. Therefore, it has no current relevance in these regulations.

3. **"Liabilities"**  
   Includes:
   - Deferred taxes,
   - Subordinated indebtedness.  
   This broad definition ensures that all long-term obligations that are not immediately due or are ranked below senior liabilities are included in the calculation of liabilities.

4. **"Minority Interest"**  
   Defined as:
   - An equity interest in an entity controlled by the company, held by a person other than the company, or  
   - An entity controlled by the company that holds such an interest.  
   This ensures that the regulatory capital reflects not only the company’s own equity but also the equity interests of third parties in subsidiaries it controls.

### **Formula for Regulatory Capital**

Subject to certain conditions, the **regulatory capital** of a company at any given time is calculated using the following formula:

> **Regulatory Capital = A + B + C + D**

Where:

- **A** = The amount of **minority interests** reported in the financial statements.
- **B** = The amount of **subordinated indebtedness** reported in the financial statements.
- **C** = The amount of the **excess of assets over liabilities**, as reported in the financial statements prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and specifications set out in **subsection 331(4)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*.
- **D** = For a **life insurance company**, the amount of **total deferred realized capital gains less total deferred realized capital losses** from real estate and share transactions (both within the company and in any other life company controlled by it).
- **E** = The amount of **goodwill** that would be included in the financial statements.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The formula includes goodwill only if it is recognized in the financial statements under the applicable accounting standards.

### **Conditions for Including a Security in Regulatory Capital**

An amount may be included in regulatory capital for a security **only if** all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Subordination in Right of Payment**:  
   The security must be **subordinate in right of payment** to:
   - The company’s **policy liabilities**, and  
   - All other liabilities of the issuing entity, **except** those that are:
     - Ranked equally with the security, or  
     - Subordinate to it by their terms.

   This ensures that only those obligations that are truly secondary (i.e., paid after policy claims and other senior debts) are counted toward regulatory capital.

2. **Fully Paid-Up**:  
   The security must be **fully paid up** — meaning all capital contributions have been made and no further payments are required.

3. **Minimum Term or No Term Requirement (for Subordinated Debt or Preferred Shares)**:  
   For **subordinated indebtedness** or **preferred shares**, the security must meet **at least one** of the following:
   - Have an **initial minimum term of five years or more**, or  
   - Have **no term (perpetual)**.

4. **Non-Redemption in First Five Years**:  
   The security **cannot be redeemed or purchased for cancellation** during the first five years after issuance.

> ⚠️ This provision ensures that subordinated instruments are not treated as short-term or easily callable obligations, which could undermine their role as a true safety net for policyholders.

### **Key Observations and Implications**

1. **Compliance with Accounting Standards**:  
   The financial statements used in the calculation must follow the **accounting principles and specifications** established by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** under subsection 331(4) of the *Insurance Companies Act*. This ensures consistency and comparability across insurers.

2. **Life Insurance Company-Specific Adjustment**:  
   Life companies have a unique component (D) related to **deferred realized capital gains and losses** from real estate and share transactions. This reflects the fact that life insurers often hold long-term investments and may realize capital gains or losses over time, which can impact their financial position and solvency.

3. **Goodwill Inclusion**:  
   Goodwill is included only if it is recognized in the financial statements. This aligns with accounting standards and ensures that regulatory capital reflects actual, recognized assets rather than speculative or unverifiable values.

4. **Repealed Provisions**:  
   - The term *"designated entity"* was **repealed** in **SOR/2001-423, section 1** — meaning it is no longer used.
   - The condition regarding the **initial term of subordinated securities** (in SOR/2001-423, section 2) was also **repealed**, indicating that the current version of the regulations now applies a more streamlined and updated framework.

### **Regulatory and Policy Rationale**

- The regulatory capital formula is designed to:
  - Reflect the **true economic strength** of the insurance company,
  - Protect **policyholders** by ensuring that companies have sufficient capital to meet obligations,
  - Provide a **predictable and transparent** basis for regulators to assess risk and solvency,
  - Encourage prudent investment and risk management practices.

- By including **subordinated debt**, **minority interests**, and **deferred gains/losses**, the formula accounts for both direct and indirect financial exposures.

### **Conclusion**

The *Regulatory Capital (Insurance Companies) Regulations* provide a comprehensive, legally grounded, and operationally practical method for determining the regulatory capital of insurance companies in Canada. The formula is designed to reflect the actual financial structure of insurers, particularly their obligations to policyholders and the nature of their investments.

While the regulations have been updated over time (notably with the repeal of outdated provisions), the core framework remains in place to ensure the financial stability and public confidence in the insurance sector.

> **Note**: As of the 2001 amendments (SOR/2001-423), the original provisions regarding designated entities and certain subordinated security requirements have been **repealed**. The current version of the regulations reflects a more focused, modern, and effective approach to capital measurement in the insurance industry.
