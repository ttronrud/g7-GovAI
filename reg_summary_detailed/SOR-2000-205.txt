### **Detailed Summary of the *Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 9)**

These regulations, approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources under **section 44 of the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act***, establish the regulatory framework governing **Class II nuclear facilities** and **Class II prescribed equipment** in Canada. They are administered by the **Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)** and provide detailed requirements for licensing, safety, operation, certification, and decommissioning of specific types of nuclear devices and installations.

---

## **I. Purpose and Scope**

The regulations apply to:
- **Class II nuclear facilities**, which are defined as facilities that include **Class II prescribed equipment**.
- **Class II prescribed equipment**, which includes specific types of devices that pose a moderate level of radiological risk and require strict controls due to their use in medical, industrial, or research applications.

These regulations aim to ensure the **safety of workers, the public, and the environment** by setting comprehensive standards for design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of such facilities and equipment.

> **Note**: The regulations were originally issued in 2000 and have been amended over time. Some provisions have been repealed (e.g., brachytherapy machine and certain certification clauses), but the core framework remains in effect.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The following definitions clarify key terms used throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* (NSCA), the primary legislation governing nuclear safety in Canada. |
| **Class II nuclear facility** | A facility containing Class II prescribed equipment. |
| **Class II prescribed equipment** | Includes: <br> - Irradiators using >10¹⁵ Bq of nuclear substance or delivering >1 cGy/min at 1 meter; <br> - Radioactive source teletherapy machines; <br> - Particle accelerators with beam energy <50 MeV (for particles ≤4 atomic mass units) or ≤15 MeV per atomic mass unit (for heavier particles); <br> - Brachytherapy remote afterloaders. |
| **Hazardous substance** | Non-nuclear substances used or produced in licensed activities that may pose environmental or health risks. |
| **Irradiator** | A device that delivers controlled radiation to targets (excluding people). |
| **Licensed activity** | Activities authorized under the NSCA (e.g., construction, operation, servicing) related to Class II facilities or equipment. |
| **Licensee** | A person authorized to carry out a licensed activity. |
| **Radiation survey meter** | Instrument for measuring radiation dose rates. |
| **Radioactive source teletherapy machine** | A machine delivering radiation via a sealed radioactive source for therapeutic purposes. |
| **Sealed source** | Radioactive material enclosed in a capsule or cover that prevents dispersion under normal conditions. |
| **Servicing** | Maintenance activities (installation, repair, dismantling) not part of routine operations or authorized under license. |
| **Teletherapy machine** | Device delivering a collimated beam of radiation for therapeutic use. |
| **Worker** | A person performing work referenced in a license. |
