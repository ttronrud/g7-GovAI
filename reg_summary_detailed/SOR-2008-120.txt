**Detailed Summary of the Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations*, made under **section 136a and 207 of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, establish specific rules governing the operation of vessels in certain Canadian waters. These regulations are designed to **protect public safety, environmental integrity, and the safe navigation of vessels**, while allowing for limited exceptions and special permits for legitimate activities.

The regulations were originally enacted in **2005** and have been amended over time, with several provisions repealed or updated (e.g., in SOR/2023-274 and SOR/2025-158). As of the latest version, the rules apply to all vessels operating in designated rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, with strict restrictions on speed, propulsion type, and use of vessels for recreational or sporting activities.

## **Key Definitions**

Before diving into the operational rules, the following key terms are defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Electrical Propulsion** | A vessel propelled by an electric motor powered by electric cells (e.g., batteries). |
| **Engine Power** | Measured in kilowatts (kW) using **ISO 8665** standards for small craft engines. |
| **Local Authority** | Municipalities, provinces, territories, or federal/provincial departments with government powers. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Transport (responsible for enforcement and policy). |
| **Personal Watercraft (PWC)** | Water-jet driven vessels with enclosed hulls, no cockpit, used by individuals straddling, sitting, standing, or kneeling. |
| **Power-Driven Vessel** | Vessels propelled by internal combustion engines or steam engines. |
| **Rivers and Lakes** | All waters upstream of high-tide shorelines, **excluding** the St. Lawrence River east of 70°53′ W longitude. |
| **TP 15587** | The official schedule document containing detailed restrictions, published by Transport Canada and periodically amended. |

## **Core Operational Restrictions**

### **1. General Prohibition on Vessel Operation in Specific Waters (Schedule 1)**

> *A person must not operate a vessel in the waters described in Schedule 1 of TP 15587, except as indicated in that Schedule.*

- Applies to **all vessels** (electrical or power-driven).
- Schedule 1 identifies specific bodies of water (e.g., certain rivers, lakes) where vessel operation is generally prohibited.
- Exceptions may exist for specific activities (e.g., fishing, emergency response) as noted in the schedule.

---

### **2. Restrictions on Electrical Propulsion and Power-Driven Vessels in Schedule 2**

> *No vessel driven by electrical propulsion or power-driven propulsion may operate in the waters described in Schedule 2, except as indicated.*

- Applies to both **electrical and conventional** vessels.
- Schedule 2 includes sensitive or ecologically protected areas (e.g., certain lakes and rivers in British Columbia, Ontario).
- Exceptions may be made for authorized activities (e.g., scientific research, emergency operations).

---

### **3. Power Limitation for Electrical Propulsion Vessels (Schedule 3)**

> *No vessel with electrical propulsion and aggregate power >7.5 kW may operate in the waters described in Schedule 3.*

- **7.5 kW** is the maximum allowed for electrical propulsion in these areas.
- This restriction aims to prevent noise, pollution, and disturbance in ecologically sensitive zones.
- Applies only to **electrical propulsion**, not internal combustion engines.

---

### **4. Engine Power Limitation Based on Schedule 4**

> *If a vessel has engine power exceeding the maximum in column 4 of Schedule 4, it cannot operate in the waters listed in columns 1–3 of that schedule.*

- Schedule 4 provides **zone-specific power limits** based on vessel size and location.
- For example, a vessel with engine power above 50 kW may be prohibited from operating in a specific river or lake.
- The restriction applies to **both electrical and power-driven vessels**.
- Exceptions are noted in the schedule.

---

### **5. Speed Restrictions in Schedule 5**

> *No vessel may operate at a speed exceeding the maximum speed in column 4 of Schedule 5.*

- Applies to **all vessels** (electrical or power-driven) in the areas listed in columns 1–3.
- Speed limits are set per water body (e.g., 5 km/h in a narrow river).
- Purpose: Prevents accidents, reduces environmental impact, and ensures safe navigation.

---

### **6. Towing for Water Skiing or Recreational Equipment (Schedule 6)**

> *No vessel may tow a person on water skis or other equipment in Schedule 6 waters, except during permitted hours.*

- Prohibits **towing for sport** (e.g., water skiing, wakeboarding) in certain areas.
- Exceptions: Only allowed **during specific permitted hours** (e.g., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
- Protects wildlife and prevents collisions in sensitive zones.

---

### **7. Wake Surfing in Schedule 7 Waters**

> *No vessel may allow wake surfing in Schedule 7 waters outside permitted hours.*

- Similar to above: prohibits wake surfing outside designated times.
- Ensures public safety and reduces disturbances in ecologically or recreationally sensitive areas.

---

### **8. Proximity Speed Limit (Within 30 m of Shore)**

> *No vessel may exceed 10 km/h within 30 meters of the shore in the following waters:*

- **Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta**
- **British Columbia rivers and lakes**
- **Nitinat River and Lake (upstream of Nitinat Bar)**
- **Nova Scotia rivers and lakes**
- **Bras d’Or Lake (inland of a line from Coffin Point to Red Head)**

**Exceptions:**
- Vessels **towing for water skiing or recreational use** are exempt **if**:
  - The vessel follows a course **away from and perpendicular to the shore**.
  - The vessel operates in **rivers <100 m wide**, **canals**, or **buoyed channels**.
  - The vessel operates in **Schedule 5 waters** (where speed limits already apply).
- **Subsections 5 and 7 do not apply** if another speed limit under the Canada Shipping Act or Canada Marine Act is in force.

## **Exemptions and Exceptions**

### **Exemptions from General Restrictions (Subsections 2(1)–(5) and (7))**

The following individuals or activities are **exempt** from vessel operation restrictions:
