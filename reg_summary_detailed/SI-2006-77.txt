**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
Acquisition of Permanent Resident Status Fee Remission Order  

**Legal Basis:**  
This order is made under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act*, and is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Treasury Board. This provision allows for the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of certain fees when specific conditions are met, in the public interest.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary purpose of this order is to provide a fee remission for individuals who paid the $975 "Acquisition of Permanent Resident Status Fee" under the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR) during a specific transitional period — specifically, before or around May 3, 2006 — and who either paid the fee at a certain time or acquired permanent resident status after that date, prior to a subsequent regulatory amendment.

### Key Provisions:

#### 1. **Fee Amount and Context**
- The full fee for acquiring permanent resident status under subsection 303(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* was $975.
- This regulation provides remission of **$485** of that $975 fee under specific time-based conditions.

#### 2. **Eligibility Conditions for Remission**

Remission of $485 is granted **only if** one of the following two scenarios applies:

**Scenario A:**  
- The fee of $975 is paid **on or after 12:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Saving Time (EDST) on May 3, 2006**,  
- **And before** the coming into force of the *Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Section 303 Fee)*.

> This means individuals who paid the full $975 fee *after May 3, 2006*, but *before* the new fee regulations took effect, are eligible for a $485 remission.

**Scenario B:**  
- The fee of $975 was paid **before 12:00 a.m. EDST on May 3, 2006**,  
- **And** the individual acquires permanent resident status **on or after 12:00 a.m. EDST on May 3, 2006**,  
- **And before** the coming into force of the *Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Section 303 Fee)*.

> This applies to individuals who paid the fee earlier (before May 3, 2006), but who later obtained permanent resident status *on or after May 3, 2006*, before the new fee rules were implemented.

#### 3. **Repayment Requirement**
- If the full $975 fee was paid, the **$485 remitted amount must be repaid** to the individual who paid it.
- This repayment condition ensures that the government does not lose revenue from the fee — it only remits a portion, and the individual is required to reimburse the remitted amount.

> Importantly, the remission is not a full refund. It is a partial reduction of the fee, with the understanding that the person who paid the original fee will later repay the $485.

### Interpretation and Practical Implications:

- The regulation appears to be a **transitional measure** designed to ease the administrative burden on applicants during a period of regulatory change.
- The cutoff date of **May 3, 2006** is significant — it marks the transition point between the old fee regime and the new one, which likely introduced changes to the fee structure (e.g., a different amount or method of collection).
- The remission is not retroactive or automatic — it is strictly time-bound and tied to the date of payment and/or acquisition of status.
- The requirement to repay the remitted $485 suggests that the government is maintaining financial accountability and ensuring that the fee structure remains stable and predictable in the long term.

### Historical Context:
This regulation was enacted in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)), but the specific conditions apply to events occurring in **2006**. This indicates that the regulation may have been initially drafted or passed in 1991 as a general framework, and then activated or applied in 2006 during a specific policy or administrative transition.

It is likely part of a broader effort by Immigration Canada to manage the transition to a new fee structure while providing relief to applicants who were affected by the change.

### Conclusion:

This **Acquisition of Permanent Resident Status Fee Remission Order** provides a **partial fee reduction of $485** for individuals who paid the $975 permanent resident status fee under the old regulations during a specific transitional window (May 3, 2006). The remission is conditional on either:
- Paying the fee *after* May 3, 2006, or
- Paying the fee *before* May 3, 2006 but acquiring status *after* that date — both before the new fee regulations took effect.

Importantly, the remitted amount must be **repaid** by the individual who paid the original fee. This reflects a balanced approach: providing relief during a transition period while preserving government revenue and ensuring compliance with financial administration rules.

This regulation serves as a **targeted, time-limited, and accountable** mechanism to address administrative and public interest concerns during a regulatory change in immigration fee policy.
