Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the *Marine Liability and Information Return Regulations*, enacted under the *Marine Liability Act* (S.C. 2014, c. 29, s. 36 and s. 50(3); S.C. 2001, c. 6). These regulations establish reporting obligations for persons involved in the receipt, handling, or export of certain types of oil and hazardous substances through marine transport in Canada.

## 📚 **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Marine Liability and Information Return Regulations* (MLIRR) are designed to ensure transparency and accountability in the movement of oil and hazardous substances by sea. They require specific reporting by entities that receive or export certain types of marine cargo—particularly oil and hazardous materials—into or out of Canada. The primary goal is to support environmental protection, facilitate risk assessment, and enable the Ship-source Oil Pollution Fund (SSOPF) to manage potential liabilities arising from oil pollution incidents.

These regulations were made under **subsection 74.4(3)a** and **117(1.5)b** of the *Marine Liability Act*, and are enforced by the **Minister of Transport**, with final authority exercised by the **Governor in Council**.

## 🔍 Key Definitions and Jurisdictional Boundaries

### 1. **Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Marine Liability Act*.
- **Administrator**: The Administrator of the **Ship-source Oil Pollution Fund** (SSOPF), responsible for receiving and managing reports and funds related to oil pollution.
- **Receive (in respect of contributing oil)**: Means receiving oil into tankage or storage **immediately after carriage by a ship**.

### 2. **Geographic Boundary: St. Lawrence River vs. Sea**
- The St. Lawrence River ends and the sea begins at a **straight line** drawn:
  - From **Cap-des-Rosiers** to **West Point, Anticosti Island**;
  - Then from **Anticosti Island** to the **north shore of the St. Lawrence River** along the **63°W meridian**.
- This boundary defines where marine transport transitions into coastal or offshore operations.

> *Purpose*: To determine whether a shipment is considered "marine" and subject to reporting under these regulations.

## 📊 Calculation of Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Adjustments

For purposes of **paragraph 113(3)(b)** of the *Marine Liability Act*, the average CPI (excluding food and energy) is calculated as follows:

- Divide the **sum of 12 monthly CPI values** (excluding food and energy) by 12.
- If the result has a fraction:
  - **Round to one decimal place**:
    - If the **second digit after the decimal is < 5**, drop it.
    - If the **second digit ≥ 5**, **increase the first digit by 1** and drop the second digit.

> *Example*:  
> 12.34 → 12.3 (since 4 < 5)  
> 12.35 → 12.4 (since 5 ≥ 5)

> *Purpose*: To adjust compensation or liability calculations in the event of inflation, ensuring fair cost recovery for pollution response.

- **Liquefied Natural Gases (LNG)** (as defined in paragraph 2(b) of Article 16 of the *Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention*) — **any quantity**;
- **Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG)** (as defined in paragraph 2(c) of Article 16) — **over 17,000 metric tons**;
- **Any hazardous and noxious substances** listed in paragraphs 5(a)(ii), (iii), (v), (vi), and (vii) of Article 1 of the *Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention* — **over 17,000 metric tons**.

- If receiving cargo from an **agent or mandatary**:
  - Name of agent/mandatary and type/quantity of cargo received.
- Name and address of **associated persons** involved.

> *Note*: This provision ensures traceability of hazardous materials, especially for high-risk substances.

### ✅ **3. Exporting Contributing Oil or Non-Persistent Oil**

**Applies to**:
- Oil or non-persistent oil exported by sea from Canada or offshore installations, destined for a location **outside Canada**.

**Reporting Thresholds**:
- Must file a return if:
  - **Contributing oil** exceeds **150,000 metric tons** in a calendar year; or
  - **Non-persistent oil** exceeds **17,000 metric tons**.
