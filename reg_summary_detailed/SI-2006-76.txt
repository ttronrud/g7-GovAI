**Key Elements of the Transfer:**

1. **Scope of Transfer:**  
   - The transfer applies only to the **Regional Offices** under the **Communications and Consultations Secretariat**.  
   - These offices are responsible for regional coordination, public engagement, and communication functions related to federal policy and government operations.

2. **Functional Context:**  
   - The **Communications and Consultations Secretariat** historically served as a central unit within the Privy Council Office to manage public communications, consultation processes, and outreach to stakeholders across Canada.  
   - The Regional Offices functioned as regional extensions of this secretariat, facilitating dialogue between federal government and regional communities.

3. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   - The **Treasury Board**, as the principal body responsible for managing federal public administration, personnel, and the overall performance of federal departments and agencies, assumes responsibility for:
     - Oversight of operations
     - Financial management
     - Performance monitoring
     - Human resources and administrative policies
     - Accountability and compliance

4. **Rationale (Implied):**  
   - The transfer reflects a broader administrative restructuring aimed at improving efficiency, accountability, and coordination within federal public service operations.  
   - By placing regional public engagement functions under the Treasury Board, the government seeks to align these activities more closely with broader public service governance, performance standards, and departmental accountability frameworks.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   - The transfer became effective on **July 1, 2006**, meaning all administrative, operational, and supervisory responsibilities for the Regional Offices in the Communications and Consultations Secretariat were transferred to the Treasury Board on that date.

---

**Significance:**

- This move represents a shift in the federal government’s structure, decentralizing certain public engagement functions from the executive branch (Privy Council Office) to the administrative oversight body (Treasury Board).  
- It underscores a trend toward strengthening central oversight of public service operations and enhancing accountability across the federal government.  
- It may also facilitate more consistent standards in how regional consultations and communications are conducted, ensuring alignment with national public service policies.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a formal administrative reorganization under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. It transfers the operational and supervisory control of the Regional Offices within the Communications and Consultations Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Treasury Board, effective July 1, 2006. The change enhances centralized oversight and aligns regional public engagement activities with broader federal public service governance objectives.
