**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions – Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation**

**1. Legal Authority and Source:**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.
- Specifically, it is based on **paragraph 2(a)** of that Act, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers.
- The regulation is referenced as **S.C. 1998, c. 21**, which is the *Budget Implementation Act, 1998a*.

**2. Subject of the Transfer:**
- The regulation concerns the **powers, duties, and functions** related to the **Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation (CMSF)**.
- These responsibilities were originally conferred upon the **Minister of Human Resources Development** under **Part 1 of the Budget Implementation Act, 1998a**, which was enacted on December 12, 2003.

**3. Transfer of Responsibility:**
- As of **December 12, 2003**, the powers, duties, and functions relating to the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation are being transferred from:
  - **The Minister of Human Resources Development**  
    (who previously held oversight of the CMSF)
- To:
  - **The Minister of State to be styled Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development**  
    (a newly designated ministerial role, reflecting a reorganization of federal government responsibilities).

**4. Purpose and Context:**
- The transfer reflects a broader **restructuring of federal government departments and ministerial portfolios** to better align responsibilities with evolving policy priorities.
- The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation was established to provide financial support to Canadian students pursuing post-secondary education, particularly those from low-income backgrounds.
- By transferring oversight to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, the government signals a strategic emphasis on **human resources development and skills training** as central to national economic and educational goals.

**5. Effective Date:**
- The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003** — the same date the original powers were conferred under the Budget Implementation Act, 1998a.

**6. Legal and Administrative Significance:**
- This transfer is not merely administrative; it constitutes a formal legal reassignment of governmental authority under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- It ensures continuity in the operation of the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation while aligning its management with a ministerial portfolio focused on workforce development and education outcomes.

**7. Implications:**
- The new Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development now has full responsibility for managing the CMSF, including budgeting, program implementation, oversight of scholarship distribution, and reporting to Parliament.
- This shift may also indicate a broader governmental strategy to integrate education funding and skills development within a unified human resources framework.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation formally transfers the administrative and policy responsibilities of the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation from the former Minister of Human Resources Development to the Minister of State (now styled Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development), effective December 12, 2003. The move is part of a government-wide reorganization aimed at streamlining responsibilities and enhancing coordination between education, human resources, and skills development policy. The regulation ensures legal clarity and continuity in the management of the scholarship program under the new ministerial leadership.
