**Detailed Summary of the Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **Overview**
These regulations, made under the authority of the *Customs Tariff* and approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, establish the **rules of origin** for goods originating in **Commonwealth Caribbean Countries (CCC)**. The purpose is to determine whether goods from these countries qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the **Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff**—a trade agreement that allows reduced or zero tariffs on certain goods imported into Canada.

The regulations came into force on **January 1, 1998**, and were designed to ensure that only genuinely "originating" goods from CCC countries benefit from preferential treatment.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Beneficiary Country**:  
  A country that is a party to the Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff. These are the Caribbean nations eligible for preferential treatment under the tariff regime.

---

### **Conditions for Origin in a Beneficiary Country**

A good is considered to **originate in a beneficiary country** if it meets **one or more** of the following criteria:

#### **1. Naturally Derived or Produced in the Country**
- A **mineral good** extracted from the soil or seabed of the country.
- A **vegetable good** harvested in the country.
- A **live animal** born and raised in the country.
- A **good obtained from a live animal** raised in the country.
- A **good obtained by hunting or fishing** in the country.
- A **good derived from sea fishing or marine resources** taken from the sea by a vessel of the country.
- A **product made on board a factory ship** of the country, using **only products** from (f) above (i.e., marine products).
- **Waste or scrap** derived from manufacturing facilities within the country.
- **Used goods** imported into Canada **for the sole purpose of recovering raw materials** (i.e., not for resale or consumption).
- **Goods produced in the country exclusively** from any of the products listed in (a) to (h) above.

> This list establishes a broad, natural-origin basis for origin, emphasizing products that are directly derived from local natural resources or produced through local processes.

#### **2. Value Threshold Rule (General Rule for Non-Listed Goods)**  
For goods **not listed in Chapters 61 to 63** of the *List of Tariff Provisions*, a good originates in a beneficiary country if:
> The value of **non-originating materials, parts, or products** (used in manufacturing or production) **used outside** the beneficiary country or from an undetermined location  
> is **no more than 40%** of the **ex-factory price** of the finished good as packed for shipment to Canada.

- This is known as the **40% rule** and is a standard measure used in origin determination to prevent "degrading" or "foreign content" from disqualifying goods.
- The ex-factory price includes all costs up to the point of packing for shipment.

#### **3. Deemed Origin (for Specific Cases)**
Certain materials and packaging are **deemed to have originated** in the beneficiary country under specific conditions:
- Any **materials, parts, or products** used in the manufacture of goods that originate in **another beneficiary country** or **from Canada** — are **deemed to have originated** in the beneficiary country.
- **Packing materials** required for transportation (e.g., crates, containers) are **deemed to have originated** — **except** packing that is used in the **ordinary sale** of the product in the beneficiary country (i.e., retail packaging).

> This rule simplifies origin determination by allowing intermediate inputs from other CCC countries or Canada to be treated as originating, thereby preserving the preferential status of the final product.

### **Special Rules for Goods in Chapters 61 to 63**

These chapters cover **textiles, apparel, and related products**. Specific rules apply:

#### **Chapter 61 & 62 (Apparel, Textiles, and Sewn Products)**
- A good originates in a beneficiary country if it is:
  - **Cut**, **knit to shape**, and/or **sewn or otherwise assembled** in that country.

> This means that even if fabric is imported from elsewhere, if the final assembly (cutting, sewing, etc.) happens in the beneficiary country, the product qualifies as originating.

#### **Chapter 63 (Fabric and Fabric-Based Products)**
- A good originates if it is:
  - Cut, knit to shape, and sewn or assembled in the beneficiary country, **from fabric produced in any beneficiary country or in Canada**.

> This allows flexibility: the fabric itself can originate in Canada or another CCC country, as long as the final assembly occurs in the beneficiary country.

---

### **Application of Subsections (4) and (5) – Fabric/Part Focus**

When determining origin for goods in Chapters 61–63:
- Subsections (4) and (5) apply **only to the fabric or parts** that determine the **tariff classification** of the final product.
- The classification is determined according to the **General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System (HS)**, as set out in the schedule to the *Customs Tariff*.

> This ensures that origin is assessed based on the **key components** that define the product’s HS code, not every component of the product.

---

### **Origin Retention During Transport**

A good that qualifies as originating **retains its origin status** only if:
1. It **remains under customs control** outside the beneficiary country; and  
2. It does **not undergo any further production or processing** outside the beneficiary country — except for:
   - Unloading
   - Reloading
   - Separation from a bulk shipment
   - Storing
   - Any operation necessary to transport it to Canada or preserve its condition

> This prevents "reprocessing" or "remanufacturing" abroad from disqualifying the good from preferential treatment.

---

### **Grouping and Whole Good Treatment**

Goods in a shipment are treated **separately** unless specific exceptions apply:

#### **Group, Set, or Assembly Rule**
- If a group, set, or assembly of goods is classified under **one HS item**, then the entire group is considered **one good** for origin purposes.

#### **Tools, Parts, and Accessories**
- Tools, parts, and accessories that are:
  - Imported with a good,
  - Customarily included as standard equipment in the sale of that good,
  - And whose price is **included in the price of the good** (no separate charge),
  
  are **considered part of the good** and form a **whole** for origin purposes.

> This prevents the disqualification of a product due to incidental accessories or tools.

#### **Unassembled Goods in Multiple Shipments**
- If an **unassembled good** is imported in **more than one shipment** due to transport or production constraints, it is still treated as **one good**.

> This avoids fragmentation of origin status due to logistical realities.

---

### **Shipping Requirement for Preferential Treatment**

To be entitled to the **Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff**:
- Goods must be **shipped directly to Canada**, either:
  - **Directly from a beneficiary country**, or
  - With **transshipment** (i.e., passing through another country en route to Canada)

> **No indirect routes** (e.g., via a third country not in the CCC) are allowed unless the goods are re-imported or reprocessed — which would likely disqualify them.

> Importantly, **transshipment is permitted**, but only if the goods remain in the same chain and do not undergo further processing.

---

### **Repeal Clause**
The regulations include a **repeal clause**, indicating that these rules supersede any prior provisions on origin for the CCC tariff. This ensures a clear, current legal framework.

---

### **Key Implications and Purpose**

1. **Simplifies Origin Determination**:  
   Provides clear, practical rules for determining whether goods qualify for preferential treatment, especially for agricultural, natural, and manufactured products.

2. **Protects Local Value Chains**:  
   The 40% rule and natural-origin criteria ensure that only goods with substantial local content benefit from preferential tariffs.

3. **Supports Regional Integration**:  
   Encourages trade among Commonwealth Caribbean nations by allowing goods from one CCC country to be treated as originating in another, provided they meet origin criteria.

4. **Prevents Abuse**:  
   Restrictions on reprocessing, further manufacturing, or removal from customs control prevent fraud or manipulation of origin.

5. **Aligns with International Standards**:  
   Uses the Harmonized System (HS) for classification, ensuring consistency with global trade practices.

### **Conclusion**

The *Commonwealth Caribbean Countries Tariff Rules of Origin Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 36) provide a **comprehensive, structured, and practical framework** for determining whether goods from Commonwealth Caribbean countries qualify for preferential tariff treatment under Canadian trade policy.

By combining **natural origin criteria**, a **value threshold (40%)**, **specific rules for apparel and textiles**, and **clear rules on transport and grouping**, the regulations ensure that only genuinely origin-based goods receive benefits — promoting fair trade, regional economic development, and compliance with international customs standards.

These rules remain a foundational part of Canada’s trade policy with the Caribbean region, though they may be reviewed or updated in light of evolving trade relationships and regional agreements.
