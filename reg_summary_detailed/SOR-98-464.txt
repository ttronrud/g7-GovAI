**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Prescribing Antique Firearms (S.C. 1995, c. 39, s. 139)**

---

### **Overview**

The regulation titled *Regulations Prescribing Antique Firearms* was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, under specific provisions of the *Criminal Code of Canada*. It was enacted pursuant to:

- **Subsection 84(1)** of the *Criminal Code*, which defines the term *antique firearm*;
- **Subsection 117.15(1)a**, which provides the legal authority to prescribe the types of firearms classified as antique for regulatory purposes.

These regulations formally define and list specific firearms that qualify as *antique firearms* under Canadian law, thereby allowing for certain exemptions or special treatment in terms of licensing, possession, and transfer—particularly in relation to the strict controls on modern firearms.

The regulations came into force on **December 1, 1998**.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **identify and classify specific firearms as "antique"** for the purposes of the definition of *antique firearm* under subsection 84(1) of the *Criminal Code*. This classification enables certain firearms to be legally possessed, transferred, or stored under more lenient rules than modern firearms, provided they meet the defined criteria.

This classification is critical because:

- Antique firearms are generally **not subject to the same strict licensing and registration requirements** as modern firearms;
- They are **exempt from some of the restrictions** on use, ownership, and sale that apply to firearms manufactured after a certain date;
- They are **protected under the law as historical or cultural artifacts**, especially when they are preserved or used in heritage contexts.

### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

1. **Exemption from Modern Firearm Controls**  
   Firearms listed in this schedule are considered *antique* under the *Criminal Code*, which means they are generally **not subject to the same licensing, registration, and storage requirements** as modern firearms.

2. **Possession and Transfer**  
   Individuals may legally possess, transfer, or store these firearms without needing a modern firearm license, provided they are not used for hunting or dangerous purposes and are stored appropriately.

3. **Prohibited Modifications**  
   Any modification that converts an antique firearm into a modern firearm (e.g., adding a magazine, changing the barrel, or altering the trigger mechanism) may render it non-compliant with the regulation.

4. **Cultural and Historical Significance**  
   These regulations recognize the historical value of such firearms, supporting their role in museums, private collections, and heritage education.

5. **Enforcement and Compliance**  
   The regulations are enforced by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** and provincial/territorial authorities. Possession of a firearm not meeting the criteria may result in legal penalties if it is deemed a modern firearm under the *Criminal Code*.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No automatic exemption** for all pre-1898 firearms. Only those meeting the **specific criteria** (e.g., cartridge type, bore size, design) are included.
- **Post-1897 reproductions** of flintlock mechanisms are included only if they are **not handguns**.
- **Modern cartridges or gauges** are excluded regardless of age.
- **Repeating firearms** (e.g., rifles or shotguns with magazine feeds) are explicitly excluded from center-fire categories.

---

### **Conclusion**

These regulations provide a **clear, legally binding framework** for identifying which firearms qualify as *antique* under Canadian law. By defining specific types of pre-1898 firearms—particularly those limited to rim-fire cartridges, specific gauges, or non-repeating mechanisms—Canada ensures that historically significant firearms are protected from unnecessary regulation while maintaining public safety standards.

This balance between **historical preservation** and **
