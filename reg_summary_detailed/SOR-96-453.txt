**Detailed Summary of the Alternative Fuels Regulations (S.C. 1995, c. 20)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**

The Alternative Fuels Regulations are issued under **Section 6 of the Alternative Fuels Act** (*Act*). This section empowers the **President of the Treasury Board** to consult with relevant stakeholders—specifically industry representatives and environmental groups—before making regulatory decisions. Following this consultation process, the **Treasury Board** formally adopts the regulations on the recommendation of the President, pursuant to **paragraphs 6(a) and (b)** of the Act.

This procedural framework ensures that the regulations are developed with input from key interest groups, balancing economic, environmental, and technological considerations.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and classify what constitutes an "alternative fuel" and a "motor vehicle"** under the Alternative Fuels Act. By establishing clear, legally binding definitions, the regulations provide a consistent framework for:

- Determining eligibility for incentives or subsidies,
- Regulating fuel use and vehicle performance,
- Supporting the transition from conventional fossil fuels to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.

### **3. Definition of "Alternative Fuel"**

Under the regulations, the following are **prescribed as alternative fuels** when used as the **sole source of direct propulsion energy** in a motor vehicle:

- **Ethanol**  
- **Methanol**  
- **Propane gas** (also known as LPG – Liquefied Petroleum Gas)  
- **Natural gas** (including compressed natural gas – CNG and liquefied natural gas – LNG)  
- **Hydrogen**  
- **Electricity**

> ⚠️ *Note:* "Direct propulsion energy" means the fuel is directly used to power the vehicle’s engine or motor, not indirectly through a combustion system or auxiliary means.

Additionally, the regulations expand the definition to include **blended fuels**, depending on the context:

#### a) For subsections **4(1) and 5(1)** of the Act (e.g., fuel use in certain vehicle types or under specific conditions):
- Any **blended fuel** containing **at least 50%** of one of the fuels listed above (ethanol, methanol, propane, natural gas, hydrogen, or electricity) qualifies as an alternative fuel.

> Example: A blend of 60% ethanol and 40% gasoline would qualify as an alternative fuel under this provision because it contains at least 50% ethanol.

#### b) For subsections **4(2) and 5(2)** of the Act (e.g., fuel standards or vehicle certification):
- Any **blended fuel** containing **at least 10%** of one of the listed alternative fuels qualifies as an alternative fuel.

> Example: A blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline would qualify under this provision, as it contains 15% of an alternative fuel.

> 🔍 *Note:* These blended fuel definitions are context-specific and serve different regulatory or policy objectives (e.g., environmental benefits, infrastructure development, or market incentives).

### **4. Definition of "Motor Vehicle"**

The regulations define which types of vehicles are considered **motor vehicles** under the Act. These are:

- **Automobiles** (passenger cars)  
- **Passenger vans** (e.g., minivans, SUVs)  
- **Buses** (public or private transit vehicles)  
- **Light duty trucks** (e.g., pickup trucks, small cargo vehicles)  
- **Medium duty trucks** (e.g., delivery trucks, service vehicles with higher payload capacity)

> ✅ *Exclusions:* Heavy-duty trucks (e.g., long-haul freight trucks) or non-road vehicles (e.g., construction equipment) are **not included** in this definition unless otherwise specified in future amendments.

This classification ensures that fuel policies and incentives are targeted at vehicles commonly used in personal and public transportation, with a focus on reducing emissions and promoting cleaner technologies.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on **September 24, 1996**.

This date marks the official start of the legal application of the definitions and provisions outlined in the regulations, enabling enforcement, compliance, and implementation of related policies and programs.

---

### **6. Key Implications and Significance**

- **Environmental Policy Alignment**: The inclusion of hydrogen, electricity, and blended fuels supports Canada’s early efforts to promote cleaner transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Market Development**: By clearly defining alternative fuels, the regulations encourage investment in infrastructure (e.g., fueling stations, charging networks) and vehicle manufacturing.
- **Consumer Clarity**: The definitions help consumers and businesses understand which fuels qualify for government incentives, tax credits, or environmental labeling.
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: The inclusion of blended fuels allows for gradual adoption of alternative fuels, enabling a phased transition from conventional gasoline and diesel.

---

### **7. Legal Basis and Citation**

- **Statutory Authority**: Section 6 of the *Alternative Fuels Act*  
- **Regulatory Citation**: *S.C. 1995, c. 20* (Statutory Code 1995, Chapter 20)  
- **Effective Date**: September 24, 1996  

---

### **Conclusion**

The Alternative Fuels Regulations provide a foundational legal framework for defining **alternative fuels** and **motor vehicles** in Canada. By clearly specifying which fuels and vehicles qualify under the Act, the regulations support national strategies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, lower emissions, and foster innovation in clean transportation technologies. The inclusion of both pure and blended fuels, along with a broad range of vehicle types, ensures that the policy is both practical and adaptable to evolving technological and market conditions.

These regulations remain a key component in Canada’s broader environmental and energy transition agenda, particularly in the context of sustainable mobility and climate change mitigation.
