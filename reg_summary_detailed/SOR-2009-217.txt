**Detailed Summary of the CPFTA Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**. It is grounded in **subsection 49.5(9)a of the Customs Tariff** (a key provision of Canada’s tariff law), which enables the government to establish aggregate quantity limits for certain goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment under international trade agreements.

This specific regulation is part of the implementation framework of the **Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)**, and it is referenced in **Section 42 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2009, c. 16)**, which provides the legal mechanism for setting quantity limits on goods benefiting from the Peru Tariff.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish and enforce aggregate quantity limits** for certain sugar-related goods that are eligible for the **Peru Tariff** under the CPFTA. These limits are designed to:

- Prevent overuse or abuse of preferential tariff treatment;
- Ensure fair and equitable access to tariff benefits among Canadian exporters;
- Maintain the integrity of the trade agreement by preventing market distortion due to excessive or non-compliant imports.

**3. Scope of the Regulation**

The regulation applies to goods classified under the following **Harmonized System (HS) tariff item numbers**:

- **1701.91.10**  
- **1701.99.10**  
- **1702.90.21**  
- **1702.90.61**  
- **1702.90.70**  
- **1702.90.81**

These tariff items are all related to **sugar products**, including refined sugar, sugar syrups, and certain processed sugar items. The goods are specifically those that are **entitled to the Peru Tariff** under the CPFTA.

**4. Key Provisions**

- **Aggregate Quantity Limit**:  
  The total quantity of goods from the above tariff items that may be imported into Canada and benefit from the Peru Tariff during a given period is capped at the amount specified in **Column 2 of the Schedule** attached to the regulation.  
  This limit applies **collectively** across all the listed tariff items — meaning that the sum of all quantities of these sugar products imported under the Peru Tariff must not exceed the prescribed aggregate limit.

- **Period of Application**:  
  The quantity limit applies for the period specified in **Column 1 of the Schedule**.  
  The exact start and end dates are defined in the schedule and are typically aligned with the fiscal or trade cycle of the agreement (e.g., a calendar year or a specific trade period).

---

**5. Effective Date**

The regulation **comes into force on the day that Section 42 of the Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2009, c. 16) comes into force**.  
This date is generally the date of enactment or publication of the Act in the Canada Gazette, which is typically **August 1, 2009** — a date referenced in the note.

> **Note**: The regulation is cited as being in force as of **August 1, 2009**, and is referenced in **Supplemental Instrument SI/2009-67**, which confirms its official publication and enforcement.

---

**6. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Canadian customs authorities are responsible for enforcing the aggregate quantity limit.
- Importers must ensure that their shipments of the specified sugar products do not exceed the total aggregate limit for the applicable period.
- Exceeding the limit may result in the **non-eligibility** of goods for the Peru Tariff, potentially leading to higher duties or rejection of the claim for preferential treatment.

**7. Context and Significance**

This regulation is a **key component of the CPFTA’s safeguards**. While the agreement provides preferential tariff treatment (e.g., zero or reduced duties) to goods exported from Peru to Canada, it also includes **mechanisms to prevent over-reliance or market distortion**. Aggregate quantity limits ensure that Canada does not open its market to excessive volumes of sugar products from a single source, which could harm domestic producers or disrupt market balance.

**Conclusion**

It reflects a balance between promoting trade liberalization and preserving market stability.
