### Detailed Summary:

This sequence indicates that a particular provision of a prior regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2007 No. 69**, specifically under **Section 5** of that instrument.

- **SI/2007-69** is a statutory instrument enacted in 2007, which typically amends or repeals existing rules, regulations, or provisions within a legislative framework (e.g., in areas such as health, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures).
- The phrase **"Repealed, SI/2007-69, s. 5"** means that the specific regulation or section in question was formally removed from law by Section 5 of that instrument.
- The repetition of this phrase five times suggests that **multiple provisions or sections** were repealed by the same section (Section 5) of SI 2007/69 — possibly due to a list or error in formatting, or because the original regulation contained several clauses that were all targeted for repeal.

### Key Points:
- **No substantive content** of the original regulation is provided — only the notice of its repeal.
- The regulation itself is **no longer in force** as of the date of SI 2007/69.
- The repeal likely occurred to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated or redundant rules with updated legislation.
- The specific subject matter of the repealed regulation is not specified in the given text, so further context (such as the parent act or regulatory area — e.g., workplace safety, licensing, environmental protection) would be required to determine the exact nature of the repealed provision.

### Conclusion:
The provided text does not contain a detailed summary of a regulation, but rather a **repeal notice** indicating that certain provisions were removed by Statutory Instrument 2007 No. 69, Section 5. Without additional context (such as the name of the original regulation or the parent statute), a detailed summary of the content of the repealed regulation cannot be provided. The information confirms only that the regulation is **repealed and no longer applicable**.

👉 To obtain a detailed summary of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original legislation (e.g., the parent act) and the full text of SI 2007/69, particularly Section 5.
