**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Grapes-for-Processing Order**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Ontario Grapes-for-Processing Order** and may be cited as such. It is a statutory instrument under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (Loi).

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The Order provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi). This is the primary legislation that establishes the legal framework for regulating the marketing of farm products, including grapes.

- **Board**: Refers to the **Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario** (Régie). This body is established under the Act and has broad regulatory authority over the marketing of farm products, including grapes.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the **Ontario Grape Growers’ Marketing Board** (Office de commercialisation). This is a specialized body within the broader framework of the Act, focused specifically on grape marketing.

- **Grapes**: Defined as grapes produced in Ontario, **excluding those used for purposes other than processing** (such as table grapes or fresh consumption). The term specifically includes grapes intended for **processing into products like raisins, juice, wine, spirits, or beverages**.

- **Plan**: Refers to any marketing plan for grapes established and amended over time under the authority of the Act. The Plan governs pricing, marketing, and distribution strategies for grapes in Ontario.

- **Processing**: Defined broadly to include:
  - Manufacturing grape products or juice,
  - Producing beverages, spirits, or wine,
  - Activities such as bottling, distilling, fermenting (with sugar or sulfur dioxide), or using other chemicals.
  This term encompasses the transformation of raw grapes into marketable processed goods.

- **Processor**: A person who engages in the business of processing grapes. This includes wineries, juice producers, and other entities involved in converting grapes into finished products.

### **3. Regulatory Authority of the Board and Commodity Board**

Both the **Farm Products Marketing Board (Board)** and the **Ontario Grape Growers’ Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** are authorized to regulate the marketing of grapes in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between Ontario and other Canadian provinces),
- **Export trade** (sales outside of Canada).

For these purposes, each body may exercise **all or any powers** that they would have in regulating grape marketing **within Ontario**, including powers related to pricing, classification, and enforcement — provided such powers are exercised over persons and property located within Ontario.

This ensures consistency in regulation whether grapes are being sold locally, provincially, or internationally.

### **4. Specific Powers of the Commodity Board (Relevant to Levies and Charges)**

A key provision of the Order grants the **Commodity Board** specific authority related to **levies and charges** on grape producers and marketers:

#### **a. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**
- The Commodity Board may:
  - Fix, impose, and collect **levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of grapes** within Ontario.
- These levies are intended to support the financial sustainability of the grape industry and may be used to:
  - Offset costs,
  - Cover losses,
  - Fund marketing or development initiatives.

#### **b. Classification of Producers into Groups**
- The Commodity Board has the power to **classify producers into different groups** (e.g., by size, type of operation, region, or production volume).
- Different **levies or charges** can be set for each group, allowing for equitable and differentiated financial contributions based on the scale or nature of production.

#### **c. Use of Levies and Charges**
- The collected levies may be used for:
  - Establishing **reserves** (funds set aside for future use),
  - Covering **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred during grape sales or disposal,
  - **Equalizing or adjusting** payments among grape producers.
- This mechanism helps ensure that producers who may have had poor market outcomes (e.g., due to low prices or supply surpluses) are compensated, while those with better sales outcomes may contribute more — promoting fairness and stability in the industry.

#### **d. Time Periods of Application**
- The Commodity Board may determine **specific time periods** during which levies or adjustments apply. This allows flexibility in response to market conditions, such as harvest cycles, supply fluctuations, or economic downturns.

### **5. Important Note on Revocation**

> **[Revoked, SOR/80-90]**

This section indicates that a **previous version** of the regulation (specifically, the authority granted to the Commodity Board under section 3 of the Act regarding interprovincial and export trade) was **revoked by the Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/80-90)**.

This means:
- The original version of the Commodity Board’s powers under section 3 (which may have included broader or different levy powers) is **no longer in effect**.
- The current version of the Order reflects a **revised, more limited, or updated authorization**, likely introduced to correct inconsistencies or reflect changes in policy or legislation.
- The current authority described above (for levies and charges) is the **current, active version** of the power, replacing the revoked provision.

---

### **6. Purpose and Implications**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- Provide a **structured and equitable system** for managing the marketing of Ontario-grown grapes, especially in interprovincial and export markets.
- Ensure that producers and processors are fairly compensated, especially during periods of market volatility.
- Create financial mechanisms (such as levies and reserves) to stabilize the industry and protect producers from economic shocks.
- Promote fair competition and long-term sustainability in the grape processing sector.
