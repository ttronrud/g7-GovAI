### **Scope of Remission**

The Order grants **remission of GST** (under Division II of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act*) for the following circumstances:

- **When**: The GST was paid or became payable **on or after September 23, 1992**.
- **To whom**: A **band listed in the Schedule** (Column I).
- **For what**: The **value of consideration paid or payable** for the purchase of:
  - Land (real property), up to a specified number of acres (as set out in Column II of the Schedule);
  - Any **tangible personal property** located on the land at the time of purchase;
  - All **associated costs** related to the purchase (e.g., legal fees, surveying, administrative costs).

> ✅ **Important**: The remission applies **only if** the land purchase is made **pursuant to a specific agreement**.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to **three key conditions**:

1. **No Prior Rebate, Refund, or Remission**  
   The band must not have previously received:
   - A GST rebate,
   - A refund, or
   - A remission of GST  
   under the *Excise Tax Act* or the *Financial Administration Act* in respect of the same transaction.

2. **No Input Tax Credit (ITC) Claim**  
   The band **must not be entitled** to claim an **input tax credit** under Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* for the GST involved in the purchase.  
   - This means the GST paid on the purchase is not recoverable as a business expense by the band.

3. **Application Requirement**  
   A **written application** must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **four years** of the date the tax was paid or became payable.  
   - Failure to submit such an application within this timeframe will result in the loss of eligibility for remission.

### **Purpose and Public Interest Justification**

The Order is rooted in **historical justice and reconciliation**:
- Treaty land entitlements are a key component of Indigenous rights under Canadian law.
- Many First Nations bands have long-standing claims to land based on historical treaties, particularly those from the 1800s.
- The remission of GST on land purchases made under these agreements helps reduce financial barriers and supports the economic self-sufficiency of these communities.

By removing the GST burden on land purchases made under formal, negotiated settlement agreements, the Order:
- Recognizes the **legitimacy of treaty rights**,
- Supports **economic development** of Indigenous communities,
- Promotes **fairness and equity** in tax treatment for land transactions tied to historical agreements.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Limited to specific bands** | Only bands listed in the Schedule are eligible. This ensures targeted and accountable application. |
| **Limited to land purchases after September 23, 1992** | Reflects the date when formal settlement processes began. |
| **Cap on acreage** | The number of acres eligible for remission is capped per band, as specified in the Schedule. This prevents unlimited tax relief. |
| **No input tax credit** | The band cannot claim GST credits for purchases made under this remission — emphasizing that the tax is being waived, not just offset. |
| **Time-bound application** | Encourages timely action and ensures accountability in administrative processes. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Treaty Land Entitlement (Saskatchewan) Remission Order** is a significant policy instrument that balances **fiscal responsibility** with **social and historical justice**. It provides a formal, legally grounded mechanism to relieve certain Indigenous bands in Saskatchewan from GST obligations incurred on land purchases made under treaty land entitlement settlements.

This Order reflects a broader government commitment to:
- Recognizing Indigenous rights and treaty obligations,
- Supporting self-determination and economic development in First Nations communities,
- Ensuring that tax policy does not unfairly penalize communities engaged in land-based economic development through historical agreements.

It stands as a notable example of how tax policy can be used as a tool for reconciliation and equity in Canada’s relationship with Indigenous peoples.
