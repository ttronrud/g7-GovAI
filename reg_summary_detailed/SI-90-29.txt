The reference "[Repealed, SI/2017-7]" indicates that the regulation in question has been formally repealed by a Statutory Instrument (SI) numbered SI/2017-7, issued in 2017.

However, **no specific regulation is named or described** in your query beyond the repealing reference. As a result, a detailed summary cannot be provided because:

- The actual regulation being repealed is not identified (e.g., it may have been a rule under a specific act, such as the Health and Safety at Work Act, or a sector-specific regulation).
- Without knowing the original regulation’s title, purpose, scope, or content, it is not possible to summarize its provisions or implications.
- The notation "Repealed, SI/2017-7" only confirms that the regulation was formally abolished or replaced by legislation, not what it was or what it did.

### What SI/2017-7 Typically Indicates:
Statutory Instruments (SIs) like SI/2017-7 are used in the UK (and similar jurisdictions) to make secondary legislation. When a regulation is "repealed" by an SI, it means:
- The regulation was no longer in force after the date of the SI's coming into effect.
- The repeal may be part of a broader legislative review, consolidation, or modernization effort.
- The repeal may be due to redundancy, inconsistency with newer laws, or inefficiency.

### Next Steps for a Detailed Summary:
To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
1. The full title of the regulation being repealed (e.g., "The Motor Vehicle (Driving Licences) Regulations 2015").
2. The primary legislation it was made under (e.g., the Road Traffic Act 1988).
3. The date it came into force.
4. Its key provisions (e.g., licensing requirements, safety standards, reporting obligations).
5. The reason for its repeal (e.g., redundancy, merger with another regulation, or alignment with new policy).

### Conclusion:
**There is currently insufficient information to provide a detailed summary of the regulation referenced as "[Repealed, SI/2017-7]."**  
To proceed, please provide the full title or subject matter of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2017-7.

If you have a specific regulation in mind (e.g., related to employment, health, transport, or environment), please clarify so I can assist with a detailed summary.
