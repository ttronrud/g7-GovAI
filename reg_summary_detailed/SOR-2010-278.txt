|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Export and Import Permits Act* |
| **Exported** | As defined in section 6.4 of the Act (exported to the U.S.) |
| **Manitoba quantity** | Monthly export limit from Manitoba to the U.S. |
| **Ontario quantity** | Monthly export limit from Ontario to the U.S. |
| **Ontario/Quebec/Manitoba/Saskatchewan quantity** | Monthly export limits from each province |

### ⏳ **4. Key Deadlines and Procedures**

#### ✅ **Relinquishment of Export Allocation**
- Any **primary producer or remanufacturer** wishing to **give up their 2011 export allocation** must **notify the Minister in writing by December 10, 2010**.
- This relinquishment is **binding** and results in the loss of their allocated volume.

#### ✅ **Transfers of Export Allocations**
A primary producer or remanufacturer may **transfer a portion** of their monthly export allocation to another entity **only with Ministerial consent** under subsection 6.3(4) of the EIPA.  
The transfer is considered **included in the original producer’s export volume** if:
1. The transferred portion includes a **corresponding volume of actual products**, or  
2. The **non-product volume** (i.e., non-physical transfer) does **not exceed 15%** of the original allocation.

> This ensures that only **real, physical product exports** are counted in the allocation system.

### 📊 **5. Allocation Methodology by Province**

#### 🔹 **Ontario Quantity Allocation**

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Ontario quantity}}{\text{Total historical exports (Ontario)}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s historical exports}
\]

- **Numerator**: The volume of the producer’s products exported from Ontario during the reference period.
- **Denominator**: Total volume of all primary producers and remanufacturers' exports from Ontario during the reference period, **excluding those who relinquished** their 2011 allocations.

**Remainder Allocation:**
- After initial allocations are made, any **remaining Ontario quantity** is distributed **in order of application receipt**.
- Each applicant receives the amount they requested **until the remainder is fully allocated**.
- **Rule**: An applicant must **exhaust their initial allocation** before applying for the remainder.

---

#### 🔹 **Quebec Quantity Allocation**

The Quebec allocation is **more complex**, involving **two pathways** depending on the applicant’s history and type.

##### 🚩 **For Remanufacturers**
- If a remanufacturer exported products from Quebec during the reference period, it may only receive an allocation based on **its historical export volume**.

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Quebec quantity}}{\text{Total historical exports from Quebec (excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Remanufacturer’s historical exports}
\]

> The **sum of all remanufacturers’ allocations must be ≥ 10% of the Quebec quantity** to meet a **minimum reserve threshold**.

##### 🚩 **For Primary Producers**

There are **two possible allocation methods**, depending on the producer’s past behavior:

1. **Based on Historic Export Volume (if they exported to the U.S.)**
   - Formula:
     \[
     \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume exported from Quebec}}{\text{Total volume exported from Quebec (excluding relinquished)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec quantity}
     \]
   - Requires proof of past exports to the U.S.

2. **Based on Historic Production Volume (if no exports to U.S.)**
   - Formula:
     \[
     \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Production volume (2007–2009)}}{\text{Total production volume (2007–2009) by qualifying producers}} \right) \times \text{Reserve pool}
     \]
   - Applies only if the producer **had no exports** to the U.S. during the reference period.
   - **Maximum allocation**: **No more than 40%** of the producer’s **average monthly production** (2007–2009).

##### 📌 **Reserve Pool Mechanism**
- The reserve pool ensures that **at least 10% of the Quebec quantity** is allocated to primary producers (via production-based allocation).
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Reserve Pool} = \text{Quebec quantity} - \left( \text{Total remanufacturer allocations} + \text{Allocations to primary producers based on export volume} \right)
  \]
- If the sum of remanufacturer allocations is **less than 10%**, the **gap is filled** by allocating from the reserve pool.
- The reserve pool is **then distributed** among primary producers based on their **production volume (2007–2009)**.

##### 📌 **Residual Non-Allocated Quantity**
- Any leftover in the reserve pool after all primary producers are allocated is **not distributed**.
- Formula:
  \[
  \text{Residual} = \text{Reserve Pool} - \text{Total allocated to primary producers}
  \]

> This ensures that the **10% minimum** is met and that no over-allocation occurs.

---

#### 🔹 **Manitoba Quantity Allocation**

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Manitoba quantity}}{\text{Total historical exports from Manitoba}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s historical exports}
\]

- Based on **historical export volume** during the reference period.
- Excludes producers who relinquished their allocations.

**Remainder Allocation:**
- Distributed **in order of application receipt**.
- Applicants must **exhaust their initial allocation** before applying for the remainder.

---

#### 🔹 **Saskatchewan Quantity Allocation**

**Formula:**
\[
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Saskatchewan quantity}}{\text{Total historical exports from Saskatchewan}} \right) \times \text{Producer’s historical exports}
\]

- Same structure as Manitoba.
- Excludes relinquished allocations.
- Remainder allocated **in order of application receipt**.
- Applicants must **exhaust initial allocation** before applying for remainder.

### 📝 **6. Key Principles and Rules**

| Principle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Transparency** | All allocations are based on **historical data** from the reference period (2007–2010). |
| **Equity** | Producers with a history of exports receive allocations proportional to their past performance. |
| **Fairness** | Producers with no U.S. export history may still qualify based on **production
