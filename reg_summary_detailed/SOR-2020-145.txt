### **Detailed Summary of the *Standards for Work-Integrated Learning Activities Regulations***

---

#### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**

The *Standards for Work-Integrated Learning Activities Regulations* were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, under specific provisions of the **Canada Labour Code (Act)**:

- **Paragraphs 264(1)(a.1)a, (a.3)b, (a.4)b**, and **(i.1)c**
- **Subsection 264(2)d**

These provisions authorize the regulation of work-integrated learning (WIL) activities for students enrolled in post-secondary or vocational programs, ensuring that such activities are conducted under labor standards that protect the rights and well-being of students while supporting their educational development.

The regulation was originally introduced in **S.C. 2015, c. 36, s. 92(1)** and later amended in **S.C. 2017, c. 33, s. 218**. It is part of the broader framework of the *Canada Labour Code* (R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2), which governs labor relations, working conditions, and employment rights across Canada.

#### **2. Definition of "Educational Institutions"**

For the purposes of **subsection 167(1.2)** of the Canada Labour Code, the following institutions are considered eligible for providing work-integrated learning activities:

1. **Post-secondary or vocational schools** listed in the **Directory of Educational Institutions in Canada**, maintained by the **Council of Ministers of Education** via the **Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials (CICIC)**.
2. **Secondary educational institutions** that meet provincial requirements for delivering education in their jurisdiction.
3. **Post-secondary or vocational institutions administered by a federal department or agency**.
4. **Secondary or post-secondary institutions located outside Canada**, provided they meet the legal requirements for education delivery in their jurisdiction.

> This broad definition ensures international and federal access to WIL opportunities, supporting both domestic and cross-border educational programs.

#### **3. Pre-Activity Requirements: Documentation Submission**

Before a student begins performing work-integrated learning activities, they must submit to the **employer** a set of documents issued by their educational institution or vocational school. These documents must contain:

- The student’s **full name**
- The **name, address**, and **program name** of the educational institution or vocational school
- The **name and address** of the employer
- A **description of the activities** being performed (how they fulfill program requirements)
- The **start and end dates** of the activities, or the **total number of hours** to be performed
- The **name, job title, phone number, and email address** of a designated staff member from the institution involved in program administration

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and alignment between the educational program and the work experience.

#### **4. Employer Recordkeeping Obligations**

Employers must maintain a **detailed record** of all aspects of the student’s participation in WIL activities for a period of **36 months after the activities cease**.

The record must include:
