**Regulation Summary:**

**Regulation Title:** Authorization for the Minister of Transport to Prescribe Charges for Pleasure Craft Plate Issuance and Compliance Notices  
**Source:** S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6 (Statutory Citation)  
**Governing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**Recommendation Basis:** Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board  
**Legal Authority:** Paragraph 19(1)(b) of the *Financial Administration Act*  

---

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

This regulation authorizes the Minister of Transport to issue orders that establish specific charges to be collected from owners or operators of pleasure craft (such as motorboats, personal watercraft, and other non-commercial recreational vessels) under the following conditions:

1. **For the issuance of plates (license plates)** to pleasure craft, based on:
   - The **recommended safe limits of engine power**  
   - The **recommended gross load capacity**  

2. **For the issuance of compliance notices** related to:
   - Adherence to **construction standards** (e.g., safety, structural integrity, materials, and design requirements for vessels)

---

**Key Elements Explained:**

- **"Pleasure craft"** refers to recreational vessels used for personal or non-commercial purposes, not commercial or commercial-like operations (e.g., fishing boats used for income, or cargo transport).

- **"Recommended safe limits of engine power and gross load capacity"**:
  - These are technical thresholds established by the Minister of Transport (often in consultation with safety experts, marine engineers, or standards bodies) to ensure that vessels remain safe for operation.
  - Vessels exceeding these limits may be subject to higher fees or restrictions to prevent risks such as instability, overloading, or unsafe maneuvering.

- **"Charges to be paid"**:
  - The regulation gives the Minister the power to set fees for:
    - Applying for and receiving license plates (a regulatory requirement for legal operation on waterways).
    - Receiving notices that inform owners or operators about compliance with construction standards (e.g., if a vessel fails to meet safety requirements).

- **"Prescribe by order"**:
  - The Minister of Transport is not required to set these charges through legislation but can issue a formal *regulatory order* (a government rule) that specifies:
    - The exact amount of the fee.
    - The conditions under which the fee applies (e.g., based on engine horsepower or gross tonnage).
    - The types of vessels affected.

- **Legal Basis – Paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act**:
  - This provision allows federal departments and agencies to establish and collect fees for services or regulatory purposes, provided they are reasonable, transparent, and related to the service or activity being regulated.
  - It ensures that the fees are properly authorized and accountable, and that the revenue supports the regulatory function (e.g., safety enforcement, vessel oversight).

---

**Implications and Objectives:**

- **Revenue Generation**: The fees help fund the administration of vessel registration, safety inspections, and enforcement of standards.
- **Safety Promotion**: By linking fees to safe engine power and load capacity, the regulation incentivizes operators to maintain vessels within safe operational limits, reducing risks of accidents or environmental harm.
- **Compliance Enforcement**: The requirement to issue compliance notices ensures that vessels built or modified to meet (or fail to meet) construction standards are properly monitored and regulated.
- **Administrative Flexibility**: The Minister of Transport can adapt the fees and rules as technology, safety standards, or vessel usage evolve, without needing to amend primary legislation.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation grants the Minister of Transport the authority to establish a fee-based system for pleasure craft registration and compliance monitoring. It is designed to promote vessel safety by tying registration fees to engine power and load capacity, and to ensure that all pleasure craft meet minimum construction and safety standards. The power is exercised under a clear legal framework (the Financial Administration Act), ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment with public safety objectives.

**Note:** While the regulation itself is silent on the actual fee amounts, the Minister of Transport would issue a subsequent *regulatory order* (e.g., under the same statute) to specify the exact charges, which would then be published and enforceable.
