**Detailed Summary of the Controlled Goods Regulations (S.C. 2000, c. 31, s. 5)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Controlled Goods Regulations*, made under **Section 43a of the Defence Production Act**, establish a regulatory framework governing the **examination, possession, and transfer of "controlled goods"** in Canada. These goods are typically items of strategic importance—such as defense-related equipment, dual-use technologies, or sensitive materials—that could pose national security risks if transferred to unauthorized individuals or entities.

The regulations aim to:
- Prevent unauthorized or illicit transfers of controlled goods,
- Ensure that only individuals and organizations with appropriate security screening and oversight can access such goods,
- Maintain transparency and accountability through mandatory record-keeping and reporting,
- Provide exemptions for certain categories of individuals (e.g., temporary workers, international students, U.S. government personnel) who act in good faith and under specific conditions.
