Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Finance to the Minister of Industry**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, specifically **paragraph 2(a)** of that Act. This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the authority to transfer certain powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers.

This transfer is not a new legislative creation but a reorganization of existing responsibilities within the Canadian federal government's public service structure.

---

#### **2. Scope of Transfer**

The transfer includes **all powers, duties, and functions** previously held by the **Minister of Finance** and now being transferred to the **Minister of Industry**. These functions are specifically defined in two Orders in Council:

- **Order in Council P.C. 1993-1907**, dated **November 4, 1993**  
  This order established the initial framework for the responsibilities associated with economic development and regional support, particularly in relation to the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.

- **Order in Council P.C. 1995-537**, dated **March 29, 1995**  
  This order further refined and expanded the duties related to regional economic development, especially in Quebec, reinforcing the role of the agency in supporting regional growth and competitiveness.

These two Orders collectively define the specific functions and authorities that are being transferred.

#### **3. Transfer of Control and Supervision**

In addition to the powers, duties, and functions, the regulation explicitly transfers:

> **"The control and supervision of that portion of the public service known as the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec."**

This means that the **Minister of Industry** now assumes full responsibility for:

- The **management, oversight, and operational control** of the Economic Development Agency of Canada (EDAC) as it applies to the **regions of Quebec**.
- Decision-making authority over programs, funding allocations, performance monitoring, and strategic direction related to regional economic development in Quebec.

This includes the ability to direct policy, approve initiatives, and ensure accountability in how the agency supports economic development in Quebec’s regions.

---

#### **4. Implications and Context**

- **Shift in Responsibility**: This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of federal responsibilities, placing regional economic development—particularly in Quebec—under the purview of the **Minister of Industry**, which is traditionally responsible for promoting industrial growth, innovation, and regional competitiveness.
  
- **Rationale**: The move likely aims to:
  - Improve coordination between economic development and industrial policy.
  - Strengthen targeted support for regional economies, especially in Quebec, where economic development is a key policy priority.
  - Align public service functions with broader economic and industrial objectives.

- **Historical Background**: The Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec was established to support economic growth in underdeveloped or disadvantaged regions of Quebec. Its transfer to the Ministry of Industry signals a move toward integrating regional development into broader industrial policy frameworks.

#### **5. Regulatory References (S.I. Numbers)**

The regulation is supported by two statutory instruments (S.I.) that define the original scope of the transferred functions:

- **S.I. 93-206** (November 4, 1993): Establishes the initial duties and functions of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.
- **S.I. 95-49** (March 29, 1995): Updates and expands those functions, particularly in terms of regional development policy and implementation.

These instruments are referenced as the legal basis for the transfer of powers and responsibilities.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally transfers key responsibilities—specifically those related to regional economic development in Quebec—from the **Minister of Finance** to the **Minister of Industry**. It includes all powers, duties, and functions defined in two Orders in Council (P.C. 1993-1907 and P.C. 1995-537), as well as full control and supervision of the **Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec**.

This reallocation strengthens the Minister of Industry’s role in promoting regional economic growth and reflects a broader governmental strategy to align financial and industrial policy with regional development goals.
