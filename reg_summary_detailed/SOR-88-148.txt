### **Detailed Summary of the Toronto/Buttonville Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**
The **Toronto/Buttonville Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Minister of Transport to adopt zoning regulations for airports to ensure safety, minimize hazards to aircraft operations, and protect airspace integrity. 

Prior to the final adoption of these regulations, a **proposed version** was published in:
- Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* (June 13 and 20, 1987),
- Two successive issues of the *Richmond Hill Liberal* and *Markham Economist* (June 17 and 24, 1987),
- Two successive issues of *L’Express de Toronto* (June 16 and 23, 1987).

This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, community groups, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations or objections to the Minister of Transport. Based on this public consultation, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, formally adopted the regulations.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**
- **Title:** *Toronto/Buttonville Airport Zoning Regulations*
- **Applicability:** Applies to all lands—including public road allowances—adjacent to or in the vicinity of the Toronto/Buttonville Airport.
- **Jurisdiction:** The airport is located in the **Regional Municipality of York, Province of Ontario**, specifically in **Markham**.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Toronto/Buttonville Airport at Markham, in the Regional Municipality of York, Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point used as a datum for elevation measurements. Located 45.0 meters northeasterly at right angles from a point 485.0 meters southeasterly along the runway centerline from the northwesterly end of runway 15–33. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for runways 03–21 and 15–33). Designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility and unobstructed paths during landing approaches. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary surface at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, except where this would be less than 9 meters above ground level—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. This surface defines the upper limit for all structures and natural growth. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area of the airport, including the runway, designated for take-off and landing in a specific direction. Two strips are defined: one for runways 03–21 (60 m wide, 837.93 m long), and one for runways 15–33 (150 m wide, 1,176.19 m long). |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a 1:7 ratio (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. |

---

#### **4. Elevation Datum**
- The **assigned elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **193 meters above sea level**.
- All other elevation references (approach surfaces, outer surface) are measured relative to this point.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities – Structural and Natural Growth Restrictions**

##### **(a) Construction and Development Restrictions**
No person may:
- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object**,
- Or make any **addition to an existing building, structure, or object**,
on any land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

1. The **approach surface** (for each runway end),
2. The **outer surface**, or
3. The **transitional surface**.

> ⚠️ *This applies to all structures, including towers, antennas, trees, or buildings.*

##### **(b) Management of Natural Growth**
If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces:
- The **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This ensures that natural features do not create visual obstructions or hazards during flight operations.

##### **(c) Waste Disposal Restrictions**
No owner or occupier may:
- Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> 🐦 *This is a critical safety measure to prevent bird strikes, which can cause serious damage to aircraft.*

#### **6. Description of Key Features (Based on Zoning Plan No. 19-036-84-05, May 30, 1986)**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (by runway)**
Each approach surface is a **conical-shaped inclined plane** with a specified slope and horizontal distance from the runway end:

| Runway | Slope | Horizontal Distance from End | Height of Top Line | Width of Top Line |
|--------|-------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 03 | 1:30 (1m vert / 30m horiz) | 1,446 m | 48.2 m above end | 174.6 m from centerline |
| 15 | 1:40 | 1,724 m | 43.1 m above end | 333.6 m from centerline |
| 21 | 1:30 | 1,203 m | 40.1 m above end | 150.3 m from centerline |
| 33 | 1:40 | 1,768 m | 44.2 m above end | 340.2 m from centerline |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during approach and landing by preventing obstructions in the critical approach zone.

##### **B. Outer Surface**
- Located at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (193 m AGL)**.
- If this elevation would place the outer surface **below 9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to ensure safety and practicality.

> This defines the maximum allowable height for all structures and vegetation across the entire airport perimeter.

##### **C. Strips**
- **Runway 03–21 Strip**:
  - Width: 60 meters (30 m on each side of centerline)
  - Length: 837.93 meters
- **Runway 15–33 Strip**:
  - Width: 150 meters (75 m on each side)
  - Length: 1,176.19 meters

> These define the active areas where aircraft take off and land.

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges** of the strips and approach surfaces.
- Intersect with the **outer surface** or with the transitional surface of an adjacent strip.

> These surfaces provide a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer zone, preventing sharp elevation changes that could interfere with aircraft navigation.

#### **7. Boundary of Regulated Lands**
The regulated area is defined by a detailed, precise boundary description based on **property lines, road allowances, and registered land plans**. The boundary follows a complex path through several lots and concessions in Markham, including:

- From **Lot 23, Concession 2** (Richmond Hill border)
- Across road allowances between Concessions 2–3, 3–4, 4–5
- Along property lines of Lots 22, 21, 20, 17, 16, 15, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 2
- Along major roads: **Cachet Parkway, Village Parkway, Willowbrook Road**
- Includes key reference points tied to registered land plans:
  - **Plan 5316** (Lot 1 boundary)
  - **Plan M-1714** (Block C)
  - **Plan M-1440, M-1475, M-1751, M-1755, M-1762, Plan 7566**

> The boundary ensures that only land within a defined, safe perimeter is subject to height restrictions.

#### **8. Purpose and Safety Objectives**
These regulations are designed to:
- Prevent **visual obstructions** during aircraft takeoff and landing.
- Minimize the risk of **bird strikes** by restricting waste disposal near the airport.
- Ensure **airfield safety and operational efficiency** by maintaining clear flight paths.
- Provide a **clear, enforceable framework** for land use around the airport.

---

#### **9. Enforcement and Authority**
- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require
