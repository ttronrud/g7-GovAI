**Detailed Summary of the Private Buoy Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
The *Private Buoy Regulations* are established by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of two federal ministers:
- The **Minister of Transport**
- The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**

This action is authorized under **Sections 519 and 562a of the Canada Shipping Act**, which provide the legal basis for regulating aids to navigation, including private buoys.

These regulations are published under **R.S., c. 6 (3rd Supp.), s. 77** — a section of the *Statutes of Canada* that designates the regulatory framework for private aids to navigation.

---

### **2. Definition of "Private Buoy"**
A **private buoy** is defined as:
- Any buoy that is **not owned** by:
  - The federal government  
  - A provincial government  
  - A government agency  

> **Exemption**: Private buoys used solely to **mark fishing gear** are **excluded** from these regulations.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all private buoys** placed in **Canadian waters**, **except** those used to mark fishing gear.

---

### **4. Prohibition on Placement of Unsafe or Misleading Buoys**
**No person may place a private buoy in Canadian waters if it:**
- Interferes with or is likely to interfere with the navigation of any vessel, or  
- Misleads or is likely to mislead the operator of any vessel.

This provision ensures that private buoys do not create hazards or confusion for mariners, especially in busy or complex maritime areas.

---

### **5. Requirements for Placement of a Private Buoy**
Before placing a private buoy in Canadian waters, the following conditions must be met:

#### **(a) Minimum Size Requirements**
- The portion of the buoy visible above water must be:
  - At least **15.25 cm (6 inches) wide**
  - At least **30.5 cm (12 inches) high**

> This ensures the buoy is large enough to be clearly visible and recognized at a distance.

#### **(b) "PRIV" Marking Requirements**
The buoy must display the capital letters **"PRIV"** on opposite sides, with the following specifications:
- Size: As large as is **practical** given the buoy’s size
- Colour:
  - **White** when the background is red, green, or black  
  - **Black** when the background is white or yellow  
> This ensures the marking is highly visible and immediately recognizable as a *private* buoy, distinguishing it from official government aids.

#### **(c) Compliance with Canadian Aids to Navigation Standards**
The buoy must comply with the requirements of:
- **Canadian Aids to Navigation (TP 968)**, published by the Canadian Coast Guard in 1995 and **as amended from time to time**.

This standard ensures the buoy meets technical, structural, and durability requirements for safety and visibility in marine environments.

#### **(d) Owner Information Display**
The buoy must display, in a **conspicuous, permanent, and legible** manner:
- The **name**
- The **address**
- The **telephone number** of the owner

> This allows mariners to contact the owner in case of emergency or to report issues, enhancing accountability and safety.

#### **(e) Construction and Maintenance Standards**
- The buoy must be **constructed and maintained** in a way that:
  - Keeps it in **position** (does not drift or shift)
  - Maintains its **specified characteristics** (size, shape, marking, visibility)

#### **(f) Anchor Requirements**
- The buoy’s **anchor** must be:
  - Constructed and maintained in a manner that ensures it remains in position  
> This prevents the buoy from drifting or being lost due to strong currents or wind.

---

### **6. Responsibility of the Owner**
The **owner** of a private buoy is responsible for:
- Ensuring that the **name, address, and telephone number** displayed on the buoy are **accurate and up-to-date at all times**  
> This obligation emphasizes accountability and real-time accessibility of information to the public.

---

### **7. Modifications by the Minister of Transport**
If there is a **safety concern** — such as the need for **increased visibility** or better identification to prevent accidents — the **Minister of Transport** may issue an order requiring the owner to:
- Modify the buoy according to the requirements in the:
  - **Procedures Manual for Design and Review of Short-range Aids to Navigation Systems (TP 9677)**  
  - Published by the Canadian Coast Guard in March 1989 and **as amended from time to time**

> This allows for adaptive regulation based on evolving safety needs, such as in areas with high vessel traffic or poor visibility.

---

### **8. Lighting Requirements**
- **No private buoy may have a light** unless:
  - The light remains **lit throughout the night**  
  - The light meets the requirements specified in **paragraph 4(1)(c)** (i.e., as defined in TP 968)

> This ensures that any illuminated private buoy provides consistent, safe, and reliable lighting for navigation.

---

### **9. Authority to Remove Non-Compliant Buoys**
The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
- **Remove** a private buoy from Canadian waters if it does not comply with these regulations

> This enforcement power ensures that unsafe or non-compliant buoys are promptly addressed to protect maritime safety.

---

### **10. Repeal Clause**
The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior conflicting or outdated rules are superseded by these new regulations.

---

### **11. Effective Date**
These regulations come into force on the **date of registration** with the federal government.

## **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mariner Safety** | Prevents confusion, interference, and accidents by ensuring private buoys are clearly identifiable and non-hazardous. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires owners to provide contact information, enabling emergency response and public oversight. |
| **Standardization** | Aligns private buoys with national aids-to-navigation standards (TP 968), ensuring consistency with official systems. |
| **Enforcement** | Gives the Minister of Transport clear authority to inspect, modify, or remove non-compliant buoys. |
| **Flexibility** | Allows for safety-based modifications when needed, balancing private use with public safety. |

---

## **Summary in Plain Language**
Private buoys — those not owned by governments or agencies — must meet strict safety and visibility standards when placed in Canadian waters. They must be large enough, clearly marked with "PRIV," and display the owner’s name, address, and phone number. They must not interfere with navigation or mislead mariners. If safety concerns arise, the government can require modifications. Any light on a private buoy must stay on all night. The government can remove unsafe buoys, and all rules take effect upon registration.

**Note**: These regulations are designed to protect the safety of all vessels and ensure that private users do not inadvertently create hazards on Canadian waters. They emphasize **clarity, visibility, and accountability** while allowing private individuals to use buoys responsibly.
