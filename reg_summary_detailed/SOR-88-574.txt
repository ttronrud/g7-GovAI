### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

This regulation is an **Order in Council** made under **Section 3* of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act***.

### **Core Provisions and Legal Effects**

#### 1. **Corporate Legal Capacity**
- Both the **Agency** and the **Institute** are granted **bodily corporate status** in Canada.  
- This means they can legally enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, and conduct business activities in Canada as independent legal entities.

---

#### 2. **Privileges and Immunities for the Agency**
- The Agency enjoys the **full privileges and immunities** set out in **Articles II and III of the UN Convention**.
- These include:
  - Immunity from legal process (except in cases of criminal acts unrelated to official duties).
  - Immunity from taxation.
  - Freedom to operate without interference.
- **Exception**: Local authorities may enter the Agency’s premises **only in the event of a fire** (i.e., no general right to enter for inspections or administrative purposes).

---

#### 3. **Privileges and Immunities for the Institute**
- The Institute is granted privileges and immunities **only to the extent** that such rights are **contained in the 1988 Agreement and its 1997 amendment**.
- This means the Institute does **not** automatically receive the full scope of UN Convention privileges; instead, its rights are **limited and defined** by the bilateral agreement between Canada and the Institute.

> ✅ This reflects a more limited, negotiated approach compared to the Agency, which benefits from broader international treaty rights.

---

#### 4. **Privileges and Immunities for Representatives**
- Representatives of Institute Members (delegates attending meetings) are granted the privileges and immunities under **Article IV of the UN Convention** during:
  - Their journey **to and from** Canada.
  - Their stay **in Canada** while attending meetings of the Agency or Institute.
- These include:
  - Immunity from arrest or detention.
  - Protection from legal process while performing official duties.
  - Exemption from certain taxes and customs duties.

---

#### 5. **Continuation of Immunity for Former Representatives**
- Even after a representative ceases to serve in an official capacity, they retain **immunity from legal process** for:
  - Words spoken or written
  - Acts performed in the course of their official duties
- This immunity **continues** as long as it is explicitly stated in **paragraph III(1)(a) of the Agreement**.

> 🔍 This is a significant protection for former officials, ensuring that past official conduct cannot be challenged in Canadian courts.

---

#### 6. **Taxation and Residence Status**
- For **taxation purposes**, any period during which a representative is present in Canada **to perform official duties** shall **not be counted as residence**.
- This means:
  - The representative is not subject to Canadian income tax during such periods.
  - They are not considered a resident of Canada for tax purposes, even if they are physically present.

> 📌 This provision is crucial for ensuring that international officials are not penalized financially for carrying out their duties in Canada.

---

#### 7. **Privileges for Officials of the Agency and Institute**
- All officials of the Agency and Institute are granted the privileges and immunities under **Article V of the UN Convention**.
- This includes:
  - Immunity from legal process.
  - Exemption from certain taxes.
  - Protection of personal and official communications.

> ✅ **Special Status for Key Officers**:
- The **Secretary-General of the Agency** and the **Executive Director of the Institute** are granted **additional privileges and immunities**.
- These are equivalent to those enjoyed by **diplomatic envoys** under international law, including:
  - Immunity from arrest and legal process.
  - Exemption from customs duties.
  - Protection of their spouses and minor children.
- This reflects a recognition of their high-level, strategic roles in international organizations.

---

#### 8. **Privileges for Experts**
- Experts (technical or scientific personnel) performing missions for the Agency or Institute in Canada are granted privileges and immunities under **Article VI of the UN Convention**.
- These are granted **only to the extent necessary** for the performance of their duties.
- Examples include:
  - Immunity from legal process during the execution of their expert functions.
  - Protection of their personal and professional activities.

  - **Subsequent Orders or regulations** (if any).

> Therefore, while this regulation provides a detailed historical and legal snapshot, it **does not apply today**.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation was a foundational step in recognizing the operational autonomy and diplomatic status of the **Francophonie Agency** and the **Energy Institute** in Canada. It established a comprehensive set of legal protections, including immunity from legal process, tax exemptions, and residence rules, tailored to the nature and function of these organizations. However, due to its **repeal in 1999**, it is now **historical**, and current privileges must be assessed under more recent agreements and legal instruments.

For modern applications, Canadian authorities would need to refer to the **current bilateral agreements** and any **subsequent Orders in Council** or **international law developments** governing the privileges of these organizations.
