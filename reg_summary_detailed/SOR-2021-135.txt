Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the **Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations**, which amends the *Navigation Safety Regulations, 2020*, and establishes additional or complementary safety standards aligned with the *International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974*, and its 1988 Protocol.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Vessel Safety Certificates Regulations**

### 🔍 **Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations are introduced to:
- Enhance maritime safety by implementing **additional or complementary standards** to those set out in the **SOLAS Convention (1974)** and its 1988 Protocol.
- Ensure that Canadian vessels—both domestic and foreign operating in Canadian waters—meet rigorous safety requirements for the protection of life, property, and the environment.

The regulations are made under several statutory authorities, including:
- **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** (primary legislation)
- **Canada Labour Code** (section 157b)
- **Canada Pension Plan** (paragraph 7(1)(a))
- **Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992** (section 27d)
- Various **Statutes of Canada** (e.g., S.C. 2019, c. 29, par. 375(1)(c); S.C. 2018, c. 27, s. 707, etc.)

These provisions reflect a **coordinated approach** involving multiple federal ministers:
- **Minister of Transport** (primary authority)
- **Minister of Natural Resources** (for certain safety aspects)
- **Minister of National Revenue** (for financial or compliance-related matters)
- **Minister of Labour** (for crew and workplace safety elements)
- **Minister of Transport** (for voyage-specific standards)

> ✅ The Administrator in Council is satisfied that the new standards **achieve the objectives of SOLAS** and are consistent with international best practices.
