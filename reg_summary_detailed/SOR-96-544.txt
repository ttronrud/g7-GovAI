**Detailed Summary of the Discretionary Interest By-Law (Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation)**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Board of Directors enacted this *Discretionary Interest By-Law* under two specific provisions of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (the "Act"):  
- **Paragraph 11(2)(g)a**: Grants the Board the authority to make by-laws to implement the Act’s provisions.  
- **Subsection 14(2.4)b**: Authorizes the Corporation to pay interest on deposits insured by CDIC in certain circumstances, specifically following the winding-up of a member financial institution.

This by-law establishes a clear, transparent, and objective method for determining the interest rate that CDIC will pay on insured deposits when a financial institution is being wound up.

**Core Provision of the By-Law**  
When CDIC decides to make an interest payment under subsection 14(2.4) of the Act—specifically, in respect of deposits that were insured by CDIC and are now subject to a winding-up order—the interest rate applied shall be:  
> *The simple annual rate of interest that applies to Government of Canada treasury bills with a term of approximately three months, as established at the last Bank of Canada auction preceding the date of the winding-up order.*

**Key Elements of the Interest Rate Determination:**  
1. **Interest Type**: The rate is a *simple annual rate*, not compound, which ensures clarity and simplicity in calculation.  
2. **Benchmark**: The rate is based on *three-month Government of Canada treasury bills*—a widely recognized, low-risk benchmark for short-term interest rates in Canada.  
3. **Timing**: The rate is determined at the *last Bank of Canada auction of three-month treasury bills prior to the date the winding-up order is issued*.  
   - This ensures that the rate reflects market conditions at the time the institution’s winding-up process begins.  
   - It avoids using outdated or future rates, providing a fair and timely basis for interest calculation.  
4. **Purpose**: This provision serves as a *discretionary interest rate* mechanism, meaning it is not tied to a fixed rate or a formula based on the institution’s financials, but instead uses a market-based reference point to ensure consistency and fairness.

**Objective and Rationale**  
- **Transparency**: By using a publicly available, market-based rate (the 3-month T-bill rate), the by-law ensures that the interest paid is transparent and objectively determined.  
- **Fairness**: The rate reflects current economic conditions, ensuring that depositors are not disadvantaged by outdated or artificially set rates.  
- **Consistency**: It provides a standardized method across all cases involving winding-up orders, promoting uniformity in CDIC’s treatment of insured deposits.  
- **Stability and Confidence**: Using a stable, government-backed benchmark reassures depositors that their funds will be protected with a fair return, even in times of financial distress.

**Repeal Clause**  
The by-law includes a *repeal clause* indicating that this provision is no longer in force—however, the text of the by-law itself does not specify a future repeal date or mechanism. This may suggest that the by-law was enacted as a temporary or transitional measure, or that it has been superseded by a later amendment or regulation. The absence of a clear repeal date implies that the provision may have been intended as a short-term or interim rule.

**Effective Date**  
The by-law came into force on **December 5, 1996**—one day after its publication date (December 4, 1996). This short delay is typical in regulatory processes and allows for administrative review and implementation.

**Legal Citation and Reference**  
- **Statutory Reference**: *R.S., c. 18 (3rd Supp.), s. 51* (section 51 of the *Regulations of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation*)  
- **Amendment Reference**: *S.C. 1996, c. 6, s. 26(3)* (a Statutory Change in 1996 that amended the Act to allow for the by-law’s adoption)

---

**Summary in Plain Language**  
When a bank or financial institution fails and is being wound up, CDIC may pay interest to depositors on their insured deposits. This by-law says that the interest rate used for such payments will be the same as the interest rate on three-month Canadian government treasury bills, as officially set by the Bank of Canada in the auction just before the winding-up order is issued. This ensures that depositors receive a fair, market-based return that reflects current economic conditions.

**Conclusion**  
This Discretionary Interest By-Law provides a clear, transparent, and economically grounded method for determining interest payments to depositors during the winding-up of a member institution. It enhances depositor confidence, promotes regulatory consistency, and aligns CDIC’s practices with market benchmarks. While the by-law is dated and may have been superseded by subsequent regulations, its principles—particularly the use of a market-based, short-term government bond rate—remain a foundational element in CDIC’s interest payment framework.
