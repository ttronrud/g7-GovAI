## 📚 Disclosure of Information to Provinces or Indigenous Bodies

  - A **province** or
  - An **Indigenous governing body**
- **Conditions for Disclosure**:
  1. The sharing must occur under a **written agreement** between the Minister and the recipient body.
  2. The agreement must state that:
     - The information is **privileged** (confidential)
     - It **shall not be disclosed** to any person not legally entitled to receive it.
  3. The information may **only be used** to determine a person’s eligibility for a **social, income assistance, or health insurance program** of that province or Indigenous body.

## ⏸️ Suspension and Resumption of Allowances

- **Suspension Power**:
  - The Minister may **suspend** payment of a special allowance if there are **reasonable grounds to believe** the applicant’s eligibility is in question.
  - This occurs **only after an investigation has been initiated** into the applicant’s eligibility.

- **Resumption of Payments**:
  - If the investigation confirms the applicant **is eligible**, payments are **resumed**.
  - When payments are resumed, the allowance is **paid retroactively** for **all periods during the suspension** during which the applicant was actually eligible.

> 💡 This ensures that eligible applicants are not penalized financially due to temporary investigations.

## 📅 What Constitutes “Maintenance” of a Child?

A child is considered to be **maintained by an applicant in a given month** if **one of the following conditions applies**:

- Care
- Maintenance
- Education
- Training
- Advancement  
> To a **greater extent than any other department, agency, institution, Indigenous governing body, or individual**.

> ✅ This establishes a standard of primary responsibility — the applicant must be the **primary provider** of support.

> The applicant is an entity listed in paragraphs 3(1)(a) to (c) of the Act and:
> - The child was **previously in foster care** or maintained by such an entity
