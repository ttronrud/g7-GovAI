**Detailed Summary of the Charlo Airport Zoning Regulations (1978)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Charlo Airport Zoning Regulations*, approved on October 10, 1978, by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**, establish specific spatial and height restrictions for lands and water areas surrounding **Charlo Airport** in the County of Restigouche, New Brunswick. These regulations are designed to ensure aviation safety by controlling the construction and natural growth of objects near the airport, particularly those that could interfere with aircraft approaches, takeoffs, or flight paths.

The regulations are formally titled the **Charlo Airport Zoning Regulations** and are enforceable across all lands and underwater areas within defined boundaries, except where those lands are formally incorporated into the airport itself.

### **Key Definitions**

To clarify the scope and application of the regulations, several key terms are defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Charlo Airport located in the County of Restigouche, New Brunswick. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for measuring distances and elevations. It is located 500 feet north of a point 3,000 feet west of the easterly end of the runway. Its coordinates are N. 1,544,317.27 feet and E. 1,041,507.02 feet, referenced to the New Brunswick Horizontal Control System. The ARP is **deemed to be 114 feet above sea level** for regulatory purposes. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of the runway strip. It consists of two segments: <br> - A first slope rising at a ratio of **1.66 vertical feet per 100 horizontal feet** to a horizontal line 10,000 feet from each end of the strip. <br> - A second steeper slope rising at a ratio of **2 vertical feet per 100 horizontal feet** to a horizontal line 50,000 feet from each end, at a height of **966 feet above the elevation at the end of the strip**. <br> The surface extends **8,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the runway strip and its approach surfaces, at a ratio of **1 vertical foot per 7 horizontal feet**, extending upward until it intersects with the outer surface. This surface ensures a smooth transition between the runway and the outer boundary zone. |
| **Outer Surface** | A surface that defines the upper limit of the airport’s zone of influence. It is composed of two parts: <br> - A **common plane at 150 feet above the ARP elevation**; <br> - If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, then a **30-foot surface above ground** is used instead. <br> This surface is shown on Department of Transport Plans S-424B, C, D, and E (dated September 2, 1977). |
| **Strip** | The primary landing area of the airport, defined as a **6,400-foot-long** and **1,000-foot-wide** rectangular area centered on the runway. The width is 500 feet on each side of the runway centerline. This is shown on Plan S-424C. |

### **Applicability**

- The regulations apply to:
  - All **land and underwater areas** within the designated zones.
  - **Public road allowances** adjacent to or near the airport, up to the outer limits defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- Exceptions: Lands that are formally part of the airport (e.g., operational runways, taxiways, hangars) are excluded from these restrictions.

---

### **Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- Construct, erect, or build any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing structures),  
- Or allow any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, vegetation),  
such that the **highest point** of the object exceeds the elevation of any of the following **imaginary surfaces** at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> These surfaces are not physical boundaries but **imaginary planes** used to define safe zones for aircraft operations.

---

### **Management of Excessive Natural Growth**

- If any **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the height of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a formal direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that vegetation does not pose a hazard during landing or takeoff, especially during low visibility or adverse weather conditions.

---

### **Prohibition on Waste Accumulation**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal or accumulation** of:
    - Waste,
    - Materials,
    - Substances that are **edible or attractive to birds**.

> This rule is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation hazard. Accumulated food or organic waste can attract birds to the airport area, increasing the risk of collisions with aircraft.

---

### **Geographic and Plan-Based References**

All dimensions, elevations, and boundaries are based on official Department of Transport plans, which serve as the authoritative reference for compliance:

- **Plans S-424A, B, C, D, E, and F** (dated September 2, 1977) provide detailed visual representations of:
  - The **airport reference point**
  - The **strip**, **approach surfaces**, **transitional surface**, and **outer surface**
  - The **circular zone** of influence

- The **circular area** of influence extends **13,000 feet** from the airport reference point.

> These plans are essential for determining compliance with height and spatial restrictions.

---

### **Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **To ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **To minimize risks from bird strikes** by prohibiting the accumulation of food or organic matter that attracts birds.
3. **To provide clear, measurable boundaries** using standardized elevation and horizontal measurements, allowing for consistent enforcement and planning.
4. **To maintain a safe and predictable environment** around the airport for both pilots and air traffic control.

---

### **Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions regarding the removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Monitor compliance with the height and waste restrictions.
- Violations may result in legal action or administrative penalties, though specific penalties are not detailed in this regulation.

---

### **Historical and Contextual Notes**

- These regulations were enacted in **1978**, reflecting the standards and practices of Canadian aviation safety policy at the time.
- The use of **imaginary surfaces** (approach, transitional, outer) is a standard feature in airport zoning regulations, particularly under the **Aeronautics Act**, which mandates such safety zones to protect aircraft operations.
- The reference to the **New Brunswick Horizontal Control System** indicates that the coordinates are tied to a provincial geodetic framework, ensuring accuracy in mapping and enforcement.

### **Conclusion**

The *Charlo Airport Zoning Regulations* are a comprehensive set of spatial and height controls designed to protect aviation safety at Charlo Airport. By defining precise elevation limits through imaginary surfaces and restricting the growth of vegetation and waste, the regulations create a safe operational environment for aircraft. The rules are grounded in technical precision, supported by official plans, and enforced through the authority of the Minister of Transport. They represent a foundational element of airport safety planning in rural New Brunswick and serve as a model for similar zoning regulations at other small airports.

**In short**:  
These regulations establish strict height and land-use limits around Charlo Airport to prevent obstructions to aircraft, prohibit bird-attracting waste, and ensure safe flight operations through clearly defined surfaces and zones.
