### **Detailed Summary of the Polar Bear Pass Withdrawal Order**

This regulation, known as the **Polar Bear Pass Withdrawal Order**, is a legal instrument issued by the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) under the **Territorial Lands Act** and the **Canada Oil and Gas Act**. It formally withdraws specific parcels of land on **Bathurst Island, Northwest Territories**, from disposal and from oil and gas exploration, in order to establish a **National Wildlife Area (NWA)** for the protection of wildlife, wetlands, and associated habitats.

---

## **Background and Context**

1. **Exploration Permits and Historical Use**  
   - The lands described in **Schedule I** were previously granted exploratory permits under the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations*.
   - These permits were issued by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and allowed extensive oil and gas exploration activities.
   - The interest owners of these permits included major companies such as **Suncor, Esso, Canterra Energy, Dome Petroleum**, and others, as well as private individuals (e.g., Mildred H. and Ethel A. Hembdt).

2. **Legal Obligations under the Canada Oil and Gas Act**  
   - Under **subsection 63(1)** of the *Canada Oil and Gas Act*, interest owners are required to negotiate an exploration agreement within a specified timeframe to maintain their rights to the land.
   - However, in this case, the interest owners **surrendered all interest** in the lands described in Schedule I. This surrender was a key condition for the government’s decision to withdraw the land from oil and gas use.

3. **Intent to Protect Wildlife**  
   - The government intends to designate a **National Wildlife Area** under the *Canada Wildlife Act*, specifically on lands described in **Schedules II and III**, to protect:
     - Wildlife populations (notably polar bears and other Arctic species)
     - Wetlands
     - Critical habitats
   - This protection is essential due to the ecological sensitivity of the region and the vulnerability of Arctic species to environmental disruption.

## **Key Legal Actions Taken**

The Order revokes and replaces a prior disposal order and implements new withdrawals under two key statutes:

### 1. **Revocation of Prior Order**
- The Order **revokes** the *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Bathurst Island N.W.T.) from Disposal Order* made by **Order in Council P.C. 1983-706** (dated March 10, 1983).
- This prior order had already withdrawn certain lands from disposal, but the new Order strengthens and clarifies the withdrawal to align with wildlife protection goals.

### 2. **New Withdrawals Under the Territorial Lands Act and Canada Oil and Gas Act**

| Land Schedule | Legal Withdrawal | Purpose |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| **Schedule II** | Withdrawn from disposal under the *Territorial Lands Act* | To protect wildlife, wetlands, and associated habitats. This land is designated as the core of the new National Wildlife Area. |
| **Schedule III** | Withdrawn from the application of the *Canada Oil and Gas Act* | To prevent oil and gas exploration on these ecologically sensitive areas. These lands are not included in Schedule II but are still critical for habitat protection. |
| **Schedule I (not in Schedules II or III)** | Withdrawn from the application of the *Canada Oil and Gas Act* | To ensure that the lands in Schedules II and III can be used without interference from oil and gas activities. This facilitates the establishment of the wildlife area. |

> **Note**: The withdrawal of Schedule I lands from oil and gas activity is not a full revocation of ownership or use, but rather a **functional withdrawal**—it removes the legal ability to conduct oil and gas exploration or apply for exploration permits.

## **Geographic Description of the Withdrawn Lands**

The Order precisely defines three parcels of land on Bathurst Island using geographic coordinates and topographic descriptions.

---

### **1. Schedule II – Core Wildlife Area (Approx. 2,291 km²)**  
- **Location**: Between the **Bracebridge and Goodsir Inlets** on Bathurst Island.
- **Description**:
  - Based on **map sheets 68G and 68H** of the National Topographic System (scale 1:250,000).
  - Coordinates are in **Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 14**.
  - Begins at the **ordinary low water mark** near the west side of Queens Channel and Goodsir Inlet.
  - Follows the coastline along the **west side of Crosier Strait**, around **Brooman Point**, and continues along the **Bracebridge Inlet**.
  - Ends at a point near the northeast corner of the parcel and returns to the starting point.
- **Area**: Approximately **2,291 km²**.

> This area is designated as the **core of the National Wildlife Area**, intended for the protection of polar bears, migratory birds, and other Arctic species.

---

### **2. Schedule III – Additional Habitat Protection Area (Approx. 2,624 km²)**  
- **Location**: Adjacent to and extending beyond Schedule II, including coastal waters.
- **Description**:
  - Begins near **Rapid Point**.
  - Traverses southward through **Black Point**, near **Brooman Point**, and follows coastal sinuosities.
  - Includes a broader coastal zone and inland areas.
  - Extends from the west side of the island to the northeast, forming a larger contiguous area.
- **Area**: Approximately **2,624 km²**.

> This area provides **additional habitat** and supports ecological connectivity, especially for marine and terrestrial species.

## **Legal and Environmental Significance**

1. **Environmental Protection**  
   - The withdrawal of these lands from oil and gas exploration ensures that **critical Arctic ecosystems** are preserved.
   - The area is especially important for **polar bears**, which rely on sea ice and coastal habitats for denning, hunting, and migration.

2. **Compliance with Federal Legislation**  
   - The Order is legally sound because:
     - It is issued under **paragraph 19(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which allows for the withdrawal of land from disposal for public or environmental purposes.
     - It is supported by **subsection 5(2) of the Canada Oil and Gas Act**, which allows for the withdrawal of land from oil and gas use when such use would interfere with the protection of wildlife or other public interests.

3. **Surrender of Interest by Owners**  
   - The fact that the permit holders have **voluntarily surrendered their interests** in Schedule I lands demonstrates cooperation between industry and government in protecting the environment.

4. **Public Benefit and Biodiversity Conservation**  
   - The establishment of the National Wildlife Area supports long-term biodiversity, climate resilience, and sustainable stewardship of Canada’s Arctic territories.

## **Citation and Enforcement**

- **Title**: *Polar Bear Pass Withdrawal Order*  
- **Citation**: This Order may be cited as the *Polar Bear Pass Withdrawal Order*.  
- **Effective Date**: Implied upon publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, as per the original Order in Council (SI/83-65, 1983).  
- **Jurisdiction**: Northwest Territories, Bathurst Island.

## **Conclusion**

The **Polar Bear Pass Withdrawal Order** represents a significant step in Canada’s commitment to **conserving Arctic ecosystems**. By withdrawing large tracts of land from oil and gas exploration and designating them as a **National Wildlife Area**, the government ensures that vital habitats for polar bears and other species are protected from industrial development. This action reflects a balance between economic interests and environmental responsibility, grounded in clear legal authority and supported by the voluntary surrender of exploration rights by private and corporate owners.

It stands as a landmark example of how federal environmental policy can be implemented through targeted, legally robust land management decisions in Canada’s northern territories.
