---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The permit is officially titled: **"Import of Dairy Products for Personal Use Permit"**.
- It is formally cited as **General Import Permit No. 1**.

- **Value limit**: The total value of dairy products imported in a single transaction (importation) must not exceed **CAD $20**.

- The importation must be strictly for **personal consumption** and not for distribution, sale, or use in business operations.
- The importer and household members must be the intended recipients of the dairy products.

- If a customs entry form is required for any dairy product imported under this permit, the form must be **clearly endorsed** with one of the following statements:
  - **"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 1"** (in English)
  - **"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 1"** (in French)

> 🔍 Purpose of endorsement: This ensures customs officials can identify the import as being covered under the general personal-use exemption and apply the appropriate rules and exemptions, without requiring additional documentation or inspection.

---

### **5. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The permit is a **general authorization**, meaning it does not require pre-approval or detailed product specifications.
- However, compliance with the **value limit ($20 per importation)** and **personal-use requirement** is mandatory.
- Failure to meet these conditions may result in:

  - Imposition of duties or taxes,

  - Dairy products imported for commercial or business use.
  - Bulk or large-scale imports exceeding $20 in value.
  - Products that are not classified as dairy (e.g., non-dairy alternatives).
- The $20 cap is **per importation**, meaning multiple shipments of dairy products (e.g., one shipment of $10 and another of $15) would each count as separate importations and must individually comply with the $20 limit.
