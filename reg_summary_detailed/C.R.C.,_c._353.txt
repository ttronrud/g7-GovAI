The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of various sections of statutory rules (SORs — Statutory Orders) under the **Supreme Court of Canada's regulations** or provincial legislation, specifically in the context of **Ontario’s regulatory framework**.

However, **no actual regulation is present** in the text — only repeated citations indicating that certain provisions have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Content:**
- The text does **not contain a regulation** itself.
- Instead, it is a list of **repeal notices**, indicating that specific sections of previous regulations have been formally removed from law.

**2. Repealed Provisions:**
The citations point to the following repealed sections from various Statutory Orders (SORs):

| SOR | Section | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| SOR/2017-286, s. 34 | Repeated 10 times | Likely refers to a regulation related to **provincial licensing, compliance, or enforcement**; the exact subject is not specified in the text. |
| SOR/86-451, s. 2 | One instance | Possibly relates to **fire safety or building codes** (based on historical context of SOR/86-451). |
| SOR/95-412, s. 3 and s. 4 | Two instances | Likely related to **municipal or environmental regulations** (e.g., waste management, land use). |
| SOR/78-430, s. 2 | One instance | May relate to **public health or sanitation**. |
| SOR/96-474, s. 2 and s. 4 | Two instances | Possibly related to **fire prevention or emergency services**. |
| SOR/78-507, s. 3 | One instance | May pertain to **municipal bylaws or zoning**. |

**3. Legal Implication of Repeal:**
- When a regulation is **repealed**, it is **no longer in force**.
- This means that the specific rules, requirements, or obligations outlined in those sections are **no longer applicable**.
- Repeals often occur when:
  - A new regulation is introduced that supersedes the old one.
  - A provision is found to be outdated, ineffective, or inconsistent with current law.
  - There is a need for legal clarity or simplification.

**4. Contextual Background (Inferred):**
- These SORs are part of **Ontario’s administrative regulations**, typically issued under a broader statute (e.g., Fire Prevention Act, Municipal Act, Environmental Protection Act).
- The repeated nature of the citations (especially SOR/2017-286, s. 34) suggests that this particular section was **a key or frequently referenced provision** that was removed during a comprehensive regulatory update.
- The repeal of multiple sections (e.g., SOR/95-412, s. 3 and 4) may indicate a **major reform** in environmental or municipal governance.

**5. Key Takeaway:**
> **This text is not a regulation. It is a list of repealed regulations — indicating that specific rules have been formally removed from the legal framework.**  
> As such, it serves as a **historical record** of legislative changes, showing that certain provisions were obsolete or superseded by newer legislation.

### Conclusion:
There is **no active regulation** in this list. Instead, it is a **record of repeals** from prior Ontario Statutory Orders. The repeated references to SOR/2017-286, s. 34 suggest that this was a central provision removed during a regulatory modernization effort, likely in the area of **public safety, environmental compliance, or municipal administration**.

To understand the full context, one would need to consult:
- The original regulation (e.g., SOR/2017-286)
- The statute under which it was issued
- The official legislative justification for the repeal

Until such information is available, this summary provides only the **historical and procedural significance** of the repeals listed.
