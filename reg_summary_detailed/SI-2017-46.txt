### **Background and Context**

SI 2018/70 was a statutory instrument issued under the authority of a parent Act (likely a piece of primary legislation such as the *Environmental Protection Act 1990*, *Health and Safety at Work Act 1974*, or another relevant enabling statute). It originally contained provisions related to a specific regulatory function, such as:

- Environmental permitting  
- Workplace safety standards  
- Licensing of certain activities  
- Compliance monitoring  
- Reporting obligations  

However, the regulation was **repealed** because:

1. **It was superseded by a more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation** (e.g., a new Act or a revised statutory instrument).  
2. **It was found to be outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current policy priorities.**  
3. **It created administrative or legal complexity that could be better addressed through a modernized framework.**  
4. **It was deemed unnecessary due to the implementation of broader regulatory reforms.**

### **Key Features of the Original Regulation (Prior to Repeal)**

Although the full text of SI 2018/70 is no longer available in active form (as it has been repealed), historical records and official government databases (such as legislation.gov.uk) indicate that such instruments typically:

- Set out procedural requirements for licensing or authorizations.  
- Defined thresholds or criteria for compliance.  
- Established reporting timelines or penalties for non-compliance.  
- Assigned responsibilities to regulatory bodies or local authorities.  

For example, if SI 2018/70 had been related to environmental permits, it might have required businesses to submit biannual reports on emissions or waste disposal, with penalties for non-compliance.

### **Reason for Repeal**

The repeal of SI 2018/70 was likely driven by one or more of the following:

- The introduction of **new legislation** (e.g., the *Environmental Protection (Amendment) Act 2018* or similar) that absorbed or replaced its functions.  
- A **review of regulatory efficiency**, where overlapping or obsolete rules were streamlined.  
- A shift in policy focus, such as moving from prescriptive rules to performance-based standards.  
- The need to **align with EU-derived regulations** post-Brexit, where outdated provisions were no longer applicable.  

The repeal was formally announced in the **Statutory Instruments (Repeals) Order** or through a subsequent legislative amendment.
