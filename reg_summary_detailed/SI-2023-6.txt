### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation establishes a formal remission (i.e., forgiveness or cancellation) of certain overpayments made under the *Public Service Income Benefit Plan for Survivors of Employees Slain on Duty*. The remission is granted specifically to beneficiaries who received overpayments due to administrative errors, and only those overpayments that occurred **before May 31, 2023**.

The rationale for the remission is grounded in the principle that collecting such overpayments would be **unreasonable and unjust**, particularly when the overpayments were the result of errors in administrative processing rather than intentional misconduct or fraud.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Scope of Remission**  
   - The remission applies to overpayments made under the *Public Service Income Benefit Plan for Survivors of Employees Slain on Duty*.  
   - It is limited to beneficiaries who received these overpayments **prior to May 31, 2023**.  
   - The overpayments must have been caused by **administrative errors**, such as:
     - Incorrect calculation of benefit amounts
     - Misapplication of eligibility criteria
     - Errors in processing or documentation
     - Systemic or procedural mistakes in benefit administration

2. **Exclusion of Certain Cases**  
   - Overpayments resulting from fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or beneficiary misconduct are **not eligible** for remission.  
   - The regulation explicitly excludes cases where the overpayment was due to the beneficiary’s fault or deliberate actions.

3. **Reasonableness and Justice**  
   - The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, has determined that collecting these overpayments would be **unreasonable and unjust**.  
   - This determination is based on the nature of the errors (non-intentional), the long-term impact on surviving beneficiaries (especially those who may have faced financial hardship), and the principle of fairness in public benefit administration.

4. **Effective Date and Application**  
   - The remission is retroactive to the date of the overpayment, but only for amounts paid before May 31, 2023.  
   - Beneficiaries must be notified of the remission and provided with the opportunity to confirm their eligibility.

5. **Implementation and Administration**  
   - The Department of Public Service and Financial Management (or relevant administering body) is responsible for:
     - Identifying eligible overpayments
     - Reviewing cases for administrative error
     - Processing the remission request
     - Communicating the outcome to affected beneficiaries

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Improved Public Service Administration**: Highlights a commitment to correcting systemic errors and enhancing transparency and accountability in benefit programs.  
- **Alignment with Fairness Principles**: Demonstrates the government’s adherence to equitable treatment in public financial programs, particularly for vulnerable populations.  
- **Prevention of Future Errors**: May prompt reforms in the administration of the benefit plan to reduce the likelihood of similar overpayments in the future.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a targeted, equitable, and principled mechanism for forgiving overpayments made under the Public Service Income Benefit for Survivors of Employees Slain on Duty—specifically those arising from administrative errors and occurring before May 31, 2023. By remitting these overpayments, the government acknowledges the injustice of collecting funds in such circumstances and reinforces trust in public benefit programs.
