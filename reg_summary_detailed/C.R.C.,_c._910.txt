The provided text indicates that a specific regulation has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) and does not contain any substantive content to summarize.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the information:

- **Repeal Status**: The regulation is explicitly stated to have been **repealed**.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal occurred in **1998**, under **Chapter 10, Section 201** of the Statutes of Canada.
- **Legal Citation**: The repeal is referenced in **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2013-107**, which means that the formal legal document that officially canceled or replaced the regulation was published in 2013.
- **Multiple References**: The phrase "[Repealed, 1998, c. 10, s. 201, see SI/2013-107]" appears three times, indicating that this repeal applies to a regulation or set of regulations, possibly in a legislative or regulatory list where multiple entries reference the same repeal.

### Interpretation:
This notation is typically found in legal or regulatory databases to inform users that a particular rule, provision, or statute is no longer in force. The regulation was previously in effect but was formally removed from the legal framework in 1998. The 2013 Statutory Instrument (SI/2013-107) serves as the official record confirming the repeal and may include details on the reasons, context, or replacement provisions.

### Key Points:
- The regulation is **no longer valid or enforceable**.
- It was **repealed in 1998** by a legislative act (c. 10, s. 201).
- The **official confirmation** of the repeal is found in **SI/2013-107**, which may provide additional context such as the rationale or transitional arrangements.
- There is **no substantive content** of the original regulation provided in the text — only the status of its repeal.

### Conclusion:
There is **no detailed summary of the regulation itself** because it has been repealed and its text is not included. The provided information only serves as a **status indicator** — that the regulation is no longer in force. To understand what the original regulation was about, one would need to consult historical legal documents or archives prior to 1998, which are not included in this entry.

If you have access to the original regulation or the full text of SI/2013-107, I can assist in summarizing its content or explaining the repeal's implications.
