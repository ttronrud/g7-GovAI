**Detailed Summary of the Age Guidelines (Canadian Human Rights Commission, 1978)**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) issued these guidelines under specific provisions of the *Canadian Human Rights Act* (the "Act"). Specifically, the guidelines are authorized under:

- **Paragraph 14(e)** of the Act, which empowers the Commission to issue guidelines on reasonable practices in the context of human rights.
- **Subsection 22(2)** of the Act, which allows the Commission to issue guidelines to assist in the interpretation and application of the Act, particularly in matters of discrimination.

These guidelines are formally titled the **Age Guidelines** and were issued on **October 10, 1978**, from Ottawa.

**Purpose and Scope**

The primary purpose of the Age Guidelines is to provide clarity on when **differences in pricing or charges** (such as fares, rates, or fees) based on age—particularly for children, youth, and senior citizens—may be considered **reasonable and non-discriminatory** under the Canadian Human Rights Act.

The guidelines address the provision of **goods, services, and facilities available to the general public**, including but not limited to transportation, entertainment, recreation, education, and accommodation.

**Key Provision: Reasonableness of Age-Based Pricing**

A central principle established in the guidelines is:

> **Adverse differentiation in the provision of goods, services, or facilities that is based solely on a reduction or absence of rates, fares, or charges for children, youths, or senior citizens is considered reasonable and is not a discriminatory practice under Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.**

This means that:

- It is **not discriminatory** to charge lower prices or offer free access to certain age groups (e.g., children under 12 or seniors over 65).
- The differentiation must be **based solely on age** and not on other factors such as race, gender, religion, disability, or sexual orientation.
- The practice must be **proportionate, justified, and applied consistently** across similar age groups.

---

**Definition of "Adverse Differentiation"**

The Commission defines "adverse differentiation" as a situation where a person is treated less favourably in access to goods, services, or facilities because of their age. However, the guidelines clarify that such differentiation is **not discriminatory** when it is:

- Limited to **price reductions or exemptions** for children, youth, or seniors.
- **Not tied to other forms of discrimination** (e.g., denying access due to age while also excluding people on the basis of race or disability).
- **Not arbitrary or disproportionate** in nature.

---

**Non-Discrimination Principle Under Section 5 of the Act**

Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods, services, and facilities available to the public. However, the guidelines emphasize that **age-based pricing is a recognized and acceptable exception**—provided it is:

- **Reasonable and justified** (e.g., based on actual cost, operational needs, or social policy).
- **Consistently applied** (e.g., children under 12 get a discount, seniors over 65 get a reduced rate).
- **Not used as a pretext for exclusion or unequal treatment** of other groups.

---

**Limitations and Conditions**

While the guidelines affirm that age-based pricing is not discriminatory, they do not permit:

- **Unjustified or arbitrary pricing** (e.g., offering a discount to children but not to adults with similar needs).
- **Denial of access** based on age that would otherwise be available to others (e.g., charging no fee for children but charging full price for adults with disabilities).
- **Use of age as a proxy for other discriminatory factors** (e.g., using age to exclude people with disabilities or from marginalized communities).

---

**Application and Enforcement**

- These guidelines serve as **interpretive tools** for businesses, service providers, and public institutions to understand how age-based pricing may be legally compliant.
- They are not binding law but are **authoritative guidance** issued by the Commission to support fair and equitable practices.
- The Commission may use these guidelines in **enforcement actions or human rights complaints** to assess whether a pricing policy constitutes discrimination.

**Historical Context and Significance**

Issued in 1978, these guidelines were among the early efforts by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to address **age-related discrimination** in public services. At the time, there was growing concern that age-based pricing might be perceived as discriminatory, especially in sectors like transportation and recreation.

By explicitly recognizing that **discounts for children and seniors are not discriminatory**, the guidelines helped promote **inclusive access** to public services while allowing organizations to manage costs and maintain financial sustainability.

---

**Conclusion**

The Age Guidelines (1978) establish a clear and balanced framework:

- They **protect the rights of children and seniors** by affirming that reduced or free access to services based on age is not discriminatory.
- They **support fair and practical pricing models** in public and private sectors.
- They **do not extend to other forms of discrimination**—such as those based on race, gender, or disability—and emphasize that age-based pricing must be reasonable, consistent, and non-arbitrary.

These guidelines remain a foundational reference in Canadian human rights policy, particularly in sectors where age-based pricing is common (e.g., public transit, museums, theatres, and healthcare access).
