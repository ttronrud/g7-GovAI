**Detailed Summary of the *Notices of Uninsured Deposits Regulations (Retail Associations)***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Notices of Uninsured Deposits Regulations (Retail Associations)* are issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 378.2(3)a of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act***. This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific rules regarding the disclosure of deposit insurance status for retail cooperative credit associations.

These regulations are part of broader legislative efforts to ensure transparency and consumer protection in the financial sector, particularly concerning the **insurance of deposits** held with certain types of financial institutions.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **ensure that consumers are clearly informed** that deposits made with **retail cooperative credit associations** are **not insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**. This is critical because:

- CDIC insures deposits up to $100,000 per individual in eligible financial institutions (such as banks, credit unions, and some cooperative credit associations).
- However, **retail cooperative credit associations** (which are distinct from member institutions) are **exempt from CDIC insurance** due to their structure and operational independence.
- Without clear disclosure, consumers may mistakenly believe their deposits are protected, leading to financial risk.

Thus, the regulations mandate **explicit, visible, and accessible notices** to inform individuals about this lack of insurance.

### **3. Required Notices and Their Requirements**

#### **A. Notice Under Subsection 378.2(1): Account Agreement or Separate Document**

- A **notice must be provided** to each person opening or maintaining a deposit account with a retail association.
- The notice must be delivered **either as part of the account agreement** or as a **separate, standalone document**.
- **Special Requirement When Shared Premises Exist**:
  - If the retail association operates **on premises shared with a member institution** (as defined in *section 2 of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*), the notice must include an **additional statement** clarifying that:
    - The **retail association’s business is separate and distinct** from that of the member institution.
    - This distinction is essential to prevent confusion about deposit insurance coverage, as member institutions are typically CDIC-insured.

- **Verbal Disclosure and Signed Declaration**:
  - The retail association must **verbally explain all information** in the notice to the account applicant.
  - The applicant must then sign a **declaration confirming** that:
    1. They have been given and have read the notice,
    2. The retail association has verbally explained the contents of the notice, and
    3. They understand that **deposits with the retail association are not insured by CDIC**.

> This requirement ensures that consumers are not only informed but also **actively aware and consenting** to the risk of uninsured deposits.

#### **B. Notice Under Paragraph 378.2(2)(a): Branch Display Requirements**

- The notice must be **prominently posted in every branch** of the retail association.
- **Physical Display Requirements**:

  - Width: **43.18 cm**
  - Font size:
    - Heading: **120 points**
    - Body text: **50 points**
  - Must be **clearly visible** in the public area of the branch where customers interact with staff.

> These specific dimensions and font sizes ensure that the notice is **highly visible and legible**, even from a distance or from a seated position.

- **Online Presence**:
  - If the retail association has a website, the notice must be **prominently displayed** on the site in a manner that is clearly visible to users accessing the site.

> The online requirement reflects the growing importance of digital banking and ensures that online customers are also informed.

#### **C. Notice Under Paragraph 378.2(2)(b): Advertising Requirements**

- The notice must appear **prominently in all advertisements** where the retail association:
  - Offers deposit facilities, or
  - Solicits deposits (e.g., promotional materials, flyers, brochures, online ads)

- The format of the notice must follow the form specified in **subsection 2(1)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.

> This ensures consistency and clarity in all marketing materials, preventing misleading claims about deposit insurance.

### **4. Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 160 of *An Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters* (S.C. 2007, c. 6) comes into force**.
- If the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision allows for a smooth transition and ensures that the rules are implemented in alignment with the broader legislative framework.

### **5. Key Legal and Consumer Protection Implications**

- **Transparency**: Consumers are explicitly informed about the uninsured nature of their deposits.
- **Risk Awareness**: Individuals understand that their deposits are not protected by CDIC, which could affect their financial decision-making.
- **Prevention of Misrepresentation**: By requiring both written and verbal disclosure, the regulations prevent misleading statements or omissions in account opening processes.
