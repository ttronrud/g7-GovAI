The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-26, section 89**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument No. 2015-26**, specifically **section 89** of that instrument.
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such repeals are typically effective upon publication in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (SOR), which occurred in 2015. Therefore, the repeal became effective on or around the date of publication of SOR/2015-26.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation (which is now repealed) is not described in the provided text. Without additional context (such as the title, subject matter, or section number of the original regulation), it is not possible to determine what specific rule or requirement it governed—e.g., whether it related to environmental standards, licensing, safety, or another area.
- **Implication**: Because the regulation is repealed, it is no longer enforceable, and any legal or administrative obligations previously derived from it are nullified. Any current legal interpretation or compliance measures must now refer to updated or successor regulations.

### Conclusion:
The provided information confirms that a regulation was formally **repealed by SOR/2015-26, s. 89**, but **does not contain details about the original regulation's content, scope, or purpose**. As a result, a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be provided—only that it has been removed from the legal framework.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal, which may be archived in official government publications such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders Database* (e.g., through the Government of Canada’s website or the National Archives of Canada).
