### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Regulation**
- The regulation referenced was a **section (6.05)** within a **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2015-81**.
- Statutory instruments are secondary legislation used in jurisdictions like Canada (where SI is common) to implement or amend primary legislation.
- Section 6.05 would have previously governed a specific legal provision, such as a procedural rule, a requirement, or a definition, depending on the subject matter of SI 2015-81.

#### 2. **Repeal Details**
- The section was **officially repealed** by **Section 6.05 of SI/2015-81** itself.
- This is a self-repealing mechanism: the instrument repeals its own section.
- The repeal took effect as part of the **publication and coming into force** of SI/2015-81.

#### 3. **Legal Consequence**
- Once repealed, **Section 6.05 no longer exists** as a legally binding provision.
- Any previous application, enforcement, or reference to this section is now **invalid or obsolete**.
- The repeal may have been enacted to:
  - Modernize or simplify the legislation,
  - Resolve inconsistencies,
  - Align with new policy or primary law,
  - Reflect changes in administrative or regulatory frameworks.

#### 4. **Contextual Notes**
- The repeated entries (12 times) suggest a possible formatting or data-entry error — likely a copy-paste or technical glitch — as the same information is redundantly listed.
- In official legal databases, such repetition is not standard and may indicate a misrepresentation or error in the source.
- The repeal of section 6.05 is **not a standalone regulation**, but a **change within a larger legislative instrument**.

#### 5. **Where to Find the Original SI**
To understand the full context of SI/2015-81 and what section 6.05 originally covered, one should consult:
- The **official government publication** (e.g., Canada Gazette, or relevant provincial legislation database),
- The **text of SI/2015-81**, which would contain the original wording of section 6.05 and the rationale for its repeal.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced — **section 6.05 of Statutory Instrument 2015-81** — has been **repealed** by the same instrument. It is **no longer in force** and does not apply.
