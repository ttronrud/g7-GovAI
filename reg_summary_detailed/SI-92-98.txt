**Detailed Summary of the Unemployment Insurance Premiums (Spousal Employment) Remission Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Unemployment Insurance Premiums (Spousal Employment) Remission Order*, made under the authority of the Governor General in Council, is a regulatory instrument issued in 1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)) to address what was deemed an *unjust* collection of unemployment insurance premiums in specific circumstances involving spouses. This Order provides for the **remission (full refund)** of certain unemployment insurance premiums paid by individuals or employers in relation to the employment of a spouse or a spouse-controlled corporation.

The Order is intended to correct an inequity in the existing system where an individual or employer who employed their spouse was required to pay unemployment insurance premiums—regardless of whether the spouse’s employment was economically or socially significant or whether the employment was within a household context.

### **Legal Basis**

The Order is authorized under **subsection 23(2.1)** of the *Financial Administration Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board) to make orders to remit certain taxes or fees when deemed unjust.

This legislative authority allows for a discretionary, equitable adjustment to the financial obligations of individuals or employers when such obligations are considered unreasonable or unjust.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Unemployment Insurance Act* (the primary legislation governing unemployment insurance in Canada). |
| **Employee’s premium** | The portion of the unemployment insurance premium paid by an individual (employee) under the Act. |
| **Employer’s premium** | The portion of the unemployment insurance premium paid by an employer under the Act. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the Minister of National Revenue, who provides policy and administrative recommendations. |
| **Spousal employment** | Defined in two ways: <br>1. The employment of an individual by their spouse (as employer or employee); or <br>2. The employment of an individual by a corporation where **more than 40% of the voting shares** are controlled by the individual’s spouse (either individually or jointly with the individual). |

> This definition ensures that the remission applies not only to direct household employment but also to situations where a spouse has significant control over a business entity in which the individual is employed.

### **Main Provisions**

#### **Section 3 – Remission to Individuals**
- An individual is entitled to a **full remission** of the **employee’s premium** they paid under the *Unemployment Insurance Act* for spousal employment.
- The period covered is from **March 1, 1978, to August 15, 1988**.
- This means that if an individual (e.g., a spouse) was employed by their spouse during this time, the premium they paid as an employee is refunded.

#### **Section 4 – Remission to Employers**
- An employer is entitled to a **full remission** of the **employer’s premium** they paid for spousal employment during the same period (March 1, 1978 – August 15, 1988).
- This applies when the employer is the spouse of the employee or a corporation in which the spouse controls over 40% of the voting shares.

> Thus, both parties—employee and employer—are eligible for a refund of the premiums they paid in relation to spousal employment during the specified timeframe.

### **Conditions and Limitations**

#### **Section 5 – Exclusions (No Remission in Certain Cases)**  
A person **shall not receive a remission** under Sections 3 or 4 if they previously received:
1. A **refund of an employee’s premium** under the Act (i.e., already received a refund for such a premium);
2. A **refund of an employer’s premium** under the Act;
3. A **benefit** under the Act (such as unemployment insurance benefits).

> This provision prevents double recovery. If a person already received a refund or benefit related to the same premium or employment, they are excluded from receiving further remission under this Order.

> The exclusion ensures that the remission does not create a windfall or result in overlapping financial benefits.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **correct an inequity** in the unemployment insurance system. Historically, the system required both spouses to pay premiums when one was employed by the other—regardless of the nature or economic value of the work.

- In many cases, the employment of a spouse was informal, part-time, or within a domestic setting (e.g., a spouse working at home or in a family business).
- Requiring both parties to pay premiums for such employment was considered **unjust** because:
  - The work may not have been economically productive.
  - The employment may have been a result of family structure, not market activity.
  - It placed a financial burden on individuals in family-based or low-income households.

By remitting these premiums, the government recognizes that such employment should not be treated as a taxable or contributory employment relationship in the traditional sense.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Time Period**: Only applies to premiums paid between **March 1, 1978, and August 15, 1988**.
- **Geographic and Economic Scope**: Applies across Canada; no regional restrictions.
- **Eligibility**: Only applies to individuals or employers who meet the **spousal employment definition**.
- **No Extension**: The Order does not extend beyond the specified period.
- **No Benefit to Non-Spousal Employment**: The remission is strictly limited to employment involving a spouse or spouse-controlled corporation.

---

### **Practical Implications**

1. **For Individuals (Employees)**:
   - If a person was employed by their spouse during 1978–1988, they can apply for a refund of the employee’s premium they paid during that time.
   - The refund is only available if they did not previously receive a refund or benefit for that premium.

2. **For Employers**:
   - If an employer (e.g., a spouse) employed their spouse during the period, the employer can claim a refund of the employer’s premium paid during that time.
   - Again, only if the claim is not already covered by a prior refund or benefit.

3. **For Spouse-Controlled Corporations**:
   - If an individual is employed by a corporation where the spouse controls over 40% of the voting shares, the premiums paid by the employer (the corporation) are eligible for remission.

### **Administrative Process (Implied)**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, such orders typically involve:
- Application procedures (e.g., forms or claims) to the Minister of National Revenue.
- Verification of eligibility (e.g., employment records, ownership shares).
- Review by the Department of National Revenue or a designated agency.
- Processing and disbursement of refunds within a defined timeframe.

### **Conclusion**

The *Unemployment Insurance Premiums (Spousal Employment) Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable correction to an outdated and potentially unjust requirement in the unemployment insurance system. It recognizes that employment between spouses—especially in domestic or family-controlled settings—does not always constitute a traditional economic activity and should not be subject to the same premium obligations as independent employment.

By remitting premiums paid between March 1, 1978, and August 15, 1988, the Order promotes fairness and reduces financial burdens on individuals in family-based employment arrangements. However, it is limited in scope, time, and eligibility, and excludes individuals who have already received refunds or benefits related to the same premiums.

**Key Takeaway**:  
This Order reflects a policy shift toward recognizing the unique nature of family employment and ensuring that financial contributions to unemployment insurance are proportional to actual market-based employment, not household arrangements.
