**Detailed Summary of the AECB Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order, 1997**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources and the Treasury Board**.  
It is made pursuant to **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which authorizes the government to establish fee remission orders to address certain financial recoveries or refunds related to cost recovery fees.

The regulation is formally titled:  
**"AECB Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order, 1997"**  
It is published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 1991, Chapter 24, Section 7(2), which provides the legal basis for the remission of fees under the AECB (Alberta Energy Regulator or similar body, likely referring to the Alberta Energy Regulator or a predecessor agency).

---

### **2. Scope and Application**
This Order applies to fees paid under the following regulations:
- The **AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1996**
- The **AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1994**
- The **AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1993**
- The **AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations** (general reference)

This means that any fee paid under any of these prior regulations is subject to the remission provisions outlined in this Order.

---

### **3. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **remit (i.e., refund) specific portions of fees** that were previously refunded or would be refunded under the existing fee regulations. The remission ensures that:
- Individuals or entities are not unfairly charged for fees that were reduced due to changes in licensing conditions.
- The financial impact of fee reductions or revocations is fairly distributed, preventing double billing or overpayment.

---

### **4. Remission Provisions**

#### **(a) Remission of Previously Refunded Fees**
A remission is granted for **any portion of fees that were already refunded prior to the coming into force of this Order**.  
This provision ensures that individuals who received a refund under earlier regulations (1993, 1994, or 1996) are not required to pay that refunded amount again — effectively recognizing the refund as valid and final.

> **Key point**: This protects against retroactive financial liability for fees already returned.

---

#### **(b) Remission in Specific Circumstances of Fee Reduction or Change**

The Order provides for **additional remission** in cases where a fee is reduced or altered after being paid. The remitted amount is calculated using a **proportional formula** based on the number of days remaining in the original fee period.

##### **Case 1: Revocation or Amendment of Licence/Approval (Reducing Term or Activity)**

- **Situation**: A person pays a fee for a licence or approval, but the licence is later **revoked or amended** in a way that:
  - Reduces the duration of the licence, or
  - Changes the licensed activity, thereby reducing the required fee.

- **Remission Calculation**:
  > Remitted amount =  
  > (Fee paid ÷ Number of days in the original fee period) × (Number of days remaining in the fee period, starting from the day the revocation or amendment is approved)

- **Example**:  
  If a licence had a 365-day fee of $10,000, and the Board revokes it after 180 days, the remaining period is 185 days.  
  Remitted amount = ($10,000 ÷ 365) × 185 ≈ $5,077

> This ensures that the fee is proportionally reduced based on the time remaining after the change.

---

##### **Case 2: Change from Fixed Period Fee to Hourly Rate Fee**

- **Situation**: A person pays a **quarterly, annual, or biennial fee** (fixed period fee), but the fee structure is later changed to an **hourly rate fee**.

- **Remission Calculation**:
  > Remitted amount =  
  > (Fee paid ÷ Number of days in the original fee period) × (Number of days remaining in the fee period as of the date the change to hourly rate occurs)

- **Example**:  
  A company pays an annual fee of $20,000 (365 days). On day 100, the fee is changed to an hourly rate.  
  Remitted amount = ($20,000 ÷ 365) × 265 ≈ $14,520

> This recognizes that the company paid for a full-year commitment, but the new hourly model makes the fixed fee overpriced for the remaining time.

---

##### **Case 3: Reduction of Fee Amount**

- **Situation**: A person pays a fee for a licence or approval, and the fee is later **reduced** (e.g., due to policy changes, cost adjustments, or regulatory review).

- **Remission Calculation**:
  > Remitted amount =  
  > [(Fee paid – Current fee) ÷ Number of days in the original fee period] × (Number of days remaining in the fee period as of the date of the fee reduction)

- **Example**:  
  A licence fee was $15,000 for a 365-day period. The fee is later reduced to $12,000. On day 150, the reduction takes effect.  
  Difference = $3,000  
  Remitted amount = ($3,000 ÷ 365) × 215 ≈ $1,809

> This ensures that the entity is not charged for the difference between the original and reduced fee for the remaining days.

### **5. Key Definitions and Interpretation**
- All **words and expressions** used in this Order have the **same meaning as in the AECB Cost Recovery Fees Regulations, 1996**, ensuring consistency in interpretation.
- The "Board" refers to the **Alberta Energy Board (AEB)** or its successor regulatory body responsible for licensing and fee collection.
- A "designated officer" may be involved in approving revocations or amendments, and the date of such approval is the starting point for the remaining period.

---

### **6. Legal and Policy Implications**
- **Fairness and Accountability**: The Order promotes fairness by ensuring that fee payments are not penalized when licensing conditions change.
- **Transparency**: The formula-based approach provides clear, predictable, and transparent calculation methods for fee remission.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: By standardizing the calculation, it reduces disputes and simplifies administrative processing.
- **Compliance with Financial Administration Principles**: The Order aligns with principles of fiscal responsibility and cost recovery, ensuring that fees are only collected for actual use and service.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
The **AECB Cost Recovery Fees Remission Order, 1997** serves as a critical administrative tool to:
- Correct overpayments resulting from changes in licensing conditions,
- Provide refunds for previously refunded fees,
- Ensure equitable treatment of licensees and applicants when fees are reduced or restructured.

It reflects a balanced approach to regulatory fee management — one that respects both the need for cost recovery and the obligation to protect applicants from financial harm due to regulatory changes.

This Order remains in force and continues to apply to all fees under the referenced regulations, unless superseded by a new regulation.

**Note**: While the regulation references "AECB," it is likely a reference to the **Alberta Energy Board (AEB)** or a similar regulatory body responsible for energy licensing and cost recovery in Alberta, Canada. The exact name may vary depending on organizational evolution over time.
