**Detailed Summary of the Stelco Steel Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The Stelco Steel Remission Order is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue and the Treasury Board. This action is authorized under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the government to make orders related to the remission (i.e., partial or full cancellation) of customs duties when it is deemed to be in the public interest.

The Order is formally titled the **"Stelco Steel Remission Order"** and may be cited by that name.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **grant a partial remission of customs duties** that were previously paid by Stelco Steel (a Canadian steel manufacturer) on a specific piece of equipment: a **continuous casting system** imported into Canada.

The remission applies only to a **portion** of the customs duties originally levied under the **Customs Tariff**. It does not cancel the entire duty amount or apply to other imports or industries.

---

**3. Scope of the Remission**  
- The remission is limited to the amount specified in **Column III** of each item in the attached Schedule.
- This amount represents a **portion of the total customs duties** that were originally paid on the continuous casting system.
- The remission applies to customs duties that were:
  - Paid under the **Customs Tariff**;
  - Accounted for under a specific **customs accounting document** (identified in **Column I** of each item);
  - Imported on a specific **date** (identified in **Column II** of each item).

Thus, the remission is tied directly to the import transaction and is not a general or blanket relief.

---

**4. Conditions for the Remission**  
The remission is granted **pursuant to Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act**, which typically governs the conditions under which remissions may be made. Specifically, the following condition applies:

> A claim for remission **must be made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years** of the day on which this Order comes into effect.

This means that Stelco Steel must:
- Identify the claim within the two-year window;
- Submit it formally to the Minister of National Revenue;
- Failure to do so will result in the loss of the right to receive the remitted amount.

---

**5. Public Interest Justification**  
The Order is justified on the grounds that it is in the **public interest** to remit a portion of the duties. While the regulation does not elaborate on the specific public interest rationale, such justifications in similar cases often include:
- Promotion of industrial competitiveness;
- Support for technological advancement in domestic manufacturing;
- Encouragement of innovation and capital investment in key sectors (e.g., steel production);
- Economic benefits to the broader Canadian industrial base.

---

**6. Key Takeaways**  
- The remission is **partial**, not full, and only applies to a specific import (continuous casting system) and specific customs accounting records.
- It is **time-bound**: claims must be submitted within two years of the Order’s coming into force.
- It is **subject to administrative process**: the claim must be formally made to the Minister of National Revenue.
- The Order is **targeted and specific**, reflecting a targeted fiscal policy decision to support a particular industrial investment.

**Conclusion**  
The Stelco Steel Remission Order is a targeted, legally grounded measure that allows a portion of customs duties paid on a specific industrial import to be refunded. It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and public interest, aiming to support Canadian industry through strategic investment in manufacturing technology. However, it imposes a strict deadline for claim submission, underscoring the importance of timely administrative action by the affected party.
