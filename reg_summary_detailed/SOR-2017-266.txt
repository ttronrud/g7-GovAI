**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) Order**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, specifically **S.C. 2002, c. 29**, which is Canada’s primary legislation for protecting wildlife species at risk. The regulation is grounded in **Section 58** of SARA, which empowers the federal government to designate and protect **critical habitat** for listed species.

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA applies to the critical habitat of the Northern Abalone (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*), meaning that the designated areas where the species relies on for survival and recovery are legally protected under the Act.
- The regulation is issued pursuant to **Sections 58(4)** and **58(5)** of SARA, which allow the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) and the Environment (Minister of the Environment, through Parks Canada) to:
  - Designate critical habitat;
  - Make orders to protect it;
  - Ensure that such designation is based on scientific and environmental assessments.

---

### **2. Species at Risk Status**

- The **Northern Abalone (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*)** is classified as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to the Species at Risk Act.
- This status means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires immediate conservation action, including the protection of its essential habitat.

---

### **3. Development of the Critical Habitat Designation**

- The **Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and the Environment** jointly prepared an **action plan** for the Northern Abalone, which included a detailed scientific assessment of the species’ needs and the identification of **critical habitat**.
- This action plan was formally **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, ensuring transparency and public access to the information.
- The critical habitat identified in the plan is now legally recognized and protected under this Order.

---

### **4. Jurisdiction and Exemption from Provisions**

- The Order **does not affect any area** that is designated under **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, which refers to areas that are subject to specific provisions related to Indigenous land claims and management.
- This is a key legal safeguard: the Order does not override or interfere with Indigenous land claims or wildlife management responsibilities in those areas.

---

### **5. Consultation with Wildlife Management Boards**

- The Ministers recognize that **certain areas** identified in the critical habitat may fall within the jurisdiction of **wildlife management boards** established under **land claims agreements** with Indigenous peoples.
- In accordance with **subsection 58(8)** of SARA, the Ministers have **consulted** with the relevant wildlife management boards to ensure that the designation of critical habitat respects existing Indigenous governance and management responsibilities.
- This consultation process is a requirement under SARA to ensure that Indigenous rights and interests are respected in species conservation decisions.

---

### **6. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The **Critical Habitat of the Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) Order** formally designates specific geographic areas as **critical habitat** for the species.
- These areas are essential for the survival and recovery of the Northern Abalone, including:
  - Suitable rocky substrates for attachment;
  - Access to food sources (e.g., algae);
  - Protection from predators and environmental stressors.
- The Order legally prohibits or restricts activities that could **destroy, degrade, or otherwise interfere** with the integrity of this habitat, unless authorized under specific exemptions or permits.

---

### **7. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, meaning it becomes legally binding immediately upon publication.
- The Order was issued on **November 30, 2017**, with a copy filed in Gatineau on **September 11, 2017**, indicating a coordination process between federal offices in Ottawa and Gatineau (where Parks Canada is based).

### **8. Key Principles and Outcomes**

| Principle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scientific Basis** | The designation is based on a formal action plan and scientific assessment of the species’ ecological needs. |
| **Legal Protection** | The critical habitat is protected under SARA, making it a legally enforceable area. |
| **Transparency** | The action plan and critical habitat are publicly accessible via the Species at Risk Public Registry. |
| **Indigenous Engagement** | Consultation with wildlife management boards ensures respect for Indigenous rights and traditional land management. |
| **No Conflict with Land Claims** | The Order avoids overlapping with areas governed by Indigenous land claims under subsection 58(2)b. |

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant conservation step for the **Northern Abalone**, an endangered marine species. By formally designating its critical habitat, the federal government ensures that the areas essential for the species’ survival are protected from harmful development, exploitation, or degradation. The process reflects a balanced, science-based, and inclusive approach that respects both ecological needs and Indigenous governance structures, in full compliance with the Species at Risk Act.

This Order is a vital tool in the broader effort to recover the Northern Abalone population and prevent its extinction.
