### **Levy Structure and Application**

#### **1. Levy on Processors (Rate: $0.09 per 100 lb)**  
- **Who Pays:** Every processor operating in PEI who purchases or ships potatoes **outside PEI** for processing.
- **Rate:** $0.09 per 100 pounds (lb) of potatoes.
- **Scope:** Applies to all potatoes processed outside PEI, regardless of variety or destination.
- **Reporting Requirement:**  
  - Must remit levies to the Commodity Board **by the 15th day of each month**.  
  - Must submit a monthly statement that includes:
    - Name and address of the grower
    - Quantity of potatoes purchased or shipped

> ✅ Purpose: To track and fund the economic impact of potatoes being processed outside PEI.

---

#### **2. Levy on Dealers and Exporters (Rate: $0.13 per 100 lb)**  
- **Who Pays:** Every dealer and exporter operating in PEI who sells or ships potatoes in:
  - **Interprovincial trade** (to other Canadian provinces)
  - **Export trade** (to countries outside Canada)
- **Exemption:**  
  - Levies **do not apply** to potatoes referred to in subsection (1) — this appears to be a typographical or structural error, as no specific "referred to in subsection (1)" is defined.  
    → Likely a drafting issue; **no clear exemption is established**, so it may be a typo or omission.  
    → In practice, the levy applies to all interprovincial and export sales unless otherwise specified.

- **Rate:** $0.13 per 100 lb of potatoes sold or shipped.

- **Reporting Requirement:**  
  - Must remit levies to the Commodity Board **by the 15th day of each month**.  
  - Must submit a monthly statement that includes:
    - Quantity sold or shipped
    - Variety of potato
    - Type of pack (e.g., bag, box, bulk)

> ✅ Purpose: To generate revenue for market development, research, and support for PEI’s potato sector in broader trade channels.

### **Compliance and Enforcement**

- All levies are **monthly** and must be paid **by the 15th day of each month**.
- The Commodity Board is responsible for:
  - Receiving levy payments
  - Receiving and verifying monthly reports
  - Maintaining records
- Failure to comply may result in penalties, though no specific penalties are outlined in this Order.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered**, which is **March 15, 2016**.

> ⚠️ Note: The Order was amended or partially repealed by **SOR/2017-238, s. 1**, which repealed the definition of "person" — a likely administrative or typographical correction. The rest of the Order remains in force as written.

---

### **Key Objectives of the Regulation**

1. **Revenue Generation**:  
   - To generate funds for the potato industry through a transparent levy system.

2. **Market Transparency and Accountability**:  
   - Requires detailed reporting (grower name, quantity, variety, pack type) to ensure traceability and accountability in the supply chain.

3. **Support for Industry Development**:  
   - Funds collected are likely used for:
     - Research into potato quality and yield
     - Promotion of PEI potatoes
     - Infrastructure improvements
     - Market development (especially in interprovincial and export markets)

4. **Differential Levies Based on Activity**:  
   - Higher levy ($0.13) on dealers/exporters reflects greater market exposure and potential risk to the industry.
   - Lower levy ($0.09) on processors reflects the nature of processing as a value-added activity outside PEI.

### **Critical Observations & Notes**

- **No Exemption Clarified**: The phrase "except on potatoes that are referred to in subsection (1)" is ambiguous and appears to be a drafting error. Since subsection (1) refers to processors, and processors are subject to a different levy, the exemption is not clearly defined. This could lead to confusion or enforcement challenges.
- **Reporting Requirements Are Detailed**: The Order mandates specific data (grower name/address, variety, pack type), which supports traceability and helps the Commodity Board understand market dynamics.
- **Geographic Scope**: The levy applies only to potatoes marketed **in or out of PEI**, excluding internal PEI sales or direct farm-to-consumer transactions (unless they involve interprovincial or export marketing).
- **No Penalties Stated**: While non-compliance is implied, the Order does not specify penalties for late payments or inaccurate reporting.

### **Conclusion**

The *Prince Edward Island Potato Marketing Levies Order* establishes a structured, transparent, and revenue-generating system for the potato marketing sector in PEI. It differentiates between processors and dealers/exporters based on their market activities and imposes distinct levies to reflect their roles in the supply chain.

By requiring detailed monthly reporting and timely payments, the Order enhances accountability and provides critical data for industry planning and policy development. While minor drafting issues exist (notably the unclear exemption), the overall framework is clear and operational, supporting the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of PEI’s potato industry.

> **Status**: In force as of March 15, 2016, with minor amendments (repeal of "person" definition) effective 2017. No further changes noted in public records.
