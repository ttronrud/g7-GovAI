The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or replaced) by **Regulation SOR/2014-293, section 11**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status**:  
The specific regulation referenced is **no longer in force**. It was formally **repealed** on or around the date of the publication of **SOR/2014-293**, which is the *Supplemental Regulation 2014-293* issued by the Government of Canada.

**Repeal Mechanism**:  
Section 11 of SOR/2014-293 explicitly **repeals** (cancels) the previously existing regulation. This means that any legal provisions, requirements, or obligations established under that regulation are no longer valid or enforceable.

**Context of SOR/2014-293**:  
SOR/2014-293 is a regulatory document typically issued under a federal statute (such as the *Canada Labour Code*, *Fisheries Act*, or another enabling act), and it often contains amendments, additions, or repeals to existing rules. The repeal of a regulation under section 11 suggests that the government has determined that the prior rule is outdated, inconsistent with current policy, or redundant.

**Implications**:  
- Any legal actions, compliance obligations, or administrative procedures based on the repealed regulation are no longer valid.  
- Stakeholders (e.g., employers, employees, businesses, or regulatory bodies) must refer to current, active regulations that remain in force.  
- The repeal may reflect a broader policy shift, modernization of regulations, or consolidation of rules.

**Note on Repetition**:  
The repeated occurrence of the same line "[Repealed, SOR/2014-293, s. 11]" suggests that this may be a copy-paste error or formatting issue in the original source. In official regulatory databases, such entries are typically listed once per regulation. The repetition does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed — it simply emphasizes the repealing action.
