**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Chicken Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Alberta Chicken Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act (Alberta)**. This Order establishes specific rules governing the marketing of chickens in **interprovincial and export trade** within the province of Alberta.

It came into force on **March 25, 1999**, and is part of a broader framework designed to ensure fair, stable, and sustainable marketing practices for chicken producers in Alberta.

### **Key Definitions**

The Order defines several key terms that apply throughout its provisions:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* of Alberta. This is the enabling legislation that provides the legal foundation for the regulation of agricultural products, including chickens.

- **Chicken**: Defined as any category of chicken that is:
  - Under **six months of age**
  - Not raised or used for **egg production**
  - Includes specific types such as:
    - Broilers (fast-growing chickens raised for meat)
    - Roasters (larger, often used in retail or restaurant settings)
    - Rock Cornish hens (a specific breed of young chicken)

> *Note: The definition excludes chickens raised solely for eggs (e.g., layers), focusing only on meat-producing young chickens.*

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the **Alberta Chicken Producers Board**, established under the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* and its associated *Plan*. This body is responsible for managing and regulating the marketing of chickens.

- **Plan**: Refers to the *Alberta Chicken Producers Plan Regulations*, which provide operational guidelines and objectives for the Board’s activities, including pricing, marketing, and producer support.

### **Powers and Responsibilities of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted broad authority to regulate the **marketing of chickens in interprovincial and export markets**, with powers that mirror those it has in managing local marketing within Alberta. Specifically, the Board may:

#### 1. **Fix and Impose Levies or Charges**
- The Board may establish **levies or charges** on:
  - Whole chickens
  - Components of chickens (e.g., parts like meat, feathers, or by-products)
- These levies can be **differently applied** based on the type of producer or marketer.

#### 2. **Classify Producers into Groups**
- The Board has the power to **classify persons** (e.g., farmers, processors, distributors) involved in the production or marketing of chickens into **distinct groups**.
- Different **levies or charges** can be set for each group depending on their size, scale of operations, or role in the supply chain.

#### 3. **Collect Levies and Charges**
- The Board may **collect these levies and charges** from producers and marketers operating within Alberta.

#### 4. **Use Proceeds for Specific Purposes**
The funds collected from levies and charges may be used for:
- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize markets or manage price fluctuations)
- **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to:
  - Poor market conditions
  - Unfavorable sales or disposal of chicken
- **Equalization or adjustment of returns** among producers:
  - To ensure that producers who experience lower sales or market prices receive compensation
  - To promote equity in income distribution across the industry

> This mechanism helps protect smaller producers from market volatility and ensures a more stable and fair return on investment.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

The Order is authorized under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the government to make orders that regulate the marketing of agricultural products, particularly in interprovincial and export contexts. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food recommends the Order, and the Governor General in Council formally enacts it.

This reflects a common structure in agricultural policy: **market stabilization through producer-led boards** with financial tools to mitigate risk.

---

### **Repeal Clause**

The Order includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that it is a standalone regulation and not intended to replace or supersede other existing laws. However, the specific text provided does not indicate a full repeal of prior orders—only that this Order comes into force on March 25, 1999, and supersedes any previous conflicting provisions related to chicken marketing in interprovincial and export trade.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of the Alberta Chicken Order are:

1. **Market Stability**: To stabilize prices and reduce price volatility in interprovincial and export markets.
2. **Producer Protection**: To protect producers—especially smaller ones—from financial losses due to market downturns.
3. **Equity and Fairness**: To ensure that all producers benefit fairly from market performance through mechanisms like equalization.
4. **Financial Sustainability**: To generate revenue through levies that fund operational costs and reserve-building.
5. **Efficient Marketing**: To provide a structured and transparent system for managing the marketing of young, meat-producing chickens.

---

### **Significance and Context**

This Order is part of a larger system of **commodity boards** in Alberta, which were established to manage agricultural commodities (like wheat, canola, and poultry) through coordinated marketing and financial support. The Alberta Chicken Producers Board operates under the *Plan*, which outlines strategic goals such as:
- Maintaining stable prices
- Supporting farm income
- Promoting efficient and sustainable production

By extending the Board’s powers to interprovincial and export trade, this Order ensures that Alberta’s chicken producers are not at a disadvantage in national or international markets.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Chicken Order* is a targeted and practical regulatory tool that enables the **Alberta Chicken Producers Board** to manage the marketing of young, meat-producing chickens (under six months of age) in both domestic and international markets. It provides a structured mechanism for:
- Imposing fair levies based on producer type
- Collecting revenue
- Using funds to stabilize prices, cover losses, and ensure equitable returns

This Order strengthens the resilience of Alberta’s poultry industry by promoting market stability, protecting producers, and ensuring long-term sustainability in a competitive and volatile market environment.
