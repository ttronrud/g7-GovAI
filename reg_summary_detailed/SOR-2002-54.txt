## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

### **1. Definitions**
The regulations begin with a list of key terms used throughout:

- **Act**: Refers to *Part I of the Canada Labour Code*, which governs labour relations in federally regulated sectors (e.g., aviation, telecommunications, banking).
- **Director General**: The head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), responsible for administrative functions.
- **FMCS**: The *Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service*, a federal agency tasked with facilitating labour negotiations and resolving disputes.
- **Head of FMCS**: The senior labour program official designated as the head of the FMCS.
- **Organization**: Includes any corporation, unincorporated association, or trade union.

These definitions ensure clarity and consistency in interpreting the regulations across different parties involved in labour relations.

### **2. Delegation of Ministerial Powers**
This section establishes that certain actions normally required to be taken by the **Minister of Labour** can be carried out by either the **Head of FMCS** or the **Director General** on the Minister’s behalf.

#### Key Points:
- **General delegation**: Any notice, request, or report that may be given to or received by the Minister under the Act may be directed to or received by either the Head of FMCS or the Director General.
- **Specific delegation for arbitration requests**: Any request under subsections 57(2), (3), or (4) of the Act (which relate to appointing arbitrators or arbitration board chairpersons) may be made directly to the **Director General** on behalf of the Minister.

> This streamlines administrative processes by allowing FMCS officials to act as intermediaries without requiring direct ministerial intervention in routine matters.

The regulations define how notices, requests, and reports must be delivered to individuals or organizations.

#### Valid Methods of Service Include:
