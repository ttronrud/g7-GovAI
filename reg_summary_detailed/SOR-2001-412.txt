The provided text consists of four identical references to a repealed regulation:

**[Repealed, SOR/2006-318, s. 5]**

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that **a specific section (section 5) of a regulation** was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **SOR/2006-318**, which is the *Statutory Instrument of 2006, No. 318*.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Province of Ontario* (in the context of Ontario, Canada).
- **SOR/2006-318** is the official number and year of the regulatory instrument that repealed the section.
- **Section 5** of the previously existing regulation was removed from the legal framework effective upon the coming into force of SOR/2006-318.

### Key Points:
- The regulation referenced in section 5 is **no longer in force**.
- It was **repealed entirely**, meaning it was formally canceled and replaced or superseded by another regulation or policy.
- There is **no content provided** in the original text to describe what the section originally regulated (e.g., specific rules about licensing, fees, procedures, or standards), as the summary only includes the repeal notice.
- The repeal likely occurred to streamline regulations, correct outdated provisions, or align with new legislation or administrative policies.

### Implication:
Any legal or operational reference to the repealed section must now be updated or replaced with current regulations. Legal practitioners, government agencies, or individuals relying on this section must consult the current version of the regulation or relevant successor provisions.

### Conclusion:
This entry serves as a **repeal notice** rather than a detailed regulatory summary. It confirms that **Section 5 of the regulation referenced in SOR/2006-318 was officially canceled** and is no longer applicable. Without the original text of the section, a detailed summary of its content cannot be provided.

> ⚠️ **Note**: To obtain the original content of the repealed section, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to repeal or the official archives of the Ontario government’s legislative database (such as the Ontario Legislation website or the Statutes of Ontario).
