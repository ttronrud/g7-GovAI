**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Great Slave Lake N.W.T.) from Disposal Order***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Withdrawal of Certain Lands (Great Slave Lake N.W.T.) from Disposal Order"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a formal legal instrument under the *Territorial Lands Act* of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of land located around Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories from disposal or sale**—that is, from being available for private or commercial development.  

These lands are being **set apart and appropriated for future development as a national park**, reflecting a commitment to environmental conservation, public recreation, and the protection of natural and cultural resources.

---

### **3. Legal Basis**
The Order operates under the authority of the **Territorial Lands Act**, which governs the management, disposition, and use of land in the Northwest Territories. By withdrawing the described lands from disposal, the government ensures they will not be subject to mineral leasing, private ownership, or other forms of commercial exploitation without prior approval.

Importantly, the Order includes a **saving clause** that protects existing rights of holders of **recorded mineral claims in good standing**. This means:
- Mineral rights currently held by individuals or companies are **not extinguished**.
- These claimants retain their legal rights to explore and extract minerals beneath the withdrawn lands.
- The withdrawal does **not override** existing mineral claim titles.

### **4. Geographic Description of the Withdrawn Lands**

The lands withdrawn are located along the shores and adjacent areas of **Great Slave Lake**, one of Canada’s largest lakes and a significant ecological and cultural site. The boundary is defined in a detailed, precise sequence of bearings and distances, referencing specific topographic features and monuments.

#### **Key Components of the Boundary Description:**

- **Map Reference**:  
  The boundary is based on two primary topographic maps:
  - **Artillery Lake map sheet (75 N.W. and 75 N.E.)**, produced in **1966 at a scale of 1:500,000** by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (now Natural Resources Canada).
  - A **Parry Falls map sheet (75 K/15)**, produced in **1961 at a scale of 1:50,000**, used for a specific exception.

- **Coordinate System**:  
  All coordinates are **geodetic**, referenced to the **1927 North American Datum (NAD 27)**.

- **Total Area**:  
  The total area of the withdrawn lands is approximately **2,860 square miles** (about 7,400 square kilometers).
