**Issuing Authority:**  
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada

**Governing Legislation:**  
*Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, S.C. 2002, c. 29

- S.C. 2015, c. 10, s. 60 (amendment to SARA)

### **Background and Context**

1. **Species at Risk:**  
   The *Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis)* St. Lawrence River population is officially designated as an **endangered species** under Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This classification means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat:**  
   A formal **recovery strategy** for this population was developed and is publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*. This strategy identifies the **critical habitat**—specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species.

3. **Legal Requirement for Exclusion of Certain Areas:**  
   Under **subsection 58(2)(b)** of SARA, certain areas designated as critical habitat may be excluded if they are located within a **"place"** that is protected under federal environmental legislation.  
   - Specifically, the critical habitat that falls within **Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area** and within **five designated bird sanctuaries** (Cap-Saint-Ignace, L’Islet, Montmagny, Saint-Vallier, and Trois-Saumons) is legally required to be excluded from the official critical habitat designation.

4. **Legal Basis for Exclusion:**  
   - Subsection **58(5)** of SARA mandates that any portion of critical habitat located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)(b) must be **excluded** from the formal order establishing critical habitat.  
   - This exclusion is not a reduction in protection but a recognition that these areas are already protected under other federal environmental laws (e.g., National Wildlife Areas or Migratory Bird Sanctuaries), and thus do not require additional regulatory restrictions under SARA.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Applicability of SARA Section 58(1):**  
   Subsection 58(1) of SARA applies to the **critical habitat** of the Striped Bass St. Lawrence River population **only to the extent that it is not excluded** by the provisions of this Order.

2. **Excluded Areas (Protected Under Other Legislation):**  
   The following areas are **excluded** from the critical habitat designation under this Order:
   - **Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area**  
     → As defined in *Part III of Schedule I to the Wildlife Area Regulations*.
   - **Five Migratory Bird Sanctuaries**:
     - Cap-Saint-Ignace Bird Sanctuary  
     - L’Islet Bird Sanctuary  
     - Montmagny Bird Sanctuary  
     - Saint-Vallier Bird Sanctuary  
     - Trois-Saumons Bird Sanctuary  
     → As defined in *Part V of the Schedule to the Migratory Bird Sanctuary Regulations*.

3. **Purpose of Exclusion:**  
   These areas are already protected under existing federal environmental statutes. Excluding them from the critical habitat list avoids **duplicative or conflicting regulatory measures** and ensures that the species' protection is maintained through existing, legally enforceable conservation frameworks.

4. **Scope of the Order:**  
   The Order establishes the **critical habitat** for the Striped Bass population **only in areas not listed above**. This means that any remaining critical habitat is legally recognized and must be protected under SARA, including from activities that could harm the species or its habitat.

### **Legal and Policy Implications**

- **Compliance with SARA:**  
  The Order ensures full compliance with SARA’s requirements for identifying and protecting critical habitat while respecting existing federal land-use protections.

- **Avoidance of Regulatory Overlap:**  
  By excluding areas already protected under wildlife area or sanctuary regulations, the Order prevents overlapping or contradictory environmental assessments, permits, or restrictions.

- **Focus on Recovery:**  
  The Order directs conservation efforts toward areas that are not already protected, allowing for targeted habitat restoration, monitoring, and management actions to support the recovery of the Striped Bass population.

- **Transparency and Public Access:**  
  The recovery strategy and this Order are publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, ensuring transparency and public accountability in species conservation decisions.

### **Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette, which typically occurs shortly after publication. The exact date of registration is not specified in the text but is generally within a few days of issuance.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding instrument that:
- Confirms the critical habitat of the endangered Striped Bass St. Lawrence River population;
- Excludes specific protected areas (Cap Tourmente and five bird sanctuaries) from the critical habitat designation due to their existing federal protection;
- Ensures compliance with SARA’s requirements while respecting existing environmental protections;
- Supports the long-term recovery of the species by focusing conservation efforts on unprotected, ecologically vital areas.

This balanced approach reflects the principles of integrated environmental governance—protecting species at risk while respecting the legal and administrative frameworks that govern land and wildlife management in Canada.
