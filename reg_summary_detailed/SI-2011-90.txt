### 5. **Creditable Periods and Eligibility Rules**

#### A. **Definition of Creditable Periods**
- **Canada**:
  - Periods of contribution under the CPP
  - Periods during which a disability pension is paid
  - Periods of residence used to qualify for Old Age Security (OAS)
- **Romania**:
  - Periods of contribution and equivalent periods under Romanian legislation

#### B. **Totalizing of Periods (Key Mechanism)**
The Agreement allows **totalization** of creditable periods to determine eligibility for benefits, even if periods are earned in different countries.

##### For OAS (Canada):
- A period of presence/residence in Romania during which a person contributes to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial pension plan is **counted as a period of residence in Canada**.
- This applies to the person and their **spouse/common-law partner and dependants** who reside with them and are not subject to Romanian legislation due to employment/self-employment.

> ❌ **Reverse Rule**: A period of presence/residence in Canada where the person contributes to Romanian legislation is **not counted** as a period of residence in Canada (unless under specific conditions).

##### For CPP (Canada):
- A calendar year in which the person has **at least 3 months** of creditable periods under Romanian legislation is considered **one full creditable year** under the CPP.

##### For Romanian Old-Age/Invalidity/Death Benefits:
- A CPP creditable year is counted as **12 months** of creditable periods under Romanian law.
- A month of creditable period under the OAS Act (not overlapping with CPP) is counted as **one month** under Romanian law.

> 📌 **Purpose**: Ensures individuals do not lose benefits due to cross-border work or residence.

#### C. **Eligibility if Total Periods Are Insufficient**
- If total creditable periods (from both countries) are less than one year and no right exists under either country’s law:
  - The competent institution **does not have to pay** a benefit under this Agreement.
  - However, those periods **are still considered** when determining eligibility for benefits from the **other Party** under Chapter 1.

> ✅ **Key Point**: Periods are not wasted—they are used in eligibility assessments for the other country.

### 6. **Benefit Amount Calculations**

#### A. **For Canadians Outside Canada (OAS)**
- If a person is eligible **only through totalization**:
  - **Earnings-related portion** of the pension is calculated based on **CPP pensionable earnings**.
  - **Flat-rate portion** is calculated by:
    - Taking the flat-rate amount under CPP.
    - Multiplying it by the **ratio of actual CPP contributions to the minimum qualifying period**.
    - The ratio **cannot exceed 1.0** (i.e., maximum is full flat-rate).

> Example: If someone has 50% of the required CPP contributions, they receive 50% of the flat-rate amount.

#### B. **For Romanians Eligible via Totalization**
- The **theoretical benefit** is calculated as if all creditable periods were completed under Romanian law.
- The **actual benefit** is then reduced based on the **ratio of Romanian creditable periods to totalized creditable periods**.

> Example: If 60% of total periods are Romanian, the benefit is 60% of the theoretical amount.

#### C. **Population-Based Benefits**
- If the benefit amount depends on the number of beneficiaries, the Romanian institution must also consider individuals who **reside or stay in Canada**.

> ✅ Ensures fairness in benefit distribution.

  - Implementing
