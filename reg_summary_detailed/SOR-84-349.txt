### **Key Provisions**

1. **Applicable Entity:**  
   The **Peace River-Liard Regional District** is the recipient of the services and is legally obligated to pay the prescribed fees.

2. **Services Covered:**  
   The regulation applies to two core services:  
   - **Water supply** (provision of potable water)  
   - **Sewage disposal** (collection, treatment, and removal of wastewater)

3. **Source of Services:**  
   The services are provided by and from the **Fort St. John Airport**, which operates as a federally supported infrastructure providing essential utilities to the Regional District.

4. **Legal Basis for Charges:**  
   The charges are authorized under:  
   - **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Minister of Transport to make orders setting fees for services provided under federal agreements.  
   - **Order in Council P.C. 1983-3759**, which provides the overarching authority for the Minister to establish charges for such services.  
   - The **prior agreement** entered into between the Peace River-Liard Regional District and Her Majesty in Right of Canada under **Order in Council P.C. 1983-3643 (17 November 1983)**, which outlines the terms and conditions of service delivery and financial obligations.

5. **Fee Structure:**  
   The exact fees are specified in an **annexed schedule** (not included in the provided text). This schedule details:  
   - The specific charges (e.g., per-unit rates, flat fees, or volume-based pricing)  
   - The applicable service components (e.g., water volume, sewage volume, or service area)  
   - Any applicable timeframes or billing cycles  

6. **Citation and Reference:**  
   The Order may be cited as:  
   **"Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Services Charges Order (Peace River-Liard Regional District)"**

7. **Publication Note:**  
   Although the Order is referenced in the *Canada Gazette Part II*, it is **not published in that issue** — indicating it may have been issued as a supplementary or internal document, or published separately in a different format or later.

### **Implications and Context**

- This regulation reflects a **federal-provincial partnership** in infrastructure delivery, where a federal facility (Fort St. John Airport) provides essential utility services to a regional district.  
- The fees are not arbitrary but are tied to a formal agreement and statutory authority, ensuring transparency and accountability.  
- The use of the *Financial Administration Act* underscores that the charges are part of a structured, government-administered financial framework, not discretionary pricing.  
- The agreement under P.C. 1983-3643 likely established the scope, duration, and conditions of service, while this Order sets the **monetary terms** for those services.

---

### **Limitations and Notes**

- The **schedule of fees is not included** in the provided text, so the exact amounts, rates, or volume-based formulas cannot be determined from this summary.  
- The Order does not specify whether the charges are subject to review, adjustment, or audit.  
- There is no mention of dispute resolution, service quality standards, or penalties for non-payment — suggesting these are governed by the underlying agreement (P.C. 1983-3643).

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **statutory instrument** that legally authorizes and prescribes the fees the Peace River-Liard Regional District must pay for water and sewage services provided by the Fort St. John Airport. It operates under federal legislative authority and is rooted in a formal agreement between the Regional District and the federal government. While it establishes a clear financial framework, the absence of the fee schedule limits the full operational detail, and its non-publication in the *Canada Gazette Part II* may indicate a more administrative or internal nature.

This Order ensures that the cost of essential utility services is transparent, legally binding, and consistent with federal financial administration standards.
