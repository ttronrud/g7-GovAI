Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Children’s Sleepwear Regulations* (S.C. 2010, c. 21), enacted under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act* and made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Health.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Children’s Sleepwear Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

### 🔹 **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
- These regulations were issued under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**.
- The authority stems from the Minister of Health's recommendation to the Governor General in Council.
- Purpose: To ensure the **safety of children’s sleepwear** with respect to **flame resistance**, **toxicity**, and **labeling requirements**, particularly in relation to children’s health and safety.

### 🔹 **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CGSB** | Canadian General Standards Board — responsible for developing and maintaining national standards for products, including textiles. |
| **Char length** | The maximum extent of material damage (charring) resulting from a flame test. Measured in millimeters (mm). |
| **Loose-fitting sleepwear** | Includes nightgowns, nightshirts, dressing gowns, bathrobes, housecoats, robes, pyjamas, and baby-doll pyjamas **up to size 14X**. Excludes: infant sleepwear (≤7 kg), hospital-use sleepwear, polo pyjamas, and sleepers. |
| **Tight-fitting sleepwear** | All sleepwear in sizes up to 14X that is **not** loose-fitting. Includes: infant sleepwear (≤7 kg), hospital-use sleepwear, polo pyjamas, and sleepers. |

> ⚠️ *Note: The distinction between tight and loose-fitting sleepwear is critical for determining required safety standards.*

### 🔹 **3. Flame Resistance Requirements**

#### ✅ For **Tight-Fitting Sleepwear**:
- Must pass the **CGSB CAN/CGSB-4.2 No. 27.5** flame resistance test (45° angle, one-second flame impingement).
- Required **time of flame spread must exceed 7 seconds**.
- This ensures that tight-fitting garments (which are more likely to ignite and spread fire) do not burn rapidly.

#### ✅ For **Loose-Fitting Sleepwear**:
- Must be tested using **Schedule 1 procedures** (based on U.S. CPSC standards).
- Must meet **two criteria**:
  1. **Average char length** across five specimens must **not exceed 178 mm**.
  2. **No more than one specimen** may have a char length equal to the **full length of the specimen** (i.e., no complete charring).

> 💡 *This means that even if one piece fails slightly, as long as the average is under 178 mm and only one piece reaches full length, the garment passes.*

### 🔹 **4. Toxicity and Safety Requirements for Flame-Retardant-Treated Sleepwear**

If any loose-fitting sleepwear is **treated with a flame retardant**, the following **toxicological safety thresholds** must be met:

#### ❌ Prohibited Effects:
The flame retardant or any extractable component **must not** cause:
1. **Acute lethality**:
   - Oral exposure: ≤500 mg/kg body weight (based on OECD Test No. 401).
   - Dermal exposure: ≤1000 mg/kg body weight (based on OECD Test No. 402).
2. **Dermal irritation**:
   - Erythema (redness) or edema (swelling) graded at a **mean >1** (based on OECD Test No. 404).
3. **Dermal sensitization**:
   - >15% of test animals respond in **Draize or Buehler tests** (adjuvant-based).
   - >30% of test animals respond in **five other OECD 406 tests** with adjuvant.
4. **Gene mutation or chromosomal aberration**:
   - Detected via in vitro or in vivo mutagenicity tests (OECD Test No. 471, 473, 474, 475, etc.).
5. **Tumorigenicity (cancer potential)**:
   - Must not induce tumors in oral route studies (OECD Test No. 451).

> 🚫 These tests are mandatory to ensure that flame retardants do not pose **acute or chronic health risks** to children.

---

### 🔹 **5. Labeling Requirements for Flame-Retardant-Treated Sleepwear**

All flame-retardant-treated loose-fitting sleepwear must have a **permanently affixed label** that clearly states:
- The words **“flame retardant”** and **“ignifugeant”** (a technical term meaning fire-resistant).
- Clear and legible **instructions in both English and French** for care, especially:
  - Cleaning procedures.
  - Avoidance of treatments or agents that could **reduce flame resistance** (e.g., bleaching, harsh detergents, dry cleaning with certain solvents).

> 🔍 *This ensures consumers are informed about how to maintain the garment’s safety over time.*

---

### 🔹 **6. Testing and Washing Procedures**

#### A. **General Testing Protocol**
- Four specimens (89 mm × 254 mm) are cut from the garment:
  - Two in the **lengthwise direction**.
  - Two in the **crosswise direction**.
- All layers in multilayered fabrics must be preserved and maintained in relative position.
- Each specimen must be **labeled with the direction of cut**.

#### B. **Flammability Testing**
- The specimens are tested using **Standard FF 5-74** (U.S. CPSC, 1985), which includes:
  - Paragraphs 1616.5(a), (b), and (c)(1)–(3).
- The **average char length** is calculated for:
  - Lengthwise specimens.
  - Crosswise specimens.
- A **fifth specimen** is cut in the direction of the **longest average char length** and tested separately.

> ✅ Final result: The **average char length across all five specimens** must meet the 178 mm limit.

---

### 🔹 **7. Washing and Drying Procedures (to assess durability of flame resistance)**

#### For **Non-Flame-Retardant Loose-Fitting Sleepwear**:
- Must undergo:
  - **One washing cycle** (per Section 3, with exceptions in paragraphs (b) and (e)).
  - **One drying cycle** (per Section 4).
- If labeled **“dry clean only”**, must be **dry cleaned once** (per Method 30.3 of CGSB CAN2-4.2-M77), **excluding sections 3.2 and 5.5–5.7**.

#### For **Flame-Retardant-Treated Sleepwear**:
- Must undergo:
  - **20 successive washing cycles** (same washing procedure).
  - **One drying cycle**.
- If labeled **“do not bleach”**, avoid bleaching during washing (but still complete 20 washes).
- If labeled **“dry clean only”**, must be **dry cleaned five times** (successively).

> 🔍 *These cycles simulate real-world use and ensure flame retardants remain effective over time.*

---

### 🔹 **8. Apparatus and Chemical Specifications**

#### Washing Conditions (based on CGSB Method 58):
- **Water temperature**: 58°C to 62°C.
- **Water hardness**: Less than 50 ppm calcium carbonate.
- **Washing machine**: Normal cycle (for automatic machines).
- **Detergent**: Must comply with **CGSB 2-GP-115M** (standard for laundry detergents).
- **Bleach agent**: Must produce **0.015% available chlorine** when added.

#### Drying Conditions:
- Must follow the drying procedures in **Sections 4.2 and 7.5 of CGSB Method 58**.

> ✅ These standardized conditions ensure consistent and reproducible testing.

### 🔹 **9. Toxicity Testing Procedures (OECD-Based)**

All flame retardant components must be tested using internationally recognized OECD guidelines:

| Test | Purpose | OECD Standard |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **OECD 401** | Acute oral toxicity | Dose ≤500 mg/kg |
| **OECD 402** | Acute dermal toxicity | Dose ≤1000 mg/kg |
| **OECD 404** | Dermal irritation | Mean grade >1 = failure |
| **OECD 406** | Dermal sensitization | >15% (Draize/Buehler) or >30% (other adjuvant tests) |
| **OECD 471, 473, 474, 475, 480** | Gene mutation & chromosomal aberrations | In vitro and in vivo tests |
| **OECD 451** | Tumorig
