**Detailed Summary of the Annex Code 9075 Sales Tax Remission Order**

**Title:**  
*Annex Code 9075 Sales Tax Remission Order*

**Purpose:**  
This regulation establishes a mechanism for the remission (i.e., refund or offset) of sales tax on certain machinery and other goods imported into Canada, specifically in cases where customs duties are subject to drawback under *Code 9075 of the Customs Tariff*. The remission is designed to correct the overpayment of sales tax that results when the duty-paid value (DPV) used to calculate sales tax is not reduced by the amount of drawback claimed on the imported goods.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Scope of Application:**  
   The remission applies to:
   - All machinery and other goods imported into Canada.
   - Goods for which customs duties are subject to drawback under *Code 9075 of the Customs Tariff*.

2. **Trigger for Remission:**  
   Remission is granted when there is a difference between:
   - The **sales tax paid or payable** on the imported machinery or goods, based on the original duty-paid value (DPV), and  
   - The **sales tax that would have been payable** if the duty-paid value had been reduced by the amount of the drawback.

   In other words, if a taxpayer claims drawback (a refund of customs duty paid) on imported goods, the value used to calculate sales tax is effectively reduced. However, if the sales tax was originally calculated using the full duty-paid value, the taxpayer has overpaid sales tax. This Order provides for a remission of that overpayment.

3. **Calculation of Remission Amount:**  
   The amount of sales tax remitted is equal to the **difference** between:
   - The actual sales tax paid or otherwise due (based on the original DPV), and  
   - The sales tax that would have been due if the DPV had been reduced by the amount of the drawback.

   This ensures that the taxpayer is not penalized for the reduction in the duty-paid value due to the drawback claim, which in turn aligns the sales tax liability with the actual economic value of the goods.

4. **Legal Citation:**  
   This Order may be cited as *Annex Code 9075 Sales Tax Remission Order*, reflecting its connection to the specific tariff code under which duties are subject to drawback.

**Policy Rationale:**  
The regulation addresses a potential double burden or overpayment in the tax system:
- Customs duties are often refunded (drawback) when goods are re-exported or used in a different way than originally intended.
- Sales tax is typically calculated based on the duty-paid value of imported goods.
- When drawback is claimed, the duty-paid value is reduced, which should reduce the sales tax liability.
- However, if sales tax was already paid on the full duty-paid value, the taxpayer has effectively overpaid sales tax. This Order ensures that the overpayment is corrected through a formal remission.

This mechanism promotes fairness and accuracy in the tax system by aligning sales tax obligations with the actual value of the imported goods after drawback is applied.

**Implications for Taxpayers and Importers:**  
- Importers who claim drawback under Code 9075 are entitled to a remission of sales tax equal to the difference described above.
- The remission must be claimed in accordance with applicable procedures and timelines set by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
- It reduces the overall tax burden on machinery and other goods where drawback is applicable, supporting efficient trade and investment.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Annex Code 9075 Sales Tax Remission Order* ensures that when customs duties are refunded (drawback) on imported machinery or goods, the corresponding sales tax overpayment is appropriately offset. By remitting the difference between the original sales tax and the sales tax that would have applied after the reduction in duty-paid value, the regulation enhances tax equity and prevents double taxation. It is a critical component of the Canada Revenue Agency’s framework for managing both customs and sales tax obligations in the context of imported goods.
