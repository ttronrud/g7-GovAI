### **Core Provision: Levy Collection**

#### **1. Levy Amount and Application**
- Every **buyer, assembler, or processor** who purchases, assembles, or processes pulse crops must **deduct a levy of 1% of the gross value** of the pulse crops being marketed in **interprovincial or export trade**.
- This levy applies to all pulse crops marketed outside Saskatchewan (i.e., interprovincial sales or exports).
- The levy is **deducted from payments made to producers**.

> Example: If a buyer purchases $100,000 worth of pulse crops for interprovincial or export trade, a levy of $1,000 (1%) must be deducted and remitted to the Board.

#### **2. Exemption Clause**
- Pulse crops produced **at or under the direction of any research institution** (e.g., government or academic research farms) are **exempt from the levy**.
- This exemption supports research and development activities aimed at improving crop yield, quality, and sustainability.

### **Reporting and Remittance Requirements**

#### **1. Timely Submission**
- Each buyer, assembler, or processor must **forward the deducted levy** to the Saskatchewan Pulse Crop Development Board **not later than the 20th day of the month following the month in which the pulse crops were purchased**.

> Example: If pulse crops were bought in June, the levy must be remitted by **July 20**.

#### **2. Required Documentation**
- Each monthly remittance must include a **detailed list** containing:
  - The **names of all producers** from whom pulse crops were purchased;
  - The **amount of levy deducted** from each producer;
