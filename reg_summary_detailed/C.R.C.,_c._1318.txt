### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Branch Office**: Refers to the *Canada Branch of the International Labour Office* (Succursale).

### **3. Juridical Personality of the ILO**
The International Labour Organization is granted **full juridical personality**, meaning it is recognized as a **body corporate** with the following legal capacities:
- The ability to **enter into contracts**;

This recognition allows the ILO to function independently in legal and financial matters, similar to a sovereign entity.

### **4. Immunity from Legal Proceedings**
The ILO, its property, and its assets—**regardless of location or ownership**—enjoy **immunity from suit and all forms of judicial process**, comparable to that of **foreign governments**, with two important exceptions:
- The ILO may **waive its immunity** for specific proceedings or contractual obligations.

> *Note:* This immunity applies to all legal actions, including civil, criminal, and administrative suits.
