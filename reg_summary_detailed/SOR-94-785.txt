*(Repealed in part: SOR/2016-156, s. 2; certain provisions repealed in SOR/2000-242, s. 1)*

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**
The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board) enacted these regulations to:
- Establish a **retirement compensation arrangement** (a supplementary pension plan) for certain public servants and members of specific federal institutions.
- Provide a **structured, voluntary retirement benefit** that supplements the standard public service pension.
- Ensure **fair and consistent treatment** of individuals who had or were transitioning into retirement after December 15, 1994.
- Allow for **flexible participation**, with contributions based on salary and service duration, and benefits calculated in relation to pensionable service.

These regulations were introduced to meet the objectives of the *Special Retirement Arrangements Act*, particularly in addressing retirement needs for individuals who may not qualify fully under the standard Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA), especially those with long service or special status.

## 📚 **Core Provisions of the Regulation**

---

### ✅ **1. Who Is Covered by the Retirement Compensation Arrangement?**

A person becomes eligible **if any of the following apply**:

1. **On or after December 15, 1994**, the person is required to contribute to:
   - The **Public Service Pension Fund (PSPF)** or **Superannuation Account**
   - The **Canadian Forces Superannuation Account** or **Canadian Forces Pension Fund**
   - The **Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Account** or **RCMP Pension Fund**

2. **Is or has been a deputy head** with **at least 10 years of pensionable service** under the PSSA and **elects**, under section 7 of the Act, to participate **before ceasing employment**.

3. **Immediately before December 15, 1994**, was deemed by section 14 of the PSSA to be employed in the public service.

> This creates a **transition mechanism** for individuals who were already in the public service but whose retirement benefits were being calculated under the old system.

---

### ✅ **2. How Do Participants Contribute?**

#### **For Deputy Heads (Part I – Paragraph 4(d))**
- Must contribute at **twice the applicable rate** under section 5(2) of the PSSA (excluding subsection 5(6)).
- If **aggregate pensionable service** (PSSA + other service + elected period) exceeds **35 years**, the **excess period** is taxed at **twice the rate under section 5(3)** of the PSSA (again, excluding 5(6)).
- Contributions are based on the **salary at the last day of employment as a deputy head**, adjusted periodically for salary range changes.

#### **For Persons Deemed Employed (Part I – Paragraph 4(e))**
- Must contribute at the **rate and salary level** established under **section 14 of the PSSA as it read immediately before December 15, 1994**.
- If aggregate service exceeds 35 years, the **excess service** is taxed at the **same rate** as in section 14 (as it existed before Dec 15, 1994).

> These rates are **double** the standard PSSA contribution rates, making this a **more generous voluntary plan**.

---

### ✅ **3. Contribution Payment Schedule**

- Contributions must be paid **monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually**.
- Payments must be made **before the end of the relevant period**.
- Must be sent directly to the **Minister**.

---

### ✅ **4. Election and Revocation**

- An election to participate must be:
  - In **writing**
  - **Signed and dated**
  - State the intention to participate
  - Specify the **period of contribution**
  - Delivered or mailed to the Minister **within 60 days** of the start date.

- A participant may **revoke** the election at any time in writing, **only for the remainder of the period** not yet contributed to.

- A participant may **suspend** the election for any portion of the remaining period.

> This gives flexibility, but only for **unpaid portions**.

---

### ✅ **5. What Happens If Contributions Are Not Paid?**

- If a contribution is **unpaid at the end of the period** and the election is **not revoked**:
  - The Minister issues a **written notice** demanding payment within **60 days**.
- If unpaid after 60 days:
  - **Deductions are made from future benefits**:
    - **Monthly benefits**: Deducted in **equal installments** up to:
      - The unpaid amount ÷ number of months unpaid, **or**
      - **30% of the gross monthly benefit** (whichever is less)
    - **Lump sum option**: Participant may choose to receive the full unpaid amount **at the time of benefit commencement**.
  - In all other cases, the amount is deducted **in a lump sum** at the time the benefit starts.

> This ensures that **non-payment does not result in a loss of benefits**, but instead results in **reduced future payments**.

---

### ✅ **6. When Does Participation End?**

A participant remains subject to the arrangement until the **earlier of**:

1. The day before they reach:
   - **Age 60** if they are a **Group 1 contributor** (under subsection 12(0.1) of PSSA)
   - **Age 65** if they are a **Group 2 contributor** (under subsection 12.1(1) of PSSA)

2. Revocation of the election

3. Re-employment in the public service (requiring contributions to PSSA or PSPF)

4. Commencement of an annuity or annual allowance under PSSA

5. Expiration of the elected contribution period

6. Election to **transfer accrued pension benefits** to an eligible employer

7. Death of the participant

> Participation ends upon **any of these events**, regardless of age or service.

---

### ✅ **7. Benefit Payment Rules**

- Benefits are **only payable** for periods of service for which **contributions were made or are payable**.
- **No double benefits**:
  - If a participant is entitled to a benefit under the **Canadian Forces Superannuation Act**, **RCMP Superannuation Act**, or **Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act**, **no benefit** is payable under this arrangement for that period.
  - However, the participant **is entitled to a return of contributions** (with interest) under this plan for that period.

> This prevents overlap and ensures **non-duplication** of benefits.

---

### ✅ **8. Transfer of Benefits to Eligible Employers**

If a participant is transferred to an **eligible employer** (e.g., a private company), and the employer has an **external retirement compensation arrangement** (a private pension plan), then:

- The Minister may transfer to that employer:
  - The **lesser of
