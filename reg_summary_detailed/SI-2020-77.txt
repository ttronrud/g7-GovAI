---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11)**. It is being made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** and the **Treasury Board**. This demonstrates that the decision is both politically and administratively supported, with the government recognizing the public interest in providing relief during a period of significant economic disruption.

The purpose of the regulation is to **grant remission (i.e., a partial or full waiver) of broadcasting licence fees** for a specific period, specifically to assist broadcasting licensees affected by the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

### **2. Scope of the Remission**

- **Who is eligible?**  
  Any person who holds a valid broadcasting licence under one of the following regulatory frameworks:
  - *Radio Regulations, 1986* (Section 2)
  - *Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987* (Section 2)
  - *Discretionary Services Regulations* (Section 1)

  These definitions cover all types of licensed broadcasting undertakings in Canada, including radio, television, and certain discretionary services.

- **What fees are being remitted?**  
  The remission applies to **licence fees paid or payable under paragraph 3(b) of the Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997**. This specifically refers to **Part II licence fees**, which are typically the annual fees associated with operating a broadcasting licence.

- **Time Period Covered:**  
  The remission applies to the **period from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021** — a full fiscal year that coincided with the onset and peak of the global pandemic.

- **Includes Interest:**  
  The remission covers not only the principal fees but also **any interest** that may have accrued on those fees during the period.

### **3. Conditions for Eligibility and Remission**

To qualify for the remission, the licensee must meet **three specific conditions**:

#### **Condition 1: Financial Impact Due to COVID-19**
- The licensee must provide an **attestation (formal declaration)** to the **Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)**.
- This attestation must be submitted **on or before January 31, 2021**.
- The attestation must state that the **COVID-19 pandemic had a significant financial impact** on the broadcasting undertaking.
- More specifically, the licensee must demonstrate that the pandemic caused an **estimated reduction of 25% or more in revenues** directly related to their broadcasting operations.

> *Note:* This threshold (25%) is designed to ensure that only those who experienced a material financial downturn due to the pandemic are eligible, preventing abuse or broad application to minor or non-pandemic-related financial challenges.

#### **Condition 2: Continued Operation of the Broadcasting Undertaking**
- The licensee must **continue to operate their broadcasting service** for a minimum of **two full years** after the date the remission is granted.
- This condition ensures that the relief is not used as a mechanism to terminate operations or exit the broadcasting sector, and that the service remains available to the public.

#### **Condition 3: Compliance with Broadcasting Regulations**
- The licensee must **continue to comply with the requirements of the Broadcasting Act** and their specific licence conditions, particularly regarding:
  - **Exhibition of Canadian content** (e.g., programming that is produced in Canada and reflects Canadian culture, language, and values).
- This compliance must be maintained for **at least two years after the remission is granted**.

> *Rationale:* This condition ensures that the public interest in Canadian content is preserved, even during times of financial hardship. It prevents licensees from using the remission as a way to reduce or suspend compliance with national broadcasting standards.

### **4. Public Interest and Policy Rationale**

The regulation reflects a **public interest decision** made in response to the unprecedented economic and operational challenges posed by the **global pandemic**. Key considerations include:

- **Supporting the stability of the broadcasting sector** during a time of uncertainty.
- Recognizing that many broadcasters faced **revenue losses due to closures, reduced advertising, and audience shifts**.
- Maintaining the **availability and diversity of Canadian media** by preventing the collapse of essential services.
- Ensuring **fairness and accountability** through clear, measurable criteria (e.g., 25% revenue drop, two-year compliance).

### **5. Key Dates and Deadlines**

| Event | Deadline |
|------|----------|
| Submission of attestation to CRTC | January 31, 2021 |
| Remission applies to | April 1, 2020 – March 31, 2021 |
| Minimum operational requirement | Two years after remission is granted |
| Minimum compliance requirement | Two years after remission is granted |

> *Note:* The attestation deadline is critical — failure to meet it results in ineligibility for the remission, even if other conditions are met.

### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply to all licence fees** — only those under **paragraph 3(b)** of the Broadcasting Licence Fee Regulations, 1997 (Part II).
- It does **not extend to future periods** beyond March 31, 2021.
- The remission is **not retroactive** to periods before April 1, 2020.

### **7. Enforcement and Oversight**

  - Receiving and verifying the attestation.
  - Ensuring compliance with the two-year operational and content requirements.
- The **Minister of Canadian Heritage** and the **Treasury Board** retain oversight of the implementation and policy framework.
- The CRTC may conduct audits or reviews to verify that the licensee continues to meet the conditions post-remission.

---

### **Conclusion**

This remission order is a targeted, temporary, and conditionally structured policy intervention designed to:

- Provide **financial relief** to broadcasting licensees who suffered significant revenue losses due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**,
- Maintain **public access to Canadian broadcasting services**,

It balances compassion with accountability, ensuring that relief is granted only to those who meet rigorous, measurable criteria and commit to continuing their service and compliance obligations.

**In essence:** This regulation is a pandemic-responsive measure that offers a one-time fee waiver to affected broadcasters, contingent on proof of financial hardship, continued operation, and ongoing compliance with Canadian broadcasting standards.
