**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to make orders related to the remission (i.e., cancellation or reduction) of customs duties when it is in the public interest.

The Order is formally titled the **Aluminerie de Bécancour Remission Order** and may be cited by that name.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (forgive or refund) customs duties** that were paid or would have been payable by **Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc.** on specific **aluminum smelting equipment** imported into Canada. The remission is granted to support the company’s investment in its smelting operations at the Bécancour facility in Quebec, which is a key player in Canada’s aluminum production sector.

This action is taken in the **public interest**, suggesting that the government believes the investment in aluminum production supports national economic objectives—such as energy efficiency, industrial competitiveness, and the development of domestic manufacturing capacity.

**3. Definition of Key Term**  
- **"Purchase order number"** refers to the unique identifier assigned by Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc. to each purchase of equipment for its smelter in Bécancour, Quebec. This number is used to track and verify the specific transaction eligible for remission.

**4. Scope of Remission**  
Under **Section 3**, the government grants a **remission of customs duties** to Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc. for the **smelting equipment** listed in the **schedule annexed to the Order**.  
- The remission applies to duties that were **already paid** or that are **still payable** under the **Customs Tariff** (Canada’s tariff system that classifies and taxes imported goods).  
- The equipment must be specifically listed in the schedule attached to the Order to qualify.

This means that the company will not be required to pay the full customs duty on these specific items, effectively reducing the cost of importing the equipment.

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to a strict condition:  
- Aluminerie de Bécancour Inc. must **submit a formal claim for remission** to the **Minister of National Revenue**.  
- The claim must be made **on or before December 31, 1989**.

This deadline is critical and imposes a time-bound obligation on the company. Failure to meet this deadline will result in the **loss of the remission benefit**.

**7. Limitations and Exclusions**  
- The remission applies **only to the specific equipment listed in the schedule**.
