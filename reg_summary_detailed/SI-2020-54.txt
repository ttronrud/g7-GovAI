**1. Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is issued under **section 10 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) Implementation Act** (S.C. 2020, c. 1). This section provides the legal authority for the designation of a specific federal minister to serve in a designated role related to the implementation of the CUSMA. The purpose is to ensure that a designated minister has the necessary authority and official standing to carry out duties related to CUSMA implementation.

**2. Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

- **Designation of the Minister for International Trade:**  
  The Minister for International Trade is formally designated as the minister responsible for the purposes of the CUSMA Implementation Act. This means that, in all official, administrative, and legal contexts under the Act, the Minister for International Trade is recognized as the primary federal minister accountable for the implementation of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement.

- **Membership in the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada:**  
  The regulation confirms that the Minister for International Trade is a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada. This is a formal recognition of the minister’s status as a senior official in the federal government, granting them the authority to act on behalf of the Crown in certain official capacities, including in the context of international trade policy and CUSMA implementation.

- **Authority and Responsibility:**  
  By being designated as the Minister "for the purposes of that Act," the Minister is empowered to:
  - Provide official direction and oversight for CUSMA implementation;
  - Coordinate with Canadian agencies, provincial governments, and international partners;
  - Issue orders, directives, and policy guidance related to compliance, enforcement, and trade measures under CUSMA;
  - Represent Canada in intergovernmental and international discussions related to the Agreement.

**3. Purpose and Significance:**

- **Clarity of Accountability:**  
  The designation ensures that there is a single, clearly identified minister responsible for CUSMA implementation, which enhances accountability, transparency, and coordination across government departments.

- **Legal and Administrative Effect:**  
  The regulation provides the necessary legal framework for the Minister to act under the authority of the CUSMA Implementation Act. It enables the minister to exercise powers, issue directives, and make decisions that are legally binding under the Act.

- **Alignment with CUSMA Implementation:**  
  CUSMA, as a comprehensive trade agreement, requires robust and coordinated implementation across multiple government sectors. This designation ensures that the federal government has a clear focal point for trade policy, dispute resolution, and compliance with CUSMA obligations.

**4. Context and Background:**

- The *Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act* (S.C. 2020, c. 1) was enacted to provide the legislative framework for implementing the CUSMA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It establishes procedures for enforcement, dispute resolution, and coordination among federal departments.

- Section 10 of the Act specifically allows the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to designate a minister to serve as the designated minister for the purposes of the Act. This is a procedural mechanism to ensure that the right minister is appointed to fulfill the responsibilities tied to the Agreement.

---

**5. Practical Implications:**

- The Minister for International Trade becomes the central point of contact for:
  - Trade compliance and enforcement;
  - Monitoring of CUSMA provisions;
  - Liaison with U.S. and Mexican counterparts;
  - Oversight of sectoral implementation (e.g., agriculture, automotive, services).

- This designation strengthens the federal government’s ability to manage the complex obligations of CUSMA, including regulatory alignment, dispute settlement, and economic cooperation.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally appoints the Minister for International Trade as the designated minister under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act. By designating this minister as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council and as the responsible minister for the Act, the regulation ensures that the federal government has a clear, legally recognized authority to lead and coordinate the implementation of CUSMA. This enhances governance, accountability, and effectiveness in managing Canada’s key trade relationship with the United States and Mexico.
