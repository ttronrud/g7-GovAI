**Detailed Summary of the Regulation (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 47)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The regulation, found in **Statutory Instrument S.C. 1991, c. 24, section 47**, is a directive issued by the **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**) under **section 157a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. Its primary purpose is to **discontinue the preparation and submission to Parliament of a specific set of annual reports** that were previously required under various Acts of Parliament.

These reports, although previously mandated by law, were found to contain **either the same information as, or less information than**, what is already provided in the **Public Accounts** or in **expenditure estimates** submitted to Parliament. Since Parliament already has access to comprehensive financial and operational data through these established mechanisms, the duplication or redundancy of these reports is deemed unnecessary and inefficient.

### **Legal Basis**

- **Section 157a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** empowers the Governor in Council to:
  - Discontinue or modify the submission of reports or documents to Parliament if they are found to be redundant or not adding new or valuable information.
  - Ensure that parliamentary oversight remains effective and cost-efficient.
- The provision allows for the **removal of reports** that do not provide unique or essential information to Parliament, especially when such information is already available elsewhere.

---

### **Scope of the Discontinuation**

The regulation formally **discontinues** the following annual reports, which were previously required to be laid before either House of Parliament:

| Report Title | Relevant Act and Section |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Annual Report on the Administration of the Canada Student Loans Act | Canada Student Loans Act, s. 22 |
| Annual Report on the Administration of the Old Age Security Act | Old Age Security Act, s. 47 |

### **Key Rationale**

1. **Redundancy of Information**:
   - The reports were found to contain **information already available** in:
     - The **Public Accounts** (a comprehensive account of government spending and financial operations).
     - **Expenditure estimates** (which outline budget allocations and projected costs).
   - Therefore, the reports did not provide **new, distinct, or unique insights** into government operations or financial performance.

2. **Efficiency and Cost Reduction**:
   - Maintaining multiple parallel reports increases administrative burden and costs for government departments and Parliament.
   - Eliminating redundant submissions streamlines reporting and reduces duplication.

3. **Enhanced Transparency and Oversight**:
   - By consolidating information into the Public Accounts and estimates, Parliament gains a more **coherent, integrated, and comprehensive view** of government operations.
   - This improves the quality of parliamentary scrutiny without adding unnecessary layers of reporting.

4. **Compliance with Financial Administration Principles**:
   - The regulation aligns with the broader principles of the Financial Administration Act, which emphasize **efficiency, accountability, and transparency** in government financial reporting.

### **Effective Date and Impact**

- The directive takes effect **immediately upon publication** in the *Canada Gazette* (as part of S.C. 1991, c. 24).
- **No further reports** of the listed types are to be prepared or submitted to either House of Parliament.
- Government departments responsible for producing these reports are **no longer required** to compile or file them.

---

### **Implications for Government and Parliament**

- **For Government Departments**:
  - Eliminates administrative work and reporting obligations related to these 11 annual reports.
  - Reduces costs and allows resources to be redirected to more strategic or impactful reporting areas.

- **For Parliament**:
  - Gains access to the same information through the Public Accounts and expenditure estimates, without needing additional reports.
  - Ensures that parliamentary oversight remains robust and focused on high-value, non-redundant information.

- **For Public Accountability**:
  - Maintains accountability through existing mechanisms (Public Accounts, estimates) while removing outdated or duplicative reporting.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant step toward **streamlining government reporting** and enhancing the **efficiency of parliamentary oversight**. By discontinuing redundant annual reports, the Government of Canada ensures that financial and operational information is presented in a **clear, consolidated, and accessible format**—without unnecessary duplication. It reflects a modernization of public financial governance, aligning with best practices in transparency, accountability, and administrative efficiency.

> **In essence**: The regulation removes 11 outdated or redundant annual reports because they duplicate information already available in Parliament’s existing financial records—thereby saving time, reducing costs, and improving the quality of oversight.
