**Detailed Summary of the *Certain Canada Port Authorities Divestiture Regulations* (S.C. 1992, c. 46, s. 22)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Certain Canada Port Authorities Divestiture Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued by the **Treasury Board of Canada**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**, under two key statutory authorities:

- **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)**  
- **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**

These regulations were enacted to address the **transition of certain public service employees** who were displaced when the **Canada Port Authorities (CPAs)** — specifically the Local Port Corporations and Non-Corporate Port of Canada Ports Corporations — were divested from public service operations.

The core purpose of the regulations is to **ensure continuity and fairness in the superannuation rights** of public service employees who transitioned to new private-sector employers (referred to as "new employers") as a result of the divestiture of the port authorities.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, which governs pension rights and benefits for public servants.
- **New Employer**: A person or body that:
  - Is incorporated by letters patent issued by the **Minister of Transport**, and
  - Carries out the **same activities** previously performed by a Local Port Corporation or a Non-Corporate Port of Canada Ports Corporation.
  - Includes any entity acting for or on behalf of such a body.

> This definition ensures that only entities directly resulting from the restructuring of the port authorities are considered "new employers" under the regulations.

---

### **Scope and Application**

#### **Who Does This Apply To?**
These regulations apply to individuals who:
- Were **deemed to be part of the public service** under the *Divestiture of Service Transitional Coverage Regulations*,
- **Cease to be employed in the public service** and
- **Become employed by a new employer on or after January 1, 2000**.

> The key date is **January 1, 2000** — the effective date of the regulations.

#### **Exclusions**
- **Does NOT apply** to individuals who **subsequently re-employ** with the new employer.
- **Sections 4 to 9** (which may relate to transitional coverage or service credits) do **not apply** if the individual has exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA.
- **Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 of the PSSA** (which govern pension and survivor benefits) apply **only after** the individual ceases employment with the new employer.

---

### **Key Provisions and Implications**

#### **1. Extension of Option to Exercise Pension or Survivor Benefits**
Despite the general rule that options under sections 12(3) and 13.01 of the PSSA (which allow employees to choose between pension or survivor benefits) are time-limited, **these regulations extend the window** for eligible individuals:

> If, **without these regulations**, a person would have been eligible to exercise such an option, they may do so **no later than one year after** the date they cease public service employment and begin employment with the new employer.

This provision provides **additional time** to make benefit decisions, recognizing the uncertainty and disruption caused by the transition from public service to a new private employer.

---

#### **2. Effect of Exercising an Option Under Subsection 3(2)**
If a person exercises an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA (likely a choice to opt out of public service superannuation or to take a different benefit path):

- They are **deemed not to have become employed by the new employer** for the purposes of:
  - These regulations,
  - Sections 83 to 99 of the *Public Service Superannuation Regulations* (which cover pension and benefit administration).

> This means the individual is **excluded** from the application of the transitional rules and **cannot later claim benefits** under the standard provisions when they leave the new employer.

---

#### **3. Death Benefits and Survivor Allowances**
For a person who dies while employed by a new employer:

- **Death Benefit**: Survivors and children are entitled to a **return of contributions** (i.e., a refund of the employee’s pension contributions) under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA.
- **Survivor Allowance**: Survivors and children are entitled to an allowance under paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b) of the PSSA, **subject to the limitations** in subsections 12(4) and (5).

> This ensures that **family members are protected** financially even in the event of the employee’s death during employment with the new employer.

---

#### **4. Child Allowance for Stepchildren or Adopted Children**
A child who:
- Is **born to or adopted by** the employee, or
- Becomes a **stepchild** of the employee,

**during the period** that begins on the date the employee ceases public service employment and ends on the date they cease employment with the new employer,

is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the PSSA**.

> This provision recognizes the **family situation** during the transition period and ensures that children formed during this time are not excluded from benefits.

---

#### **5. One-Year Period for Benefit Applications**
Under subsection 10(5) of the PSSA, the one-year period for applying for certain benefits (e.g., survivor benefits or pension options) begins on the **date the person ceases employment with the new employer**, not the date they left public service.

> This clarifies the timeline for benefit claims and ensures consistency in how timeframes are measured.

---

#### **6. Pensionable Service and Age Determination**
- **Pensionable service** includes:
  - The period of service with the new employer that begins on the date the person **ceases public service employment** and ends on the date they **cease employment with the new employer**.

> This means that **service with the new employer is counted toward pension eligibility**, even though the individual was no longer in the public service.

- **Age for pension purposes** is determined as the person’s age on the **day they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This ensures that pension calculations reflect the actual date of employment termination with the new employer.

---

#### **7. Group 1 Contributor Status**
All individuals covered by these regulations are considered **Group 1 contributors** under the PSSA.

> Group 1 contributors are typically those in the public service and are subject to the standard pension rules. This classification ensures they are treated consistently with other public servants in terms of benefit entitlements.

---

### **Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on January 1, 2000**.

> This aligns with the date of the divestiture of the Canada Port Authorities and the start of the transition for affected employees.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

The *Certain Canada Port Authorities Divestiture Regulations* serve several important functions:

1. **Transitional Fairness**: They provide a structured and fair transition for employees who moved from public service to new private-sector port operators due to the divestiture of the port authorities.

2. **Preservation of Benefits**: They ensure that key superannuation rights — including pensions, survivor benefits, and child allowances — are not lost or delayed due to the change in employer.

3. **Clarity and Predictability**: By defining who is covered, when benefits apply, and how service and age are calculated, the regulations reduce uncertainty for both employees and administrators.

4. **Recognition of Family and Service Continuity**: The rules acknowledge that personal and family circumstances (e.g., births, adoptions) may occur during the transition period and provide appropriate protections.

5. **Legal and Administrative Consistency**: The regulations are grounded in existing statutory frameworks (PSSA and FAA), ensuring compliance and legal enforceability.

### **Conclusion**

The *Certain Canada Port Authorities Divestiture Regulations* are a targeted, practical, and humane set of rules designed to **protect the pension and family benefits of public service employees** who transitioned to new private port operators following the divestiture of the Canada Port Authorities.

They balance administrative necessity with employee rights, ensuring that despite a change in employment status and employer, individuals retain access to essential superannuation benefits and protections — particularly in the areas of death benefits, survivorship, child allowances, and pensionable service.

These regulations remain a key example of how Canadian public service pension policy adapts to structural changes in government operations.
