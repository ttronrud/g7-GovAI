### **3. Definition of a "Distributing Company" (Key Provision)**

Under **subsection (1)**, a company is considered a *distributing company* if **any one** of the following applies:

#### ✅ Option A: Reporting Issuer Under Provincial or Federal Legislation
A company is a distributing company if it is a **reporting issuer** under any of the following statutes (as listed in **column 2 of the Schedule**):
- The *Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5* (Ontario)
- The *Securities Act, R.S.Q., c. V-1.1* (Quebec)
- The *Securities Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418* (New Brunswick)

- The *Securities Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. S-13* (Newfoundland and Labrador)

> These are the **provincial securities acts** that define a "reporting issuer" as a company that must file periodic reports and disclosures with the relevant provincial securities regulator.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The definition of "reporting issuer" is defined in each of these statutes, and the regulations refer to the *current, as-amended* versions of these definitions.

#### ✅ Option B: Filing a Prospectus or Registration Statement
A company is a distributing company if:
- It has **filed a prospectus or registration statement** under **provincial or foreign legislation**, and  
- **Any of its securities are listed and posted for trading** on a **stock exchange in Canada or outside Canada**.

> This provision captures companies that are not formally classified as "reporting issuers" under provincial law but still engage in public securities trading.

#### ✅ Option C: Involvement in Corporate Transactions
A company is a distributing company if it is involved in, formed for, results from, or continues after one of the following corporate events:
- **Amalgamation**
- **Reorganization**
- **Arrangement**
- **Statutory procedure**

> **Condition**: At least one of the participating corporate bodies in the transaction must be:
> - A company that is a reporting issuer (under any of the above-listed provincial acts), **or**
> - A company that is otherwise subject to the definition of a "distributing company" under Option B.

> This ensures that companies involved in significant corporate restructuring are also subject to the regulatory framework of distributing companies.

---

### **4. Exclusions from the Definition**

A company is **not** considered a distributing company **if**:
- It is subject to an **exemption** under provincial securities legislation, **or**
- It has received an **order from the relevant provincial securities regulator** stating that it is **not a reporting issuer** for the purposes of that legislation.

> This provides a **protective exemption** for companies that are not required to report publicly due to specific regulatory exemptions (e.g., small private companies, exempt issuers, or those operating under special regimes).

> This exclusion ensures that only companies with significant public exposure or formal reporting obligations are classified as distributing companies.

---

### **5. Regulatory Effect and Effective Date**

- **Effective Date**: The regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** (i.e., when officially published in the *Canada Gazette* or other official register).
- This means the rules are immediately enforceable upon registration and do not require a separate implementation date.

### **6. Key Definitions and References**

The regulations explicitly reference the **definition of "reporting issuer"** in the following legislation (as amended from time to time):

| Jurisdiction | Relevant Act |

### **7. Key Implications and Practical Applications**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Distributing companies are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny, including disclosure, financial reporting, and transparency requirements. |
| **Public Trading Exposure** | The presence of publicly traded securities on exchanges (domestic or foreign) triggers the classification, regardless of whether the company is formally a "reporting issuer." |
| **Corporate Restructuring** | Even if a company is not a reporting issuer, if it participates in a merger, reorganization, or amalgamation involving a reporting issuer, it becomes a distributing company. |
| **Exemption Protection** | Smaller or non-public companies that are exempt from reporting obligations are not subject to the full scope of distributing company rules. |
| **Interprovincial Consistency** | The regulation harmonizes the definition across provinces by referencing the specific provincial securities acts, ensuring consistency in how "distributing company" is interpreted. |

> - Is part of a major corporate event (like a merger or reorganization) involving a reporting issuer or publicly traded entity.

>
> These rules come into effect immediately upon registration and apply uniformly across Canada’s provinces.
