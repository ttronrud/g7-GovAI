- Section 463 of the Act  

**Effective Date:**  
June 1, 1992  

**Purpose of the Regulations:**  
To define and prescribe specific classes of individuals who, despite not being ordinarily resident in Canada, are considered *resident Canadians* for the purposes of determining membership eligibility in cooperative credit associations under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.

### Key Provision:  
For the purposes of **paragraph (b)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" in Section 2 of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, the following classes of persons are deemed to be resident Canadians:

---

#### **Class 1: Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada, Who Are Full-Time Employees of a Body Corporate with Specific Characteristics**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident** in Canada,  
- And whose **principal reason for residing outside Canada** is to act as a **full-time employee** of a body corporate that meets **one or more of the following conditions**:

1. **Ownership or Control by Resident Canadians**:  
   - More than 50% of the voting shares are **beneficially owned** by resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a)** or **(c)** of the definition of "resident Canadian" in Section 2 of the Act, **or**  
   - The body corporate is **under the control or direction** of such resident Canadians.

2. **Majority of Directors are Resident Canadians**:  
   - A **majority of the directors** of the body corporate are resident Canadians described in **paragraph (a)** or **(c)** of the definition.

3. **Subsidiary Status**:  
   - The body corporate is a **subsidiary** of a body corporate that satisfies either condition (i) or (ii) above.

> **Note**: This provision recognizes that certain Canadian citizens living abroad may still be considered "resident Canadians" if their employment is tied to a foreign entity that is primarily controlled or owned by Canadian residents. This ensures that such individuals maintain a connection to Canada through employment in Canadian-owned or controlled corporate structures.

#### **Class 2: Canadian Citizens Not Ordinarily Resident in Canada Who Are Full-Time Employees of an International Association or Organization of Which Canada is a Member**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Is **not ordinarily resident** in Canada,  
- And is a **full-time employee** of an **international association or organization** to which **Canada is a member** (e.g., the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, International Labour Organization, etc.).

> This provision acknowledges the role of Canadian citizens working abroad in international institutions where Canada participates. It ensures that such individuals are not excluded from being considered resident Canadians due to their foreign residence, as their work is directly linked to Canada’s international engagement.

---

#### **Class 3: Canadian Citizens Who Were Ordinarily Resident in Canada on Their Sixtieth Birthday and Have Resided Outside Canada for Less Than 10 Consecutive Years**

A Canadian citizen who:
- Was **ordinarily resident in Canada on their 60th birthday**,  
- And has since **resided outside Canada for less than 10 consecutive years**.

> This provision is designed to protect individuals who have lived abroad temporarily or for a limited period after reaching age 60. It recognizes that such individuals may have had a strong historical connection to Canada and are not considered "newly" non-resident due to a short-term absence. The 10-year limit ensures that individuals who have been abroad for an extended period are not automatically excluded from residency status.

---

### Key Implications and Objectives:

1. **Broadening Residency Definition**:  
   The regulations expand the definition of "resident Canadian" beyond strict physical presence or long-term residence, allowing individuals with strong ties to Canada (through employment, nationality, or family history) to retain residency status for purposes of cooperative credit association membership.

2. **Support for Canadian-Owned Foreign Entities**:  
   By recognizing Canadian citizens working abroad for Canadian-owned or Canadian-controlled corporations, the rules support Canada’s economic interests and ensure that cooperative credit associations remain linked to Canadian residents even when those residents are abroad.

3. **International Engagement Recognition**:  
   The inclusion of employees of international organizations in which Canada participates ensures that Canadian nationals working in global institutions are not disadvantaged in terms of financial or cooperative participation.

4. **Preservation of Historical Ties**:  
   The 10-year rule for individuals who were once residents of Canada provides a pathway for those who have lived abroad but maintain a strong historical and legal connection to Canada.

5. **Compliance with Cooperative Credit Association Requirements**:  
   These regulations ensure that cooperative credit associations can legally and fairly include members who are Canadian citizens by citizenship, even if they live abroad, thereby promoting inclusivity and stability in the cooperative financial system.

---

### Limitations and Exclusions:

- The regulations **do not apply** to individuals who are not Canadian citizens.  
- The residency status is **conditional** and based on specific criteria, not general residence.  
- The rules are **not retroactive** and apply only to individuals meeting the specified conditions as of June 1, 1992, or thereafter.

---

### Conclusion:

The *Resident Canadian (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* serve as a critical tool in maintaining the integrity and inclusivity of cooperative credit associations in Canada. By clearly defining who qualifies as a "resident Canadian" for purposes of membership—even when residing abroad—these regulations support the financial and social participation of Canadian citizens in the cooperative sector, while aligning with broader principles of residency, citizenship, and international engagement.

This framework reflects a balance between recognizing individual circumstances and ensuring compliance with Canadian tax and regulatory standards under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.
