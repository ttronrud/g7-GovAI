**Detailed Summary of the Corporate Interrelationships (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The regulations are made under the authority of:
- **Section 80.1a** and **subsection 463(1)b** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (the "Act").
- By **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.

This means the regulations are a formal administrative instrument enacted to implement specific provisions of the Act, particularly those related to corporate interrelationships involving the issuance and transfer of shares between cooperative credit associations and their subsidiaries.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **regulate the issuance of "delivery shares"** by a cooperative credit association (CCA) to a **particular subsidiary** for the purpose of an acquisition, with the goal of ensuring that such transactions:
- Are structured in a way that avoids tax avoidance or abuse;
- Are transparent and compliant with Canadian income tax principles;
- Do not result in unintended tax consequences or residency issues for Canadian tax purposes;
- Are temporary and designed to facilitate a transfer of ownership to shareholders of another body corporate.

The regulations establish **prescribed conditions** under which such share deliveries are permitted and define the **consequences if those conditions are not met**.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, which governs the structure, operations, and regulatory framework of cooperative credit associations. |
| **Delivery Shares** | Shares issued by a cooperative credit association to a **particular subsidiary** specifically for the purpose of acquiring that subsidiary (under subsection 80.1(1) of the Act). These are not ordinary shares but are issued with a specific transactional intent. |
| **Particular Subsidiary** | A subsidiary body corporate that is named in subsection 80.1(1) of the Act — meaning it is a designated subsidiary involved in a specific acquisition transaction. |

### **4. Prescribed Conditions for Section 80.1(1) of the Act (Acquisition of Delivery Shares)**

These conditions must be satisfied **before** a cooperative credit association issues delivery shares to a particular subsidiary:

1. **Fair Market Value Consideration**  
   The consideration paid by the cooperative credit association for the delivery shares must be **equal to the fair market value** of those shares at the time of issuance.  
   → Ensures no undervaluation or overvaluation, promoting transparency and fairness.

2. **Active Trading on a Canadian Exchange**  
   The class of shares to which the delivery shares belong must be:
   - Widely held, and  
   - Actively traded on **one of the following Canadian stock exchanges**:
     - Canadian Venture Exchange (CVE)
     - Montreal Exchange (MX)
     - Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)  
   → Ensures liquidity and market-based pricing, reducing the risk of artificial valuations.

3. **Sole Purpose of Transfer**  
   The **sole purpose** of the acquisition by the particular subsidiary of the delivery shares is to **transfer them to the shareholders of another body corporate**.  
   → Prevents the use of the transaction for internal control, asset retention, or other non-transparent purposes.

4. **Arm’s Length Transactions**  
   Immediately before the acquisition, the **other body corporate and its shareholders must deal with both the cooperative credit association and the particular subsidiary at arm’s length**.  
   → As defined under the *Income Tax Act*, arm’s length means transactions conducted as if the parties were independent and not related. This prevents tax avoidance through artificial relationships.

5. **Non-Canadian Residency (Pre-Acquisition)**  
   Immediately before the acquisition, **neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate is resident in Canada** for the purposes of the *Income Tax Act*.  
   → Ensures that the transaction occurs outside Canada to avoid Canadian tax implications (e.g., withholding tax, income recognition).

---

### **5. Prescribed Conditions for Section 80.1(2) of the Act (Post-Acquisition Transfer)**

These conditions apply **after** the acquisition of delivery shares, specifically regarding the transfer of shares to shareholders of another body corporate:

1. **No Beneficial Interest Acquired by the Subsidiary**  
   The particular subsidiary must **not acquire a beneficial interest** in the delivery shares as a result of the acquisition.  
   → Ensures the subsidiary does not gain ownership or control over the shares.

2. **Immediate Transfer to Shareholders**  
   The acquisition must be **immediately followed** by a transfer of the delivery shares to the **shareholders of the other body corporate**.  
   → Ensures the transaction is not a temporary holding; it is intended as a one-way transfer.

3. **Non-Canadian Residency (Post-Transfer)**  
   Immediately after the transfer, **neither the particular subsidiary nor the other body corporate is resident in Canada** (for income tax purposes).  
   → Maintains the offshore structure to prevent Canadian tax exposure.

4. **Post-Transfer Subsidiary Relationship**  
   After the transfer, the **other body corporate must become a subsidiary of the particular subsidiary**.  
   → This creates a new corporate structure where the original entity (the "other body") is now under the control of the subsidiary that acquired the shares — but only after the transfer.

> ⚠️ Note: This condition may appear paradoxical — the subsidiary acquires shares to transfer them to another entity, which then becomes its subsidiary. This creates a complex corporate reorganization, but is intended to allow for strategic restructuring while maintaining compliance with tax and residency rules.

### **6. Required Actions if Conditions Are Breached or Cease to Apply (Section 80.1(3))**

If **any of the conditions in sections 2 or 3 are not met or cease to be met**, the cooperative credit association must take the following actions **within 30 days**:

1. **Cancel the Delivery Shares**  
   - The shares must be canceled.  
   - **Exception**: If the CCA’s by-laws limit the number of authorized shares, the delivery shares may be restored to the status of **authorized but unissued shares** (i.e., they remain in the authorized share capital but are not issued to anyone).  
   → Prevents permanent issuance of shares that no longer meet the criteria.

2. **Return the Consideration to the Particular Subsidiary**  
   - The amount paid by the CCA for the delivery shares must be **returned to the particular subsidiary**.  
   → Ensures no net gain or loss is retained by the cooperative credit association.

3. **Cancel the Entry in the Stated Capital Account**  
   - The entry reflecting the consideration received (i.e., the capital received from the share issuance) must be **removed from the stated capital account** of the cooperative credit association.  
   → Maintains accurate financial records and prevents inflated capitalization.

> This 30-day window ensures timely corrective action and accountability.

### **7. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on:
- The day that **section 147 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007 (S.C. 2007, c. 37)** comes into force, **or**
- If later, on the day the regulations are **registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette*).

> **Note**: The regulations were in force as of **March 8, 2008** (as per SI/2008-33).

---

### **8. Regulatory Context and Significance**

These regulations are part of a broader framework designed to:
- **Prevent tax avoidance** through complex corporate structures;
- Ensure that share transactions between cooperative credit associations and their subsidiaries are **transparent, legitimate, and tax-compliant**;
- Protect the integrity of Canadian tax residency rules and arm’s length principles;
- Allow for **temporary offshore reorganizations** that may be necessary for business strategy, without triggering adverse tax consequences.

They reflect a balance between enabling strategic corporate restructurings and preventing abuse — particularly in cases where entities attempt to shift assets or income across borders to avoid Canadian taxation.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

A cooperative credit association (CCA) can issue shares (called "delivery shares") to a subsidiary (a company it owns or controls) **only if**:
- The shares are valued fairly;
- They are traded on a major Canadian exchange;
- The only reason for the subsidiary to buy them is to pass them on to shareholders of another company;
- All parties involved are not residents of Canada at the time of the transaction;
- The transaction is conducted fairly (at arm’s length);
- The shares are transferred immediately to the shareholders of that other company.

If any of these conditions fail, the CCA must:
- Cancel the shares;
- Return the money paid;
- Remove the capital entry from its books.

This ensures that such transactions are **temporary, transparent, and compliant with Canadian tax law**, and do not result in hidden tax liabilities or residency issues.

### **Conclusion**

These regulations provide a **clear, structured, and enforceable framework** for corporate interrelationships involving the issuance and transfer of shares between cooperative credit associations and their subsidiaries. They are designed to **promote legitimate business restructuring** while **protecting Canadian tax policy** from abuse through offshore or artificial transactions. The rules emphasize transparency, fairness, and compliance with both the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* and the *Income Tax Act*.
