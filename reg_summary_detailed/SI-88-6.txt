**Detailed Summary of the Goodyear Remission Order (S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 170, s. 4)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Goodyear Remission Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**, and the **Treasury Board**, under **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. The Order was enacted to promote economic development and support Canadian manufacturing by providing a **remission (offset or reduction)** of both **customs duties** and a **portion of the federal sales tax** on specific tires imported by **Goodyear Canada Inc.**

This Order is officially cited as the **Goodyear Remission Order** and is designed to benefit Goodyear Canada Inc. during a specific time period, with strict conditions and limitations.

### **Key Provisions and Interpretation**

#### 1. **Definition of "Tires"**
- The term *tires* in this Order refers to **all tires** **except**:
  - Solid press-on tires  
  - Solid pneumatic-shaped tires  
  - Pneumatic tires for forklift trucks  
  - Off-the-road bias ply tires in sizes greater than **11.00 × 24**

> This exclusion ensures that only certain types of standard passenger or commercial tires are eligible for the remission, excluding specialized or industrial-grade tires that may not be part of the core automotive manufacturing sector.

---

#### 2. **Remission of Customs Duty**
- A **remission of customs duties** is granted for tires imported by **Goodyear Canada Inc.** during the period:
  - **October 1, 1987, to December 31, 1997**
- The remission applies to customs duties that were **paid or would have been payable** under the **Customs Tariff** for those imports.

> This means that Goodyear Canada Inc. will not be required to pay the full amount of customs duty on qualifying tires imported during this 10-year window.

---

#### 3. **Remission of Federal Sales Tax**
- In addition to customs duty remission, a **proportional remission of federal sales tax** is granted on the goods (tires) subject to the customs duty remission.
- The amount of sales tax remitted is calculated as:
  
  > **Sales tax remitted = (Actual sales tax paid) – (Sales tax that would have been paid if the duty-paid value had been reduced by the amount of customs duty remitted)**

- In simpler terms:
  - The sales tax is based on the **duty-paid value** of the imported goods (i.e., the value used to calculate tax after customs duty is applied).
  - If customs duty is reduced, the duty-paid value decreases, which in turn reduces the sales tax.
  - The remitted sales tax is the **difference** between what was actually paid and what would have been paid under the lower duty-paid value.

> This provision effectively reduces the overall tax burden on Goodyear Canada Inc. by addressing the **tax consequence of lower import cost**, ensuring that the benefit of duty remission is not offset by higher sales tax.

#### 4. **Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following **strict conditions**:

| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Goodyear Canada Inc. must continue to be a manufacturer of tires in Canada** | The company must maintain its status as a Canadian tire manufacturer. If it ceases manufacturing in Canada, the remission rights would be forfeited. This ensures that the policy supports **domestic manufacturing capacity** and job retention. |
| **Customs duty remission per period is capped at $12.6 million** | The total remission is limited to **$12.6 million per five-year period** (i.e., each 12-month period within a 5-year block). The five-year period begins on **October 1, 1987**, and is divided into five 12-month intervals. For example: <br> - October 1, 1987 – September 30, 1988 <br> - October 1, 1988 – September 30, 1989 <br> - etc. <br> This cap prevents excessive fiscal benefit and ensures fiscal responsibility. |
| **Claim must be made to the Minister of National Revenue within two years of importation** | A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the goods were imported. This establishes a **strict time limit** for claiming benefits, ensuring timely administration and reducing administrative burdens. |

### **Policy Objectives and Rationale**

- **Support for Canadian Manufacturing**: The Order was designed to encourage and sustain **domestic tire production** in Canada by reducing the cost of importing raw materials or components used in tire manufacturing.
- **Public Interest**: The Governor General in Council declared that the measure is in the **public interest**, likely due to:
  - Job creation and retention in the Canadian manufacturing sector
  - Promotion of industrial development in regions where Goodyear operates
  - Strengthening the competitiveness of Canadian manufacturers in a global market
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: The inclusion of caps and time limits ensures that the government does not incur uncontrolled expenditures or long-term fiscal liabilities.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- The Order is authorized under **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor General in Council to issue orders for the remission of taxes or duties when it is in the public interest and on the recommendation of relevant ministers.

---

### **Scope and Duration**
- **Time Period**: October 1, 1987 – December 31, 1997 (a 10-year window)
- **Eligible Entity**: Goodyear Canada Inc. only
- **Eligible Goods**: All tires (excluding the listed exclusions)

---

### **Administrative and Compliance Requirements**
- Goodyear Canada Inc. must:
  - Maintain its status as a Canadian tire manufacturer
  - File claims with the Minister of National Revenue within **two years of importation**
  - Ensure that the total customs duty remission per 12-month period does not exceed **$12.6 million** (over five such periods)

> Failure to meet any of these conditions results in the **loss of remission rights**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Goodyear Remission Order* is a targeted fiscal policy tool designed to:
- Reduce the cost of importing tires for a Canadian manufacturer
- Support domestic manufacturing and industrial development
- Ensure fiscal accountability through caps, time limits, and eligibility conditions

It reflects a balanced approach—offering significant financial relief to a key Canadian industrial player while protecting public finances and ensuring that benefits are tied directly to continued domestic production and compliance.

This Order remains a notable example of how federal governments can use targeted tax and duty remissions to promote industrial policy and regional economic development.
