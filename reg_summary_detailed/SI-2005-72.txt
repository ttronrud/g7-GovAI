**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulatory order, issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, outlines the decision of the Governor in Council—on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment—to **not add four species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk (Schedule 1 to SARA)**. The order also includes provisions for **referring assessments back to the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** and **approving public registry statements** explaining the rationale for each decision.

### **I. Species Not Added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk**

The following species are **not being added** to Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act:

1. **Porsild’s bryum (Mielichhoferia macrocarpa)**  
2. **Plains bison (Bison bison bison)**  
3. **Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi)**  
4. **Dolphin and Union population of the barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus)**

---

### **II. Rationale for Not Listing Each Species**

#### **1. Plains Bison (Bison bison bison)**

- **Status Assessment (COSEWIC):**  
  The COSEWIC status report classifies the plains bison as *threatened*, noting that all populations except the Pink Mountain herd are stable or increasing. No current disease threats exist that endanger the species.

- **Population Size and Distribution:**  
  As of 2003, there were approximately 600,000–720,000 plains bison in North America. Over 95% of the population is maintained in commercial ranching operations. In 2004, Canada had about 240,000 bison on 1,900 commercial farms, generating over **$50 million annually** in bison product sales.

- **Economic and Industry Implications:**  
  The Canadian bison industry supports rural economies, particularly in aboriginal communities, and contributes to sustainable land management by restoring native pastures and reducing cultivated land use.  
  However, **declining consumer demand** due to food safety concerns (e.g., BSE) and shifting dietary trends (declining red meat consumption) have led to **lower prices and reduced market viability**.  
  Listing the species under SARA could **further reduce consumer demand**, as public perception may view bison as "protected" or "rare," potentially undermining market confidence and profitability.

- **Genetic Considerations:**  
  Wild and ranch-raised bison are genetically indistinguishable. All modern herds descend from a small number of wild bison from the late 1800s. Therefore, listing would not distinguish between wild and farmed populations and could harm the commercial sector.

- **Current Protections:**  
  While not protected under SARA, plains bison in **national parks remain protected under the Canada National Parks Act**. Parks Canada continues to lead in bison recovery efforts, including planned reintroductions into national parks.

- **Future Considerations:**  
  The Minister of the Environment reserves the right to **reconsider listing** in the future if sufficient evidence emerges that the species faces new threats or if the economic or ecological balance changes.

- **Consultation Concerns:**  
  The **Nunavut Government and Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)** raised concerns about:
  - Inadequate consultation with Indigenous stakeholders.
  - Lack of inclusion of **community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge** in the assessment process.  
  As a result, the decision to not list the species is **conditional**—it is **not final** and will be revisited after further consultation with NWMB and other Indigenous groups.

---

#### **2. Porsild’s bryum (Mielichhoferia macrocarpa)**

- The species is not being listed due to **insufficient evidence of significant decline or threat** to its survival.
- The assessment indicates that the population is currently stable or shows no clear signs of decline.
- The decision is based on the **best available scientific information** and the absence of critical threats that would warrant listing under SARA.

- **Future Review:**  
  The Minister may reconsider the listing after **further consultation** with Indigenous communities and stakeholders, particularly regarding traditional knowledge and regional ecological impacts.

---

#### **3. Peary Caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi)**

- This species is not being added to the List due to **lack of sufficient evidence of imminent extinction risk**.
- While Peary caribou face habitat loss and climate change pressures, the current data do not meet the thresholds required for listing under SARA.
- The decision reflects a **cautious approach**, recognizing that while threats exist, they are not currently severe enough to justify formal protection under the Act.

- **Future Review:**  
  The Minister will **reconsider** this decision after completing consultations with Indigenous communities and stakeholders, particularly in the Arctic regions where the species is found.

---

#### **4. Dolphin and Union Population of Barren-Ground Caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus)**

- This population is not being listed due to **lack of sufficient evidence of decline or critical threats** at this time.
- Although caribou populations in the Arctic face challenges from climate change, predation, and habitat degradation, the current data do not indicate an immediate risk of extinction.
- The assessment suggests that the population remains stable or is recovering in some areas.

- **Future Review:**  
  The Minister will **reconsider** the listing after completing consultations with Indigenous communities, particularly the Inuit, who have deep traditional knowledge of caribou movements and ecosystem dynamics.

### **III. Referral of Assessments Back to COSEWIC**

Two assessments are being **referred back to COSEWIC** for further review and analysis:

#### **1. Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus)**

- **Background:**  
  In a prior Order in Council (P.C. 2005-5), the polar bear was not listed due to **ongoing consultation with the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)**. The NWMB raised concerns that:
  - The original 1999 COSEWIC status report **lacked community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge**.
  - The report was **incomplete** and did not reflect the most current scientific data, including climate change impacts and shifting ice conditions.

- **Legal Basis:**  
  Under **section 15(2) of SARA**, COSEWIC must assess species based on the **best available information**, which includes:
  - Scientific data
  - Community knowledge
  - Aboriginal traditional knowledge

- **Decision:**  
  The assessment is being **referred back to COSEWIC** to:
  - Incorporate traditional and community knowledge.
  - Reassess the species’ status using updated scientific and Indigenous knowledge.
  - Determine whether the current designation of "**special concern**" remains valid.

- **Future Action:**  
  Once COSEWIC completes its revised assessment, the Minister will evaluate whether the polar bear should be listed or if further consultation is needed.

#### **2. Dwarf Woolly-heads (Psilocarphus brevissimus)**

- **Background:**  
  A new discovery has revealed that a population previously identified as *Psilocarphus elatior* (tall woolly-heads) on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border is actually *Psilocarphus brevissimus* (dwarf woolly-heads).

- **Impact on Assessment:**  
  This discovery **challenges the previous status report**, which only recognized the British Columbia population. The presence of a **new Canadian population** means the species may be more widespread and potentially less at risk than previously thought.

- **Decision:**  
  COSEWIC has requested that the Minister **refer the assessment back** to conduct a revised evaluation of:
  - The total range and distribution of the species.
  - Population size and trends.
  - Level of threat and risk.

- **Outcome:**  
  A revised status report will be prepared, and the species’ risk level will be reassessed accordingly.

### **IV. Public Registry Requirements (Annexes)**

The Minister of the Environment is **required to include formal statements in the public registry** under **Section 120 of SARA** explaining the reasons for each decision. These statements are attached as:

- **Annex 1:** Reasons for not listing the **plains bison**  
- **Annex 2:** Reasons for not listing **Porsild’s bryum, Peary caribou, and the Dolphin and Union caribou population**  
- **Annex 3:** Reasons for referring the **polar bear and dwarf woolly-heads** assessments back to COSEWIC

These statements ensure **transparency, accountability, and public access** to the decision-making process under SARA.

### **V. Key Principles Underlying the Decisions**

1. **Science-Based Decision-Making:**  
   All decisions are grounded in the best available scientific data, including COSEWIC assessments.

2. **Inclusion of Traditional and Community Knowledge:**  
   Indigenous and community knowledge is recognized as a vital component of species assessments, especially in Arctic and remote regions.

3. **Balancing Conservation and Economic Interests:**  
   The decision to avoid listing the plains bison reflects a balance between ecological conservation and economic sustainability for rural and Indigenous communities.

4. **Procedural Compliance:**  
   The order complies with SARA requirements, including:
