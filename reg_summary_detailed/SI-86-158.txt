Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, broken down into clear, organized sections for clarity and ease of understanding:

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Pre-Trial Conference Regulation**

#### **1. Mandatory Nature and Timing of the Pre-Trial Conference**
- A **pre-trial conference is required** whenever an accused is to be tried **before a jury**.
- The conference must be held at a **specific time, date, place, and manner** as directed by the **presiding judge** of the court.
- If the judge determines that additional conferences are needed, they may be scheduled at **further dates and times** as the judge deems appropriate.

> ✅ *This ensures that all parties have a structured opportunity to prepare and address trial issues before the trial begins.*

---

#### **2. Attendance at the Pre-Trial Conference**
Unless otherwise ordered by the judge, the following parties must attend:
- **Counsel representing the accused** at trial, or  
  - **The accused themselves**, if they do not have legal representation.
- **The prosecutor** who will appear at trial, or  
  - A **senior counsel responsible for prosecutions** (e.g., a lead prosecutor or deputy).

> ✅ *This ensures that both sides are present and can engage in meaningful discussion, promoting fairness and transparency.*

---

#### **3. Purpose of the Pre-Trial Conference**
The primary goals are:
- To **promote a fair trial**.
- To ensure the trial is **expeditious (efficient and timely)**.
- To identify and resolve potential issues before trial begins, reducing delays and unnecessary courtroom proceedings.

> ✅ *This helps streamline the trial process, prevents last-minute surprises, and supports judicial efficiency.*

---

#### **4. Format and Conduct of the Conference**
- The pre-trial conference is intended to be an **informal meeting**.
- It is typically held **in chambers** (private courtroom space, not in open court).
- The meeting allows for **full and free discussion** of all relevant issues.
- Such discussions **do not prejudice the rights** of either party.

> ✅ *This informal setting encourages open communication and collaborative problem-solving without the formalities of a courtroom proceeding.*

---

#### **5. Disclosure of Preliminary Motions**
- At the conference, **counsel must disclose** to the judge:
  - The **nature and specific details** of any preliminary motion they intend to file before trial.
- The presiding judge has **discretion** over how to proceed:
  - The judge may require the motion to be **reduced to writing** and heard **prior to trial**.
  - Alternatively, the judge may allow the motion to be heard **at the start of the trial**.

> ✅ *This ensures transparency and allows the court to manage the trial timeline effectively.*

---

#### **6. Disclosure of Trial Matters and Time Estimates**
- Counsel must disclose to the judge:
  - Any **matters that may arise during the trial** and which would normally be addressed **after the jury is sworn**.
  - The **anticipated length of time** required to hear and resolve these matters.

> ✅ *This allows the judge to plan for potential delays and make informed decisions about trial scheduling.*

- The judge may then choose to:
  - Deal with such matters **before any jury is selected** (i.e., before the jury panel is called), at a date and time the judge deems fit.
  - Or, deal with them **after the jury is sworn**, in the absence of the jury.

> ✅ *This flexibility helps avoid disruptions during jury selection and ensures that procedural issues are resolved efficiently.*

---

#### **7. Judicial Endorsement of the Indictment**
- Upon completion of the pre-trial conference, the **presiding judge must endorse** the indictment (or a true copy of it).
- The endorsement must include the **date of the pre-trial conference**.

> ✅ *This serves as an official record of the conference and confirms that the court has reviewed and acknowledged the case’s status.*

---

#### **8. Flexibility for Additional Pre-Trial Conferences**
- The regulation **does not prohibit** the court from holding **additional informal pre-trial conferences** beyond the mandatory one.
- These additional conferences may be held **on terms set by the judge**, based on the specific circumstances of the case.

> ✅ *This provides flexibility to address unique or complex cases where further preparation is needed.*

---

#### **9. Effective Date**
- These rules come into force on the day that **Section 553.1 of the Criminal Code** becomes effective.
- Section 553.1 was enacted by **Section 127 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985** (S.C. 1985, c. 19).
- The rules officially took effect on **March 25, 1986**.

> ✅ *This establishes a clear timeline for implementation and legal enforceability.*
