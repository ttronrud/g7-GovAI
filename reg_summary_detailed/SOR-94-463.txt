The specific effective date may be found in the official notice, but generally, such repeals become effective upon publication unless otherwise stated.

- **Legal Authority**:  
  The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Ontario government** through the *Statutory Rules* system. SOR/2017-84 is a collection of rules and amendments that modify or cancel existing regulations.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**:  
  Section 1 of this regulation specifically **repeals** one or more prior regulations.

  Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions that were previously established under the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Entities or individuals relying on that regulation must now refer to current, active legislation or regulations that have replaced it (if any).

- **Need for Further Information**:  
  To provide a more detailed summary (e.g., the original subject of the regulation, its purpose, or what it governed), the **original regulation’s title or subject matter** would need to be identified.
