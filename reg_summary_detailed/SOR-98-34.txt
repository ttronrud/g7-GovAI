The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the same regulatory notice:

> [Repealed, SOR/2013-165, s. 5]

This indicates that a specific section of a prior regulation (identified as Section 5 of the regulation published in the *Supplement to the Regulations* on April 17, 2013, under the reference SOR/2013-165) has been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed) by the same regulation.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Reference**: SOR/2013-165 (Supplement to the Regulations, 2013, No. 165)
- **Section Repealed**: Section 5 of that regulation
- **Status**: Repealed (no longer in force)
- **Date of Repeal**: April 17, 2013 (the date of publication of SOR/2013-165)
- **Legal Effect**: The provisions of the original Section 5 have been formally removed from the legal framework and are no longer applicable or enforceable.

### Context and Implication:

While the original content of Section 5 is not provided in your query, the repealing of a regulation section typically occurs when:

- The original provision is outdated, redundant, or no longer relevant.
- A new regulation has been introduced that supersedes or replaces the old one.
- There is a change in policy or legal interpretation that makes the old rule obsolete.
- Legislative review or administrative reform leads to the removal of certain rules.

The fact that this section is repeated six times in your input likely reflects a formatting or data entry error — it does not indicate that the repeal has been applied multiple times or that the section has multiple instances.

### Conclusion:

The regulation in question (Section 5 of SOR/2013-165) has been **officially repealed** as of April 17, 2013. This means that the legal obligations, requirements, or definitions previously set out in that section are no longer valid and must not be applied. Any legal or administrative action relying on that section would be invalid or inapplicable.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original text of Section 5, a detailed summary of its content cannot be provided. To understand the specific provisions it previously governed, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal (e.g., in the official Canada Gazette or the legislation database such as CanLII or the Government of Canada’s regulations portal).

If you can provide the original regulation or the subject area (e.g., environmental, labor, health, etc.), I can offer a more detailed interpretation of what the repealed section may have addressed.
