**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Forces Special Election Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **Canadian Forces Special Election Regulations**.
- It may be cited as such and serves to provide specific procedural and substantive rules governing a special election process for members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Act"** refers to the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* (Loi). This is the primary legislation governing pension contributions and benefits for members of the Canadian Forces.
- **"Former Act"** refers to:
  - The *Defence Services Pension Act* (DSP Act), and
  - Any other Canadian statute that previously provided pensions based on length of service in the forces, excluding the current Act.
  - This definition ensures that historical pension schemes are recognized in the context of this special election.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These Regulations apply to **members of the Canadian Forces** who meet **all of the following conditions**:
1. Are covered under the *Defence Services Pension Continuation Act* (DSPCA).
2. **Failed to make an election** to become a contributor under:
   - The *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* (CFSA),
   - Part V of the *Defence Services Pension Act* (DSP Act), or
   - Part V of the *Militia Pension Act*.
3. The failure to elect was due to **erroneous advice** given by a person within the forces whose **ordinary duties included providing advice on elections** under either the Act or the former Act.

> In essence, this regulation addresses individuals who were misled or incorrectly advised by military personnel (e.g., personnel in administrative or HR roles) about their right to elect pension contributions under the new superannuation system — a key mechanism to correct past omissions caused by misinformation.

---

### **4. Right to Elect (Time Limit)**

- A member who qualifies under Section 3 **may elect to become a contributor under the Act** if:
  - They **make the election within one year** of being **informed by the Minister** of their right to do so.

> This one-year window is critical — it establishes a strict deadline for action. After that period, the right to elect lapses, and the individual cannot retroactively join the contribution scheme.

---

### **5. Evidence and Submission of Election**

- Every election must be:
  - Made in **writing**.
  - Completed on **Form CFSA 109**, which is specifically designed for this purpose.
  - **Forwarded to a person designated by the Minister** (e.g., a pension officer or designated authority) **within the prescribed time** (i.e., within one year of receiving notification from the Minister).

> The requirement for written documentation ensures accountability, transparency, and auditability of the election process.

---

### **6. Special Provision for Members Who Received a Gratuity Under the Former Act**

- If a member received a **gratuity** (a lump-sum payment) under the *former Act*, they may elect to become a contributor under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* **only if** they:
  - **Agree to pay back the full amount of the gratuity** (in lump sum or in instalments), **plus simple interest at 4% per annum**.
  - The interest accrues from the **date the gratuity began to be paid** until the date of the election.

> This provision is designed to prevent the "double benefit" of receiving a gratuity under the old system while also receiving pension contributions under the new system. It ensures financial fairness and consistency in the transition from the old to the new pension framework.

> **Payment Options**:
> - Lump sum from personal funds or DVA Re-establishment Credit.
> - Partial lump sum settlement of arrears, with the balance paid in monthly instalments.
> - Full monthly instalments until all arrears are paid.

> Importantly, the plan of payment is **subject to adjustment** based on verification of the total arrears of contributions under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Regulations*.

This form is **specifically for use** by eligible members who:

       - Any service periods they would have been entitled to count under **Part V** of the *Defence Services Pension Act* or *Militia Pension Act*.
     - Upon making this election, they are **deemed to have elected to pay contributions** for that service.

3. **Payment Plan Selection (Only One Option May Be Chosen)**:

4. **Signature and Witnessing**:
   - The member signs the form.
   - A **witness** (typically a fellow service member or officer) signs to verify the signature of the elector.

5. **Forwarding Status Declaration**:
   - The person receiving the form (e.g., commanding officer or designated authority) must confirm:
     - Whether the election was **forwarded within one year** of notification, or

### **8. Key Principles and Objectives**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Corrective Justice** | Addresses historical errors caused by misleading advice within the forces, ensuring that individuals are not unfairly excluded from the new pension system. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Requires written documentation and verification to ensure that elections are legitimate and properly recorded. |
| **Financial Fairness** | Prevents individuals from receiving benefits under both the old and new systems by requiring repayment of gratuities and interest. |
| **Timeliness** | Enforces a one-year deadline to ensure timely resolution and prevent indefinite delays in pension eligibility. |
| **Consistency with Existing Law** | Aligns with the broader *Canadian Forces Superannuation Regulations* and ensures that contributions are calculated fairly and consistently. |

---

### **9. Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Eligibility is conditional** — not all members of the forces are covered. Only those who were misled by force personnel and failed to elect are eligible.
- **No automatic entitlement** — the election must be **voluntary and formally submitted**.
- **No retroactive benefits** — the new contributions begin only upon the valid election and payment.
- **Interest and repayment obligations** — especially for those who received gratuities under the former system — serve as a financial safeguard to maintain equity in the pension system.

---

### **10. Conclusion**

The *Canadian Forces Special Election Regulations* serve as a **targeted, corrective mechanism** to address a specific gap in the transition from the old pension system (based on length of service) to the modern *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* system. By allowing members who were misled by erroneous advice to formally elect into the new contribution framework, the regulations promote fairness, transparency, and accountability.

They ensure that:
- Individuals who were unaware of their rights are not permanently excluded.
- The integrity of the pension system is preserved through proper documentation and financial accountability.
- The transition to a more comprehensive and equitable superannuation scheme is managed in a structured, legally sound manner.

### **Summary in One Paragraph**

The *Canadian Forces Special Election Regulations* allow members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were misled by erroneous advice from force personnel about their right to elect pension contributions under the *Canadian Forces Superannuation Act* to formally become contributors — provided they do so within one year of being informed by the Minister. The election must be submitted in writing on Form CFSA 109 and forwarded to a designated authority. Members who received a gratuity under the former Act must repay that amount plus 4% simple interest. The form includes clear instructions on payment options, a signature and witness section, and a verification clause to confirm timely forwarding. These regulations ensure fairness, accountability, and consistency in the transition from the old pension system to the current superannuation framework.
