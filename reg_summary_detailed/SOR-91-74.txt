**Detailed Summary of the Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1991**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Unemployment Insurance Act* of Canada. Specifically, it is enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of two key governmental bodies:  
- The Minister of Employment and Immigration  
- The Treasury Board  

This action is grounded in three specific subsections of the Act:  
- **Subsection 24(4)**: Authorizes the setting of maximum benefit amounts under Section 24 of the Act (which governs regular unemployment insurance benefits).  
- **Subsection 25(10)**: Provides the authority to set maximum benefit amounts under Section 25 (which covers benefits for individuals who are not eligible for regular benefits, such as those with limited work history or specific circumstances).  
- **Subsection 26(8)**: Grants authority to establish maximum benefit amounts under Section 26 (which pertains to the payment of benefits to individuals who are receiving other forms of assistance or are in specific transitional or emergency situations).

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to formally establish and authorize the maximum financial limits for unemployment insurance benefits payable in the calendar year 1991. These limits are set annually to ensure fiscal responsibility, manage government spending, and maintain the stability and sustainability of the unemployment insurance program.

**3. Effective Date**  
The benefits authorized under this Order take effect on **January 1, 1991**. This means that all benefit payments made to eligible individuals during the year 1991 will be subject to the maximum amounts specified in the Order.

**4. Key Benefit Amounts (for the Year 1991)**  
The Order establishes three distinct maximum benefit amounts under different sections of the Unemployment Insurance Act:

- **Section 24 (Regular Unemployment Insurance Benefits):**  
  Maximum benefit amount = **$230,000,000**  
  This amount represents the total funding available for regular unemployment insurance payments to individuals who meet standard eligibility criteria (e.g., lost employment through no fault of their own, sufficient work history, and active job search).

- **Section 25 (Special or Supplementary Benefits):**  
  Maximum benefit amount = **$120,000,000**  
  This fund supports additional or alternative benefits for individuals who do not qualify for regular benefits under Section 24, such as those with limited work experience, part-time workers, or those in transitional employment situations.

- **Section 26 (Emergency or Transitional Benefits):**  
  Maximum benefit amount = **$620,000,000**  
  This is the largest of the three amounts and is intended for emergency or transitional support, such as for individuals experiencing job loss due to economic downturns, structural changes, or other exceptional circumstances. It may also cover benefits for individuals in specific industries or regions affected by downturns.

**5. Citation and Legal Status**  
The Order is officially titled:  
**"The Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1991"**  
It may be cited in legal and administrative contexts using this title and is binding on all relevant government agencies and service providers responsible for administering unemployment insurance benefits.

**6. Significance and Context**  
- The Order reflects the government’s fiscal planning for the year 1991, balancing the need to provide financial support to unemployed individuals with the need to maintain budgetary constraints.  
- The significant difference in the amounts—especially the $620 million allocated under Section 26—suggests that emergency or transitional support was a priority during that period, possibly due to economic conditions such as a recession or industry-specific downturns.  
- The total funding available for unemployment benefits in 1991 was approximately **$970 million** ($230M + $120M + $620M), which would have been distributed across eligible claimants based on individual circumstances and eligibility rules.

**7. Limitations and Implications**  
- These are **maximum** amounts, meaning that actual benefit payments to individuals are determined by eligibility criteria, income thresholds, and other factors, and may not reach the full maximum.  
- The Order does not define how benefits are distributed or who qualifies; those details are governed by the *Unemployment Insurance Act* and its implementing regulations.  
- The Order is specific to the year 1991 and is not applicable to future years unless a new Order is issued.

**Conclusion**  
The *Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1991* is a critical administrative instrument that legally authorizes the financial framework for unemployment insurance benefits in Canada during that year. By setting clear maximums for benefits under Sections 24, 25, and 26, it ensures transparency, accountability, and consistency in the delivery of support to unemployed individuals. The allocation of funds—particularly the substantial amount under Section 26—indicates a focus on emergency and transitional assistance, reflecting the economic environment and policy priorities of the time.
