**Detailed Summary of the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Regulations**

---

### **Background and Legal Basis**

The *Scott Islands Protected Marine Area Regulations* (S.C. 2009, c. 14, s. 47) were enacted under **section 12c of the Canada Wildlife Act** (R.S., c. W-9; S.C. 1994, c. 23, s. 2), following the establishment of the **Scott Islands Protected Marine Area (PMMA)** by order of the Governor in Council under subsection 4.1(1)a of the Canada Wildlife Act (S.C. 1996, c. 31, s. 107).

These regulations provide the detailed operational framework for protecting wildlife and its habitats within this marine conservation zone, which is located in the northern part of the Pacific coast of Canada, near the Scott Islands (part of the British Columbia coast).

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Aircraft**:  
   Includes any air vehicle that does not have a pilot on board. This broad definition ensures that unmanned aerial systems (drones) and other non-piloted aircraft are subject to restrictions.

2. **Protected Marine Area (PMA)**:  
   Refers specifically to the Scott Islands Protected Marine Area established by government order. It is a legally designated zone where certain activities are restricted to protect biodiversity and ecological integrity.

3. **Vessel**:  
   Defined as any boat, ship, or craft designed, used, or capable of being used for navigation in or above water — regardless of propulsion method — but **excludes** floating objects of a prescribed class under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* (e.g., certain floating platforms or structures used for shipping).

### **Prohibited Activities in the Protected Marine Area**

The following activities are strictly prohibited unless specifically exempted:

#### 1. **Wildlife Disturbance or Harm**
- Any activity that is likely to:
  - Disturb, damage, or destroy wildlife or its habitat;
  - Remove wildlife or its habitat from the area.

#### 2. **Waste Discharge**
- Dumping or discharging any waste material or substance that could harm wildlife or degrade habitat quality.

#### 3. **Introduction of Non-Native Organisms**
- Introducing any living organism (e.g., plants, animals, microbes) that could harm native species or degrade habitat.

#### 4. **Aircraft Flight Below 3,500 Feet**
- Flying an aircraft **below 3,500 feet above mean sea level** within the **flight restriction zone** defined in the schedule.

#### 5. **Proximity Restrictions for Vessels**
- **No vessel over 400 gross tonnes** may anchor within **1 nautical mile (1,852 meters)** of the **low water mark** of:
  - Triangle Island
  - Sartine Island
  - Beresford Island
- This restriction applies to anchoring, not navigation.

> **Note**: These prohibitions are intended to minimize human impact on sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems, especially those supporting bird populations and other wildlife.

### **Exemptions and Exceptions**

Several important exemptions apply to ensure public safety, national security, and legitimate governmental operations:

#### **Section 2 Does Not Apply To:**

- **Public Safety or National Security Activities**  
  Activities carried out in emergencies or for public safety or national security purposes.

- **Foreign Vessels or Aircraft in Canada’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)**  
  Foreign vessels or aircraft operating within Canada’s EEZ are exempt **only if** their activities comply with **Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)**, which governs the rights and responsibilities of states in marine areas.

#### **Paragraphs 2(1)(a) and (b) Do Not Apply To:**

- **Fishing Activities**  
  Fishing conducted under the authority of:
  - The *Coastal Fisheries Protection Act*
  - The *Fisheries Act*

- **Navigation Under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001**  
  Vessels navigating legally under this act (e.g., commercial or recreational vessels following established routes).

- **Foreign Military Vessels or Canadian Forces Vessels**  
  Vessels belonging to foreign military forces or those under Canadian military command are exempt from these restrictions.

#### **Paragraphs 2(1)(d) and (e) Do Not Apply To:**

- **Government Enforcement Officers**  
  Federal or provincial enforcement officers (e.g., wildlife officers, fisheries officers) performing official duties.

- **British Columbia Government Wildlife Research or Conservation Personnel**  
  Employees or officers of the Government of British Columbia who conduct:
  - Wildlife research
  - Conservation
  - Interpretation of wildlife (e.g., educational or monitoring activities)

> These exemptions allow essential operations to proceed without undue restriction while maintaining environmental protection.

### **Permit System for Permitted Activities**

Despite the general prohibitions, the **Minister of the Environment** may issue a **permit** allowing certain activities that would otherwise be prohibited — provided they meet strict environmental criteria.

#### **Conditions for Permitting an Activity**

A permit may be issued if:

1. **Purpose is Conservation-Related**  
   The activity aims to promote the conservation of wildlife or its habitat.

2. **Benefits Outweigh Adverse Effects**  
   The proposed activity is likely to provide **net benefits** for wildlife conservation, and any negative impacts are outweighed by positive outcomes.

3. **No Alternative Exists**  
   There is **no feasible alternative** that achieves the same conservation benefit with fewer or less harmful impacts.

OR

4. **Adverse Effects Are Minimal or Mitigable**  
   The adverse effects on wildlife are not significant enough to compromise conservation, **provided**:
   - The applicant implements specific mitigation measures described in paragraph (2)(d);  
   - And there is still **no alternative** that provides equivalent benefits with lower environmental impact.

> This ensures that only activities with clear environmental justification and minimal harm are allowed.

---

### **Permit Application Requirements**

All permit applications must include detailed information, including:

- **Applicant Contact Information**
- **Activity Details**:
  - Purpose of the activity
  - Location of activity
  - Conveyances (e.g., boats, aircraft) used
  - Types of equipment
  - Number of personnel involved and their qualifications
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**:
  - Likelihood and scope of effects on wildlife/habitat
  - Specific effects on **birds** or species that are a **significant food source for birds**
- **Mitigation and Monitoring Plan**:
  - Measures to monitor effects
  - Plans to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts if prevention is not possible

> The emphasis on **bird habitat and food sources** reflects the ecological importance of avian species in this region.

---

### **Minister’s Evaluation Criteria**

When assessing applications, the Minister must consider:

1. The **likelihood and scope** of environmental effects.
2. The **capacity of wildlife or habitat to recover** or be restored if damage occurs.
3. The **impact on birds or their food sources**.
4. **Cumulative effects** — how the proposed activity interacts with other existing or planned activities in the area.

> This ensures that individual activities are evaluated not in isolation, but as part of a broader environmental context.

---

### **Conditions Imposed on Permits**

All permits must include the following mandatory conditions:

- **Notification of Changes**:  
  The permit holder must **notify the Minister immediately** of any change to information provided in the application (e.g., route, equipment, personnel).

- **Carrying the Permit**:  
  Each individual carrying out the activity must **carry a copy of the permit at all times** while in the Protected Marine Area.

Additional conditions may be included, such as:

- **Location, timing, duration, and frequency** of activity
- **Types of vessels** allowed (including registration, call sign, owner, master, operator)
- **Monitoring and mitigation measures**
- **Reporting obligations** (e.g., regular reports on actual and predicted effects)
- **Limits on number of personnel** and required qualifications

> These conditions ensure accountability, transparency, and effective environmental oversight.

---

### **Permit Duration and Renewal**

- A permit **expires on the fifth anniversary** of the issue date or the date specified in the permit — whichever comes first.
- No automatic renewal; must be re-applied for after expiry.

---

### **Suspension and Cancellation of Permits**

#### **Suspension (Temporary Revocation)**

The Minister may **suspend** a permit if:

- It is necessary to protect wildlife or its habitat, especially **birds or species that are a key food source for birds**; or  
- The permit holder has **failed to comply** with any condition of the permit.

- Suspension is **temporary** and lifted when:
  - The grounds for suspension no longer exist; or  
  - The permit holder takes corrective action to resolve the issue.

> Suspension allows for enforcement and environmental protection without permanently banning activities.

#### **Cancellation (Permanent Revocation)**

A permit may be **cancelled** if:

1. It is necessary for conservation reasons (especially regarding birds or key food sources);  
2. The permit has been suspended **at least twice**;  
3. The permit has been suspended for **six months or more**; or  
4. The applicant has provided **false or misleading information**.

> Cancellation serves as a strong deterrent against non-compliance or environmental harm.
