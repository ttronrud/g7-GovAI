**Detailed Summary of the Petroleum Incentives Program Advance Ruling Fees Order (SI/83-105, 1983)**

**Regulatory Background and Authority:**

This regulation, known as the *Petroleum Incentives Program Advance Ruling Fees Order*, was issued on May 19, 1983, by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. It is grounded in two legal authorities:

1. **Paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act** – This provision empowers the Minister to make orders relating to fees for administrative services, including advance rulings under specific programs.
2. **Order in Council P.C. 1983-1507 of May 19, 1983** – This constitutional instrument grants the Minister the authority to establish fee structures for administrative processes under federal programs.

The regulation applies specifically to the **Petroleum Incentives Program Act**, which provides financial incentives to companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production in Canada.

**Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to establish a clear and fair fee structure for applicants who seek an *advance ruling* from the Minister regarding their eligibility for financial incentives under the Petroleum Incentives Program Act. An advance ruling is a formal determination by the government that a company is entitled to a specific incentive, such as tax or production-related benefits, based on the nature of its operations or project.

This fee structure ensures that the government can recover administrative costs associated with reviewing and processing these applications, while also providing transparency and predictability in the process.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Fee Structure Based on Time Spent (Per Hour):**
   - The fee payable by a person applying for an advance ruling is **$50 for each hour or part thereof** spent on the preparation of the advance ruling.
   - This means that even if the preparation effort takes only 30 minutes, the applicant must pay for a full hour.
   - This hourly rate is designed to reflect the administrative effort required to prepare and submit a detailed application, including documentation, technical data, and compliance with program requirements.

2. **Minimum Fee per Advance Ruling:**
   - The total fee for any single advance ruling **shall not be less than $250.00**.
   - This ensures that applicants cannot circumvent the fee structure by submitting applications with minimal preparation time. Even if the preparation time is less than one hour, the applicant must pay the full $250 minimum.

3. **Application Scope:**
   - The fee applies to any person seeking an advance ruling concerning their **entitlement to an incentive** under the *Petroleum Incentives Program Act*.
   - The ruling may pertain to eligibility for incentives such as production-sharing arrangements, tax credits, or other financial benefits tied to petroleum exploration or development.

**Interpretation and Practical Implications:**

- **Time-Based Fee with Minimum Cap:** The combination of an hourly rate and a minimum fee creates a hybrid fee model. For example:
  - If a company spends 1 hour preparing the application: fee = $50.
  - If it spends 2 hours: fee = $100.
  - If it spends 3 hours: fee = $150.
  - However, if the total time is less than one hour, the fee is still **$250**.

- **Cost Recovery for Government:** The government recovers administrative costs (e.g., review, technical assessment, legal analysis) through this fee structure, which helps fund the operation of the Petroleum Incentives Program.

- **Transparency and Accountability:** The clear fee structure provides applicants with a transparent cost estimate before initiating the process, enabling better budgeting and planning.

- **Fairness and Proportionality:** The minimum fee ensures that no applicant avoids the cost of applying, even for simple or short applications, thus preventing abuse of the system.

**Effective Date and Citation:**

- The Order was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on May 19, 1983, and is officially cited as:
  **Petroleum Incentives Program Advance Ruling Fees Order (SI/83-105)**

- It remains in force unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a balanced and transparent fee regime for advance rulings under the Petroleum Incentives Program. It combines a time-based fee with a minimum threshold to ensure that both the administrative burden and the financial responsibility of applicants are appropriately addressed. The structure promotes accountability, discourages frivolous applications, and ensures sustainable funding for the government’s review process in the petroleum sector.

This Order is a key component of the regulatory framework governing incentive eligibility in Canada’s oil and gas industry, reflecting a pragmatic approach to administrative cost recovery within a public policy context.
