**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, addresses a correction to previously applied fees under the *Department of Public Works and Government Services Act* by remitting certain amounts that were incorrectly collected. The action is based on a determination that the collection of these fees was unreasonable and stems from a failure to properly apply adjustments mandated by law.

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Governing Legislation**:  
  The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, to adjust or correct the collection of fees or amounts when such collection is found to be unreasonable.

- **Relevant Provision**:  
  The adjustment is specifically tied to **subsection 17(1) of the Service Fees Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**, which requires annual adjustments to service fees. However, the fees in question—specifically, the *Canada Gazette insertion fees*—were not properly adjusted under this provision.

- **Applicable Act**:  
  The fees in question are governed under **Section 17 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (S.C. 1996, c. 16)**, which sets out the rules for fees related to the publication of notices in the *Canada Gazette*.

- **Amendments and Context**:  
  The regulation references amendments to the Service Fees Act, including:
  - **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** (original enactment)
  - **S.C. 2017, c. 20, s. 451** (a later amendment that may have reinforced or clarified the requirement for annual adjustments)
  - **S.C. 1996, c. 16** (the foundational legislation on gazette fees)

### **Nature of the Correction**

The regulation corrects an **unreasonable collection** of insertion fees in the *Canada Gazette* by **remitting (returning) funds** that should have been adjusted annually under subsection 17(1) of the Service Fees Act.

This means:
- The government had previously collected fees for inserting notices in the *Canada Gazette* without applying the required annual adjustments.
- Upon review, the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services concluded that the collection of these fees was **unreasonable**—likely due to failure to account for inflation, cost changes, or other adjustments mandated by law.
- Therefore, the amounts collected in error are being **returned** to the appropriate fiscal accounts or fund pools.

### **Amounts Remitted**

Two specific amounts are remitted for two fiscal years:

1. **$3,181.38** for the **2019–2020 fiscal year**  
   → This amount represents the correction for the fee structure applied during that year, which was found to be in error due to non-compliance with the annual adjustment requirement.

2. **$4,488.69** for the **2020–2021 fiscal year**  
   → A larger adjustment is made in this year, reflecting either a more significant error or a greater impact of the unadjusted fee structure.

### **Purpose and Impact**

- **Corrective Action**: The remittance serves as a corrective measure to ensure that fees charged under the *Department of Public Works and Government Services Act* are in compliance with the Service Fees Act’s requirement for annual adjustments.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: It demonstrates the government’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and adherence to statutory requirements.
- **Prevention of Overcharging**: By returning the overcollected amounts, the government prevents public entities or individuals from being charged fees that exceed the legally mandated, adjusted levels.
- **Administrative Clarity**: The regulation provides clarity on how annual fee adjustments are to be applied and reinforces the accountability of the Treasury Board and the Minister in overseeing fee policy.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal correction issued to rectify an unreasonable fee collection under the *Canada Gazette* insertion fees. Based on statutory authority under the Financial Administration Act and the Service Fees Act, the Government of Canada is returning **$3,181.38** and **$4,488.69** to the relevant accounts for the fiscal years 2019–2020 and 2020–2021, respectively. The action ensures compliance with the requirement for annual fee adjustments and upholds the principle of fair and reasonable fee collection in public administration.

This type of adjustment is typically part of periodic fiscal reviews and reflects a broader effort to maintain transparency, equity, and legal compliance in government fee structures.
