The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SI/2010-83, s. 5]

This indicates that a particular regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially cancelled or withdrawn) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2010-83, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2010-83**, which is a type of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (or a similar jurisdiction, depending on context).  
  - **SI/2010-83** refers to the specific instrument issued in 2010, numbered 83.
  - **Section 5** of that instrument explicitly contains the provision that repeals the original regulation.

- **Nature of the Repeal**:  
  The repeated entries suggest that multiple provisions or sections (possibly parts of a broader regulation) were repealed by the same instrument. However, without the original regulation’s name or content, it is not possible to identify exactly what was repealed.

- **Implications**:  
  - Any legal obligations, definitions, requirements, or procedures previously established by the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
  - Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to the current, active legislation that supersedes it.
  - The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative update, consolidation, or correction of outdated or redundant rules.

- **Jurisdictional Context**:  
  Statutory Instruments are typically used in the UK (or Commonwealth countries) to implement or amend primary legislation. SI 2010-83 likely relates to a field such as environmental regulation, health, transport, or public administration, though the specific subject area is not specified here.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the entries is **no longer valid** and has been formally **repealed by Statutory Instrument 2010-83, section 5**. This means it is of no legal effect and should not be relied upon in legal, regulatory, or administrative contexts. For accurate current legislation, one must consult the current version of the relevant statute or the official legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk) to identify the successor provision or the new rules that now apply.
