**Regulation Title:**  
*Exemption from Restrictions on Investments (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations*

**Enactment Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **paragraphs 459(a)a and (b)a** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.

**Statutory Basis:**  
- Paragraph 459(a)a and (b)a of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (TCLA)  
- Section 550 of *The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act*, Chapter 9 of the Statutes of Canada, 2001 (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 550)  
- Reference to earlier enactment: S.C. 1991, c. 45  

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

It removes the application of specific regulatory limitations when determining whether a trust or loan company may acquire a "substantial investment" in another entity.

### Key Provisions:

#### 1. **Scope of Exemption:**
The regulation provides that **subsections 453(4) to (6)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* **do not apply** when assessing whether a company is permitted to acquire a substantial investment in another entity under any of the following circumstances:

- Subsection **451(2)** of the Act  
- Paragraph **451(3)(b)** or **(c)** of the Act  
- Subsection **451(4)** of the Act  
- Subsection **453(1)** or **(2)** of the Act  

This exemption applies specifically to the **determination of whether a substantial investment is permissible**, as outlined in **subparagraph 453(3)(f)(ii)** of the Act.

#### 2. **Interpretation of Subparagraph 453(3)(f)(ii):**
- Subparagraph 453(3)(f)(ii) outlines a condition under which a trust or loan company may be restricted from making certain investments.  
- The regulation clarifies that **this restriction does not trigger** when evaluating whether a company can acquire a substantial investment in another entity, **provided** the investment falls within the scope of the above-listed provisions (451(2), 451(3)(b)/(c), 451(4), 453(1)/(2)).

In essence, **the usual restrictions on investment (as set out in sections 453(4) to (6)) are suspended** in these specific scenarios — allowing greater flexibility in investment decisions by trust and loan companies.

#### 3. **Effective Date:**
The regulations come into force on the day that **paragraphs 459(a) and (b)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* come into force, as enacted by **section 550 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 550)**.

- The effective date is **October 24, 2001**, as noted in the note referencing *SI/2001-102* (Statutory Instrument 2001-102).

### Implications and Significance:

- **Increased Investment Flexibility:** Trust and loan companies are allowed to make substantial investments in other entities without being subject to the usual regulatory barriers (such as ownership limits or restrictions on related-party investments) that would otherwise be imposed under sections 453(4) to (6).
- **Targeted Relief:** The exemption is not broad or general — it applies only in specific situations defined in sections 451 and 453 of the Act. This ensures that the regulatory framework remains focused and targeted.
- **Alignment with Financial Consumer Protection Goals:** The amendment supports the broader objectives of financial stability and market efficiency by enabling trust and loan companies to participate more actively in investment activities, particularly in areas related to financial services and trust management.
- **Regulatory Clarity:** The regulation removes ambiguity in the application of investment restrictions, providing clear guidance to financial institutions on when such restrictions do not apply.

### Conclusion:

This regulation is a **targeted exemption** that allows trust and loan companies to acquire substantial investments in other entities without being subject to the investment restrictions typically applied under sections 453(4) to (6) of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*. It operates within the framework of specific statutory provisions (451 and 453) and only applies when assessing investments under those subsections. The exemption came into effect on **October 24, 2001**, following the enactment of section 550 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act, and reflects a policy decision to enhance the operational flexibility of trust and loan companies while maintaining oversight and financial stability.

This regulation is an example of how regulatory frameworks can be adapted to support financial institution activities while preserving the integrity of the investment and trust sectors.
