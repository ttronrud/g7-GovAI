**Detailed Summary of the Indian Bands Council Method of Election Regulations**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation, officially titled the *Indian Bands Council Method of Election Regulations*, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, under **subsection 74(3) and 74(4) of the Indian Act**.

#### **Key Background Elements:**

1. **Historical Context:**
   - On **December 14, 1989**, the Minister declared via the *Indian Bands Council Election Order* that the councils of certain Indian bands would be elected through democratic processes as mandated by the Indian Act.
   - Prior to this, election procedures for band councils were often governed by outdated or inconsistent orders and regulations.

2. **Revocation of Previous Orders:**
   - The Governor in Council has determined that all **previous orders and regulations** made under subsections 74(3) or 74(4) of the Indian Act — including those listed in **Part I of the Schedule** — are **repealed and revoked**.
   - This action ensures a **unified, modern, and consistent regulatory framework** for band council elections.

3. **Band Referendum and Consent:**
   - A **referendum or special meeting** was held for certain bands listed in **Schedule III**.
   - A **majority of the electors** who participated in these meetings **approved** the division of their reserves into **electoral sections** for voting purposes.
   - Based on this democratic consent, the Minister recommended the division of reserves, which the Governor in Council has now formally adopted.

### **Main Provisions of the Regulation**

#### **1. Election of Chief and Councillors – General Rule (Schedule I & II)**

- **For Bands in Schedule I:**
  - The **Chief** and **Councillors** of each band are elected by a **majority of the votes of the electors** of the band.
  - This means that all band members (eligible electors) vote directly in a general election for both chief and councillors.

- **For Bands in Schedule II:**
  - **Councillors** are elected by a **majority of the votes of the electors** of the band.
  - The **Chief** is elected by a **majority of the votes of the elected councillors** from among themselves.
  - This system establishes a **council-based selection process** for the chief, where the chief is chosen by the elected councillors, promoting internal accountability and consensus.

> This reflects a shift from direct election of the chief to a **representative model**, where councillors first elect the chief — a process that may be intended to encourage stability and shared governance.

#### **2. Division of Reserves into Electoral Sections (Schedule III)**

- For each band listed in **Column I of Schedule III**, the **reserve land** is to be divided into **electoral sections**.
- The number of sections is specified in **Column II** of each item.
- Each section is **distinctly identified** by a **number and description** in **Column III** (e.g., "Section 1: North End of the Reserve").

> **Purpose of Division:**
> - To allow for **more localized and representative voting**.
> - To ensure that candidates are accountable to specific communities within the reserve.
> - To provide **greater electoral fairness and inclusivity**, especially in larger or geographically dispersed reserves.

#### **3. Election of Chief and Councillors in Divided Reserves (Schedule III)**

- For bands in **Schedule III**, the **Chief** is elected by a **majority of the votes of the electors of the band**.
- The **Councillors** are elected by a **majority of the votes of the electors of the band in the electoral section** where the candidate:
  - **Resides**, and
  - **Proposes to represent** on the band council.

> This provision is critical:
> - It ensures that candidates are **rooted in a specific community**.
> - It promotes **local representation**, giving residents of a particular section a voice in council decisions.
