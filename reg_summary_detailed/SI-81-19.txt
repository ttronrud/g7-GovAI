**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Authorization of Fees for Private Sector Services by the Department of Communications**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
This regulation is issued under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Communications** and the **Treasury Board**. It grants the **Minister of Communications** the authority to **prescribe fees** for private sector services and goods provided by the **Department of Communications (DOC)**.

The primary objective of the Department is to **foster the orderly development and operation of communications** in both domestic and international contexts. As such, the Department will provide services to the private sector, but only when necessary and in accordance with established cost and policy frameworks.

### **2. Key Definitions and Cost Components**

To ensure transparency, consistency, and fairness in fee-setting, the regulation defines key financial and operational terms:

#### **A. Depreciation**
- Calculated as: **Capital cost of equipment ÷ expected useful life**.
- The useful life must be certified by **two departmental employees**, one of whom must be a **financial officer from financial services**.

#### **B. Direct Costs**
All costs directly attributable to a specific service or good:
- **Direct Labour Cost**
  - Includes: Basic wage/salary, shift premiums, fringe benefits, and overtime premiums.
  - **Fringe benefits** include employer contributions to:
    - Superannuation
    - Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
    - Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)
    - Supplementary Death Benefits
    - Unemployment Insurance
    - Medical and Surgical Insurance
    - Hospital Insurance
  - Annual labour cost is divided by **1650 available hours per year** (based on 365 days minus weekends, holidays, leave, and 7.5 hours/day), unless overridden by a collective agreement.

- **Direct Material Cost**
  - Cost of materials used in service delivery, based on **expected actual usage and cost**.

- **Equipment Cost**
  - Includes:
    - Depreciation (capital cost + depreciation)
    - Maintenance (labour, materials, direct expenses)
    - Space (if significant)
  - **Maintenance labour** is pro-rated based on expected annual usage.
  - **Material costs** = cost of replacement parts.
  - **Direct expenses** = e.g., maintenance contracts.

- **Space Allocation**
  - If equipment occupies significant space, a portion of building costs is allocated.
  - Annual carrying cost of building = **Capital cost × Capital Recovery Factor**.
  - **Capital Recovery Factor Formula**:
    $$
    \text{Annual Installment} = \frac{\text{Present Sum}}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}} \quad \text{(where } r = \text{long-term borrowing rate, } n = \text{useful life)}
    $$
  - Interest rate used: **long-term borrowing rate** set by the Department of Finance.
  - Annual cost is divided by **square feet occupied** by equipment.

#### **C. Full Cost**
- Sum of all **direct costs** and **indirect costs**.

#### **D. Incremental Cost**
- The cost of producing **additional units** beyond the level funded by appropriation.
- Example: If an appropriation funds 100 units, but 150 are required, the incremental cost is the cost of the extra 50 units.

#### **E. Indirect Costs (Overhead)**
- Overhead costs not directly tied to a service but allocated via a basis (e.g., direct labour).
- Includes:
  - Statutory expenses
  - Departmental administration costs (from Main Estimates)
  - Sector overhead
  - Services provided free by other government departments
  - Minus **formula-based indirect overhead recoveries** from the Department of National Defence
- Overhead rate is **calculated annually** by the Comptroller’s Branch:
  - Total overhead cost ÷ Total direct labour cost (basic salary + shift premium + fringe benefits)
- This rate is applied to **direct labour cost** for each service.

#### **F. Interest on Undepreciated Capital Cost**
- Interest applied to the **remaining capital cost** of equipment after depreciation.
- Formula:  
  $$
  \text{Annual Interest} = (\text{Capital Cost} - \text{Accumulated Depreciation}) \times \text{Long-term borrowing rate}
  $$
- Rate is determined by the **Department of Finance**.

### **3. Fee Structure and Pricing Policy**

#### **A. Domestic Services (Canada)**
- Fees are charged for:
  - **All direct costs**
  - **All indirect costs (overhead)**

#### **B. International Services (Outside Canada)**
- Fees are charged at:
  - **Total cost + 200% markup** to recover **Government of Canada overhead costs**
- This markup ensures full recovery of overhead, which is not feasible in domestic pricing due to different cost structures and risk profiles.

#### **C. Exceptions and Flexibility**
- The **Minister of Communications** may **alter or waive** fees if:
  - The fee would **undermine the Department’s objectives** (e.g., public interest, innovation, accessibility)
- This discretion allows for flexibility in exceptional cases (e.g., public benefit, research, or national security).

#### **D. Contract Duration**
- Contracts **cannot exceed the duration of the prevailing fee schedule**.
- Any extension beyond that period requires a **written amendment** to the contract.

---

### **4. Written Agreements and Service Requests**

#### **Mandatory Requirements**
- Every request for a service must result in a **written agreement** before work begins.
- The agreement must include:
  - Ownership or rights in products tested or goods produced
  - Limited liability of DOC for damage or loss of applicant’s product
  - Confidentiality obligations
  - Patent rights: DOC may hold patent rights over new discoveries **unless otherwise agreed**
  - Identification of confidential information and safeguards for such data

#### **Pre-Approval Process**
- Requests must be submitted to the **Responsibility Centre Manager**.
- The manager will:
  1. Determine whether the **Canadian private sector can provide the service** due to:
     - Lack of specialized expertise
     - Unavailability of equipment/facilities
     - If yes, the request is **returned with justification**
  2. Confirm that:
     - The service is **within DOC’s mandate**
     - DOC has the **capability and capacity** to deliver it
     - If not, the request is **returned with explanation**

> Work may begin **in advance of formal acceptance** only if authorized by the **A.D.M. (Assistant Deputy Minister)**.

### **5. Joint Research Projects**

- The Department may enter into **joint research contracts** where:
  - Both parties contribute funding
  - Costs are shared according to agreed terms
- This enables collaborative innovation while maintaining financial accountability.

### **6. Authorization and Review Process for Fee Schedules**

#### **Responsibility**
- **Sector management** is responsible for:
  - Monitoring operations
  - Identifying services requiring fee schedules
  - Promptly notifying the **Comptroller’s Branch** of such needs

#### **Fee Development**
- The **sector providing the service** must develop **proposed fee schedules**.

#### **Annual Review (Program Forecast)**
- The **Responsibility Centre Manager**, in collaboration with the **Comptroller’s Branch**, reviews:
  - Costs incurred
  - Revenue generated
- Based on this review, decisions are made on:
  - Whether to **continue or terminate** a service
  - Whether **cost elements have changed**
- If changes are needed, **recommendations are submitted to the Minister of Communications**

#### **Approval Pathway**
