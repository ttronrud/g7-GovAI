**Detailed Summary of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund Increase in Benefits Order**

---

### **1. Background and Rationale**

The regulation is issued in response to a report under **Section 56 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act (R.C.M.P. Pension Continuation Act)**, which indicates that the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Dependants) Pension Fund** contains a significant surplus relative to the amount required to adequately cover future pension obligations.

This surplus suggests that the fund is currently overfunded and capable of supporting additional benefits without jeopardizing long-term financial stability. Based on this finding, the **Treasury Board**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, determines that it is appropriate to increase pension benefits for dependants of RCMP members.

The decision is authorized under:
- **Subsection 57(1) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. R-10)** – which empowers the Treasury Board to adjust pension benefits when necessary to ensure adequacy and fairness.
- **Paragraph 7(2)(e) of the Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)** – which grants the Treasury Board the authority to make financial orders related to pension and benefit adjustments.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Order**

The Order increases specific pension benefits for current and prospective dependants of RCMP members over a three-year period, effective **April 1, 2011**, and continuing through the 2011, 2012, and 2013 plan years.

#### **(a) Increased Pensions for Current and Prospective Widows and Children**

- **Benefit Adjustment**: A **2% annual increase** in pension amounts for:
  - Current widows
  - Prospective widows
  - Children of deceased members
- **Effective Dates**: The increase applies **as of April 1** in each of the following plan years:
  - **2011**
  - **2012**
  - **2013**

> This means that beneficiaries receive a 2% raise in their monthly pension payments each year, beginning April 1, 2011, and continuing through April 1, 2013.

#### **(b) Increased Lump Sum Benefits on Death of a Member**

- **Benefit Adjustment**: A **2% annual increase** in lump sum benefits payable to the family of a deceased RCMP member.
- **Effective Dates**: Also effective as of **April 1** in:
  - 2011
  - 2012
  - 2013

> This ensures that families receiving a one-time death benefit receive a 2% increase each year, providing enhanced financial support during times of loss.

#### **(c) Residual Amounts Payable to a Widow on Death of a Member**

This provision is particularly significant and introduces a **non-interest-bearing, substantial deemed contribution increase** to the calculation of residual benefits (i.e., the portion of the pension payable to a widow after the death of her spouse).

- **Deemed Increase in Member’s Contributions**:
  - **2012 Plan Year**: A **1,173%** deemed increase in the member’s contributions.
  - **2013 Plan Year**: A **1,198%** deemed increase.
  - **2014 Plan Year**: A **1,224%** deemed increase.

> **Important Notes**:
> - These are **not actual contributions** made by the member.
> - Instead, they represent a **hypothetical increase** in the member’s contribution base used to calculate the residual amount.
> - The increase is **without interest crediting** — meaning the benefit calculation does not account for any interest earned on the original contributions.
> - The purpose is to **increase the value of the residual benefit** to reflect the surplus in the pension fund, thereby providing greater financial support to widows.

> Example: If a widow receives a residual benefit based on a member’s contribution base of $100,000, the 1,173% deemed increase would effectively raise the base to $1,173,000 (i.e., $100,000 × 11.73), and the residual benefit would be calculated on this inflated amount — even though no actual contributions were made.

### **3. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into effect on April 1, 2011**.
- The increases apply annually from that date through the end of the 2013 plan year.
- The residual benefit adjustments are tied to the **plan year of the member’s death**, not the year the order is issued.

### **4. Legal Authority and Governance**

- The Order is issued under:
  - **Section 57(1)** of the *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act (R.S.C. 1970, c. R-10)*: Allows the Treasury Board to adjust pension benefits when a surplus exists.
  - **Paragraph 7(2)(e)** of the *Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)*: Authorizes the Treasury Board to make financial orders related to pension and benefit adjustments.

This reflects a formal, legally sound process where financial oversight bodies ensure that pension funds are managed responsibly and that benefits are adjusted in line with fiscal conditions.

### **5. Purpose and Implications**

- **Objective**: To ensure that the pension fund, which has a surplus, is used to improve the financial security of RCMP dependants.
- **Impact**:
  - Provides **real, measurable increases** in pension and lump sum benefits over three years.
  - Offers **substantial enhancement** to residual benefits for widows, especially in later years (2013–2014), which may significantly improve long-term financial outcomes.
  - Demonstrates a commitment to **fairness and adequacy** in pension provisions for RCMP families.

---

### **6. Key Observations and Considerations**

- The **1,173% to 1,224% deemed increases** are extremely high and appear to be a symbolic or structural mechanism to reflect the surplus in the fund.
- The **lack of interest crediting** suggests that the increase is purely based on contribution base adjustments, not on investment returns.
- The **timing** of the increases (starting April 1, 2011) aligns with fiscal planning cycles and annual pension review periods.
- The Order is **non-renewable** beyond the 2014 plan year unless further action is taken by the Treasury Board or the Minister.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a targeted and legally authorized adjustment to the pension benefits of dependants of RCMP members. It leverages the fund’s surplus to provide meaningful, year-on-year increases in pensions and lump sums, while introducing a dramatic, non-interest-based increase in residual benefits for widows. The Order underscores the government’s recognition of the value of RCMP families and its commitment to ensuring that pension benefits are both adequate and equitable, even in the face of fiscal prudence.

It serves as a model of how surplus pension funds can be responsibly used to enhance benefits without compromising long-term solvency.
