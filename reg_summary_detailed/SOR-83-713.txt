**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Wood Order, 1983 (SOR/81-347)**

---

### **Background and Context**
This regulation, officially titled *The Quebec Wood Order, 1983*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. It serves as a formal revocation and replacement of several outdated provincial wood marketing orders that had previously governed the regulation of wood production and trade in Quebec.

The original orders revoked include:
- The **Quebec Wood Order** (P.C. 1981-1158, May 7, 1981)
- The **Eastern Townships Wood Order** (C.R.C., c. 261)
- The **Gaspesia Pulpwood Order** (C.R.C., c. 250)
- The **Gatineau Wood Order** (C.R.C., c. 262)
- The **Pontiac Wood Order** (C.R.C., c. 263)
- The **Quebec-South Wood Order** (C.R.C., c. 264)

These older orders were considered outdated, fragmented, and inconsistent in their scope and application across different regions of Quebec. The 1983 Order consolidates and modernizes the regulatory framework for the **marketing of wood produced in Quebec**, particularly in **interprovincial and export markets**.

---

### **Purpose of the New Order**
The primary objective of the Quebec Wood Order, 1983, is to:
- **Streamline and unify** the regulation of wood marketing across Quebec.
- Provide a **single, comprehensive regulatory structure** that replaces multiple regional orders.
- Enable **effective oversight and fair market practices** in both domestic and international trade.
- Ensure **equitable distribution of revenue**, protect producers, and stabilize the wood industry through mechanisms such as levies and reserves.

### **Key Definitions**
The Order establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *An Act Respecting the Marketing of Agricultural, Food and Fish Products* (R.S.Q., c. M-35.1), a Quebec statute that governs the marketing of agricultural and related products. |
| **Commodity Board** | A specific board responsible for implementing and administering a given marketing plan. Identified in Column I of the Schedule and linked to a geographic or regional plan in Column II. |
| **Plan** | A marketing plan established under the Quebec Act (R.S.Q., c. M-35.1) for managing the production, marketing, and pricing of wood. |
| **Wood** | Any wood produced within the Province of Quebec. |

---

### **Core Powers and Authorities Granted to Commodity Boards**

#### 1. **Regulatory Authority in Interprovincial and Export Trade**
Each Commodity Board is granted **full regulatory authority** over the marketing of wood in:
- **Interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces)
- **Export trade** (sales to foreign markets)

This authority includes **all powers** that the board previously exercised in regulating the **local marketing of wood within Quebec**, under the Act and its associated Plan. This ensures consistency and continuity in policy application.

> *Example*: A Commodity Board can set minimum quality standards, establish pricing mechanisms, and enforce compliance with marketing rules when wood is sold outside Quebec.

#### 2. **Power to Impose Levies and Charges**
Commodity Boards may:
- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in the **production or marketing of wood** within Quebec.
- Classify these persons into **distinct groups** (e.g., by type of operation, volume of production, or region).
- Set **different levies or charges** for different groups.

> *Example*: A small forest owner might pay a lower levy than a large pulpwood processor, based on their production volume or market role.

#### 3. **Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for various purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize markets during downturns)
- **Payment of operational expenses and losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of wood
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers
  - This helps ensure that producers who sell at lower prices during downturns are compensated, and those who benefit during high prices share in the gains.

> *Purpose*: To promote **economic fairness**, **market stability**, and **producers’ financial protection**.

### **Legal Basis and Legislative Framework**
- The Order is authorized under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the federal government to revoke or replace provincial marketing regulations when necessary.
- It operates within the broader framework of the **Quebec Act Respecting the Marketing of Agricultural, Food and Fish Products (R.S.Q., c. M-35.1)**, which provides the legal foundation for commodity boards and marketing plans.

### **Significance and Impacts**
1. **Centralization and Efficiency**  
   Replaces six separate regional orders with a single, integrated regulatory framework, reducing administrative complexity and improving coordination.

2. **Market Stability**  
   By allowing levies and equalization mechanisms, the Order helps cushion producers against price volatility in interprovincial and export markets.

3. **Producers’ Protection**  
   Provides financial safeguards through reserves and income equalization, especially important in cyclical industries like forestry.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The classification of producers into groups and the clear rules on levy collection promote transparency and fairness.

5. **Support for Sustainable Forestry**  
   By stabilizing markets and ensuring fair returns, the Order supports long-term investment in Quebec’s forest sector.
