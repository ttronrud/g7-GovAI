**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Chicken Order**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Authority**

The British Columbia Chicken Order was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **subsections 2(1) and (2) of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. This regulatory instrument establishes specific rules governing the marketing of chickens in British Columbia, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

This Order is a **legally binding regulation** that operates under the broader framework of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*, which empowers the government to regulate the marketing of agricultural products to ensure fair pricing, market stability, and equitable distribution among producers.

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in application, the Order defines several key terms:

- **Chicken**:  
  Refers to any chicken of any class that is **under six months of age**, **not raised or used for egg production**, and **grown within the geographic area covered by the Scheme**.  
  This definition also includes:
  - Any **chicken component** (e.g., meat, bones, organs),
  - Any **article of food or drink** that is **wholly or partially manufactured or derived from chicken** (e.g., chicken nuggets, chicken broth, processed meat products).  
  The term "poulet" is included as a French equivalent, indicating the Order's bilingual context and application in French-speaking communities in BC.

- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the **British Columbia Chicken Marketing Board**, which continues to operate under the authority of the *Scheme*.  
  This body is the central regulatory and administrative entity responsible for managing the marketing and pricing of chicken in BC.

- **Scheme**:  
  Refers to the *British Columbia Chicken Marketing Scheme of 1961*, as amended over time.  
  The Scheme was originally established by **Order in Council No. 3093/61** issued on **December 12, 1961**, under the *Natural Products Marketing (BC) Act*.  
  The Scheme provides the foundational framework for the marketing, pricing, and distribution of chicken in the province.

### **3. Powers of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted broad authority to regulate the **marketing of chickens** in **interprovincial and export trade**, mirroring the powers it already has for **local marketing within British Columbia**.

Specifically, the Board may exercise all or any of the powers listed in **paragraphs 4.01(a) to (j) and (l)** of the Scheme — which typically include powers related to:
- Setting minimum prices,
- Regulating supply and demand,
- Managing market access,
- Enforcing quality standards,
- Coordinating production and distribution.

These powers are extended to **persons and property** involved in the production or marketing of chickens within BC, enabling the Board to maintain market stability and protect producers from price volatility.

### **4. Authority to Impose Levies and Charges**

A central function of the Order is the Board’s power to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on chicken,
- **Collect those levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in the **production or marketing of chicken**.

To ensure fairness and equity, the Board may:
- **Classify producers into different groups** (e.g., small farms, large-scale operations, exporters),
- **Set different levies or charges** for each group based on size, volume, or other relevant factors.

This classification allows for **proportional and equitable financial contributions** from different types of producers.

---

### **5. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize markets during downturns),
- **Payment of operational expenses** associated with the marketing and administration of the Scheme,
- **Covering losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of chicken (e.g., unsold inventory, market collapse),
- **Equalizing or adjusting payments** among producers to ensure that those who realize lower sales revenues during a period receive financial support to maintain equity.

This mechanism helps **distribute financial risk** across the industry and ensures that producers are not disproportionately affected by market fluctuations.

---

### **6. Repeal Clause**

This Order **does not create new legislation**; rather, it is a **regulatory amendment** to the existing Scheme. The Order explicitly includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that it **comes into force on August 28, 1997**, and supersedes or replaces any prior provisions that may have conflicted with it.

This date marks the effective implementation of the updated rules for chicken marketing in British Columbia, aligning the regulatory framework with evolving market conditions and administrative needs.

---

### **7. Significance and Purpose**

The British Columbia Chicken Order serves several key purposes:

- **Market Stabilization**: By allowing the Board to set prices and collect levies, it helps prevent extreme price swings that could harm producers.
- **Producer Protection**: Financial reserves and loss-sharing mechanisms protect small and medium-sized farms from economic shocks.
- **Interprovincial and Export Readiness**: The Board’s expanded powers ensure that BC chicken can be marketed effectively outside the province and internationally, with consistent standards and pricing.
- **Equity and Fairness**: Group-based levies ensure that contributions are proportional and fair, reducing the burden on smaller operations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The British Columbia Chicken Order is a critical regulatory instrument that strengthens the oversight and financial sustainability of the chicken marketing system in British Columbia. By empowering the Commodity Board to manage levies, create reserves, and ensure equitable outcomes across producer groups, it supports a stable, fair, and resilient agricultural market — both domestically and in export markets.

It reflects a long-standing policy of **cooperative marketing** in the Canadian agricultural sector, where government-supported boards help balance supply and demand, protect producers, and ensure the economic viability of local food production.
