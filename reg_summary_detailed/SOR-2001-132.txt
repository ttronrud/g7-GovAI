---

### **4. Short-Form Descriptions and Violation Classification**

- Each violation has a **short-form description** (in Column 2 of Schedule 1) to simplify enforcement notices.
- However, **in case of any discrepancy**, the **legislative provision itself takes precedence** over the short-form description.

#### Violation Classification:

| Type of Violation | Classification |
|------------------|----------------|
| Causes or could cause **minor harm** (e.g., low-level environmental or health risk, under $1,000 loss) | **Minor violation** |
| Could cause **serious harm** (e.g., significant health/environmental risk, loss >$1,000) | **Serious violation** |
| Causes **serious harm** (e.g., major harm to health, environment, or people) | **Very serious violation** |

> The classification determines the applicable penalty amount.

---

### **5. Penalty Amounts**

Penalties vary based on:
- The **type of violator** (individual vs. business),
- Whether the violation was **committed for financial gain**,
- The **severity** of the violation (minor, serious, very serious).

#### A. Individual Violators (Not in Business or for Financial Gain)

| Violation Type | Penalty |
|---------------|--------|
| Minor violation | $500 |
| Serious violation | $800 |
| Very serious violation | $1,300 |

#### B. Violators in Business or for Financial Benefit

| Violation Type | Penalty |
|---------------|--------|
| Minor violation | $1,300 |
| Serious violation | $6,000 |
| Very serious violation | $10,000 |

> **Adjustments** to these penalties are applied based on the **total gravity value** established under **Schedule 2**, which considers:
- Prior violations,
- Degree of intent or negligence,
- Harm caused.

---

### **6. Determining Total Gravity Value (for Serious/Very Serious Violations)**

The total gravity value is calculated by assessing three criteria:

| Criterion | Source in Schedule 3 |
|--------|------------------------|
| **History of Prior Violations** | Column 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 3 |
| **Degree of Intent or Negligence** | Column 2 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 |
| **Harm Caused or Potentially Caused** | Column 2 of Part 3 of Schedule 3 |

**Process**:
1. Assign a gravity value (from Column 1) for each criterion.
2. Sum the values to determine the **total gravity value**.
3. This total is used to adjust the base penalty (e.g., $6,000 or $10,000) upward or downward.

> Example: A person with a history of prior offenses, high intent, and significant environmental harm would receive a higher gravity value and thus a higher penalty.

---

### **7. Compliance Agreements and Penalty Reductions**

- If a person enters into a **compliance agreement** under **subsection 10(1)** of the Act:
  - The penalty is **reduced by $1 for every $2** the person spends on corrective actions.
  - **Maximum reduction is to nil** (i.e., no penalty if full compliance costs are met).

> This encourages corrective action and rehabilitation.
