**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Canadian Coast Guard Functions to the Department of National Defence**

**Legal Basis:**  
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207), as codified in the *Regulations of the Public Service* (R.S., c. P-34). This provision enables the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Prime Minister—to reassign certain functions, departments, or services within the federal public administration, including the transfer of control and supervision.

**Nature of the Transfer:**  
The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of two specific components within the former *Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)*:

1. **The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG)**  
2. **The Canadian Coast Guard Support Services Group (CCG-SSG)**

These entities are responsible for a range of maritime-related operations, including:

- Search and rescue (SAR) operations  
- Maritime safety and security  
- Icebreaking and navigation support  
- Environmental protection and pollution response  
- Coastal and offshore monitoring  
- Emergency response and maritime law enforcement support  

The **Support Services Group** provides administrative, logistical, technical, and operational support to the Canadian Coast Guard, including maintenance, communications, training, and supply chain management.

**Key Implications of the Transfer:**

- **Administrative Shift:** While the operational responsibilities of the Coast Guard remain largely unchanged, the **overseeing authority** (i.e., control and supervision) is now vested in the **Department of National Defence (DND)**. This includes policy direction, budgetary oversight, staffing decisions, and strategic planning.

- **Continuity of Operations:** The actual day-to-day operations of the Coast Guard are not disrupted. The services continue to deliver their critical public safety and national security functions, but now under the administrative and strategic umbrella of DND.

- **Strategic Rationale:** The transfer reflects a broader government strategy to enhance coordination between national defense and civil emergency response capabilities. Given that the Canadian Coast Guard performs functions that overlap with national security—such as SAR, maritime surveillance, and response to emergencies—the integration under DND strengthens inter-agency coordination during crises.

- **Legal and Institutional Framework:** The transfer is not a dissolution or reorganization of the Coast Guard itself. It is a reassignment of administrative control under federal public service restructuring rules. The functions remain within the federal government, but are now managed under a different department.

- **Timeline and Implementation:** The transfer was enacted in **2003** through the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, and the implementation began in the following years, with full integration into DND operations occurring by the mid-2000s.

**Purpose and Objectives:**

- Improve national coordination in maritime safety and security.  
- Enhance the responsiveness of emergency services during natural disasters, maritime incidents, or national emergencies.  
- Align Coast Guard operations with broader national defense and security priorities.  
- Promote resource efficiency through centralized oversight and shared infrastructure.

**Relevant Legal References:**  
- *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
- *Regulations of the Public Service*, R.S., c. P-34 (specifically paragraph 2(a)(a))  

**Note on Current Status (as of 2024):**  
This transfer remains in effect. As of recent years, the Canadian Coast Guard continues to operate under the Department of National Defence, although it retains its distinct mandate and operational identity. In some policy discussions, there has been renewed interest in re-evaluating the structure, especially in light of evolving maritime challenges and climate-related risks. However, no formal reversal or reversion of the transfer has occurred.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal government. It consolidates the oversight of the Canadian Coast Guard and its support services under the Department of National Defence, enhancing coordination between civil and military maritime operations. While the operational functions remain unchanged, the shift in control reflects a strategic decision to align maritime safety and emergency response with national defense priorities.
