### **Detailed Summary of the Emergency Order for the Protection of the Greater Sage-Grouse (S.C. 2002, c. 29)**

This emergency regulation, issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)** by the **Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, is designed to protect the **Greater Sage-Grouse** (*Centrocercus urophasianus*) from imminent threats to its survival and recovery. The order applies specifically to **Alberta and Saskatchewan**, where the species' habitat is located, and establishes strict prohibitions on activities that could degrade or destroy critical habitat.

---

## **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- **Purpose**: To prevent further decline of the Greater Sage-Grouse population by protecting its essential habitat from human activities that threaten its survival.
- **Legal Authority**: Issued under:
  - **Section 80** of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), which allows the government to issue emergency orders when a species is at risk of extinction.
  - **Subsection 97(2)** of SARA, which empowers the Minister to make emergency orders to protect species at risk.

> The order is an **emergency measure** due to the perceived **imminent threat** to the species' survival and recovery.

## **2. Definitions Used in the Order**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Agricultural operation** | As defined by provincial law in the relevant jurisdiction (Alberta or Saskatchewan). |
| **Legal Subdivision (LSD)** | A land unit in the Dominion Land Survey System equal to **16 hectares (400m × 400m)**, or **1/4 of a quarter-section**. |
| **Quarter-section** | A land unit of approximately **64 hectares (800m × 800m)**. |

These definitions are essential for identifying the exact geographic areas under protection.

---

## **3. Exclusions from the Order**

The order **does not apply** to the following areas:

- **Legal subdivision 12** of the **northwest quarter-section of section 29, township 2, range 29, west of the third meridian**.
- **Legal subdivisions 3, 4, 5, and 6** of the **southwest quarter-section** of the same section, township, and range.

> These areas are excluded due to specific ecological, historical, or land-use considerations, likely related to existing agricultural or infrastructure activity.

---

## **4. Designated Habitat Areas**

The order identifies specific areas essential for the **survival or recovery** of the Greater Sage-Grouse:

### In **Alberta**:
- Legal subdivisions (LSDs) listed in **Column 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1**, where a provision is specified in **Columns 2 to 5**.
- **Road allowances** between any two such LSDs and contiguous to them.
- **Intersections** of road allowances where each corner touches a protected LSD.

### In **Saskatchewan**:
- Same structure as in Alberta, using **Part 2 of Schedule 1**.

> These areas collectively form the **core habitat** for the species, including:
> - Native sagebrush and grassland ecosystems.
> - Connectivity between habitat patches (via road allowances).
> - Critical interface zones (intersections) that support movement and foraging.

---

## **5. Prohibited Activities**

The following activities are **strictly prohibited** within the designated habitat areas:

### (a) **Killing or Moving Native Plants**
- Killing or moving **sagebrush, native grasses, or native forbs** is prohibited, **except**:
  - In areas previously used for growing and harvesting **non-native plants** in **2011, 2012, or 2013**.
  - In areas **on or within 15 meters of a road edge**.

### (b) **Installing or Constructing Fences**
- Fencing is **prohibited** in legal subdivisions or road allowances, **except**:
  - Fences to manage **grazing animals** that comply with **Schedule 2 standards**.
  - Watering systems that do **not destroy more than 30 m²** of native vegetation.

> **Fence height limits**:
> - **Non-bison grazing fences**: ≤ **1.2 meters**.
> - **Bison grazing fences**: ≤ **1.7 meters**.
> - Fences must **not use page wire, chicken wire, chain link, or similar woven wire**.
> - **Top wire must be barbless**.
> - **Top two wires must have flagging or reflectors every ≤1.5 meters**.
> - **Fence posts must deter avian predators** (e.g., spikes, caps, cones, or angled metal posts at ~45°).

### (c) **Noise-Producing Structures or Machines**
- **No structure or machine** may produce noise exceeding **45 dB(A)** for:
  - At least **60 minutes per day** on **at least 10 days** in any given month.
- **New construction** of such structures is prohibited.
- **Alterations** to existing structures that increase noise are prohibited.
- **Applies only to paved, oiled, graded, or levelled roads** used by motor vehicles.

> **Noise restriction applies during specific hours**:
> - From **1.5 hours before sunset to 1.5 hours after sunrise**.
> - From **April 1 to May 30** each year (critical breeding period).
> - Sunset/sunrise times are based on **Environment Canada forecasts**.

### (d) **Road Construction or Widening**
- **No new roads** or **widening of existing roads** allowed in protected areas.

### (e) **Installation of Structures or Poles >1.2 m**
- No installation or height increase of **non-fence structures** (e.g., poles, machines) beyond **1.2 m** in height.
- Applies to all structures except those related to agricultural operations or public safety.

## **6. Exceptions and Exemptions**

Several key **exceptions** are provided to balance conservation with agricultural and rural needs:

### A. **Exemptions from Prohibitions**
The prohibitions **do not apply** within:
- **100 meters** of:
  - A **residential building** that existed on the date the order came into force.
  - A **building used for agricultural operations** that existed on the date of coming into force.
  - A **shelter** used for agriculture that remains at the same location.
  - A **structure or machine** used to feed, handle, treat, or provide water to grazing animals, **if used at the same location**.

> This ensures that essential agricultural infrastructure is not disrupted.

### B. **Reconstruction and Repair**
- **Reconstruction or repair** of existing structures (fences, machines) is allowed **if**:
  - The new structure does **not exceed** the dimensions or noise levels of the original.
  - The replacement or repair does **not increase** environmental impact.

> This prevents unnecessary disruption while allowing maintenance.

### C. **Watering Systems**
- Watering systems are allowed **only if**:
  - They do **not occupy more than 30 m²** of native vegetation.
  - They **do not include dams**.
  - They **do not have pipes ≥11 cm in diameter**.

---

## **7. Application of Prohibitions**

The prohibitions apply only to:
- LSDs listed in **Part 1 (Alberta)** or **Part 2 (Saskatchewan)** of Schedule 1 where:
  - The provision includes **"3(1)(a) to (f)"**, **"3(1)(a) to (f) and 4"**, or **"3(1)(c) to (f) and 4"**.
- Road allowances **between** or **intersecting** such LSDs.

> This ensures that only the most critical habitat areas are protected.

---

## **8. Offences and Enforcement**

- Violations of the prohibitions under **paragraphs 3(1)(a) to (f)** or **subsection 4(1)** constitute **offences under Section 97 of the Species at Risk Act**.
- Enforcement is the responsibility of provincial authorities, with potential penalties for non-compliance.

---

## **9. Exemptions for Public Safety and Health**

- The prohibitions **do not apply** to activities related to:
  - Public safety.
  - Animal or plant health.
  - Activities authorized under **provincial law** (e.g., emergency response, pest control).

> This allows necessary interventions without compromising conservation goals.

---

## **10. Effective Date and Duration**

- The order **comes into force 90 days after registration**.
- **First enforcement date**: **February 18, 2014** (as noted in the note).

> The order is **not renewable or time-limited**—it remains in force until rescinded or replaced by a new regulatory framework.

## **Key Conservation Principles Underlying the Order**

1. **Habitat Protection**: Focuses on preserving native vegetation (sagebrush, grasses) critical for food, shelter, and breeding.
2. **Ecosystem Connectivity**: Protects road allowances and intersections to maintain movement corridors.
3. **Temporal Sensitivity**: Restricts noise during breeding season (April–May), aligning with reproductive biology.
4. **Balanced Rural Livelihoods
