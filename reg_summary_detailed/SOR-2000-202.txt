**Detailed Summary of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 9)**

---

### **Overview**

The *General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations*, approved by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources under **section 44 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**, provide a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the licensing, operation, safety, security, and compliance of nuclear-related activities in Canada. These regulations were originally enacted in 2000 and remain in force, with certain provisions updated or repealed over time (e.g., the removal of outdated definitions or exemptions).

These regulations apply broadly to all licensed nuclear activities, including those involving radioactive materials, nuclear facilities, radiation devices, and nuclear substances, and are designed to ensure public health, environmental protection, national security, and compliance with international obligations — particularly those related to nuclear non-proliferation.
