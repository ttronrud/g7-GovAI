### **Detailed Summary of the Abbotsford Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 74)**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**
The **Abbotsford Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This action formally:
- **Revokes** the previous Abbotsford Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 74),
- **Approves** a new set of zoning regulations for Abbotsford Airport, which are now effective and legally binding.

These regulations establish strict spatial and elevation controls to ensure **flight safety**, particularly by minimizing **obstructions** that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Abbotsford Airport**, located in the **District of Matsqui, British Columbia**. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a reference for elevation measurements. Its assigned elevation is **50.6 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip. Designed to ensure aircraft can approach safely without encountering obstacles. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located above and around the airport, set at **45 meters above the ARP**, except where terrain is too low (below 9 meters above ground), in which case it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport (including runways) designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Described in detail in Part V of the schedule. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. Prevents obstructions near the sides of runways. |

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all lands** adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, including public road allowances, that fall within:
- The **area bounded by the outer limits** described in **Part II of the schedule**, and  
- The **area directly beneath** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond those outer limits.

This ensures that even lands not directly adjacent to runways are protected if they lie under the approach surfaces.

---

#### **4. Prohibited Construction and Elevation Restrictions**
No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (or add to existing ones) on land subject to these regulations,
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

This means that even small structures, towers, or trees must not rise above these defined imaginary planes.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) that exceeds these elevation limits may be removed by the **Minister of Transport** if it poses a hazard to aviation safety.

---

#### **5. Waste Disposal Prohibition**
No owner or occupier of land subject to these regulations may:
- Permit the land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This is a critical measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major risk to aircraft safety.

---

#### **6. Airport Reference Point and Elevation Basis**
- The **airport reference point (ARP)** is located at a precise ground-level coordinate:
  - 448.621 meters **northerly at right angles** from a point on runway 06,
  - That point is 951.465 meters **easterly along the centerline** from the end of the strip associated with runway approach 06.
- This point is used as the **datum** for all elevation calculations in the regulations.

---

#### **7. Outer Limits of Land (Boundary Description)**
The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed **legal boundary description**, consisting of a sequence of bearings and distances. Key features include:
- Starting at the **intersection of the southerly production of the west boundary of Lot 1, Plan 22917** with the **International Boundary**.
- Proceeding through multiple lots, roads, and key features such as:
  - Aberdeen Road
  - King Road
  - Ross Road
  - Simpson Road
  - Old Yale Road
  - TransCanada Highway
  - Peardonville Road
  - Marshall Road
  - Gladwin Road
  - Parkview Street
  - Huntingdon Road
- Ending at the **International Boundary** after a full loop.

> These boundaries are **shown in yellow** on **Department of Transport Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1414**, dated **November 7, 1980**.

---

#### **8. Approach Surfaces (Detailed Descriptions by Runway)**
Each approach surface is defined by its slope, extent, and elevation. The surfaces are designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches, with different slopes depending on the runway.

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **06** | Inclined at **1:50** (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal) to meet outer surface. Horizontal section extends to 15,000 meters from end of strip, with a final elevation of **277.3 meters above the end of the strip**. |
| **24** | Inclined at **1:50** to outer surface. Horizontal section extends 15,000 meters, final elevation **262.38 meters above end of strip**. |
| **12** | Inclined at **1:20** (steeper than others), rising to outer surface. Horizontal section extends 3,000 meters, final elevation **41 meters above end of strip**. |
| **30** | Inclined at **1:20**, extends to imaginary horizontal line contiguous to **International Border**, final elevation **41 meters above end of strip**. |
| **18** | Inclined at **1:40**, extends 3,000 meters, final elevation **41 meters above end of strip**. |
| **36** | Inclined at **1:40**, extends to imaginary horizontal line at **International Border**, final elevation **41 meters above end of strip**. |

> The **approach surfaces** are illustrated on the same **Department of Transport Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1414**.

---

#### **9. Outer Surface Elevation**
- The outer surface is generally a **horizontal plane at 45 meters above the ARP (50.6 m above sea level)** → **95.6 meters above sea level**.
- However, **where the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground** to avoid creating false elevation thresholds.
- This ensures that even in low-lying areas, aircraft have a safe buffer zone.

---

#### **10. Regulatory Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue **directions** requiring removal of natural growth exceeding the elevation limits.
  - Enforce compliance with the rules through administrative action.
- Violations may result in penalties or enforcement actions, though specific penalties are not detailed in this regulation.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**
This regulation establishes a **safety zone** around Abbotsford Airport to protect aircraft during takeoff and landing. It:
- Defines precise **boundaries** of protected land,
- Sets **maximum allowable heights** for all structures and natural features,
- Prohibits **bird-attractive waste disposal** to reduce aviation risks,
- Uses **scientifically designed approach and outer surfaces** to ensure aircraft can safely approach the runway without hitting obstacles.

These rules are based on **aviation safety standards**, with detailed geometric definitions that ensure consistency and enforceability. The regulations are tied to a **specific 1980 land survey plan**, and all measurements are referenced to a precise point on the airport.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ The regulations protect aviation safety through **elevation controls**.  
✅ They apply to **all land adjacent to or under approach surfaces**.  
✅ **No structures** may exceed the defined **approach, outer, or transitional surfaces**.  
✅ **Natural growth** exceeding limits can be removed by the Minister.  
✅ **Bird-related waste** is strictly prohibited.  
✅ The rules are **geographically precise**, using coordinates, bearings, and distances.  
✅ The regulation is **legally binding**, effective from the date of approval.

### **Relevance and Importance**
These regulations are essential for:
- Preventing **aircraft collisions** with terrain or structures,
- Ensuring **safe operations** at a major regional airport,
- Maintaining **compliance with national aviation safety standards**,
- Providing a **clear, enforceable framework** for land use near airports.

They represent a balance between **public land use** and **aviation safety**, ensuring that development near Abbotsford Airport does not compromise flight operations.
