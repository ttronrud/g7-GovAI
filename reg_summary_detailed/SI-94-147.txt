**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization for the Minister of Agriculture to Prescribe Fees for Scientific or Technical Assistance

**Authority and Legal Basis:**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Treasury Board**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act** (FAA), which grants the government the power to authorize the setting of fees for services provided by federal departments and agencies, particularly when such services involve the provision of scientific or technical assistance.

**Purpose:**
- The regulation empowers the **Minister of Agriculture** to **prescribe fees** that users must pay when they receive scientific or technical assistance from the **Research Branch of the Department of Agriculture**.

**Scope of Application:**
- The fees apply to **any individual or entity (user)** that receives assistance from the Research Branch.
- The assistance must be in the form of **scientific or technical support**, which may include, but is not limited to:
  - Research findings and data
  - Technical advice or consultations
  - Agricultural innovation support
  - Field or laboratory services
  - Expert analysis or evaluation

**Key Provisions:**
1. **Prescriptive Authority:** The Minister of Agriculture is authorized to issue **a regulatory order** (formal directive) that specifies:
   - The exact amount or structure of the fees.
   - The conditions under which fees are applicable.
   - The types of services or assistance that are subject to fees.
   - Who qualifies as a "user" (e.g., farmers, researchers, private businesses, government bodies).
2. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The Minister may adjust fees periodically to reflect changes in costs, demand, or policy objectives, as long as the process remains transparent and consistent with public accountability standards.
3. **Compliance and Enforcement:** Users are legally required to pay the prescribed fees. Failure to do so may result in administrative penalties or restrictions on access to future services.

**Administrative Context:**
- The decision to impose fees is made through a **collaborative process** involving the Treasury Board, which ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with broader government financial policies.
- The Governor General in Council's approval ensures that the fee-setting authority is exercised within the constitutional and legislative framework of the Canadian government.

**Rationale for the Regulation:**
- To ensure the **sustainability and funding** of the Research Branch’s operations.
- To provide a **clear, predictable, and fair cost structure** for users of agricultural research services.
- To promote **accountability and transparency** in the use of public resources.
- To support the **long-term development of Canada’s agricultural sector** through reliable, accessible, and well-funded scientific support.

**Implications:**
- This regulation enables the Department of Agriculture to maintain high-quality research and technical services without relying solely on general government funding.
- It may influence how stakeholders (e.g., farmers, agribusinesses, universities) access and utilize research resources.
- It may also prompt discussions around equity, access, and affordability—especially for small-scale or low-income users.

**Conclusion:**
This regulation establishes a formal, legally grounded mechanism for the Minister of Agriculture to set and manage fees for scientific and technical services provided by the Research Branch. It reflects a balance between ensuring financial sustainability for public research and maintaining access to essential agricultural knowledge and support for users across Canada.
