### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers and Functions under the Canadian Tourism Commission Act**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "Public Service Rearrangement Act"). This provision enables the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer powers, duties, and functions between federal ministers within the Public Service.

The specific legal basis for this transfer is:
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** – Section 207 of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, Chapter 22* (the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)
- **R.S., c. P-34** – The *Regulations of the Public Service* (specifically, the administrative framework governing ministerial responsibilities)
- **S.C. 2000, c. 28** – The *Public Service Act*, which provides foundational authority for ministerial transfers
- **SI/2023-40** – The *Statutory Instrument 2023-40*, which formalizes the specific transfer in this instance

#### **2. Nature of the Transfer**
On **July 26, 2023**, by **Order in Council P.C. 2023-769**, the powers, duties, and functions under the **Canadian Tourism Commission Act** were transferred from the **Minister of State (Tourism)** to the **Minister of Industry**.

This transfer is now being **finalized and confirmed** by a subsequent regulatory instrument issued by the Governor General in Council, based on the Prime Minister’s recommendation.

#### **3. Scope of the Transfer**
The transfer includes:
- All **powers** granted to the Minister of State (Tourism) under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*
- All **duties and responsibilities** assigned to that minister under the Act

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Oversight of tourism policy development
- Promotion of Canada as a destination for international visitors
- Coordination of tourism-related initiatives across federal departments
- Management of the CTC’s budget and program delivery
- Strategic planning and reporting on tourism performance

#### **4. Rationale and Context**
This transfer reflects a broader **restructuring of federal government responsibilities** to align with current policy priorities. The move from the Minister of State (Tourism) to the **Minister of Industry** signals that tourism policy is now being integrated into the broader industrial and economic development framework.

Key reasons for the shift may include:
- Strengthening the link between tourism and economic growth (e.g., job creation, regional development, export potential)
- Enhancing coordination between tourism, trade, and innovation
- Leveraging the Minister of Industry’s existing authority over economic development, trade, and small business support
- Streamlining decision-making and reducing bureaucratic overlap

#### **5. Impact on the Canadian Tourism Commission**
- The **Canadian Tourism Commission** will continue to operate under the same legal framework and mandate.
- However, its **ministerial oversight** and strategic direction will now be under the **Minister of Industry**, rather than the former Minister of State (Tourism).
- The Commission will likely see increased alignment with broader national economic and industry strategies, including digital transformation, sustainable tourism, and international market access.

#### **6. Legal and Procedural Significance**
- The transfer is **not a change in the Act itself**, but a **reassignment of ministerial responsibility**.
- It is a **formal and legally binding** action under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act.
- The Order in Council (P.C. 2023-769) initiated the process; this current regulation finalizes and confirms the transfer.
- The process respects the principle of **ministerial accountability**, ensuring that all responsibilities are clearly assigned and that there is a clear chain of command.

#### **7. Key Dates**
- **July 26, 2023**: Order in Council P.C. 2023-769 transfers powers from Minister of State (Tourism) to Minister of Industry (provisional).
- **[Date of this regulation]**: Final confirmation of the transfer via Statutory Instrument SI/2023-40.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation constitutes a **formal and legally valid transfer of ministerial responsibilities** under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*. By placing oversight of the Canadian Tourism Commission under the **Minister of Industry**, the federal government is reinforcing the integration of tourism as a key component of national economic development.
