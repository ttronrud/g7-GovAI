### **4. Required Supporting Documents**

The application must be accompanied by:
1. **Marriage Certificate** (if the parties were married):  
   - Original or certified true copy.

2. **Court Order or Agreement**:  
   - Original or certified true copy that provides for the division of annuity benefits.

3. **Statutory Declaration** (if the court order/agreement does not specify the cohabitation period):  
   - Must state:
     - The date the parties began cohabiting  
     - The date they ceased cohabiting  
     - If still cohabiting, a statement of intent to cease cohabitation.

> **Note**: If no cohabitation period is specified in the agreement or order, the period is **determined based on the statutory declaration**.

---

### **5. Determination of Cohabitation Period**

- Unless otherwise specified in a court order or agreement, the **period of cohabitation** is determined by the statutory declaration.
- If the parties are still cohabiting when the application is made, the period ends on the **last day of the month before the month in which the request is made**.
- The period is **not interrupted** by:
  - One party becoming incapacitated from forming or maintaining a conjugal intention.
  - Resuming cohabitation for **90 days or less** with reconciliation as the primary purpose.

> **Exception**: If one party dies during the year after the parties began living separate and apart, the year is deemed to have elapsed at the date of death — meaning they are deemed to have lived separate and apart throughout that year.

---

### **6. When the Annuity Administrator Cannot Act**

If the **court order or agreement**:
- Does not permit the annuity administrator to determine the **amount or percentage** of the annuity to be paid to the spouse or partner,  
→ The administrator **must not act** on the application and must **request that the order or agreement be amended** to allow for a determination.

---

### **7. Grounds for Deeming Separate and Apart (for Legal Effect)**

Under paragraph **52.11(2)(b)** of the *Judges Act*, the parties are **deemed to have lived separate and apart** if:
- They lived separate and apart and one party manifested an intention not to continue the conjugal relationship.

This status is **not interrupted** by:
- A party becoming incapacitated (inability to form or maintain intentions).
- Resuming cohabitation for **90 days or less** with reconciliation as the primary purpose.

> **Key Point**: This presumption is critical for determining the period of cohabitation and eligibility for annuity division.

### **8. Representation and Authorization**
