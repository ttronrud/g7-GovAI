**Detailed Summary of the Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Purpose**  
The *Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under **paragraph 531(h) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act** (*Act*). These regulations came into force on **June 1, 1992**, and are designed to allow certain subsidiaries of trust and loan companies to hold shares in their parent company under specific conditions.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **facilitate internal corporate governance and operational flexibility** by permitting subsidiaries—particularly those engaged in regulated securities activities—to hold shares in the parent company, while ensuring that such arrangements do not compromise financial stability or regulatory oversight.

**Key Definitions**  
The regulations establish the following key definitions:

1. **"Act"** – Refers to the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*, which provides the legal framework governing trust and loan companies in Canada.

2. **"Distribution"** – Defined as a distribution as outlined in **subsection 278(3) of the Act**. This includes any issuance or sale of shares or other securities by a company to the public or to specific parties, such as shareholders or institutional investors.

3. **"Regulated Securities Entity"** – A financial institution whose **primary business is dealing in securities** and which is subject to regulation in its securities activities through:
   - An Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature, or  
   - The laws of a foreign country.

This definition is critical because it identifies which subsidiaries are eligible to hold shares in the parent company.

**Main Provision: Permitted Shareholding Limit**  
Under **paragraph 73(c) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act**, a company may permit a subsidiary that is a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares in the company **only if**:

- The **aggregate value** of all such shares held by the subsidiary (or subsidiaries) does **not exceed 1% of the company’s regulatory capital**.
- This limit applies **except** for shares referred to in **section 75 of the Act**, which may be excluded from the calculation.

> **Example**: If a trust or loan company has a regulatory capital of $100 million, then the total value of shares that can be held by its subsidiaries (that are regulated securities entities) may not exceed $1 million.

This provision ensures that the parent company maintains a level of financial independence and prevents excessive concentration of ownership in affiliated entities.

**Exception for Securities Underwriting Activities**  
A significant exception is provided for subsidiaries acting as **securities underwriters** in connection with a **distribution of shares** of the parent company.

- If a subsidiary is a regulated securities entity and is acting as an underwriter in a share distribution (e.g., an initial public offering or a private placement), the parent company may **permit the subsidiary to hold shares in excess of the 1% limit**.
- This exemption applies **only until the distribution is completed and ended**.

> **Purpose of Exception**: This provision recognizes that underwriters often need to have a financial stake in the securities they are promoting to support the transaction. It allows for temporary flexibility during the underwriting phase without violating the general 1% shareholding cap.

> **Important Note**: The exemption is **time-bound** and ends once the distribution is finalized. After that, the subsidiary must comply with the standard 1% limit.

**Regulatory Oversight and Compliance**  
- The rules are designed to maintain **financial prudence and transparency** in trust and loan companies.
- The 1% cap helps prevent conflicts of interest, insider control, and potential misuse of corporate structures.
- The requirement that subsidiaries be *regulated securities entities* ensures that only entities under formal regulatory scrutiny are allowed to hold shares, thereby protecting investors and maintaining market integrity.

---

**Significance and Implications**  
These regulations:
- Provide **operational flexibility** to trust and loan companies by allowing subsidiaries involved in securities markets to invest in their parent companies.
- Balance **market participation** (through underwriting) with **regulatory safeguards** (via the 1% cap).
- Reflect a recognition that certain financial intermediaries need access to parent company equity for strategic or transactional purposes.
- Reinforce the principle that **regulatory capital** remains the benchmark for determining permissible shareholdings.

**Conclusion**  
The *Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations* establish a **structured and conditional framework** allowing regulated securities subsidiaries of trust and loan companies to hold shares in their parent company. The key elements are:

1. A **1% cap** on total shareholdings by such subsidiaries (excluding shares under section 75).
2. A **temporary exemption** during share distributions when the subsidiary acts as a securities underwriter.
3. A requirement that only **regulated securities entities** qualify for the allowance.

These provisions ensure that while companies can leverage their subsidiaries in securities markets, they remain within a safe, transparent, and financially sound regulatory boundary.
