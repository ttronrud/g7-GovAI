The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2014-41"** — indicates that the specific regulatory instrument was officially repealed (cancelled or replaced) by a statutory instrument (SI) published in 2014, number 41.

However, **no detailed content or text of the regulation itself is provided** in your query. As such, a detailed summary cannot be generated without knowing the original subject, scope, or provisions of the regulation that was repealed by SI/2014-41.

### General Interpretation:
- **"SI/2014-41"** refers to a Statutory Instrument from the United Kingdom (or a jurisdiction that uses SI numbering) issued in 2014, number 41.
- The phrase **"Repealed"** means that the regulation was formally removed from legal effect, typically because it was:
  - Outdated,
  - Superseded by a newer law or regulation,
  - Found to be inconsistent with current legislation,
  - Or replaced by a more comprehensive or modern version.
- The repeal is usually made by another Statutory Instrument, which explicitly states the regulation is no longer in force.

### To Provide a Detailed Summary:
We would need the **original title and content** of the regulation being repealed — for example:
- What area of law did it govern? (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, tax, licensing)
- What were its key provisions?
- What was its purpose or intended effect?
- What was the reason for its repeal?

Without this information, any summary would be speculative or generic.
