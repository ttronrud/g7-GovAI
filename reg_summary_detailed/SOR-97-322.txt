**Detailed Summary of the CCFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **CCFTA Tariff Preference Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 13(2)(b)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants authority to establish specific tariff preference rules under the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA).

The regulation is codified in:
- **S.C. 1993, c. 44, s. 113(2)** (Statutory Instrument of 1993)
- **R.S., c. 41 (3rd Supp.)** (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter 41, Third Supplementary)

These regulations implement and clarify the **tariff preference provisions** under **paragraph 25.7(b) of the Customs Tariff**, which allows certain goods originating in Chile to be subject to preferential tariff treatment when imported into Canada.

---

### **Core Objective**

To ensure that goods imported into Canada from Chile—particularly those that are shipped directly or via a third country—benefit from **preferential tariff treatment** under the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA), provided specific conditions are met.

This preferential treatment typically means **tariff elimination or reduction**, allowing Chilean goods to enter Canada at a lower or zero tariff rate compared to standard customs duties.

### **Eligibility Criteria for Tariff Preference (Paragraph 25.7(b))**

Goods are entitled to the benefit of the **Chile Tariff Preference** if **one of the following conditions is satisfied**:

#### **1. Direct Shipment from Chile to Canada (No Third Country Involvement)**

- The goods must be **shipped directly from Chile to Canada**.
- The shipment must be carried out on a **through bill of lading** (a single document covering the entire journey from origin to destination, without intermediate transfers or changes of carrier).

> This ensures a direct and traceable supply chain, minimizing opportunities for diversion or re-export.

#### **2. Shipment Without a Through Bill of Lading**

If a **through bill of lading is not used**, the importer must provide, **upon request by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
- Clearly indicates the **shipping route**;
- Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to the final importation into Canada.

> This requirement ensures transparency and traceability of the goods' movement, confirming that the goods originated in Chile and were not diverted through other countries for non-CCFTA purposes.

#### **3. Shipment from Chile to Canada via a Third Country**

In cases where goods are shipped **from Chile to Canada through another country**, the importer must provide:
- **Documentary evidence** indicating the **shipping route** and **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to importation into Canada; **AND**
- A **copy of the customs control documents** that demonstrate the goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the third country.

> This dual requirement ensures:
> - The goods did not undergo unauthorized release or diversion;
> - The third country applied customs controls, maintaining the integrity of the origin and trade flow under the CCFTA.

> The "customs control" requirement is critical—it confirms that the goods were not allowed to enter free circulation in the third country, which would disqualify them from preferential treatment.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 51 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 14 of the Statutes of Canada, 1997) comes into effect.

> **Note**: These regulations were originally published in **July 5, 1997**, as part of **Statutory Instrument SI/97-86**.

This timing aligns with the broader implementation of the CCFTA, which officially entered into force in 1997, enabling the application of tariff preferences for eligible goods.

---

### **Key Implications and Purpose**

- **Promotes Trade**: Encourages increased trade between Canada and Chile by reducing or eliminating tariffs on eligible goods.
- **Ensures Compliance**: Requires detailed documentation to prevent fraud, misrepresentation, or diversion of goods to avoid preferential treatment.
- **Maintains Trade Integrity**: The requirement for customs control documentation in third countries helps verify that goods remain under proper oversight, preserving the integrity of the free trade agreement.
- **Simplifies Import Process for Direct Shipments**: The through bill of lading provision streamlines compliance for direct shipments.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

Under these regulations, **Chilean goods** imported into Canada can enjoy **preferential tariff treatment** if:
- They are shipped **directly from Chile to Canada** on a **through bill of lading**, or
- They are shipped **without a through bill of lading**, but the importer can provide **clear documentation** showing the route and all stops, or
- They go through a **third country**, in which case the importer must provide:
  - A full shipping route and transshipment details; **and**
  - Proof that the goods were **under customs control** in that third country.

These rules ensure that only **genuine, origin-verified goods** from Chile benefit from tariff reductions, protecting the fairness and effectiveness of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement.

---

### **Conclusion**

The CCFTA Tariff Preference Regulations provide a clear, enforceable framework for qualifying Chilean goods to benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement. By requiring verifiable documentation and ensuring compliance with origin and movement rules, the regulations balance trade facilitation with the need to maintain the integrity of the free trade agreement. These rules were formally implemented on **July 5, 1997**, and remain a cornerstone of Canada’s trade policy with Chile.
