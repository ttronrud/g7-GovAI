**Detailed Summary of the *Transportation of Dangerous Goods by Rail Security Regulations* (S.C. 2009, c. 9, s. 25–26)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Transportation of Dangerous Goods by Rail Security Regulations*, made under **section 27a and 27.1b of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992 (the "Act")**, establish comprehensive security requirements for the transportation of **dangerous goods by rail in Canada**. These regulations are designed to protect people, property, and critical infrastructure from threats related to the transport of hazardous materials via rail.

The regulations apply specifically to **railway carriers** and **railway loaders** involved in the handling or transport of certain "security-sensitive" dangerous goods listed in **Schedule 1**. They introduce a robust framework of **security planning, personnel accountability, reporting obligations, inspections, training, and incident response**.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992* |
| **Handling Site** | A facility connected to a railway line where a rail vehicle is placed for loading or unloading of dangerous goods |
| **Railway Carrier** | A person who has possession of dangerous goods for transport by rail on a main line or for storage during transport |
| **Railway Loader** | Any person operating a handling site, or a manufacturer/producer who possesses dangerous goods at a handling site for loading or unloading purposes prior to or after rail transport |

> All other terms have the same meaning as defined in **section 1.4 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations**.

---

## **Applicability and Scope**

### **Who Is Covered?**
- Applies only to:
  - **Railway carriers** transporting security-sensitive dangerous goods (as defined in Schedule 1)
  - **Railway loaders** offering for transport or handling such goods

> **Important Exclusion**:  
> Paragraph **10(1)(g)** does **not apply** to railway loaders — meaning they are not required to develop a security plan under section 10 unless they are directly involved in transporting or handling security-sensitive goods.

### **Exemptions (When Regulations Do Not Apply)**

The security requirements (Parts 1–3) **do not apply** to dangerous goods if:

1. **Exempted under specific provisions** in the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations (e.g., special provisions 154, 167, 145, 32, 34, etc.)
2. **In limited quantities** (per subsection 1.17(1))
3. **In excepted quantities** (per subsections 1.17.1(1), (2), and (8))
4. **Medical or clinical waste** (if conditions in 1.42.3(a) and (b) are met)
5. **Radioactive materials (Class 7)** (if conditions in 1.43(a) and (b) are met)
6. **Residues in drums** (if conditions in 1.44(a) and (b) are met)
7. **Marine pollutants** (classified under 2.43(b)(ii))
8. **Specific UN numbers**:
   - UN2990, UN3072 (life-saving appliances)
   - UN2448 (melted sulfur) – only if transported in large containment and conditions met
   - UN3090, UN3091, UN3480, UN3481 (lithium batteries) – only if conditions in special provision 34 are met
9. **Neutron radiation detectors** (with ≤1g boron trifluoride gas) – only if packed per special provision 145

> These exemptions ensure that low-risk or non-hazardous materials are not subject to full security burdens.

## **Core Security Requirements (Under Section 5 of the Act)**

### **1. Reporting of Security Concerns**
Railway carriers must **immediately report by telephone** to the **Transport Canada Situation Centre** any of the following:

#### **Covered Threats & Concerns Include**:
- Interference with train crew
- Bomb threats (specific or non-specific)
- Discovery of suspicious items causing operational disruption
- Suspicious activities observed on or near:
  - Railway vehicles
  - Infrastructure (tracks, signals, stations)
  - Facilities used in rail operations
- Discovery or seizure of firearms or weapons
- Signs of tampering with a vehicle (if security is compromised)
- Possible surveillance of vehicles, infrastructure, or facilities

#### **Required Information in Report**:
- Name and contact info (phone/email) of the railway carrier
- Name, title, and contact info of the reporting individual
- Train details (itinerary, route position)
- Vehicle, infrastructure, or facility affected
- Classification and quantity of dangerous goods involved
- Description of threat, including **date/time of awareness** and **incident date/time**

> Reports must be made **without delay** and must include all known facts.

---

### **2. Designation of a Rail Security Coordinator**

Every railway carrier must:
- Appoint **one employee** as a **Rail Security Coordinator** (or acting coordinator)
- Provide the **Minister of Transport** with:
  - Name and job title of the coordinator
  - 24-hour contact information

#### Responsibilities of the Coordinator:
- Coordinate internal security matters within the organization
- Serve as the **primary point of contact** between:
  - The carrier
  - Law enforcement
  - Emergency response agencies
  - Transport Canada (Minister)

> Ensures centralized, accountable oversight of security.

---

### **3. Visual Security Inspections**

When a railway carrier:
- Accepts a railway vehicle containing dangerous goods for transport (with placard required under Part 4 of the Regulations)
- Places it into a train

→ Must conduct a **visual security inspection** at **two key times**:
1. When the vehicle is accepted for transport
2. When it is placed into the train

#### If Tampering or Suspicious Items Are Found:
- The carrier must **investigate** whether security has been compromised
- If compromised, **no transport may occur** until the situation is resolved

> This step is critical for detecting unauthorized access, tampering, or concealment.

---

### **4. Security Plan Requirements**

Railway carriers and railway loaders must develop and maintain a **written security plan** that meets strict criteria.

#### Mandatory Components of the Security Plan:

| Component | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Leadership & Structure** | Identify a senior manager responsible for overall development and implementation. Describe organizational structure, departments, and roles responsible for security duties. |
| **Security Duties** | Clearly define the security responsibilities of each department and position. |
| **Notification Process** | Outline how each responsible individual is notified when the plan must be implemented. |
| **Risk Assessment** | Conduct a formal assessment of security risks associated with handling or transporting the dangerous goods in Schedule 1. |
| **Security Inspection Process** | Include procedures for: <br> • Conducting inspections <br> • Determining if security has been compromised <br> • Determining when additional inspections are needed <br> • Responding to compromised situations |
| **Access Control** | Set measures to prevent unauthorized access to dangerous goods and rail vehicles. |
| **Candidate Screening** | Include procedures to verify information provided by individuals applying for positions involving access to security-sensitive materials. |
| **Information Management** | Establish a policy on: <br> • Limiting access to sensitive security information <br> • Sharing, storing, and destroying such information |
| **Other Risk Mitigation** | Address any other identified security risks. |
| **Training Program** | Describe a program for security awareness and plan-specific training. |
| **Incident Response** | Include procedures for responding to and reporting security incidents. |

#### Key Requirements:
- The plan must be **updated at least annually**

- Must be **notified promptly** to all responsible parties when significantly revised
- A **copy must be provided to Transport Canada upon request**

> The measures in the plan must be **proportional** to the level of security risk identified in the assessment.

> **Exception**: If a carrier already has a compliant security plan, no new one is required.
