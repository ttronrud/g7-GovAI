Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Portions of the Canada Revenue Agency Regulations**

#### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- It is enacted under **subsection 123(1) of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**.
- This provision allows the government to transfer certain portions of federal public administration to different units or departments, typically to improve efficiency, service delivery, or organizational structure.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- The regulation formally **transfers specific portions of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)** from one administrative structure to another.
- Specifically, it transfers certain functions and responsibilities related to **email, data centre, and network services**.
- The transfer is not a reorganization of the CRA as a whole, but rather a reallocation of specific technical and operational services within the agency.

#### **3. Affected Units**
The following two units within the Canada Revenue Agency are designated as the recipients of the transferred portions:
- **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Unit**
- **Email, Data Centre and Network Services Support Unit**

These units are responsible for managing and maintaining the CRA’s critical information technology infrastructure, including:
- Email systems
- Data centre operations (physical and virtual hosting of data)
- Network services (internal and external connectivity)
- Technical support and maintenance of IT systems

#### **4. Application of Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**
- **Subsection 132(1) of the Public Service Employment Act** applies to all individuals employed or engaged in the transferred units.
- This means that:
  - Employment terms, conditions, rights, and responsibilities for staff in these units are governed by the PSEA.
  - The transfer does not alter the employment status or contractual obligations of personnel, but it may affect their reporting lines, job duties, or unit-specific policies.
  - The Act ensures that public service employees are protected under federal employment standards, including fair treatment, job security, and grievance procedures.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulations come into force on **November 15, 2011**.
- This date marks the official start of the transfer of responsibilities and the application of the new structure within the CRA.

#### **6. Context and Implications**
- This transfer likely reflects a broader government initiative to:
  - Improve IT service delivery and operational efficiency.
  - Centralize or streamline technical operations to reduce redundancy and enhance cybersecurity.
  - Align CRA’s IT functions with modern digital service delivery standards.
- By consolidating email, data centre, and network services into dedicated units, the CRA may improve responsiveness, reduce costs, and strengthen data security and system reliability.

#### **7. Regulatory Citation**
- The regulation is cited as:  
  **S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12 and 13**  
  (This refers to the *Public Service Employment Act*, specifically sections 12 and 13, which relate to the transfer and application of employment provisions.)

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a formal transfer of IT service responsibilities—specifically email, data centre, and network operations—within the Canada Revenue Agency to dedicated units. It ensures that all employees in these units are covered under the Public Service Employment Act, preserving their employment rights and obligations. The transfer, effective November 15, 2011, is a strategic move to modernize and strengthen CRA’s technological infrastructure while maintaining compliance with federal public service employment standards.

*Note: While the regulation is referenced under S.C. 2003, c. 22, it appears that the actual transfer provisions (sections 12 and 13) were amended or implemented in 2011, consistent with the effective date. The original enactment year (2003) may refer to the foundational Act, not the specific transfer regulation.*
