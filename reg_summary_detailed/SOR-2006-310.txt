**Detailed Summary of the "Insider Reports (Banks and Bank Holding Companies) Regulations"**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

- **Enactment Authority**:  
  These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.  
  This reflects the delegation of regulatory power under the **Bank Act** to ensure compliance with insider reporting requirements for banks and bank holding companies.

- **Legal Foundation**:  
  The regulations are made under **section 268a of the Bank Act** (S.C. 2005, c. 54, s. 56; S.C. 1991, c. 46).  
  Section 268a empowers the federal government to establish rules governing the **submission of insider reports** by individuals and entities connected to financial institutions, particularly banks and bank holding companies.

### **2. Key Definitions and Interpretation**

#### **Definition of "Insider"**
- For the purposes of **paragraph 268(a)** of the Bank Act, the term *insider* is defined as it is defined under **any applicable legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule** to these regulations.
- This means that the definition of "insider" is **not independently defined in these regulations**, but instead **inherits the definition** from other federal or provincial financial legislation (e.g., the Securities Act, the Banking Act, or provincial securities laws).

> *Example*: If the Securities Act defines an "insider" as someone with access to material non-public information or who holds a certain percentage of shares, that definition applies here.

### **3. Requirements for Insider Reports**

#### **Form and Content (Paragraph 268(b))**
- The **form and content** of an insider report required under these regulations must align with the form and content required under any legislation listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- This ensures **consistency and comparability** across different financial reporting regimes (e.g., federal securities reporting and provincial securities laws).
- The reports must include specific elements such as:
  - Identity of the insider
  - Nature and value of transactions
  - Disclosure of beneficial ownership
  - Timeliness and accuracy of information

> *Purpose*: To ensure transparency and prevent insider trading or misuse of confidential information.

---

#### **Submission and Publication Procedure (Paragraph 268(c))**
- The **procedure** for submitting and publishing insider reports under these regulations must follow the procedures required under any legislation in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
- This includes:
  - Deadlines for submission
  - Methods of submission (e.g., electronic filing)
  - Who is responsible for publication (e.g., the bank’s compliance officer or a designated regulator)
  - Timeframes for public disclosure (e.g., within 24 hours of a transaction)

> *Purpose*: To maintain accountability, ensure timely reporting, and allow regulators and the public to monitor potential conflicts of interest.

---

### **4. Compliance Obligations**

- Any individual or entity **required to submit an insider report** under a legislation listed in Column 2 of the Schedule must comply with the **specific requirements** of that legislation.
- This includes:
  - Filing reports when material transactions occur
  - Disclosing changes in beneficial ownership
  - Avoiding unauthorized use of non-public information

### **5. Exemptions**

#### **Exemption from Insider Status**
- A person who is **exempt from being considered an insider** under any legislation in Column 2 of the Schedule—either by statute or by an **order from a provincial securities regulator**—is **not considered an insider** for the purposes of **subsection 2(1)** of the Bank Act.
- This means such individuals are **not required to file insider reports** under these regulations.

> *Example*: A non-controlling shareholder who is explicitly exempted by regulation may not be deemed an insider, even if they hold a small stake.

#### **Exemption from Reporting Requirements**
- A person who is **exempt from any or all insider reporting obligations** under any legislation in Column 2 of the Schedule—or under a provincial securities regulator’s order—is **also exempt from those same obligations under these Regulations**.
- This creates a **harmonized exemption framework**—if a person is exempted from reporting under one law, they are exempt under these regulations as well.

> *Purpose*: To avoid duplication of reporting burdens and to respect existing regulatory exemptions.
