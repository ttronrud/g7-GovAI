**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order Designating Species at Risk – Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Species at Risk Act (SARA), specifically subsection 23(1)  
**Date of Publication:**  
2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29)  
**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  

---

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Purpose of the Regulation:**  
   This order serves as an official acknowledgment by the federal government that it has received and recognized the scientific assessments conducted by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** regarding specific species listed in the **Annex** to the Order.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The regulation is grounded in **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, which mandates that the Minister of the Environment must, upon receiving a COSEWIC assessment, acknowledge receipt of that assessment and use it as a basis for determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under the Act.

3. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada. It evaluates species based on scientific evidence and provides a recommendation to the federal government on their risk of extinction.

4. **Content of the Annex:**  
   The "Annex" to this Order contains the list of species that have been assessed by COSEWIC and are included in this regulatory action. These species are formally recognized as being at risk of extinction and are subject to further federal protection and management under SARA.

5. **Government Action and Responsibility:**  
   By acknowledging receipt of these assessments, the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) confirms that the federal government is now legally committed to:
   - Using the COSEWIC assessments as the foundation for any future listing decisions.
   - Taking appropriate action under SARA, such as developing recovery strategies, implementing protection measures, or designating critical habitats.

6. **Significance:**  
   This step is a critical procedural milestone in the SARA process. It marks the transition from scientific assessment to formal government action. It ensures transparency, accountability, and adherence to scientific standards in species conservation policy.

---

**Implications:**

- The species listed in the Annex are now formally recognized as being at risk.
- The government is legally obligated to develop and implement recovery strategies and action plans for these species, as required under SARA.
- This acknowledgment strengthens the scientific basis of conservation policy and ensures that decisions are informed by expert, peer-reviewed assessments.

**Context and Background:**  
This regulation was issued in 2002 as part of the initial implementation phase of the Species at Risk Act, which was enacted in 2002 to strengthen the protection of Canada’s biodiversity. The Order reflects the government’s commitment to science-based conservation and the importance of protecting species at risk from extinction.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and legal affirmation that the federal government has received and accepted the scientific evaluations of species at risk by COSEWIC. It formally initiates the process of protecting these species under the Species at Risk Act, setting the stage for subsequent conservation actions, including recovery planning, habitat protection, and public awareness initiatives.

**Note:**  
The specific species listed in the Annex to this Order are not included in your query. To obtain the full list, one would need to refer to the original document (S.C. 2002, c. 29, Annex), which includes species such as the American Pika, the Blanding’s Turtle, the Eastern Box Turtle, and others at the time of listing.
