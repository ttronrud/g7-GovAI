**Detailed Summary of the Allocation Method Order – Softwood Lumber Products (S.C. 2006, c. 13, s. 111; Ottawa, July 12, 2007)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, issued by the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** under two key statutes — the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA) and the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* — establishes a **method for allocating monthly export quotas** for **current softwood lumber products** from four Canadian provinces — **Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan** — to the **United States** in **2007**.

The primary purpose of this Order is to ensure **fair and transparent allocation** of export quantities based on historical production and export data, while also providing flexibility for producers and remanufacturers to apply for allocations based on either their **export performance** or **production volume**.

The Order is effective as of **October 12, 2006**, and applies specifically to the **2007 export year**.

## **Core Allocation Principles**

### **1. Allocation Method by Province**

The Order establishes **distinct allocation methods** for each province, with different formulas and criteria depending on the type of applicant (primary producer or remanufacturer) and the province.

---

### **A. Ontario Quantity Allocation**

- **Applies to**: Primary producers and remanufacturers applying for an export allocation from Ontario to the U.S.
- **Calculation formula**:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Percentage share}}{100} \right) \times \text{Ontario quantity}
  $$
  - **Percentage share** = the **higher** of two values:
    1. **Best 12-month performance** (based on highest 12-month export volume during the reference period)
    2. **Reference period average** (based on total exports during the reference period)

> **Best 12-month period**:
> - For primary producers: The 12-month period with the highest export volume (as defined in PPBEV).
> - For remanufacturers: The 12-month period with the highest export volume (as defined in RBEV).

> **Exclusions**:
> - Any primary producer or remanufacturer that **writes to the Minister before December 14, 2006**, indicating they **relinquish** their allocation for 2007 is excluded from the total volume calculation.

> **Choice for Quebec exports**:
> - If a primary producer exported products from **Quebec** during the reference period, they **must choose** between:
>   - **Method 6**: Based on **historic export volume** (from Quebec).
>   - **Method 7(1)**: Based on **historic production volume** (from Quebec).
> - If **no Quebec exports**, but the producer **produced Quebec softwood lumber products** between Jan 1, 2003 – Dec 31, 2005, they **may only** apply under **Method 7(1)**.

> **Remanufacturers**:
> - If they exported from Quebec during the reference period, they **may only** receive allocation under **Method 9** (based on historic export volume).

### **B. Quebec Quantity Allocation**

Two distinct methods apply depending on whether the applicant is a primary producer or remanufacturer, and whether they are based on **export volume** or **production volume**.

#### **1. Primary Producers**

##### **Option A: Based on Historic Export Volume (Method 6)**
$$
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume exported from Quebec (reference period)}}{\text{Total former softwood exports from Quebec (reference period)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec quantity}
$$

##### **Option B: Based on Historic Production Volume (Method 7(1))**
$$
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of Quebec softwood products produced (2003–2005)}}{\text{Total volume of Quebec softwood products produced (2003–2005) by all qualifying producers}} \right) \times \text{Reserve pool}
$$

> **Reserve Pool** is calculated as:
> $$
> \text{Reserve Pool} = A + B + C
> $$
> Where:
> - **A**: Volume of former softwood products exported from Quebec under **Method 6** (export-based allocations).
> - **B**: Volume of former softwood products exported from Quebec under **Method 7(1)** (production-based allocations).
> - **C**: Volume of former softwood products exported from Quebec by applicants who **did not apply before December 14, 2006**.

> **Production data**:
> - Volume of Quebec softwood products produced by a primary producer is based on **official records provided by the Government of Quebec** with the **consent of the producer**.

---

#### **2. Remanufacturers**

##### **Based on Historic Export Volume (Method 9)**
$$
\text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of remanufacturer’s products exported from Quebec (reference period)}}{\text{Total former softwood exports from Quebec (reference period)}} \right) \times \text{Quebec quantity}
$$

> Remanufacturers who exported from Quebec **must** apply under this method.

---

### **C. Manitoba Quantity Allocation**

- **Applies to**: Primary producers and remanufacturers applying for export from Manitoba.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Allocation} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of applicant’s products exported from Manitoba (reference period)}}{\text{Total volume of all primary producers and remanufacturers’ products exported from Manitoba (reference period)}} \right) \times \text{Manitoba quantity}
  $$

> **Exclusion**: Any applicant who **relinquishes** their allocation in writing before **December 14, 2006** is excluded from the denominator.

---

### **D. Saskatchewan Quantity Allocation**

- **Applies to**: Primary producers and remanufacturers.
- **Method**: **First-come, first-served**.
- **Allocation rule**:
  - Applicants are allocated in **order of submission**.
  - Each applicant receives the amount **they requested**.
  - Allocation continues until the **Saskatchewan quantity** is fully distributed.

> This method is **simpler and less performance-based**, relying on administrative priority rather than historical data.

---

## **Key Dates and Deadlines**

- **Deadline to relinquish allocation**: **December 14, 2006**.
  - Any primary producer or remanufacturer who wishes to **give up** their export allocation must submit a **written notice** to the Minister by this date.
  - Excluded from calculations in both numerator and denominator.

---

## **Legal Basis**

- **Section 6.3(3)(a)(a)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* — authorizes the Minister to establish allocation methods for softwood lumber exports.
- **Section 108** of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006* — provides authority for setting export quotas and allocation rules.
