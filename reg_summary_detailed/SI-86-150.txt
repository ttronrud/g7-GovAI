**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**

This regulation establishes a **National Wildlife Area (NWA)** in the **Bracebridge-Goodsir Inlet region of Bathurst Island**, Nunavut (formerly part of the Northwest Territories), based on a recommendation by the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)**. The decision follows a formal review of a report identifying the **Polar Bear Pass Ecological Site** as a priority area for conservation.

The primary objectives of designating this area as a National Wildlife Area are:
- To protect and conserve wildlife, particularly polar bears and other native species.
- To support scientific research and ecological monitoring.
- To promote public education and environmental interpretation in a remote and ecologically sensitive region.

The designation is rooted in the public interest and reflects the importance of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in Arctic environments.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulation is enacted under **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**. This provision authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to assign administrative control of designated lands to the **Minister of the Environment** for the purposes of wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation.

This transfer of responsibility is significant because:
- It shifts day-to-day management and enforcement from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (who traditionally oversees Indigenous lands and relations) to the Minister of the Environment (responsible for national conservation policy).
- It ensures that the area will be managed with a focus on ecological protection, scientific research, and sustainable environmental practices.

18. **Easterly to**: 8,410,000 N, 500,000 E  
19. **Northeasterly back to the point of commencement**

#### **Total Area**:
- The total area of the designated parcel is approximately **2,624 square kilometers (km²)**.

### **4. Administrative Transfer**

- **Prior Administrator**: The lands were previously under the administrative jurisdiction of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- **New Administrator**: As of this regulation, the **Minister of the Environment** is now responsible for:
  - Administration
  - Management
  - Control
  of the area
- This transfer enables the integration of the site into Canada’s national wildlife conservation framework and ensures alignment with environmental protection standards.

---

### **5. Conservation and Research Objectives**

The designation emphasizes the following key purposes:
- **Wildlife Research**: Facilitating scientific studies on polar bears, caribou, migratory birds, and other Arctic species.
- **Conservation**: Protecting critical habitats and maintaining ecological balance.
- **Environmental Interpretation**: Promoting public awareness and education about Arctic ecosystems through interpretive programs, signage, and visitor access (where appropriate and safe).

---

### **6. Exclusions and Reservations**

A critical clause in the regulation includes a **saving, excepting, and reserving** provision:

> **All mines, mineral rights (solid, liquid, or gaseous), and the right to work such minerals are expressly excluded from the designation.**

This means:
- No mining, exploration, or extraction activities are permitted within the National Wildlife Area.
- The area is strictly protected from industrial development that could harm wildlife or degrade the environment.
- This exclusion reinforces the conservation purpose and ensures the long-term integrity of the ecosystem.

---

### **7. Jurisdiction and Applicability**

- The regulation applies to:
  - **Bathurst Island**
  - **Adjoining waters** within the region
- It operates under the **Canada Wildlife Act**, which governs the creation and management of National Wildlife Areas.

---

### **8. Significance and Implications**

This regulation represents a key step in:
- Strengthening Canada’s commitment to Arctic conservation.
- Recognizing the ecological value of the **Polar Bear Pass Ecological Site**, which supports polar bear movement and denning.
- Balancing Indigenous land stewardship with federal environmental policy — while maintaining respect for Indigenous rights and traditional knowledge through the continued involvement of MIAND in the process.

It also sets a precedent for future conservation designations in Canada’s Arctic, particularly in areas of high ecological sensitivity and biodiversity.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally establishes a **National Wildlife Area** in the Bracebridge-Goodsir Inlet region of Bathurst Island, covering approximately **2,624 km²**. It transfers management from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to the Minister of the Environment under the Canada Wildlife Act. The area is designated for wildlife research, conservation, and public education, with a strict exclusion of all mining and mineral rights. This action underscores Canada’s dedication to protecting Arctic ecosystems and ensuring the long-term sustainability of wildlife habitats in one of the world’s most fragile and vital environments.

*Note: While the regulation is framed in historical terms (referring to the Northwest Territories), Bathurst Island is now part of the territory of Nunavut, established in 1999. The reference to "Northwest Territories" in the text is therefore outdated in current administrative terms.*
