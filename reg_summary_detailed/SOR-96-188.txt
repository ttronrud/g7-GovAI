### **Detailed Summary of the Treasury Board Regulations on Interest on Overdue Accounts and Administrative Charges for Dishonoured Instruments (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 45)**

These regulations, issued under **subsection 155.1(6)** of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, establish the rules governing **interest on overdue accounts** and **administrative charges for dishonoured instruments** (such as cheques or payment orders) owed to Her Majesty in right of Canada. The regulations were **effective April 1, 1996**, and were **repealed by SOR/2018-89, s. 2**, meaning they are no longer in force as of that date. However, this summary provides a comprehensive and accurate interpretation of the content and intent of the regulation prior to its repeal.

## **1. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose is to:
- Define how **interest** is calculated and applied when payments are overdue;
- Specify **administrative charges** for dishonoured instruments (e.g., cheques that bounce);
- Provide **exceptions and waivers** where appropriate (e.g., due to emergencies, fraud, or force majeure);
- Ensure consistency in financial administration across government departments.

These rules apply to **amounts owing to Her Majesty** (i.e., the federal government) in connection with goods, services, facilities, contributions, loans, or overpayments — but **do not apply to Crown corporations or departmental debts**.

## **4. Interest Calculation Rules**

### **General Interest Rule (Subsection 1(1))**
- **Interest rate**: Monthly compound interest at **average bank rate + 3%**
- **Accrual period**: Begins on the **due date** and ends on the **day before payment is received** by Her Majesty or an authorized agent.
- **Partial payment**: If only part of the amount is paid, interest stops accruing on the portion paid on the day before receipt of that partial payment.

### **Interest on Overpayments or Erroneous Payments**
- Interest is payable by the **debtor** on any amount not repaid by its due date.
- Accrues from the **due date** until the day before repayment is received.
- **Exception for fraud or misconduct**:  
  If the overpayment or erroneous payment resulted from **fraud, falsification, wilful misrepresentation**, or other offences, interest accrues from the **day the overpayment was made** until the day before repayment.

### **Interest on Late or Missed Payments on Concessionary Loans**
- Interest is charged at the **difference between the standard rate (average bank rate + 3%) and the concessionary rate** in the loan agreement.
- Applies only if the loan is **not** a multilateral debt relief loan or developmental assistance loan.

### **Exclusions from Interest**
- **No interest** if:
  1. The delay or error was caused by **Her Majesty or its authorized agent** in processing payments or establishing amounts payable.
  2. A **system breakdown or communication failure** occurred in the government’s payment processing system.
  3. The total amount due (including interest) for a period is **less than the minimum threshold** for a demand for payment — as set by the deputy head of the program/service and published on the Government of Canada website.

## **5. Waivers of Interest**

The **appropriate Minister** or a **public officer authorized in writing** may waive or reduce interest under the following conditions:

### **Waiver Conditions (Subsection 6(2))**
| Condition | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Administrative costs exceed interest** | If the cost of assessing, billing, and collecting interest would exceed the amount owed |
| **Amount in dispute settled** | If the debt is settled in whole or in part in favour of the debtor |
| **Overpayment recovered from subsequent payment** | Applies to salary, wages, or benefits — **except** when a fine or penalty has already been imposed |
| **Urgent and critical situation** | Includes: <br>• National or provincial emergency<br>• Substantial financial hardship<br>• Natural disaster (fire, flood, storm, earthquake, drought)<br>• Disease (human, animal, plant)<br>• Accident, pollution, sabotage, terrorism<br>• Results in danger to life, health, property, social disruption, or breakdown of essential services |

### **Waiver for Circumstances Beyond Debtor’s Control**
- Includes:
  - Death or incapacity of debtor or responsible person
  - Postal disruption that delays payment and no alternative method exists
  - Delay in processing a **pre-authorized debit** due to failure in external systems or communication links

## **6. Administrative Charges for Dishonoured Instruments**

### **General Rule (Subsection 10(1))**
- When a payment instrument (e.g., cheque) is **dishonoured**, a **$15 administrative charge** is payable by the debtor to Her Majesty.

### **Additional Charges**
- If the government reimburses a **financial institution** for processing a dishonoured instrument:
  - An **additional $10 charge** is due from the debtor.
- If the financial institution charges Her Majesty for **monitoring or clearing** the dishonoured instrument:
  - The debtor pays **the amount charged by the institution**, in addition to the $15 charge.

> Example: A cheque is dishonoured. Debtor pays $15 + $10 (reimbursement) + $X (monitoring fee) = total administrative charge.

### **Exclusions from Charges**
- No charge applies if:
  - The dishonour was due to an **error or delay by Her Majesty or its agent**
  - A **system breakdown or communication failure** prevented processing
- Waiver of charge is possible if:
  - Administrative costs of assessment and collection exceed the charge
  - The situation involves an **urgent and critical emergency** (same as interest waiver)
  - The dishonour resulted from an **error by the financial institution or other entity** (e.g., incorrect account details)

> Waiver considerations:
> - The debtor’s case
> - The debtor’s diligence in taking steps to fix the issue

### ✅ **Interest and Administrative Charges Are Separate**
- Administrative charges under Part II are **in addition** to any interest under Part I or other laws.

- If a payment instrument is tendered (in full or in part) to settle an amount due (including interest), and it is later dishonoured:
  - **Interest continues to accrue** from
