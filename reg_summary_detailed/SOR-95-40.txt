### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 1 – Dairy Products for Personal Use (Canada, 1994)**

This regulation, issued on **December 29, 1994**, by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, constitutes a **General Import Permit** authorizing the importation of **dairy products into Canada for personal use**. It supersedes a prior, specific permit (the "Import of Dairy Products for Personal Use Permit, C.R.C., c. 623") and is issued under the authority of the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, specifically:

- **Section 10** – Authority to cancel or issue permits.
- **Subsection 8(1.1)** and **Subsection 8.3(3)** – Powers to issue general import permits under certain conditions.

## **I. Background and Legal Basis**

### **1. Inclusion on Import Control List**
- Dairy products were previously placed on the **Import Control List**, indicating that their importation required regulatory oversight.

### **2. Import Access Quantity Determination**
- The Secretary of State determined an **import access quantity** for dairy products under **subsection 6.2(1)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*, S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 106.  
  This means that a specific volume or value of dairy products could be imported without requiring individual permits, based on trade policy and economic considerations.

### **3. Authority to Issue Permit**
- The permit is issued under **Section 10** of the EIPA, which allows the Secretary of State to issue general import permits when appropriate.
- The permit is effective upon the **latest of the following dates**:
  - Section 74 of the WTO Agreement (Canada’s implementation act)
  - Section 106 (import access quantity)
  - Subsection 108(1)
  - Sections 109 and 111 of the WTO Implementation Act (S.C. 1994, c. 47)

> These provisions came into force in **1994**, making this permit effective from that date.

## **II. Key Provisions of the Permit**

### **2. Import Limitations and Personal Use Rules**

#### **General Value Limit**
- Any **resident of Canada** may import dairy products **for personal use and household consumption**.
- The **value per importation must not exceed $20 CAD**.

> This limit applies to all dairy products **except** those listed in **Item 5** of the schedule.

#### **Exception: Item 5 – No $20 Limit**
- Goods specified in **Item 5** (a detailed list of dairy products) are **exempt from the $20 value cap**.
- This exception likely applies to higher-value or specialized dairy items such as cheese, butter, or fermented milk products, allowing individuals to import larger quantities for personal use.

> *Note:* The exact nature of Item 5 is not fully detailed here, but it includes items like:
> - Fresh cheese
> - Processed cheese
> - Yogurt
> - Butter
> - Dairy spreads
> - Other fermented or acidified milk products

### **3. Reporting Requirement**
- If the imported goods are required to be reported under the **Customs Act**, the declaration must include the statement:
  > **"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 1 — Dairy Products for Personal Use"**  
  > or  
  > **"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 1 — Produits laitiers pour usage personnel"**

This ensures transparency and compliance with customs reporting obligations.
