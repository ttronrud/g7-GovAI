- **Improved Accountability and Oversight**: The new minister is responsible for both economic development and language rights, enabling more cohesive policy design and implementation.  
- **Efficiency and Cost Savings**: Reduces duplication of efforts and administrative overhead by eliminating separate ministerial oversight of tourism and language policy.

---

#### **5. Implementation and Effectiveness**
- The transfer is **effective immediately** upon publication in the Canada Gazette.  
- All departments, agencies, and officials previously responsible for these functions must transition their operations and reporting lines to the new minister.  
- The Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages is expected to:
  - Develop a strategic plan integrating tourism and official language policy.
  - Report to Parliament on progress and outcomes.
  - Engage with stakeholders, including Indigenous communities, francophone populations, and provincial governments.

---

#### **6. Conclusion**
This regulation represents a significant reorganization of federal ministerial responsibilities. It transfers key functions related to **tourism promotion** and **official language implementation** from the Minister of La Francophonie to the **Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages**, thereby aligning language policy with broader economic development goals. The move enhances interdepartmental coordination, strengthens bilingualism in economic policy, and supports regional development in French-speaking communities.

---

**Note**: This transfer does not affect the overall mandate of the Minister of La Francophonie, which may still include cultural and educational initiatives. However, the specific operational and policy responsibilities under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act* and the *Official Languages Act* are now fully assigned to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages.
