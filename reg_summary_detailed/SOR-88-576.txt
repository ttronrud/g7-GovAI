**1. Background and Context**

This regulatory instrument, known as the *Northwestel Inc. Shares Sale Order*, is a formal government authorization that enables the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail) to sell its entire ownership stake in Northwestel Inc. The Order was issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), specifically subsection 101(6) and paragraphs 101(1)(d) and subsection 101(7), and was approved by Her Excellency the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board.

**2. Key Entities Involved**

- **Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail):**  
  A parent Crown Corporation, meaning it is owned by the Government of Canada. As such, it operates under public accountability and is subject to federal oversight and financial regulations.

- **Northwestel Inc.:**  
  A telecommunications company providing telecommunications services, primarily in northern and remote regions of Canada. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CN Rail, meaning CN Rail holds 100% of its shares and controls its operations.

**3. Legal Authority and Basis for the Order**

The Order is grounded in two key pieces of legislation:

- **Section 31 of the Canadian National Railway Act (CNRA):**  
  This section grants CN Rail the legal authority to undertake certain corporate transactions, including the sale of its subsidiaries, provided that the transaction is in the public interest and consistent with the corporation’s mandate.

- **Subsection 101(6) and Paragraph 101(1)(d) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA):**  
  These provisions empower the Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet, acting on ministerial advice) to authorize the sale of government-owned assets or shares when:
  - The transaction is in the public interest;
  - The entity is otherwise empowered to conduct the transaction under its governing legislation;
  - The sale does not compromise public accountability or service delivery.

The Governor in Council has determined that CN Rail is duly empowered under the CNRA to proceed with the sale, and that the transaction aligns with broader public policy objectives.
