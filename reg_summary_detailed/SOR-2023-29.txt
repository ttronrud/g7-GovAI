---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under **section 24 of the *Expungement of Historically Unjust Convictions Act* (S.C. 2018, c. 11)**, establishes specific **eligibility criteria** that must be met by applicants seeking an **expungement order** for certain historical convictions listed in the *Schedule* to the Act. The purpose of this Order is to ensure that expungement is granted only in cases where the conviction was based on circumstances that are now recognized as **historically unjust**, particularly those involving **consensual, non-provisional sexual activity** or **medical actions performed with informed consent**.

The Order does **not** create new criminal penalties or change existing laws. Instead, it sets out **mandatory evidentiary requirements** that must be demonstrated in order for a conviction to qualify for expungement under the Act.

### **Key Provisions by Offence Category**

#### **1. Offences Listed in Item 7 of the Schedule**
*(Conviction related to association with a bawdy-house for acts of indecency, not prostitution)*

- **Criteria Required**:
  - The conviction must relate to the person’s **association with a bawdy-house** where **acts of indecency** (i.e., consensual sexual activity) were **viewed or engaged in**, and **not for the purpose of prostitution**.
  - The person **did not exchange money** for the provision or receipt of sexual services in that establishment.

> 🔍 *Interpretation*: This targets cases where individuals were wrongly convicted for being present at or involved in venues where consensual, non-commercial sexual acts occurred — not places where sex-for-money transactions took place.

---

#### **2. Offences Listed in Item 8 of the Schedule**
*(Conviction related to a bawdy-house for acts of indecency, not prostitution)*

- **Criteria Required**:
  - The conviction must have been related to a bawdy-house where **acts of indecency** were practiced and **not for the purpose of prostitution**.
  - **Consensual sexual activity** was viewed or engaged in.

> 🔍 *Interpretation*: Similar to item 7, but more narrowly focused on the **nature of the activity** (acts of indecency) and the **absence of commercial intent**. The key element is that the setting was not a prostitution venue.

---

#### **3. Offences Listed in Items 9 to 13 of the Schedule**
*(Various offences involving activities in bawdy-houses for acts of indecency, not prostitution)*

- **Criteria Required**:
  - The activity for which the person was convicted took place in a **bawdy-house where acts of indecency are practiced**, not a place kept for prostitution.
  - The person **did not exchange money** for the provision or receipt of sexual services.

> 🔍 *Interpretation*: This group covers a range of offences (e.g., indecent exposure, voyeurism, etc.) that occurred in such settings. The core principle remains: **non-commercial, consensual sexual activity** in a non-prostitution context must be demonstrated.

---

#### **4. Offence Listed in Item 14 – Procuring a Woman/Female Person’s Miscarriage**

##### **Subcase A: Convicted Person Used or Assisted in Using Means to Procure Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - At the time of the offence, the person was a **medical doctor, nurse, or midwife**.
  - The person acted **with the consent of the woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Recognizes that medical professionals may have provided services (e.g., medications) to assist in a miscarriage **with informed and voluntary consent**, which may have been legally or ethically acceptable at the time — thus, historically unjust if prosecuted under outdated laws.

##### **Subcase B: Convicted Person Assisted Access to Means for Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person acted **at the request of the woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Ensures that assistance provided only if explicitly requested by the individual — protecting autonomy and consent.

---

#### **5. Offence Listed in Item 15 – Pregnant Woman/Female Person Procuring Her Own Miscarriage**

##### **Subcase A: Assisted in Accessing Means to Carry Out Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person acted **at the request of the pregnant woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Supports the idea that a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body — including reproductive choices — should be respected, especially when such decisions are made voluntarily.

##### **Subcase B: Used Means with Intention to Procure Her Own Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person was **the pregnant woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Prevents misattribution of actions; ensures that only individuals who actually carried out the act (i.e., the woman herself) can qualify for expungement in such cases.

---

#### **6. Offence Listed in Item 17 – Supplying/Procuring Drugs or Noxious Things for Miscarriage**

##### **Subcase A: Convicted Person is a Medical Professional (Doctor, Nurse, Midwife)**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person was a **medical doctor, nurse, or midwife** at the time of the offence.
  - The person acted **with the consent of the woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Reflects a shift in medical ethics and legal standards — where medical professionals providing reproductive care with consent should not be punished under outdated laws.

##### **Subcase B: Assisted in Procuring the Drug/Instrument Knowing It Was Intended for Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person acted **at the request of the woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Ensures that only voluntary, consensual assistance — not coercion or unrequested intervention — qualifies.

##### **Subcase C: Procured the Drug/Instrument with Intention to Use for Own Miscarriage**
- Must demonstrate:
  - The person was **the woman or female person**.

> 🔍 *Rationale*: Prevents false or mistaken attributions of actions; only the individual who intended and acted on the self-directed choice can be eligible.

---

#### **7. Offence Listed in Item 18 of the Schedule**

- **Criteria Required**:
  - Any of the criteria set out in **sections 2 to 11** of this Order (which cover the above offences) must be satisfied.

> 🔍 *Interpretation*: This is a catch-all provision that ensures that **all applicable criteria** from the earlier sections are met for any offence listed in item 18. It ensures consistency and comprehensive evaluation across different types of historical convictions.

### **General Principles Underlying the Order**

1. **Historical Justice**:
   - The Order reflects a policy of **correcting past injustices**, particularly those rooted in outdated, repressive, or gender-biased laws (e.g., laws criminalizing consensual sex in bawdy-houses or reproductive autonomy).

2. **Consent and Autonomy**:
   - A central theme is **consent** — whether in sexual activity or reproductive decisions — and the importance of **individual autonomy**, especially for women and marginalized groups.

3. **Non-Profit, Non-Commercial Contexts**:
   - The distinction between **prostitution** and **acts of indecency** is crucial. Expungement is only available when the activity was **not commercial** or transactional.

4. **Professional Status and Medical Ethics**:
   - For medical-related offences, the requirement of professional status and informed consent aligns with modern medical ethics and human rights standards.

5. **Evidence-Based Application**:
   - Applicants must provide **clear, documented evidence** to satisfy each criterion. This ensures that expungement is not granted arbitrarily or without accountability.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Restoration of Dignity**: Allows individuals who were wrongly convicted under outdated laws to have their records cleared, restoring their dignity and future opportunities.
- **Legal Reform**: Signals a broader shift in Canadian law toward recognizing **consent**, **personal autonomy**, and **historical context** in criminal justice.
- **Gender and Reproductive Justice**: Particularly impactful in cases involving reproductive rights, where women’s bodies and choices were historically criminalized.
- **Clarification of Boundaries**: Sets clear, legally enforceable standards for what constitutes a "historically unjust" conviction, reducing ambiguity in expungement decisions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a significant step in Canada’s efforts to **rectify historical injustices** in the criminal justice system. By defining precise, evidence-based criteria for expungement in relation to offences involving consensual sexual activity in non-prostitution settings and reproductive autonomy, it ensures that expungement is both **fair, equitable, and grounded in modern values**. It reflects a commitment to justice that respects individual rights, consent, and the evolving understanding of what constitutes a just and humane legal system.

📌 **Key Takeaway**:  
Expungement is not automatic — it requires **clear evidence** that the conviction arose from **non-commercial, consensual activities** or **medical actions with informed consent**, especially in contexts historically stigmat
