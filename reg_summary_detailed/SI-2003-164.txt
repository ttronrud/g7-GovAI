**Detailed Summary of the Accredited ICAO Missions Remission Order (Part IX of the Excise Tax Act)**  
*Statutory Reference: S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, establishes a **remission (exemption or refund)** of excise tax for certain **permanent foreign missions to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)** in Canada.

The purpose of the Order is to **recognize and compensate** accredited ICAO missions for tax liabilities that would have been avoided had they been granted the full set of **privileges and immunities** provided under the *ICAO Privileges and Immunities Order*. It is rooted in the public interest to ensure that these international missions are not unfairly burdened by excise taxes that are inconsistent with their status as official diplomatic entities.

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Accredited ICAO Mission** | A permanent mission of a foreign state that was officially accredited to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Canada during the *eligible period*. This includes diplomatic missions representing a foreign government at ICAO in Canada. |
| **Eligible Period** | The period beginning on **April 1, 2002**, and ending on the **day immediately before the date of registration** of any subsequent amendment to this Order (specifically, the *Order Amending the ICAO Privileges and Immunities Order (Accredited Missions)*). This period defines the timeframe for which tax remission applies. |
| **Tax** | Refers to the excise tax imposed under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which typically includes taxes on goods such as aviation fuel, aircraft, and other aviation-related products. |

### **Core Provision: Remission of Tax**

Under this Order, **remission is granted** to each accredited ICAO mission for the **excess tax** that became payable during the eligible period, **compared to what would have been payable if the mission had been granted the full privileges and immunities** under Section 5 of the *ICAO Privileges and Immunities Order*.

#### **Formula for Remission Amount**:
> Remission = (Actual tax payable during eligible period)  
> – (Tax that would have been payable *if* the mission had been granted full ICAO privileges and immunities during the same period)

In other words:
- The mission pays excise tax as if it were a regular commercial entity.
- However, because it is an accredited diplomatic mission, it should be entitled to the same tax exemptions or reductions as other diplomatic missions under international law.
- This Order **remits the difference** — the amount of tax that would have been avoided due to those privileges.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The remission applies only to the **excess** over what would have been payable under the privileges. It does **not** refund or remit the entire tax liability.

### **Conditions for Remission**

To qualify for remission, an accredited ICAO mission must meet **two key conditions**:

1. **Payment of Tax**  
   The mission must have **already paid** the excise tax to which the remission claim pertains.

2. **Submission of a Written Claim**  
   The mission must submit a **written claim** to the **Minister of National Revenue** by a specific deadline.

   - **Deadline**: The **first day of the third calendar month** following the calendar month in which the Order is made.
     - *Example*: If the Order is made in June 2024, the claim must be submitted by **September 1, 2024**.
   - The claim must include:
     - **Original receipts** verifying the tax paid by the mission during the eligible period.
     - **Written evidence** confirming that, during the relevant period, the mission was an *accredited ICAO mission*.

> 🔍 *Note:* The claim must be submitted **before** the deadline; late submissions will not be accepted.

### **Exclusion Clause**

The remission calculation **excludes** any tax that has already been:
- Refunded
- Rebated
- Credited
- Remitted (in any form)

This ensures that the remission only applies to **new or unremitted tax liabilities** that are directly attributable to the difference between actual tax paid and tax that would have been avoided due to privileges.

---

### **Legal Authority**

The Order is issued under:
- **Section 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make regulations to remit taxes when it is in the **public interest**, based on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance.

This reflects a discretionary power to balance fiscal responsibility with international obligations and diplomatic equity.

---

### **Purpose and Public Interest Rationale**

The Order serves several important objectives:
1. **Diplomatic Equity**: Recognizes that accredited ICAO missions operate under international law and should not be subject to excise taxes that are inconsistent with their status.
2. **Fiscal Fairness**: Prevents the imposition of tax on entities that are functionally similar to diplomatic missions and are not engaged in commercial activities.
3. **Compliance with International Norms**: Aligns Canadian tax policy with the privileges and immunities granted under international agreements, particularly those governing the ICAO.
4. **Public Interest**: Ensures that the tax system does not create undue burdens on international organizations or diplomatic missions that serve public interests in aviation safety, regulation, and cooperation.

---

### **Key Limitations and Important Notes**

- **Time-Bound**: The remission applies **only during the eligible period (April 1, 2002 – date of registration of any future amendment)**.
- **No Retroactive Application Beyond Eligible Period**: Missions that were accredited after April 1, 2002, or before that date, are only eligible if they fall within the defined window.
- **No Automatic Remission**: Remission is not automatic. It requires **active submission of claims** with supporting documentation.
- **No Compensation for Pre-2002 Periods**: The Order does not extend to tax periods before April 1, 2002.
- **Not a Tax Exemption**: The Order does not eliminate the tax entirely — it only **remits the excess** that would have been avoided under ICAO privileges.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Accredited ICAO Missions Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable, and legally grounded measure that corrects a fiscal imbalance in the excise tax system by **remitting the tax burden** that would have been avoided due to the privileges and immunities granted to accredited ICAO missions.

It balances the need for government revenue with international obligations and diplomatic norms, ensuring that foreign missions involved in global civil aviation governance are treated fairly and consistently under Canadian tax law.

This Order remains in force until amended or repealed by a subsequent regulatory instrument, and its effectiveness is contingent upon timely claim submissions and compliance with procedural requirements.
