### **Detailed Summary of the Saskatoon Airport Zoning Regulations (1987)**

This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, formally **replaces and revokes** the previous *Saskatoon Airport Zoning Regulations, C.R.C., c. 108*, with new, updated zoning rules designed to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency at Saskatoon Airport. The new regulations establish strict spatial and elevation controls around the airport to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

---

## **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Background**

- **Authority**: The regulation is enacted under **Section 4.4** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which allows the Minister of Transport to issue or amend zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette Part I* (May 16 and 23, 1987) and in two issues of the *Star-Phoenix* (July 2 and 6, 1987). This provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, aviation stakeholders, municipalities) to submit written representations to the Minister.
- **Finalization**: Based on public input and recommendations, the Governor in Council, acting on the Minister of Transport’s advice, **officially revokes the old regulations** and adopts these new ones.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation introduces precise definitions for key geographic and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Saskatoon Airport and its surrounding area in the Province of Saskatchewan. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as a datum for measuring elevation and distances. Located at a specific surveyed location near the airport. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. It ensures a clear zone of visibility and prevents obstructions during aircraft approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal plane located 45 meters above the ARP elevation (or 9 meters above ground if lower), forming a boundary beyond which no structures may exceed height. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area (runway and associated taxiways) designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. |
| **Transitional Surface** | A sloped surface connecting the approach surface to the outer surface, ensuring a smooth transition in elevation between the runway end and the outer boundary. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 495.30 meters above sea level.

---

## **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to all lands:
- Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**; and  
- Directly beneath any part of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

These include public road allowances and adjacent private lands, ensuring that all areas near the airport are governed by the same safety standards.

---

## **4. Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- Construct, erect, or build **any structure, building, or object** (including additions to existing ones),  
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> These surfaces define safe zones around runways and approach paths to prevent visual obstructions that could interfere with pilots’ ability to see the runway during critical phases of flight.

---

## **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the defined surfaces, the **Minister may require** the owner or lessee to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.
- This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards during flight operations.

---

## **6. Prohibition of Bird Attractants**

- No owner or lessee may use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - Edible by birds, or  
  - Attractive to birds.

> This rule is critical to **prevent bird strikes**, which are a major aviation safety risk. The prohibition helps reduce the likelihood of birds gathering near runways or approach paths.

---

## **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Elements**

### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

- Located on the **centre line of runway 08R-26L**.
- Coordinates defined using astronomical bearings and distances:
  - Start at the **northeast corner of the southeast quarter of Section 13, Township 37, Range 6, W of 3rd Meridian**.
  - Traverse south along the easterly boundary of that section (198.27 m).
  - Proceed south 79°01′20″ east for 940.25 m to intersect the runway centerline.
  - Continue south 49°01′20″ east for 822.96 m to reach the designated ARP.

> This point serves as the **origin for all elevation and distance measurements** in the regulation.

---

### **B. Approach Surfaces**

Each approach surface is defined for the five runways:
- **Runway 14-32** (ends): Inclined plane with 1:50 slope, rising to a horizontal line 15,240 m from the end, 2,316.48 m from the centerline, at 304.8 m above the strip end elevation.
- **Runway 08R-26L** (end): Same as 14-32 (1:50 slope, 304.8 m above end).
- **Runway 08L-26R** (end): 1:25 slope (steeper), rising to a horizontal line 2,529.84 m from the end, 283.46 m from centerline, at **101.19 m** above end elevation.
- **Runway 26R** (end): Same as 08L-26R (1:25 slope, 101.19 m).

> The difference in slope (1:50 vs. 1:25) reflects the varying approach angles and safety requirements for different runways.

---

### **C. Outer Surface**

- A flat, horizontal surface at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (495.30 m → 540.30 m above sea level).
- **Exception**: Where the ground is lower than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to avoid unrealistic height requirements.

> This surface defines the **maximum allowable height** for all structures and natural features outside the approach and transitional zones.

---

### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**

Defined by width, length, and centerline positions:

| Runway | Width | Length | Side Distance |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| **08R-26L** | 365.76 m | 3,383.28 m | 182.88 m on each side |
| **14-32** | 365.76 m | 3,139.44 m | 182.88 m on each side |
| **08L-26R** | 60.96 m | 1,036.32 m | 30.48 m on each side |

> The 08L-26R strip is narrower and shorter, reflecting its secondary status and lower traffic volume.

---

### **E. Transitional Surfaces**

These connect the approach surfaces to the outer surface, forming a smooth gradient:

- **For 08R-26L and 14-32**:
  - Inclined plane with **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
  - Extends outward from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surface.
  - Ends where it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface.

- **For 08L-26R**:
  - Inclined plane with **1:5 slope** (1 meter vertical per 5 meters horizontal).
  - Similar structure, but less steep due to the shorter runway.

> These surfaces ensure a gradual transition in elevation, preventing sudden drops or rises that could confuse pilots.

---

## **8. Boundary of Outer Limits**

The outer boundary of regulated land is described in a detailed, step-by-step survey description based on land parcels, streets, and property lines. It follows a complex path across several sections of the township and range system, including:

- Major roads: **33rd Street, Byng Avenue, John A. MacDonald Road, Confederation Drive, Massey Drive, Northumberland Avenue, Bedford Road, Avenue E, Avenue A, 29th Street, 25th Street, Section 31, 33, 36, 28, 29, 30, 25**.
- Legal subdivisions and registered plans (e.g., Plan 72-S-22316, Plan 67-S-29100, Plan G.746, etc.).

> This boundary defines the **geographic perimeter** of the regulated zone and ensures consistency with the airport’s physical layout and surrounding
