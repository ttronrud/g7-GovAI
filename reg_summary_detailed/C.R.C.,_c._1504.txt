**Detailed Summary of the Import and Export Returns Order**

**Title:**  
Import and Export Returns Order

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to establish a systematic and mandatory process for collecting detailed information on all imports and exports involving Canada. It ensures that accurate and comprehensive data on trade flows—specifically the volume, value, and mode of transportation—will be systematically recorded and submitted to the federal government for statistical and economic analysis.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Mandatory Reporting Requirement:**  
   All entities involved in the importation or exportation of goods into or out of Canada are required to submit returns detailing each transaction. This includes both commercial and non-commercial movements, though the regulation focuses on commercial trade.

2. **Content of the Returns:**  
   The returns must include:
   - The full details of each import or export transaction (e.g., description of goods, quantity, value, and country of origin or destination).
   - Specific information regarding the means of transportation used for the movement of goods. This includes, but is not limited to:
     - Type of transport (e.g., air, sea, land, rail).
     - Carrier name or identifier.
     - Route or shipment path.
     - Date and time of departure and arrival.
     - Any relevant documentation or identifiers (e.g., bill of lading, airway bill).

3. **Submission Deadline and Method:**  
   - Returns must be submitted **at the time of customs clearance**. This ensures that data is collected contemporaneously with the actual movement of goods, minimizing delays and inaccuracies.
   - The returns must be sent **by mail** to the **Chief Statistician** of Canada. This method is specified to ensure a formal, auditable, and traceable record of submissions, although it may be subject to modernization or digital transition in future amendments.

4. **Applicability:**  
   The regulation applies to all imports and exports—regardless of value, size, or nature of goods—entering or leaving Canada. This includes both domestic and international trade transactions processed through Canadian customs authorities.

5. **Administrative and Statistical Function:**  
   The data collected under this Order serves critical functions:
   - Providing the government with accurate and timely trade statistics.
   - Supporting economic planning, policy formulation, and international trade negotiations.
   - Enabling monitoring of trade patterns, compliance with trade agreements, and identification of potential market trends or disruptions.

6. **Enforcement and Compliance:**  
   While the regulation does not explicitly outline penalties, non-compliance with the reporting requirement may be considered a breach of customs and trade obligations, potentially leading to administrative or legal consequences, including fines or delays in customs processing.

**Significance:**  
This regulation establishes a foundational framework for trade data collection in Canada. By mandating timely and detailed reporting, it enhances the reliability of national trade statistics, which are essential for economic forecasting, fiscal policy, and international trade analysis.

**Citation:**  
The Order may be cited as the *Import and Export Returns Order*.

**Note:**  
Although the regulation specifies mail as the submission method, modern interpretations or amendments may have introduced electronic submission options. However, as written, the current version relies on physical mail delivery to the Chief Statistician.

**Conclusion:**  
The Import and Export Returns Order ensures that all trade movements into and out of Canada are systematically documented, with a focus on transparency, accuracy, and timely data collection. It plays a vital role in Canada’s national statistical infrastructure and supports informed decision-making in trade and economic policy.
