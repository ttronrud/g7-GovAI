The provided text consists of **repeated entries** indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2012-256, section 72**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed).
- **Repealing Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2012-256*, specifically **Section 72**.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **June 15, 2012**, as SOR/2012-256 was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on that date.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 72 of SOR/2012-256 explicitly **repeals a prior regulation**, meaning it is no longer in force and cannot be cited or applied.
- **Frequency of Repeats**: The repeated lines (over 30 instances) are likely a formatting or technical error — they do not represent distinct regulatory provisions, but rather a duplication of the same repealing note. This may have occurred due to a data input or display error.

### Interpretation:

There is **no active, enforceable regulation** listed here. The repeated entries indicate that the regulation previously referenced (which is not named in the text) has been **officially removed from the legal framework** by the government through a statutory instrument.

### Implications:

- **Legal Effect**: Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures previously governed by this regulation are now **invalid** and **no longer applicable**.
- **Need for Replacement**: The repealed regulation may have been replaced by a newer, current law or regulation, which should be consulted for current requirements.
- **Research Note**: To determine what regulation was repealed, one would need to refer to the full text of **SOR/2012-256**, particularly **Section 72**, which would list the specific regulation being repealed.

Without the original regulation's name or subject matter, a precise summary of its content cannot be provided — only that it has been **officially canceled**.
