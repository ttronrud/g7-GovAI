### **Detailed Summary of the New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)**  
*Pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*

---

## **1. Background and Legal Basis**

The **New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)** were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, under **subsection 114(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999). This action followed a **public consultation process** initiated on **October 30, 2004**, when the Minister published a **proposed version** of the regulations in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, allowing stakeholders to submit comments or file **notices of objection** requesting a board of review.

This final regulation establishes a comprehensive framework for the **notification and assessment of micro-organisms and other organisms** that are introduced into Canada, particularly those used in research and development (R&D), to ensure environmental and human health protection.

## **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define critical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*. |
| **Micro-organism** | Includes: bacteria, archaea, protists (e.g., protozoa, algae), fungi (e.g., yeasts), viruses, virus-like particles, sub-viral particles, cultured cells (excluding those used to propagate the organism), or any culture (non-pure). |
| **Organism** | A living organism as defined in section 104 of CEPA 1999, **excluding** specific cases related to micro-organisms or certain regulated substances (e.g., pathogens, genetically modified organisms in Schedule 5). |
| **Research and Development (R&D) Organism** | An organism undergoing systematic investigation with primary objectives such as: <br> - Creating or improving a product/process <br> - Determining technical viability/performance <br> - Evaluating the organism before commercialization (e.g., pilot trials, scale-up). |
| **Experimental Field Study** | A field-based R&D study using the **minimum area** (≤100 hectares) and **minimum quantity** of micro-organism necessary to meet study objectives. |
| **Indigenous** | A micro-organism that occurs naturally in the **ecozone** where it is intended to be introduced. |
| **Ecozone** | One of the 10 terrestrial ecozones defined in the *Terrestrial Ecozones and Ecoregions of Canada 1995* map (Catalogue No. cas016e), as updated by the Canada Soil Information System (CanSIS). |
| **Containment Procedures** | Physical, chemical, biological, or operational controls designed to restrict the exit or dispersal of a micro-organism. |
| **Contained Facility** | An enclosed building or area meeting physical and operational requirements for a specific **containment level** as per either: <br> - *Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines* (2015 & 2017) <br> - *NIH Guidelines* (Appendix K). |
| **NIH Guidelines** | U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ *Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules* (1994, amended), which set standards for safe handling of genetically modified organisms. |
| **Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines** | Developed jointly by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), including:<br> - *Canadian Biosafety Standard, 2nd Edition (2015)*<br> - *Canadian Biosafety Guideline: Containment Level 1 (2017)* |

> ⚠️ **Note**: The *Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines* were **repealed** in 2018 (SOR/2018-11, s.33).

## **3. Scope and Exclusions**

The regulations **do not apply** in the following situations:

### **Exclusions from Application**
1. **Organisms regulated under other Acts or regulations** listed in **Schedule 4** of CEPA 1999 (e.g., human pathogens, pesticides, food safety).
2. **Micro-organisms loaded on a carrier outside Canada** and moved through Canada to a location outside Canada — regardless of carrier changes.
3. **R&D micro-organisms not intended for introduction outside a contained facility**, if:
   - Containment complies with Canadian Biosafety Standards or NIH Appendix K; **and**
   - Quantity is below thresholds:
     - Less than **50 mL or 50 g** upon import; or
     - Manufactured in a contained facility with:
       - Less than **1,000 L** present at any time (if requiring containment level 2, 3, or 4); or
       - Less than **250 L** present at any time (if under a licensed controlled activity under the *Human Pathogens and Toxins Act*).
4. **Non-micro-organisms** that are R&D organisms with **no environmental release** of:
   - The organism itself
   - Its genetic material
   - Material involved in toxicity testing
5. **Agricultural research studies** involving **indigenous micro-organisms** (see detailed exception below).

---

## **4. Special Exemption: Agricultural Research Studies**

Despite general notification requirements, **a micro-organism used in an agricultural research study** may be exempt from full Schedule 1 reporting **if** the following conditions are met:

### **Conditions for Exemption**
- The study is conducted and supervised by:
  - An **agronomist**, **plant pathologist**, or **trained researcher**.
- The micro-organism:
  - Is **not modified** from its natural form.
  - Occurs **naturally** in the same ecozone as the study site.
  - Is identifiable at a **taxonomic level** that allows assessment of:
    - Environmental and health risks
    - Study design and safety measures
- Manufacturing practices:
  - Minimize contamination and **unintentional release**.
- Field practices:
  - Follow sanitation and field controls to **minimize dispersal** beyond the study area.
- Operational procedures:
  - Ensure only **qualified individuals** receive physical possession of the micro-organism, who are aware of and capable of meeting safety conditions.

> ✅ **Agricultural research study** is defined as:
> - On land cultivated with annual crops (e.g., corn, soybeans)
> - On perennial/woody plants (e.g., grapevines, fruit trees, Christmas trees, ornamental shrubs) not requiring replanting
> - On land used for ≥5 consecutive years growing herbaceous forage crops
> - In a greenhouse **not considered a contained facility**

> ❌ Excludes forestry lands.
