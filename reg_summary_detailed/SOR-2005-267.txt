**Detailed Summary of the Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI) Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI) Regulations are made under the authority of the **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act (OSFI Act)**. Specifically, the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, exercises powers under:
- **Section 23.1(4)a** and **Section 25(1)b** of the OSFI Act
- **Section 38c** of the OSFI Act

These provisions authorize the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) to establish administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) for violations by financial institutions, bank holding companies, and insurance holding companies.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose of these Regulations is to:
- Define specific violations (contraventions) of financial institutions' regulatory obligations under various financial institutions Acts.
- Classify those violations as **minor**, **serious**, or **very serious**.
- Establish **penalty amounts** based on the nature and severity of the violation and the size of the institution (measured by total assets).
- Provide a clear, enforceable framework for administrative penalties to ensure compliance with prudential and regulatory standards.

### **3. Key Definitions and Interpretations**

#### **"Act"**
- Refers to the *Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act*.

#### **Schedule Structure**
The schedule contains a table with six columns:
| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Short-form descriptions (e.g., "Failure to maintain records") — **not part of the Regulations**; included only for reference and convenience. |
| 2–5 | Identify the specific financial institutions Act and the provision that, when violated, constitutes a violation. These provisions are the legal basis for the penalties. |
| 6 | Classifies each violation as **minor**, **serious**, or **very serious**. This classification determines the applicable penalty level. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Violations listed in columns 2 to 5 are subject to enforcement under **Sections 26 to 37** of the OSFI Act, which govern administrative penalties.

#### **Types of Violations**
The Regulations cover two types of violations:
1. **Contravention of a provision** in a financial institutions Act (e.g., failure to comply with capital requirements or reporting obligations).
2. **Non-compliance with orders, directions, undertakings, or prudential agreements** issued under such provisions.

Both types of violations may be proceeded with under the enforcement provisions of the OSFI Act.

### **4. Penalty Structure (Based on Violation Classification)**

#### **Minor Violations**
The Regulations apply a tiered penalty system based on the **total assets** of the violating institution:

| Size of Institution (Total Assets) | Penalty for Minor Violation |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ≤ $250 million                    | $100                       |
| > $250 million but ≤ $10 billion | $250                       |
| > $10 billion                    | $500                       |

> ✅ These penalties apply only to **minor** violations as defined in **Column 6** of the schedule.

#### **Continued Minor Violations**
If a minor violation is **continued over more than one day**, it results in **multiple separate violations** under **Section 35 of the OSFI Act** (which treats ongoing non-compliance as a series of discrete breaches).

- For each such separate violation:
  - The penalty is the **lesser of**:
    1. The penalty set in the above table (e.g., $250), or  
    2. The amount calculated as:  
      **$25,000 ÷ total number of separate violations**

> 🔍 Example:  
> A minor violation continues for 5 days.  
> → 5 separate violations arise.  
> → Penalty per day = $25,000 ÷ 5 = **$5,000**  
> → This is **less than** the standard $250 penalty → so the penalty is **$5,000 per day**.

> ⚠️ This provision ensures that **prolonged non-compliance is not punished at a fixed rate**, but instead is **proportionally reduced** to discourage repeated or extended breaches without excessive financial burden.

---

### **5. Enforcement and Jurisdiction**
- Penalties are enforceable under **Sections 26 to 37** of the OSFI Act.
- The Superintendent of Financial Institutions has the authority to initiate administrative proceedings and impose penalties.
- The process is **administrative**, meaning it does not require a court trial — it is a faster, more efficient method of enforcement.

---

### **6. Repeal Clause**
- The Regulations contain a **"Repeal" clause**, indicating that prior versions of these regulations (or related provisions) are being superseded or replaced by this current version.
- This ensures regulatory clarity and prevents overlapping or outdated rules.

---

### **7. Effective Date**
- The Regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication.

---

### **8. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Asset-Based Penalties** | Penalties increase with the size of the institution, reflecting the greater systemic risk posed by larger institutions. |
| **Tiered Classification** | Allows for proportionality — smaller institutions face lower penalties, aligning with their scale and risk profile. |
| **Proportionality in Ongoing Violations** | Prevents excessive penalties for prolonged breaches by capping the daily penalty at $5,000 (in the example). |
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Enables OSFI to respond quickly to compliance issues without resorting to litigation. |
| **Reference-Only Short Forms** | Enhances readability and ease of use for regulators and institutions, without legal force. |

### **9. Regulatory Context**
These Regulations are part of a broader framework designed to:
- Ensure **prudential stability** of the financial system.
- Promote **compliance** with regulatory requirements.
- Encourage **self-correction** by financial institutions through clear, predictable penalties.

They support the OSFI’s mandate to protect the financial system and maintain public confidence by enforcing adherence to rules related to:
- Capital adequacy
- Risk management
- Recordkeeping
- Reporting obligations
- Prudential agreements

### **Conclusion**

The **Administrative Monetary Penalties (OSFI) Regulations** provide a structured, proportionate, and enforceable mechanism for addressing non-compliance by financial institutions. By linking penalties to the size of the institution and the nature of the violation, the regulations promote fairness, deter misconduct, and support financial stability. The inclusion of a mechanism for reducing penalties in cases of prolonged minor violations ensures that enforcement remains practical and proportionate, avoiding disproportionate punishment for ongoing but not severe breaches.

These Regulations are a key component of Canada’s financial regulatory framework, reinforcing accountability and compliance within the financial sector.
