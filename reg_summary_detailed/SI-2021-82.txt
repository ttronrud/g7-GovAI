The regulation you have referenced is a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities under Canadian federal law, specifically:

**Regulation: S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**  
**Statutory Authority:** Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (R.S., c. P-34)  
**Provision:** Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act  

---

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the authority to reassign or transfer control and supervision of certain parts of the federal public administration. This power allows for structural realignments within the federal government to improve efficiency, accountability, or policy coherence.

#### **2. Subject of the Transfer**
The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of a specific component of the federal public administration:  
👉 **The Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)**

This secretariat is a key institution responsible for supporting and managing the operations of the **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference (CIC)** — a formal mechanism through which federal, provincial, and territorial governments coordinate on policy issues, particularly those involving shared responsibilities such as health, education, infrastructure, and natural resources.

#### **3. Pre-Transfer Ownership**
Prior to this transfer, the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada** held the control and supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat.  
- The President of the Privy Council is a constitutional officer who traditionally serves as a senior figure in the federal executive, often acting as a ceremonial or coordinating role in government operations.  
- In this case, the CICS was under the administrative oversight of this office, which may have reflected its historical role in intergovernmental coordination.

#### **4. Post-Transfer Ownership**
As of the date of the regulation (effective upon publication in *Supplement to the Canada Gazette*, 2003), the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** is now responsible for the control and supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat.

This shift is significant because:
- It reflects a strategic realignment of intergovernmental affairs within the federal government.
- It places the secretariat under a minister responsible for **infrastructure and communities**, suggesting that the CICS is now more directly involved in policy areas related to infrastructure development, regional planning, and community services — which are core responsibilities of that ministry.

#### **5. Purpose and Implications**
The transfer is intended to:
- Improve coordination between federal and provincial governments on infrastructure and community-related policies.
- Align the administrative oversight of intergovernmental coordination with the minister responsible for the relevant policy domain.
- Enhance accountability and responsiveness by placing the secretariat within a ministry with direct policy and budgetary authority over infrastructure and community development.

#### **6. Legal and Procedural Context**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which enables the federal government to reorganize its public service structure without requiring a new statute.
- The Governor General in Council acts on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, reflecting the political and executive nature of such administrative decisions.
- The transfer does not change the functions or mandate of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat — only the administrative oversight and supervisory responsibility.

#### **7. Historical and Policy Significance**
- The CICS has long played a critical role in facilitating dialogue and cooperation among levels of government.
- By placing it under the Ministry of Infrastructure and Communities, the government signals a strategic focus on strengthening federal-provincial collaboration in areas such as transportation, housing, rural development, and regional economic planning.
- This move may also reflect broader government priorities during the early 2000s, including investment in infrastructure and regional equity.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation represents a formal and legally binding transfer of administrative oversight from the President of the Queen’s Privy Council to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. It restructures the governance of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat to better align with the policy priorities of infrastructure and community development. The change underscores the federal government’s effort to enhance intergovernmental coordination through more targeted and accountable administrative arrangements.

**Note:** While the regulation is not a new law, it is a consequential administrative order that modifies the structure of federal public service responsibilities. It is typically published in the *Canada Gazette* and comes into force upon publication, as is standard for such statutory instruments.
