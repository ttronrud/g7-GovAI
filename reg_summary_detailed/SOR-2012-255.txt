**Detailed Summary of the Oath or Solemn Affirmation of Office Rules (Immigration and Refugee Board)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The **Oath or Solemn Affirmation of Office Rules (Immigration and Refugee Board)** are established under **subsection 161(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)**. This provision grants the **Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)** the authority to make rules governing the oath or solemn affirmation required of its members.

These rules are subject to **approval by the Governor in Council** (i.e., the federal Cabinet, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), ensuring that the rules align with broader government policy and constitutional standards.

The rules were developed **in consultation with**:
- The Deputy Chairpersons of the IRB
- The Director General of the Immigration Division

This collaborative process ensures that the rules reflect both administrative practicality and the values of independence, impartiality, and integrity expected of IRB members.

### **2. Purpose of the Rules**

The primary purpose of these rules is to **establish a standardized, legally binding form of oath or solemn affirmation** that must be taken by:
- The **Chairperson**
- All **other members** of the Immigration and Refugee Board

This oath is required under **section 152.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act**, which mandates that members of the IRB take an oath or solemn affirmation to uphold their duties and obligations during their term of appointment and any re-appointments.

### **3. Content of the Oath or Solemn Affirmation**

The oath or affirmation must be taken in the following form:

> *"I, [Full Name], do swear (or solemnly affirm) that:"*

1. **I will, during the term of my appointment, and any re-appointments, faithfully, impartially and to the best of my knowledge and ability, properly carry out the duties of a (full-time or part-time) [title] of the Immigration and Refugee Board;**

   - This clause emphasizes **loyalty, fairness, and competence** in performing official duties.
   - "Faithfully and impartially" reflects the core principles of public office and judicial independence.
   - The phrase "to the best of my knowledge and ability" acknowledges that members are expected to act with integrity and professional judgment, even when information is limited or uncertain.

2. **I will comply with the Code of Conduct for Members of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, as amended or replaced from time to time;**

   - This ensures that members adhere to a formalized set of ethical standards, including rules on conflicts of interest, confidentiality, conduct in public and private life, and professional behavior.
   - The inclusion of "as amended or replaced from time to time" allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing circumstances or new ethical challenges.

3. **I will not disclose or make known, unless authorized, any matter that comes to my knowledge because I am holding that office.**

   - This clause establishes a **confidentiality obligation**, protecting sensitive information related to immigration decisions, refugee claims, or internal board matters.
   - Disclosure is only permitted with **formal authorization**, reinforcing the need for discretion and trust in the board’s operations.

> *(In the case of an oath, add: So help me [Name of Deity].)*

   - For those who choose to take an **oath** (a religious or traditional form), the phrase "So help me [Name of Deity]" is required.
   - This respects religious freedom and allows individuals to affirm their commitment in a manner consistent with their beliefs.

### **4. Effective Date and Enforcement**

- **Initial Effective Date**:  
  The rules come into force on the day that **Section 17 of the Balanced Refugee Reform Act (BRA)** comes into force.

- **Alternative Effective Date (if registered later)**:  
  If the rules are **registered after the date of the BRA’s coming into force**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision ensures that the rules are implemented in a timely and coordinated manner with broader legislative reforms, while also providing a clear fallback in case of administrative delays.
