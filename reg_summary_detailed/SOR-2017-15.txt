**Detailed Summary of the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Areas Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
These regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision allows the federal government to designate specific marine areas as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to conserve and protect ecologically significant marine features, such as the rare and fragile glass sponge reefs.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Glass Sponge Reefs**: Refers specifically to the naturally occurring, biologically unique reef systems composed of silica-based sponges found within the designated Marine Protected Areas.
- **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**: Designated zones of the sea established under Section 2 of the Oceans Act to protect marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and habitats.

> All geographical coordinates referenced in the schedules are based on the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)** reference system, ensuring accuracy and consistency in mapping.

---

### **3. Designated Marine Protected Areas**
Three distinct Marine Protected Areas are established in **Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound**:

#### **A. Northern Reef Marine Protected Area**
- **Boundaries**: Defined by a series of rhumb lines connecting points **A to L**, as listed in **Schedule 1**, returning to point A.
- **Composition**:
  - **Core Protection Zone**:
    - Seabed, subsoil to 20 meters depth, and water column up to **100 meters** below sea surface.
    - Bounded by rhumb lines from points **1 to 12** (Schedule 2).
  - **Vertical Adaptive Management Zone**:
    - Water column above the core protection zone to the sea surface.
  - **Adaptive Management Zone**:
    - All remaining areas within the Northern Reef MPA not included in the core or vertical zone.

#### **B. Central Reefs Marine Protected Area**
- **Boundaries**: Defined by rhumb lines from points **M to Y** (Schedule 1), returning to point M.
- **Composition**:
  - **Two Core Protection Zones**:
    - **Zone A**: From points **13 to 23** (Schedule 3); includes seabed, subsoil to 20 m, and water column to **120 m** depth.
    - **Zone B**: From points **24 to 32** (Schedule 3); same depth and structure as Zone A.
  - **Two Vertical Adaptive Management Zones**:
    - Water columns above Zones A and B extending to the sea surface.
  - **Adaptive Management Zone**:
    - Remaining areas outside the core and vertical zones.

#### **C. Southern Reef Marine Protected Area**
- **Boundaries**: Defined by rhumb lines from points **Z to EE** (Schedule 1), returning to point Z.
- **Composition**:
  - **Core Protection Zone**:
    - Seabed, subsoil to 20 m, and water column to **146 meters** depth.
    - Bounded by points **33 to 39** (Schedule 4).
  - **Vertical Adaptive Management Zone**:
    - Water column above the core zone to sea surface.
  - **Adaptive Management Zone**:
    - All remaining areas not in the core or vertical zone.

> Each MPA includes the **seabed, subsoil to 20 meters**, and the **water column above the seabed**.

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities**
The following activities are **strictly prohibited** in all Marine Protected Areas:

- Any activity that:
  - Disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes any living marine organism or part of its habitat;
  - Is likely to cause such disturbance or damage.

- Any **scientific research, monitoring, or educational activity** unless it is part of an **approved activity plan** submitted to and approved by the Minister.

> This prohibition underscores the primary objective: to **preserve the integrity and ecological function** of the glass sponge reefs, which are highly sensitive and slow-growing ecosystems.

---

### **5. Permitted Exceptions (Despite Prohibitions)**
Certain activities are allowed under specific conditions:

#### **Fishing**
- Allowed in **adaptive management zones** and **vertical adaptive management zones**, but with strict criteria:
  - **Commercial fishing**:
    - Must use **midwater trawl, midwater hook and line, troll, seine, or gillnet**.
    - Gear must **not enter any core protection zone**.
  - **Recreational fishing**:
    - Must use **midwater hook and line**.
    - Gear must **not enter any core protection zone**.
  - Fishing must comply with:
    - The **Fisheries Act** and its regulations;
    - The **Coastal Fisheries Protection Act** and its regulations.
  - Fishing must not result in damage or removal of glass sponge reefs.

#### **Navigation of Vessels**
- Permitted in adaptive and vertical adaptive management zones if:
  - Conducted in accordance with the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001** and its regulations;
  - **No anchor is dropped into any core protection zone**.

#### **Cable Laying, Maintenance, or Repair**
- Permitted in adaptive management zones if:
  - The activity is not likely to damage, destroy, or remove any part of the glass sponge reefs.

#### **Public Safety, National Defence, National Security, Law Enforcement, or Emergency Response**
- All such activities are permitted without restriction.

#### **Approved Activity Plans**
- Any scientific research, monitoring, or educational activity may proceed only if an **approved activity plan** is submitted and granted by the Minister.

---

### **6. Submission and Approval of Activity Plans**
Any individual or organization may submit a detailed **activity plan** to the Minister for scientific research, monitoring, or educational activities.

#### **Required Elements of the Activity Plan**:
1. Name, address, phone, and email of the applicant.
2. For institutions: Name, title, contact details of the responsible individual.
3. Details of each vessel:
   - Name, registration status, number, radio call sign, and owner/master/operator details.
4. Proposed dates of first entry and final exit; alternative dates if applicable.
5. Geographic coordinates and a map showing the activity location within the MPA boundaries.
6. List of any substances that may be deposited (excluding those authorized under the Canada Shipping Act), including quantity and concentration.
