The provided text consists of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-194, s. 6]"

This indicates that a specific section of a regulation — **Section 6** — was **repealed (cancelled or removed)** by **Regulation SOR/2016-194**, which is a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument) issued in Canada in 2016.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation**: SOR/2016-194  
  This is a regulatory amendment or replacement instrument issued under the authority of a federal statute (likely related to financial services, health, or another sector, though the exact parent statute is not specified in the given text).

- **Section 6**: The specific section of the original regulation that was repealed is Section 6.

- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect as part of the issuance of SOR/2016-194. While the exact date is not listed in the provided text, such instruments typically come into force on a specified date (e.g., January 1, 2017), and the repeal would be effective from that point.

- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal suggests that:
  - Section 6 was outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current policy.
  - It was superseded by new provisions in SOR/2016-194.
  - It may have been a consolidation or restructuring of regulatory requirements, where obsolete rules were removed to improve clarity or alignment with updated standards.

- **Implication**: Any legal obligation, procedural requirement, or rule previously established under Section 6 of the original regulation is no longer in force. Legal or regulatory entities must now refer to the updated or revised provisions in SOR/2016-194 (or other applicable regulations) for compliance.

### Important Note:
The repeated entries (eight times) are likely a formatting or technical error — they do not add new information. Each line is identical, so the summary remains the same regardless of repetition.
