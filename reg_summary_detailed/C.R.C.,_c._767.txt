**Detailed Summary of the Foreign Ports Transhipped Goods Remission Order**

**Order Title:**  
*Foreign Ports Transhipped Goods Remission Order*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes a special remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duty and taxes for certain imported goods that are transhipped from a foreign port to Canada, despite the requirement under the Customs Tariff for direct shipment into Canada. The remission is intended to provide relief in cases where transhipment is unavoidable due to circumstances beyond the importer’s control, and the goods originate in a country that enjoys preferential tariff treatment under the British Preferential Tariff.

### **Key Provisions and Conditions**

1. **Eligibility for Remission**  
   - Remission is granted **only when**:
     - The goods originate in a country that is entitled to the **British Preferential Tariff** (a preferential trade arrangement historically used by the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries).
     - The goods are **not conveyed directly** into a port of Canada as required by **Section 3 of the Customs Tariff**.
     - The transhipment occurs **due to circumstances beyond the control of the importer** (e.g., natural disasters, port closures, transportation disruptions, political instability, or other force majeure events).

2. **Mandatory Evidence Requirement**  
   - The importer must **supply satisfactory evidence** to the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise (now part of the Canada Revenue Agency – CRA) to demonstrate:
     - That **direct shipment into Canada was not feasible**.
     - That the transhipment was **necessary and unavoidable** due to external, uncontrollable factors.
   - Without such evidence, the remission will not be granted.

3. **Scope of Remission**  
   - The remission applies **only to the difference** between:
     - The **customs duty and taxes** that would have been payable under the **British Preferential Tariff** (i.e., the preferential rate applicable to goods originating in eligible countries).
     - The **customs duty and taxes** that would have been payable under the **normal tariff** applicable to goods imported from the **country where transhipment occurred** (i.e., the foreign port of transhipment, which typically has a higher tariff rate).

   - In simpler terms:  
     The remission compensates the importer for the **additional duty and taxes** that would have been incurred if the goods had been imported directly from the transhipping country (which is not a preferential country), rather than from their original country of origin (which is eligible for preferential treatment).

### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Preferential Tariff Protection Preserved**:  
  The regulation ensures that goods originating in countries with preferential tariff treatment are not penalized by being subject to higher duties simply because they were transhipped through another country.

- **Fairness and Practicality**:  
  It recognizes that in real-world logistics, disruptions can occur that make direct shipment impractical or impossible. This provision prevents unjust financial burdens on importers in such situations.

- **No Automatic Remission**:  
  The remission is **not automatic**. It is conditional upon:
  - Compliance with the requirement of "circumstances beyond the importer’s control."
  - Submission of credible, documented evidence to the Department of National Revenue.

- **No Remission for Voluntary or Strategic Transhipment**:  
  If the transhipment is chosen by the importer for convenience, cost, or strategic reasons (not due to force majeure), the remission will **not apply**.

### **Example Scenario**  
A Canadian importer purchases electronics from the UK, which is a country entitled to the British Preferential Tariff. Due to a sudden closure of the UK port due to a storm, the goods must be transhipped via a port in France.  
- Under normal circumstances, the goods would have been imported directly from the UK at a preferential rate.  
- Because direct shipment was not possible due to the storm (an uncontrollable event), the importer submits evidence to the CRA.  
- The remission is granted, covering the difference between:
  - The preferential duty (UK rate) and
  - The higher duty that would apply if the goods had entered Canada from France (non-preferential rate).

### **Conclusion**  
The *Foreign Ports Transhipped Goods Remission Order* is a targeted, equitable provision designed to protect importers from excessive customs liabilities when unavoidable transhipment occurs. It safeguards the benefits of preferential trade arrangements while maintaining the integrity of the customs system by requiring proof of unavoidable circumstances and clearly defining the scope of financial relief available. The regulation emphasizes accountability and fairness, ensuring that remission is not granted arbitrarily but only in legitimate, documented cases.
