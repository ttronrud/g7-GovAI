## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Regulations, 2007**

### 🔍 **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Regulations, 2007* (S.C. 2007, c. 29, s. 73) were enacted under **section 40a of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (F-PFRA)**, which establishes a framework for equitable fiscal sharing between the federal government and provincial/territorial governments in Canada.

The goal is to ensure that provinces receive fair and predictable financial support based on their economic circumstances.

### 📚 **2. Key Definitions (Core Financial and Economic Terms)**

#### A. **Adjusted Number of Litres of Diesel Fuel Taxed at Road-Use Rate**
This metric adjusts the volume of diesel fuel taxed at the road-use rate (e.g., for vehicles) to account for regional differences in fuel use and economic activity.

- **For provinces/territories where road-use tax is not paid year-round**:
  - Based on data from *Statistics Canada’s Report on Energy Supply and Demand in Canada*, or alternative sources if unavailable.
- **For all other cases**:
  - Based on *Sales of fuel used for road motor vehicles* (table 23-10-0066-01), or alternative data if not available.
- **Adjustment factors by jurisdiction**:
  - **Ontario**: Based on diesel sold by farm trucks.
  - All other provinces/territories are adjusted by a multiplier:
    - **Nunavut**: 0.91  
    - **Northwest Territories**: 0.8  
    - **Yukon**: 0.31  
    - **Prince Edward Island**: 0.3  
    - **Quebec / Newfoundland and Labrador**: 0.25  
    - **Nova Scotia / New Brunswick**: 0.15  
    - **Manitoba, BC, Saskatchewan, Alberta**: 0 (no adjustment — zero rate)

> 💡 *Purpose*: To reflect regional differences in fuel consumption patterns and avoid over- or under-representation of diesel use in fiscal calculations.

---

#### B. **Adjusted Number of Litres of Gasoline Taxed at Road-Use Rate**
- Based on gasoline sold for road use (from *table 23-10-0066-01*).
- **Subtraction rule**: If gasoline sold for farm truck use is taxed at road-use rate, that volume is subtracted from the total.

> 💡 *Purpose*: To exclude fuel used in non-road applications (e.g., farm operations) from road-use tax calculations to prevent double-counting or misrepresentation of road vehicle fuel consumption.

---

#### C. **Assessed Market Value of Commercial-Industrial Property**

> 💡 *Purpose*: To measure the economic base of commercial and industrial activity in a province/territory for fiscal equalization purposes.

---

#### D. **Assessed Market Value of Residential Property**

> 💡 *Purpose*: To estimate individual tax liability for fiscal equalization, enabling more accurate revenue comparisons.

---
