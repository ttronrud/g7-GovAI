## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Barbados Double Taxation Agreement Protocol (2011)**

### 📌 **Overview**
This document is a **supplementary agreement** (a "Protocol") that amends the original **Agreement between Canada and Barbados for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital**, signed in Bridgetown on **January 22, 1980**. The Protocol was finalized and signed on **November 8, 2011**, and officially came into force on **December 17, 2013**, as notified by a Canadian Proclamation issued on June 3, 2014.

It aims to:
- Clarify definitions of "resident" for tax purposes.
- Resolve conflicts arising when individuals or entities are residents of both countries.
- Address taxation of gains from the alienation (sale) of property linked to real estate in the other country.
- Improve tax credits and deductions between the two nations.
- Strengthen mutual exchange of tax-related information while respecting privacy and domestic legal constraints.
- Ensure fairness and prevent double taxation in specific scenarios.

## 📚 Key Provisions of the Protocol

---

### 1. **Revised Definition of "Resident" (Article IV, Paragraph 1)**

> **Change:** Replaces the original definition of "resident" with a more precise and comprehensive one.

#### ✅ New Definition:
A person is considered a **resident of a Contracting State** if:
- They are liable to tax in that state due to **domicile, residence, place of management**, or any other similar criterion.
- **Exclusion:** Does *not* include someone who is taxed only on income or capital derived from sources within that state.

#### 🔍 Purpose:
- Prevents double taxation of income from domestic sources.
- Ensures that only individuals or entities with broader economic ties (e.g., management, domicile) are treated as residents.
- Clarifies that passive income from local sources does not trigger residency status.

---

### 2. **Residency of Companies and Other Entities (Article IV, Paragraph 3)**

> **Change:** Replaces the old paragraph with new rules for dual residency.

#### ✅ New Rules:
- If a **company is a national of a Contracting State** and is a resident of **both Canada and Barbados**, it is deemed to be a resident **only of the first-mentioned State** (i.e., the state named first in the description).
- For **other persons** (e.g., trusts, partnerships, non-company entities) who are residents of both states:
  - Competent authorities must **mutually agree** on how to apply the Agreement.
  - If no agreement is reached, such persons **cannot claim tax relief or exemptions** under the Agreement.

#### 🔍 Purpose:
- Avoids ambiguity in residency status for multinational entities.
- Prevents tax avoidance through artificial residency claims.
- Promotes cooperation between tax authorities in resolving disputes.

### 3. **Taxation of Gains from Alienation of Property (Article XIV, Paragraph 3 & 5)**

> **Change:** Replaces paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article XIV.

#### ✅ New Provisions:
- **Taxable Gains:** A resident of one country may be taxed in the other country on gains from selling:
  - Shares whose value is primarily derived from **immovable property** (real estate) in the other country.
  - Interests in partnerships, trusts, or entities where the value comes mainly from real estate in the other country.

- **Exception Clause (Paragraph 5):**
  - A **tax on gains** from the sale of property **does not affect** the right of a Contracting State to tax:
    - Gains from property sold by an individual who was previously a resident of the first country.
    - Specifically, if the individual:
      - Ceases residency in one country and becomes a resident of the other.
      - Is treated as having "deemed alienated" the property in the former country.
      - Is taxed in that first country due to the deemed sale.
    - The individual may **elect** to treat the transaction as a **purchase and resale** in the new country, with the repurchase price set at the **lesser of**:
      - The fair market value at the time of deemed alienation.
      - The actual proceeds of disposition in the first country.

#### ⚠️ Exceptions:
- This provision **does not apply** to:
  - Gains that would be taxed in the other country immediately before residency change.
  - Immovable property located in a **third country**.

#### 🔍 Purpose:
- Prevents double taxation when individuals move between countries.
- Provides a **tax election mechanism** to allow smoother transitions and avoid capital gains tax on "phantom" sales.
- Balances tax fairness with administrative flexibility.

### 4. **Double Taxation Relief in Canada (Article XXV, Paragraph 1)**

> **Change:** Replaces the original paragraph with updated rules for Canada.

#### ✅ New Rules:
- **Tax Deduction in Canada:** Any tax paid in Barbados on profits, income, or gains arising in Barbados shall be **deductible** from Canadian tax on the same income.
- **Dividend Credit:** If a Barbados-resident company pays a dividend to a Canadian-resident company that controls at least **10% of voting power**, Canada may allow a **tax credit** for the Barbados tax paid on the profits from which the dividend was drawn.
- **Exempted Income in Canada:** Even if income is exempt from Canadian tax, Canada may still **count it** when calculating tax on other income or capital.

#### 🔍 Purpose:
- Ensures Canadian taxpayers are not unfairly burdened by foreign taxes.
- Encourages investment by allowing dividend credits.
- Provides flexibility in tax calculation despite exemptions.

> ❌ **Note:** Paragraph 4 of Article XXV is deleted — likely to remove outdated or redundant language.
