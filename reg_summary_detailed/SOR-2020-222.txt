### **Overview**

The *Passenger Rail Transportation Security Regulations* are a comprehensive set of rules established under **section 18(2.1)a of the Railway Safety Act** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport. These regulations aim to strengthen the security of passenger rail transportation in Canada by establishing clear obligations for **passenger companies** and **host companies** to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from acts or attempted acts of unlawful interference with rail services.

The regulations focus on **security awareness**, **risk assessment**, **security inspections**, **security planning**, **threat reporting**, and **coordination with government and emergency agencies**—all designed to ensure the safety of passengers, staff, and infrastructure.
