**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:** Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2017-73 and Designation of the Minister of Small Business and Tourism as the Minister for the Small Business Investment Grants Act

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to the authority granted by section 2 of the *Small Business Investment Grants Act* (S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 147).

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2017-73 (February 1, 2017):**  
   The regulation formally repeals Order in Council P.C. 2017-73, which was originally issued on February 1, 2017. This order had previously established or governed the administration of the Small Business Investment Grants program under the *Small Business Investment Grants Act*.  
   - By repealing this order, the government removes the prior administrative framework that governed the implementation of the grants program.  
   - This action effectively supersedes the previous rules and procedures, signaling a change in the administrative structure or policy direction of the grants program.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Small Business and Tourism as the Minister for the Act:**  
   The regulation designates the current **Minister of Small Business and Tourism** as the official Minister responsible for administering and overseeing the *Small Business Investment Grants Act* for all purposes under that legislation.  
   - This designation means that the Minister of Small Business and Tourism now has the legal and administrative authority to:
     - Approve grant applications,
     - Make decisions on funding allocations,
     - Issue directions or guidelines related to the program,
     - Report to Parliament on program performance,
     - And otherwise fulfill the ministerial responsibilities defined in the Act.
   - The designation is made under section 2 of the Act, which provides for the appointment of a Minister to carry out the Act’s functions.

3. **Legal Basis:**  
   The authority to repeal and designate is derived from **section 2 of the Small Business Investment Grants Act**, which defines the role of the Minister and allows for the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to appoint or designate the relevant Minister.

4. **Purpose and Implications:**  
   - The repeal of P.C. 2017-73 suggests a policy or administrative refresh of the grants program, possibly to modernize procedures, improve accountability, or align the program with current economic priorities.  
   - The designation of the Minister of Small Business and Tourism reflects a strategic decision to centralize oversight of small business investment grants under a portfolio that directly supports small business development and tourism—both of which are key economic drivers.  
   - This move strengthens the integration of small business support with broader economic development goals, particularly in regions where tourism and local enterprises intersect.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation marks a formal update to the governance of the Small Business Investment Grants program. It removes outdated administrative provisions (P.C. 2017-73) and assigns the responsibility for the program to the Minister of Small Business and Tourism. This streamlines decision-making, enhances accountability, and aligns the program with current government priorities in supporting small business growth and economic development.

**Note on Terminology:**  
- "Queen’s Privy Council for Canada" is a formal body of senior officials and ministers who advise the Crown. The designation of the Minister as a member of this council is a procedural formality and does not alter the ministerial role in practice.  
- The regulation is published as a statutory instrument (SI/2017-7), indicating it is a secondary piece of legislation that implements or modifies primary legislation.
