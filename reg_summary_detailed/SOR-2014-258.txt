**Detailed Summary of the Railway Operating Certificate Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Railway Operating Certificate Regulations* were made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, under **section 17.9a of the Railway Safety Act** (R.S., c. 32 (4th Supp.), S.C. 2012, c. 7, s. 12). These regulations establish the requirements for issuing, varying, and managing **railway operating certificates** in Canada. The regulations are designed to ensure that all railway operators — whether full-service railway companies or local operators — meet rigorous safety standards, particularly in areas such as employee fitness, equipment safety, rule compliance, and operational management.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **"Rule"** refers to any safety rule that has been formally approved by the Minister of Transport under **section 19 of the Railway Safety Act**. This ensures that only recognized, vetted safety procedures are used in operations.

---

### **Applicability of the Regulations**

The regulations apply to two main types of applications:

1. **Applications for the issuance of a railway operating certificate** authorizing a **railway company** to operate and maintain a railway.
2. **Applications for the issuance of a railway operating certificate** authorizing a **local railway company** to operate railway equipment on a railway.
3. **Applications for variation** (amendments) of an existing certificate.

Sections 4 and 5 govern the first type; Sections 7 and 8 govern the second. The rules for variation are outlined in a separate section.
