**Detailed Summary of the New Brunswick Egg Order**

---

**Title of the Regulation:**  
*New Brunswick Egg Order*

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *New Brunswick Egg Order*.

---

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout the document:

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Natural Products Control Act of New Brunswick* (Loi). This Act provides the legal framework under which the Commodity Board operates, particularly in regulating the production, marketing, and trade of natural products, including eggs.

2. **"Commodity Board"**  
   Refers to the *New Brunswick Egg Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), a government body established under the Natural Products Control Act. Its primary role is to oversee and regulate the marketing of eggs produced in New Brunswick, particularly in interprovincial and export markets.

3. **"Egg"**  
   Defined as "the egg of a hen produced in New Brunswick." This establishes a geographic and species-specific definition, ensuring that only eggs originating within the province are subject to the Board’s regulatory and levy mechanisms.

4. **"Hen"**  
   Defined as "the hen of any class of the domestic chicken belonging to the species *Gallus Domesticus*." This ensures that only domestic chickens (not wild or exotic species) are considered in the context of egg production and regulation.

### **Core Authority Granted to the Commodity Board**

The central provision of the Order grants the Commodity Board significant powers related to the **marketing of eggs**, particularly in **interprovincial and export trade**.

#### **1. Power to Fix, Impose, and Collect Levies or Charges**
- The Board is authorized to:
  - **Fix** levies or charges (e.g., taxes, fees, or surcharges)
  - **Impose** these levies or charges
  - **Collect** them from individuals or businesses engaged in the marketing of eggs within New Brunswick

#### **2. Classification of Marketers into Groups**
- The Board may **classify** marketing entities (e.g., processors, distributors, exporters) into different **groups** based on factors such as size, volume of sales, type of operation, or market reach.
- Each group may be assigned **different levy or charge amounts**, allowing for a tiered or differentiated system that reflects varying levels of market activity or capacity.

#### **3. Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:
- **Creation of reserves** (financial buffers to manage market fluctuations)
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, marketing, logistics)
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to:
  - The sale or disposal of eggs
  - Market downturns or unexpected supply-demand imbalances
- **Equalization or adjustment of earnings** among egg producers
  - This ensures that producers who may have experienced lower sales or income due to market conditions can receive financial compensation or support
  - The equalization is applied **during specific periods or timeframes** as the Board determines appropriate

### **Note on Historical Context**

- The original provision in the Order that granted the Board authority to "make orders fixing, imposing and collecting levies or charges" was **repealed** by *SOR/80-90* (Statutory Order 80-90).  
- However, the **current version of the Order retains the authority** in a revised or reactivated form, indicating that the Board's powers have been restored or restructured over time.

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The regulation serves several key economic and agricultural policy goals:

1. **Market Stability**  
   By creating a system of levies and reserves, the Board helps stabilize egg prices and protect producers from volatile market conditions.

2. **Fair Distribution of Profits and Losses**  
   The equalization mechanism ensures that producers are not disproportionately burdened by market fluctuations, promoting equity among farmers.

3. **Support for Export and Interprovincial Trade**  
   The levy system supports the competitiveness and sustainability of New Brunswick’s egg industry in broader Canadian and international markets.

4. **Financial Sustainability of the Marketing Board**  
   Revenue from levies funds the Board’s operations and enables it to act as a financial intermediary between producers and consumers.

### **Conclusion**

The *New Brunswick Egg Order* empowers the New Brunswick Egg Marketing Board to implement a structured, equitable, and market-responsive system for managing egg marketing. By classifying marketers into groups and imposing tiered levies, the Board can generate revenue that supports both operational needs and producer welfare—particularly during periods of market volatility. The use of collected funds for reserves, loss compensation, and equalization ensures that the egg industry remains financially resilient and fairly structured within the province’s agricultural economy.

> **Note:** While the original authority was repealed in 1980, its current existence in this Order suggests a renewed or re-established role for the Board in egg marketing policy, reflecting ongoing recognition of the need for regulatory oversight in agricultural commodities.
