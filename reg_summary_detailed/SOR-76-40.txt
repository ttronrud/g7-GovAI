**Detailed Summary of the Astoria River Water Power Regulations**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
The *Astoria River Water Power Regulations* are a set of administrative rules issued under the authority of the **Dominion Water Power Act**. These regulations extend the operational rights of a water power development project located on the **Astoria River within Jasper National Park, Alberta**, for an additional **20 years**.

The extension was approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to **Section 12 of the Dominion Water Power Act**. This provision grants the federal government the power to issue or extend licenses for water power development in Canada, particularly in national parks or protected areas.

---

### **2. Legal Basis**
- The regulations are enacted under **Section 12 of the Dominion Water Power Act**, which empowers the federal government to extend the term of existing water power licenses.
- The authority to extend the license is exercised through a formal administrative process involving the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, reflecting the federal government's oversight of natural resource development, especially in sensitive or Indigenous-affected regions like national parks.

### **3. Key Definitions in the Regulations**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Licence** | Refers to the *final licence* for the development of water power at the Astoria River site in Jasper National Park, Alberta. This licence was originally issued under **Order in Council P.C. 1958-1039**, dated 24 July 1958. |
| **Licensee** | The entity granted the rights to develop and operate the water power project. In this case, it is **Alberta Power Limited**. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, responsible for overseeing the licensing process and making decisions under the Act. |
| **Regulations** | Refers to the broader *Dominion Water Power Regulations*, which provide the framework for licensing and operational conditions. |

> **Note**: The regulations explicitly state that this extension is *not published in the Canada Gazette Part II*, which may indicate a limited or internal administrative nature, or a delay in official publication due to procedural or policy considerations.

### **4. Key Provisions**

#### **(a) Extension of Rights**
- The licensee (**Alberta Power Limited**) may apply in writing to extend the rights granted under the original licence.
- The application must be submitted **in accordance with subsection 27(2) of the Dominion Water Power Regulations**.
- The application must include the **undertaking required by subsection 27(2)** — this likely involves commitments related to environmental protection, Indigenous consultation, or operational safety, as required by federal water power regulations.

#### **(b) Minister’s Authority to Approve Extension**
- Upon receipt of a valid application and the required undertaking, the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** has the authority to:
  - Grant an extension of the licence for an additional **20 years**.
- This extension is not automatic; it is contingent upon the Minister's assessment and approval of the application and compliance with regulatory conditions.

#### **(c) Exception to General Rule**
- The regulations note that **subsection 27(1)** of the Dominion Water Power Regulations normally restricts the ability to extend licence terms. However, **this restriction is waived** in this case, allowing the licensee to seek an extension under the specific provisions of Section 12.
- This exception underscores the importance of the project and the need for long-term stability in water power development, particularly in a protected area like Jasper National Park.

### **5. Significance and Implications**

- **Environmental and Ecological Considerations**: The Astoria River is located within **Jasper National Park**, a protected natural area. The extension of a water power licence here raises concerns about environmental impact, especially regarding river flow, fish migration, and ecosystem health. The requirement for an undertaking suggests that the licensee must commit to environmental stewardship.
  
- **Indigenous and Regional Stakeholder Concerns**: As the project lies within a national park, and given the role of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, there may be implications for Indigenous communities or land-use rights. The involvement of the Minister indicates that Indigenous consultation and rights may be part of the regulatory framework.

- **Long-Term Energy Planning**: The 20-year extension provides Alberta Power Limited with a stable period to operate and maintain the water power facility, supporting energy reliability and potentially contributing to renewable energy goals.

- **Legal Precedent**: This regulation sets a precedent for how federal water power licences can be extended in sensitive natural areas, balancing energy development with environmental and Indigenous interests.

---

### **6. Limitations and Conditions**

- The extension is **not automatic** and requires formal application and ministerial approval.
- The licensee must meet specific procedural requirements, including submitting a written application and fulfilling the conditions outlined in subsection 27(2).
- The extension is limited to **20 years**, not an indefinite period.
- The original licence (issued in 1958) is now being extended, indicating that the project has been in operation for over six decades — suggesting a long-standing, possibly critical infrastructure role.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Astoria River Water Power Regulations* represent a formal, legally grounded extension of a water power licence for 20 years, allowing **Alberta Power Limited** to continue operations at a site within **Jasper National Park**. While the extension is granted under a specific exception to general licensing rules, it is subject to rigorous procedural and environmental safeguards. The involvement of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development highlights the intersection of federal energy policy, environmental protection, and Indigenous governance in Canada’s natural resource management.

This regulation underscores the federal government’s role in managing water power development in ecologically sensitive regions and reflects a balance between energy needs and environmental responsibility. Future operations will depend on the licensee’s compliance with environmental undertakings and ongoing regulatory oversight.
