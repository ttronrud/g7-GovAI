**Detailed Summary of the "Certain Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 2014"**

---

### **1. Background and Context**

This regulation, formally titled the *Certain Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 2014*, is a Canadian statutory instrument enacted under the **Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (FEMA)**. It serves as a legal mechanism to **block or prohibit Canadian entities from complying with certain U.S. federal regulations** that are deemed to have **adverse effects on Canadian economic interests**, particularly in the realm of international trade and commerce.

The regulation is grounded in two key U.S. legal provisions:

- **Section 313 of Title 23 of the United States Code**  
  This section establishes a framework for the **environmental review of certain federal highway projects**, including requirements for environmental assessments and public participation. It mandates that federal agencies conduct environmental reviews for major transportation projects, including those involving alterations or improvements to infrastructure.

- **Section 410 of Part 635 of Title 23 of the United States Code**  
  This section governs **environmental standards for the construction and modification of highways and transportation infrastructure**, including requirements for pollution control, noise mitigation, and habitat protection. It is part of the broader National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) framework and applies to federal projects.

These U.S. provisions are considered **extraterritorial**—meaning they apply beyond U.S. borders when they affect activities or decisions made in foreign jurisdictions, such as Canada.

### **2. Canadian Concerns and Legal Basis**

The **Attorney General of Canada**, in consultation with the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, concluded that:

- The U.S. provisions in question (Sections 313 and 410) **could negatively impact significant Canadian interests**, especially in international trade and commerce.
- Canadian businesses operating in whole or in part within Canada may be required to comply with these U.S. environmental standards when bidding on or carrying out projects involving U.S. federal infrastructure.
- Such compliance could **create undue burdens, distort market competition, or lead to increased costs** for Canadian firms, particularly in sectors such as construction, engineering, and transportation.

Under **paragraph 5(1)(b)(a) of the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act**, Canada has the authority to **prohibit or restrict compliance** with foreign extraterritorial measures that are likely to harm Canadian economic interests.

### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **Section 1 – Prohibition of Compliance**
> It is prohibited for any person in Canada to comply with:
> - Section 313 of Title 23 of the U.S. Code  
> - Section 410 of Part 635 of Title 23 of the U.S. Code  
> - Any directive, instruction, intimation of policy, or other communication (from a person in a position to influence U.S. policy) that supports or promotes the application of those provisions  
> - Including any such requirements in **tender documents** issued for alterations or improvements to premises leased by the **State of Alaska** from the **Prince Rupert Port Authority**

This means:
- Canadian contractors, consultants, or other parties involved in projects related to Alaska’s leased premises **must not** follow U.S. environmental standards (such as those under 313 or 410) when submitting bids or performing work.
- Even if a Canadian entity has already complied with such U.S. requirements **before** the Order came into force, the prohibition applies **only if further compliance occurs after the Order takes effect**.

#### **Section 2 – Retroactive Application (with Exception)**
> A person who previously complied with a U.S. provision or communication **before** the Order comes into force **violates this Order only if they take further action** after the Order comes into force that constitutes compliance.

This provision provides **a grace period** for past compliance. It ensures that Canadian businesses are not penalized for having followed U.S. environmental rules in the past, as long as they do not continue to comply after the Order is enacted.

#### **Section 3 – Effective Date and Jurisdiction**
> The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the *Canada Gazette*).  
> For the purposes of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, the Order applies **before publication** in the *Canada Gazette*.

This means:
- The Order has **immediate legal effect** upon registration, even before being officially published.
- It applies to all persons in Canada, regardless of where the project is located, as long as it involves the **Alaska leased premises** under the Prince Rupert Port Authority.

---

### **4. Scope and Limitations**

- **Specific Project Focus**: The Order applies only to **alterations or improvements to premises leased by the State of Alaska from the Prince Rupert Port Authority**.  
  This is a narrow, targeted application, not a blanket ban on all U.S. environmental regulations.

- **Exclusions**:
  - The Order does **not** prohibit compliance with U.S. environmental laws in general.
  - It only blocks compliance with **specific provisions (313 and 410)** in the context of **this specific lease arrangement**.

- **No Prohibition on U.S. Domestic Projects**: The Order does not prevent Canadian entities from complying with U.S. environmental standards in U.S.-based projects.

### **5. Legal and Policy Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **To protect Canadian economic interests** by preventing Canadian businesses from being forced to meet U.S. environmental standards that may be disproportionate or discriminatory.
2. **To ensure fair competition** in international trade and infrastructure projects.
3. **To uphold Canada’s sovereignty** in matters of domestic policy and trade, especially when foreign extraterritorial measures may interfere with Canadian business operations.
4. **To maintain Canada’s ability to negotiate and manage international agreements** without being bound by foreign regulatory requirements that are not aligned with Canadian interests.

---

### **6. Significance and Implications**

- This Order reflects Canada’s **assertive stance on extraterritorial regulation**, particularly in trade and infrastructure sectors.
- It demonstrates that **even U.S. federal environmental laws can be challenged or blocked** if they are seen as harming Canadian economic interests.
- It sets a precedent for future Canadian responses to similar U.S. regulations that may impact Canadian businesses or trade.

However, it also raises questions about:
- The **potential for trade friction** between Canada and the U.S.
- The **impact on cross-border infrastructure cooperation** (e.g., port operations, transportation networks).
- Whether such measures could be seen as **protectionist or inconsistent with international trade norms**.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Certain Foreign Extraterritorial Measures (United States) Order, 2014* is a **targeted, legally grounded measure** designed to prevent Canadian entities from complying with specific U.S. environmental regulations (Sections 313 and 410) in connection with a particular infrastructure lease involving Alaska and the Prince Rupert Port Authority.

It is a **practical and legally defensible tool** under Canadian law to protect Canadian economic interests in international trade and commerce, especially when foreign regulations are perceived as creating unfair or burdensome requirements. While narrow in scope, it signals Canada’s willingness to **assert regulatory autonomy** in the face of foreign extraterritorial measures.
