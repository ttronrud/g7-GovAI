- Regulatory responsibilities related to construction, safety, and engineering standards,
- Policy development and implementation in the area of public infrastructure.

#### **6. Legal and Policy Context**

It reflects a shift toward centralized, integrated public service management in response to evolving government needs.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant reorganization of federal public service structures. By transferring key agencies (telecommunications and translation services) and all public works functions to the Department of Supply and Services, and by formally amalgamating the Department of Public Works into it, the government creates a more cohesive, efficient, and responsive department capable of managing both supply chain and infrastructure responsibilities under one unified leadership.

It marks a pivotal step in modernizing federal operations and enhancing the delivery of essential public services.
