The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2016-319, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2016-319, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument (a type of regulatory amendment or legislative notice) issued in Canada in 2016.
- **SOR/2016-319**: This refers to the *Statutory Instrument of 2016, No. 319*, which typically contains amendments or repeals to existing regulations. The specific section (section 1) contains the provision that formally removes the referenced regulation from the legal framework.
- **Number of Repeals**: The entry is listed 24 times, but this repetition is likely due to formatting or technical duplication in the source document and does not indicate multiple distinct regulations being repealed. It is safe to interpret this as a single regulation being repealed multiple times in a list — a common occurrence in legal databases where entries are repeated for formatting or indexing purposes.

### Implications:

- The regulation is **no longer applicable** or enforceable.
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established by the regulation are **no longer in effect**.
- Entities or individuals who previously relied on the regulation must now refer to the current, active version of the relevant statute or regulation, if any.

### Conclusion:

This entry confirms that a specific regulation (not named in the text) was **officially repealed on or before the date of SOR/2016-319**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Statutes of Canada* on June 14, 2016. The repeal was part of a broader legislative update to modernize or streamline the regulatory framework. Since the regulation is now inactive, it should not be referenced in current legal or operational contexts.

> ⚠️ Note: Without the original regulation's title or subject matter, a more detailed summary (e.g., about environmental standards, licensing, or safety rules) cannot be provided. To obtain such details, the original regulation's title or section number would be required.

If you can provide the **title or subject** of the regulation (e.g., "Regulation respecting the use of certain chemicals"), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
