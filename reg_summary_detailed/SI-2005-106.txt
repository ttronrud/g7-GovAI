---

**Background and Context:**  
This regulation, issued under the authority of *section 7(2)* of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24), establishes a formal mechanism by which the Government of Canada transfers a specific amount of money to the Government of Cameroon. The transfer is not a new loan or a grant but a *remittance of a debt that has been forgiven* under international debt restructuring arrangements.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Authority and Legal Basis:**  
   - The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, which is the formal executive authority of the Canadian government.  
   - It is enacted **on the recommendation** of three key federal ministers:  
     - The **Minister of Finance**  
     - The **Minister for International Trade**  
     - The **Treasury Board**  
   - The legal foundation for this action is **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the government to remit funds to foreign governments in specific circumstances—particularly where debt forgiveness is being implemented under international agreements.

2. **Amount Remitted:**  
   - The amount being transferred is **$1,630,000 (US$)**.  
   - This sum represents the **total principal and interest** owed by the Government of Cameroon to the Government of Canada on a loan made through the **Canada Account**.  
   - The Canada Account is a special financial mechanism used by Canada to provide development financing to other countries, often under multilateral or bilateral development agreements.

3. **Nature of the Debt Forgiveness:**  
   - The debt is being **forgiven** under two key international frameworks:  
     - The **Canadian Debt Initiative (CDI)**: A policy framework launched by Canada to reduce the debt burden of developing countries, particularly those facing economic hardship.  
     - The **Paris Club debt restructuring agreement**, finalized in **January 2001** between Cameroon and the Paris Club (a group of major creditor nations that includes Canada).  
   - The Paris Club agreement is a multilateral mechanism where debtor countries negotiate debt relief with their major creditors. In this case, the agreement led to the cancellation of a portion of Cameroon’s outstanding debt, including the Canadian component.

4. **Purpose of the Remittance:**  
   - The transfer of $1,630,000 is not a new financial commitment by Canada but a **formal accounting action** to reflect the forgiveness of a previously outstanding debt.  
   - The government is effectively **removing the liability** from its books and transferring the funds to Cameroon as a result of the agreed debt restructuring.  
   - This action ensures that Canada’s financial records accurately reflect the debt forgiveness and aligns with international financial reporting standards.

5. **Public Interest Justification:**  
   - The Governor General in Council determines that the remittance is in the **public interest**.  
   - This implies that the action supports broader policy goals such as:  
     - Promoting international development and economic stability in developing nations.  
     - Strengthening Canada’s diplomatic and economic relationships with countries like Cameroon.  
     - Supporting global efforts to reduce debt burdens that hinder development and poverty reduction.

**Significance and Implications:**

- This regulation is a **practical implementation** of Canada’s international development and debt relief policy.  
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to **debt relief for low- and middle-income countries**, especially those that are economically vulnerable or politically unstable.  
- The forgiveness of the debt under the Paris Club agreement is part of a broader global movement to reduce the burden of unsustainable debt on developing nations.  
- The action is consistent with Canada’s participation in multilateral debt relief efforts and its role as a responsible global financial actor.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally authorizes the Government of Canada to remit **$1,630,000 (US$)** to the Government of Cameroon to reflect the forgiveness of principal and interest on a past loan made through the Canada Account. The transfer is based on a bilateral agreement with the Paris Club, implemented under Canada’s Canadian Debt Initiative, and approved by the relevant federal ministers and the Governor General in Council. The action is grounded in public interest and supports Canada’s international development and debt relief commitments.

This is not a new loan or investment, but a **debt cancellation**—a significant act of financial support aimed at promoting economic stability and development in Cameroon.
