Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the regulation titled:

---

# **Goods Imported and Exported Refund and Drawback Regulations**  
*(Effective upon coming into force of Section 56 of the Act to Amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff, 1995)*

---

## **1. Overview and Purpose**

These regulations establish the rules governing the **refund and drawback of duties** paid on imported goods that are subsequently exported, or processed in Canada and then exported. The primary objectives are:

- To provide **economic incentives** for Canadian industry by allowing businesses to recover duties paid on imported inputs used in processing or production.
- To promote **efficient use of imported materials** in Canadian manufacturing and processing.
- To ensure **fair and consistent application** of duty relief under specific conditions.
- To align with international trade agreements, particularly the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**.

The regulations are made under authority from several provisions of the **Customs Tariff**, including:
- Subsections 77(3), 79.4(3), 80(3)
- Paragraph 95(1)(d)
- Subsections 100(3) and (5)

They came into effect when **Section 56 of the Act to Amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff (Chapter 41 of the Statutes of Canada, 1995)** came into force.

| (d) | Imported goods processed in Canada and re-exported (excluding textile fabric) |
| (e) | Imported goods directly consumed/expended in processing of exported goods |

> **Note**: The regulations apply only where the goods are processed or used in Canada and then re-exported — not for general consumption or non-exported use.

---

## **4. Conditions for Claiming a Drawback**

An application for drawback may be made **only if** the following conditions are met:

### **General Requirements**

1. **Export or Deemed Export**:  
   The goods must have been **exported or deemed to have been exported** before the application is submitted.

2. **Waiver of Rights**:  
   The applicant must provide a **waiver** from all other parties entitled to a drawback, refund, or remission — effectively giving up their right to claim the benefit.

---

### **Specific Conditions by Goods Category**

#### **(a) Goods under paragraph 89(1)(a)**  
- Must **not be damaged** before export.

#### **(b) to (e)** – General Exported Goods  
- Must **not have been used in Canada** before export (except for display or demonstration)  
- Must **not be damaged** before export

#### **(d) Non-Textile Fabric (under 89(1)(d))**  
- Must be processed in **the same plant** as the domestic or imported goods of the **same class** that were processed and exported  
- Export must occur **within two years** of the release of the imported goods

#### **(e) Textile Fabric (under 89(1)(d))**  
- Must be processed into textile goods by the **same processor** who processed the same quantity of domestic or imported textile fabric of the same class  
- Exported textile goods must be exported **within two years** of release of imported fabric

#### **(e) Goods under 89(1)(e)** – Consumed/Expended in Processing  
- Must be **directly consumed or expended** in processing the same quantity of domestic or imported goods of the same class  
- Export must occur **within two years** of release of the imported goods

---

## **5. Who Can Claim a Drawback?**

- Any person who is:
  - Importer or exporter of the goods
  - Processor, owner, or producer of the goods
  - Between the time of direct shipment to Canada and export or deemed export

> **Exception**: For goods under **Section 10**, only the **importer** may claim a drawback.

---

## **6. Time Limits for Applications**

- For **spirits, wine, or beer** under paragraph 89(1)(b), an application for drawback must be made **within five years** of the date the goods were released.

---

## **7. "Same Class" Determination**

This is a key concept in determining eligibility.

### **General Rule (paragraphs 89(1)(d) and (e))**  
Two goods are of the **same class** if:
- They are **interchangeable** in processing; or
- They are **directly consumed or expended interchangeably** in processing

### **Textile Fabric Specific Rule**  
Domestic and imported textile fabrics are considered the same class if:
1. Both are composed of fibres within **one class** listed in **Schedule I**  
   OR  
2. Fibres fall outside a class in Schedule I, **but**:
   - The class containing fibres of the domestic fabric is also a class in the imported fabric  
     OR  
   - The class represents **less than 5%** of the domestic fabric's weight  
     AND  
   - The **difference in percentage** between the proportion of that class in each fabric does **not exceed 33 percentage points**

> Example: If domestic fabric is 60% cotton and imported is 50% cotton, and both fall under "cotton class," they are considered the same class. If one has 40% and the other 70%, the difference is 30% → acceptable.

---

## **8. Conditions for "Same Condition" (Paragraph 89(1)(a))**

Imported goods are considered in the **same condition** if:
- They undergo processes under **Article 2.5 of CUSMA** (e.g., reprocessing, modifications) that **do not materially alter** their characteristics  
- Used for:
  - Development or production of export goods (not plant equipment)
  - Display or demonstration
- In the case of **reusable containers**, used in international transportation

> This ensures that goods are not "devalued" by minor changes during processing.

---

## **9. Prohibitions on Drawback Claims**

Drawback **shall not be granted** in the following cases:

| Case | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **(d) Domestic goods processed before imported goods** | If domestic goods were processed prior to imported goods, drawback is denied |
| **(e) Domestic goods consumed/expended before imported goods** | If domestic goods were consumed before imported goods, drawback is denied |
| **(c) or (e) Goods listed in Schedule III** | Goods listed in Schedule III (e.g., certain military or sensitive goods) are excluded |
| **(d) Spirits, wine, or beer** | Drawback is not allowed for imported spirits, wine, or beer under paragraph 89(1)(d) |

> These exclusions prevent abuse and protect national security or sensitive sectors.

---

## **10. Prohibitions on Refund Claims (Under Sections 21.1 or 21.2)**

For goods subject to **section 21.1 or 21.2** (e.g., duties on certain goods like fuel, plant equipment), a drawback or refund **shall not be granted** if:
- The amount has **already been refunded, remitted, applied, or paid** to the person under the Act or another Act of Parliament  
- The person has **previously applied** for a refund or remission under any other Act

> This prevents double recovery or fraudulent claims.

---

## **11. Refund Rules (Separate from Drawback)**

This Part also governs **refunds** of duties paid on imported goods under **subsection 89(1)** of the Act.

### **Conditions for Refund Claim**

- The goods must **not have been exported or deemed exported** before the application is made  
- Claim may be made by the person to whom the **Minister issued a certificate under subsection 90(1)** of the Act

> Unlike drawback, a refund is available only when goods are **not exported** — meaning it's for goods that remain in Canada.
