### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes a **customs duty remission** (i.e., exemption from paying or recovering customs duties) for specific types of **refractory construction products** used in the production of **metallurgical coke, iron, and steel**. The remission applies only to products falling under **heading 68.10 or 68.15** of the Customs Tariff, which classify refractory bricks, blocks, tiles, and similar materials.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**  
The duty remission applies to:  
- Refractory bricks  
- Refractory blocks  
- Refractory tiles  
- Other similar refractory constructional products  

These products must be used **specifically in the production of metallurgical coke, iron, or steel** — emphasizing their industrial and essential role in heavy manufacturing processes.

---

### **Conditions for Eligibility**  
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Import Date Requirement**  
   The refractory products must have been **imported into Canada during a specific period**:  
   - Starting on **February 1, 1997**  
   - Ending on the **day the Order comes into force**  
   This creates a time-bound eligibility window, limiting the remission to imports made during this period.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   An importer must **file a claim for remission** with the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the date the Order comes into force.  
   - This two-year deadline is critical and sets a clear administrative timeframe for claim processing.

3. **Submission of Supporting Evidence**  
   The importer must provide **such evidence as may be required** by the **Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA)** to verify eligibility.  
   - This could include documentation such as:  
     - Import declarations  
     - Product specifications  
     - Proof of use in metallurgical coke, iron, or steel production  
     - Certificates of origin or use  
     - Records of manufacturing or processing activities  

---

### **Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (typically the Registrar of the Canada Gazette or the Minister of National Revenue).  
- The exact date of registration is not specified in the text but is determined by official government procedures.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**  
- **Economic Rationale**: The remission supports the Canadian steel and metallurgical industries by reducing the cost of essential raw materials (refractory products), which are critical in high-temperature industrial processes.  
- **Targeted Relief**: The regulation is narrowly focused — it does not apply to all refractory products or all importers, only those used in iron and steel production and imported during a defined period.  
- **Compliance and Accountability**: The requirement for evidence ensures that the remission is not abused and is used only for legitimate industrial purposes.  
- **Administrative Burden**: The two-year claim window and evidence requirement ensure that the government can manage and audit claims effectively, while still providing timely relief to qualifying importers.

---

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a **temporary, targeted exemption from customs duties** for refractory construction materials used in the iron and steel industry, effective only for imports made between February 1, 1997, and the date of registration. It is designed to support industrial competitiveness while maintaining fiscal accountability through strict eligibility criteria and a defined claim period. The remission is not retroactive and is limited in scope, duration, and purpose.

This Order reflects a policy of **industrial support through targeted tariff relief**, balancing economic benefits with fiscal responsibility.
