**Detailed Summary of the CCOFTA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *CCOFTA Tariff Preference Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing tariff preferences under international trade agreements, specifically the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement (CCOFTA).

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1) – Provides the legal basis for the regulation's creation.  
  - S.C. 1997, c. 36 – Likely refers to the foundational Customs Tariff legislation or related enabling provisions.

These regulations are a key component of Canada’s implementation of the **Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement**, which entered into force in 2010 and aims to eliminate or reduce tariffs on goods traded between Canada and Colombia.

### **Definition of "Originating" Goods**

In these regulations, the term **"originating"** is defined as meaning that goods **qualify as originating in the territory of a Party (Canada or Colombia)** under the **rules of origin** established in **Chapter Three (Rules of Origin)** of the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, signed on **November 21, 2008**.

- This definition is central to determining whether a good is eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the CCOFTA.
- The rules of origin determine whether a product has sufficient value addition or transformation in either Canada or Colombia to be considered "originating," thus qualifying for reduced or zero tariffs upon importation into the other country.

### **Eligibility for Colombia Tariff Preference (Paragraph 24(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff)**

Goods exported from Colombia to Canada are entitled to the benefit of the **Colombia Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff treatment) under **paragraph 24(1)(b)** of the Customs Tariff **if** the following conditions are met:

#### **Scenario 1: Goods Shipped Directly to Canada (No Third Country Transit)**

If the goods are shipped directly from Colombia to Canada **without passing through any other country**, they qualify for preferential treatment **if**:

- The shipment is made via a **through bill of lading**, or  
- The shipment is **not** via a through bill of lading, **but** the importer provides, **when requested by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Clearly shows the **shipping route**;
  - Identifies **all points of shipment and transhipment** prior to entry into Canada.

> This ensures transparency and traceability of the shipment path, even in the absence of a through bill of lading.

#### **Scenario 2: Goods Shipped Through Another Country (Transit)**

If the goods are shipped **through another country** (i.e., transit), they may still qualify for preferential treatment **if**:

- The importer provides, **when requested by a customs officer**, **documentary evidence** that:
  - Shows the **full shipping route** and **all points of shipment and transhipment** before entry into Canada; **and**
  - A **copy of the customs control documents** is provided that demonstrates the goods **remained under customs control** throughout their stay in the transit country.

> This requirement ensures that the goods were not illegally diverted or re-exported, and that they were properly monitored by the customs authorities of the transit country.

> The requirement of customs control documentation is critical — it verifies that the goods were not subject to unauthorized processing or removal from the customs regime during transit.

### **Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 35 of the Canada–Colombia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (Chapter 4 of the Statutes of Canada, 2010) comes into force.
- However, **if the regulations are registered (published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This provision provides a clear mechanism for implementation timing, ensuring that the rules are activated in alignment with the broader legislative framework of the CCOFTA Implementation Act.

### **Note on Enforcement and Historical Context**

- **Note**: These regulations were in force as of **August 15, 2011**, and are referenced in **SI/2011-55** (Statutory Instrument 2011-55).
- This date reflects the official publication and coming into force of the regulations in the Canada Gazette, marking their operational status in Canadian customs administration.

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve to:

1. **Enable preferential tariff treatment** for Colombian-origin goods entering Canada, consistent with the goals of the CCOFTA.
2. **Ensure compliance with rules of origin** by requiring verifiable documentation.
3. **Prevent fraud or abuse** of tariff preferences by requiring proof of actual shipping routes and customs control during transit.
4. **Facilitate trade** between Canada and Colombia by reducing trade barriers for qualifying goods.
