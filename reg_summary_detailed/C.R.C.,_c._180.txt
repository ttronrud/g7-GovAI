**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Chicken Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Ontario Chicken Order* and may be cited as such. This document establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of chickens within Ontario, particularly in interprovincial and export contexts.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **Act**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (French: *Loi*). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the regulation of farm products, including chickens, and enables the creation of marketing plans and oversight mechanisms.  

- **Board**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (French: *Régie*). This is a provincial regulatory body established under the Act with the mandate to oversee and regulate the marketing of farm products, including chickens, both within Ontario and in interprovincial and export markets.  

- **Chicken**: Defined as a chicken or any class or part thereof that:  
  - Is produced from the egg of a domestic hen;  
  - Is less than six months of age;  
  - Was produced in the Province of Ontario.  
  This definition ensures that only chickens meeting specific age and origin criteria are included in the scope of the Order.  

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Ontario Chicken Producers’ Marketing Board* (French: *Office de commercialisation*). This body is specifically dedicated to the marketing of chickens and operates under the same legal authority as the Board. It represents producers and is responsible for implementing marketing strategies tailored to the Ontario chicken industry.  

- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan for chickens established and amended over time under the *Farm Products Marketing Act*. This includes both the original plan and any subsequent amendments, as well as any regulations made to implement or adapt the plan. The Plan serves as the operational blueprint for how chickens are marketed, priced, and distributed.

**3. Regulatory Authority and Powers**  

The *Ontario Chicken Order* grants both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** broad regulatory powers in relation to the marketing of chickens. Specifically:  

- **Interprovincial and Export Trade Regulation**: Both bodies are authorized to regulate the marketing of chickens in transactions that occur outside Ontario — including sales to other provinces and international exports.  

- **Application of Local Powers**: For the purposes of regulating interprovincial and export trade, the Board and the Commodity Board may exercise all or any powers that they currently have over the local marketing of chickens within Ontario. This includes, but is not limited to:  
  - Setting marketing standards;  
  - Establishing pricing mechanisms;  
  - Regulating quality and labeling;  
  - Enforcing compliance with marketing rules;  
  - Administering quotas or volume controls;  
  - Managing marketing agreements or contracts.  

This provision ensures consistency and continuity in regulatory application — meaning that the rules governing local chicken marketing (as set out in the Act and the Plan) can be directly applied to out-of-province and export markets, preventing regulatory gaps or inconsistencies.

**4. Purpose and Significance**  

The Ontario Chicken Order aims to:  
- Provide a stable and fair market for Ontario-produced chickens;  
- Protect producers from market volatility and unfair competition;  
- Ensure transparency and consistency in marketing practices across domestic and international markets;  
- Support the economic viability of Ontario’s chicken industry by enabling coordinated marketing strategies.  

By allowing the Board and Commodity Board to apply local marketing rules to interprovincial and export trade, the Order strengthens market integrity and ensures that Ontario producers receive fair treatment in national and global markets.

**Conclusion**  
The *Ontario Chicken Order* is a critical piece of regulatory legislation that enables the Farm Products Marketing Board and the Ontario Chicken Producers’ Marketing Board to effectively manage the marketing of Ontario-produced chickens. It establishes clear definitions, outlines the scope of regulatory authority, and ensures that marketing standards are uniformly applied — both within the province and in interprovincial and export markets. This promotes fair competition, supports producer interests, and contributes to the overall stability and sustainability of Ontario’s poultry industry.
