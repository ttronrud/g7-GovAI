### **5. Pre-Use Notification Requirements**

Before using a jammer, **CSC or Quebec’s correctional authority** must provide a **written notice to the Minister of Industry** containing:

#### **(a) Contact Information**
- A responsible person’s **telephone number and email** for responding to inquiries (day and night).
- Name, title, phone, and email of **every contact person** responsible for jammers and compliance.

#### **(b) Facility-Specific Details (for each facility where jammers will be used)**
- Name and postal address of the penitentiary or correctional facility.
- Whether the jammer will be used **sporadically or continuously**.
- **Radio frequency bands** in which it will operate.
- **Month and year** when use is intended to begin.

#### **(c) For Exemptions Under (b)**  
If the exemption applies to a third party (e.g., a contractor), the notice must include:
- The **name of the person or entity** to which the exemption applies.
- The **locations** where the jammer will be used.

> This ensures transparency and accountability.

---

### **6. Updates and Annual Compliance**

- **Updates** to the information provided under subsection (1) must be:
  - **Notified immediately** if changes occur in (a) or (b) (contact details).
  - **Notified before implementation** if changes occur in (c) or (d) (facility details or usage plans).

- **Annual confirmation** of accuracy must be submitted **by the anniversary date** of the Order’s coming into force.

> This ensures ongoing compliance and accountability.

---

### **7. Notification to NAV CANADA**

**At least 28 days before first use**, the correctional authority must provide **written notice to NAV CANADA** (the national aviation authority) containing:
- Name and postal address of the facility.
- Date when jammer use will begin.
- **Power levels, antenna patterns**, and **radio frequency bands** of the jammer.

> This is critical because jammers can interfere with aviation communications.

#### **If Changes Are Expected**
A **new notice must be sent at least 14 days before**:
- The first use of the jammer, or  
- The implementation of a change in operation (if already used).

> **Exception**: If the change only affects (c) (frequency or duration), and does **not increase interference**, no new notice is required.

  - The **minimum duration** required

> This ensures that interference does not extend beyond necessary boundaries.

#### **For Continuous Use**

> This protects external users (e.g., emergency services, public wireless networks).

---

### **10. Technical Analysis and Testing Requirements**

#### **Before First Use and After Changes**
- A **technical analysis** must be conducted for:

- **Measures to restrict interference** in accordance with section 8.

> A **record of each analysis** must be maintained.

---
