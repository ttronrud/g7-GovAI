**Detailed Summary of the Prince George Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Prince George Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development in areas surrounding Prince George Airport, British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the regulation establishes several key technical definitions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Prince George Airport located in Prince George, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A designated geographic point used as a benchmark for elevation and spatial measurements. This point is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 2,230 feet above sea level** for all purposes in these regulations. |
| **Strip** | A 1,200-foot-wide rectangular area of the runway designated for takeoff and landing in specific directions. The relevant runways are: **05–23, 18–36, and 14–32**. These strips are the primary areas of operational concern. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the end of each strip. It is designed to ensure safe aircraft approaches by limiting obstructions. Dimensions vary by runway: |
| - For **Runway 14–32**: 600 ft on each side at the strip end; 2,000 ft on each side at outer ends (200 ft above strip elevation), measured 10,000 ft horizontally from the strip ends. |
| - For **Runway 05–23**: 600 ft on each side at the strip end; 600 ft on each side at outer ends (200 ft above strip elevation), measured 10,000 ft from strip ends. |
| - For **Runway 18–36**: 600 ft on each side at the strip end; 600 ft on each side at outer ends (250 ft above strip elevation), measured 10,000 ft from strip ends. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane that is **the higher of two elevations** at any given point:  
- 150 feet above the ARP elevation (2,230 ft = 2,380 ft), **or**  
- 30 feet above ground level at that specific point.  
This surface serves as the baseline for height restrictions. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane rising from the outer edges of the strip and its approach surface, extending upward and outward until it intersects with the horizontal surface. The slope is defined as **1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally** (a 1:7 slope). This ensures a gradual transition from the runway edge to the horizontal surface. |

> All surfaces (horizontal, approach, transitional) are illustrated and legally defined on **Plan V.003**, dated **February 7, 1967**, which is registered in the **Department of Transport (Ottawa)** and also referenced in the Prince George Land Registry Office.

### **3. Geographic Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Prince George Airport**, as precisely described in **Part II of the Schedule**.

#### **Primary Area of Coverage (Horizontal Surface Limits):**
The horizontal surface forms a large, irregular boundary that encircles the airport and extends outward in all directions. The boundary is described in a detailed, step-by-step **legal description** (commencing at the Northwest corner of District Lot 2094 and proceeding through a series of directional bearings and distances). This boundary defines the **maximum allowable height** for any structure or building.

Key features of the boundary:
- Begins at the **NW corner of District Lot 2094**.
- Proceeds through various lots and land parcels, including:
  - District Lots 2063, 6970, 955, 629, 633, 634, 1547, 1550, 1550A, 1561, 1568, 1569, 1560, 745, 748, 1563.
- Includes the **Fraser River** as part of the boundary.
- Encloses a large area extending north, south, east, and west of the airport.

#### **Excluded Areas (Not Subject to Height Restrictions):**
Certain parcels are **exempt** from the height restrictions. These include:
1. **A specific area bounded by**:
   - Southeast corner of District Lot 628
   - West to the east boundary of Lot 746
   - North to the southeast corner of District Lot 2159
   - Then to the southwest corner of District Lot 955
   - To the west boundary of District Lot 1434
   - To the southeast corner of District Lot 1434
   - Back to Parcel A of District Lot 629
   - To the west boundary of the old Cariboo Highway
   - To the westerly limit of Highway dedicated by Plan 12254
   - To the southwest corner of Lot A of Plan B-7725
   - Then to the northwest corner of Lot A
   - To the southerly boundary of Plan M154
   - To the southwest corner of Plan M154
   - To the northwest quarter of District Lot 627

2. **The Northeast Quarter of District Lot 629**, **excluding**:
   - Lot A of Plan 2643
   - Lots 1, 2, and 3 of Plan 6924
   - Public roads within that quarter

> These excluded areas are **not subject** to the height restrictions imposed by the horizontal, approach, or transitional surfaces.

### **4. Prohibited Development Activities**

**No person may:**
- Erect or construct any building, structure, or object;
- Add any extension or modification to an existing building, structure, or object;

**on any land subject to these regulations**, if the **highest point** of such structure exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **Horizontal Surface** (as defined above)
2. **Approach Surfaces** (for each runway)
3. **Transitional Surfaces** (rising at a 1:7 slope from strip edges)

> This restriction applies **regardless of whether the structure is on private or public land**, including road allowances.

---

### **5. Legal and Administrative References**

- All referenced **planning and land descriptions** are **of record** in official registries:
  - **Plan V.003 (dated February 7, 1967)**: Registered with the **Department of Transport (Ottawa)** and includes the full boundary lines of the regulated area.
  - **Individual land plans (e.g., Plans 2876, 902, 916, 934, 942, 11713, etc.)**: Registered in the **Prince George Land Registry Office**.
- The horizontal surface, approach surfaces, and transitional surfaces are **visually represented** on Plan V.003 and are legally binding.

---

### **6. Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- Maintain **clear flight paths** and **safe visual and physical access** to runways and approach zones.
- Prevent **height-related hazards** to aircraft, particularly during low-altitude operations.
- Provide a **clear, enforceable, and geographically precise boundary** for land development near the airport.

### **7. Key Takeaways**

| Feature | Summary |
|--------|--------|
| **Regulatory Focus** | Height restrictions near Prince George Airport |
| **Applicable Area** | Large zone defined by a complex legal boundary, including riverbanks and major lots |
| **Maximum Height** | Determined by the highest of: horizontal surface (150 ft above ARP or 30 ft above ground), approach surfaces, or transitional surfaces |
| **Runway-Specific Approach Surfaces** | Vary in dimensions and elevation (200 ft, 250 ft) depending on runway (14–32, 05–23, 18–36) |
| **Slope of Transitional Surfaces** | 1 vertical foot per 7 horizontal feet (1:7 slope) |
| **Exclusions** | Specific parcels and public roads are exempt from height restrictions |
| **Enforcement** | Based on land registry records and official plans; violations can lead to legal action or development denial |

### **Conclusion**

The **Prince George Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to protect aviation safety by limiting construction heights near the airport. By defining clear geometric boundaries—through a detailed legal description and referenced plans—the regulations ensure that all development remains within safe operational parameters. The inclusion of both horizontal and approach surfaces, along with transitional zones, reflects a sophisticated understanding of aircraft flight dynamics. Exemptions for certain public roads and parcels allow for practical development while maintaining overall safety standards.

These regulations are a critical component of regional land-use planning and
