**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order (SOR/85-708, 1985)**

---

### **Overview**
The *Alberta Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order*, made under **Section 4** of the *Alberta Potato Order, C.R.C., c. 133*, establishes a regulatory framework for the **fixing, imposition, and collection of marketing levies** on potatoes produced in Alberta that are sold **interprovincially or for export**. This Order was issued on **November 22, 1985**, and may be cited as the *Alberta Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order*.

The primary purpose of this regulation is to ensure that potato producers contribute to the cost of marketing and distribution of their crop when it is sold outside of Alberta or to foreign markets, thereby supporting the stability and sustainability of the provincial potato industry.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Grower**: A person who produces (cultivates) potatoes in the Province of Alberta.  
  *(French: "producteur")*

- **Dealer**: A person engaged in the business of buying, receiving, or selling potatoes within Alberta.  
  *(French: "négociant")*

- **Ungraded Potatoes**: Potatoes delivered by a grower to another person without being formally graded or sorted—except to remove those that are damaged or diseased to the point of being unfit for human consumption.  
  *(French: "pommes de terre non classées")*

> Note: This definition ensures that only potatoes that are safe and fit for consumption are subject to grading, while ungraded potatoes are still subject to levy if sold interprovincially or exported.

---

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Levy on Potatoes Sold Interprovincially or for Export**
- Every **grower** who sells potatoes (in interprovincial or export trade) that are listed in **Column I of the Schedule** must pay a **levy** set out in **Column II** of the same item.
- The levy is calculated per unit (e.g., per 100 kg or per ton) and is based on the type and grade of potatoes involved.

> Example: If a grower sells "Grade A potatoes" for export, the levy amount specified in the schedule applies directly to that category.

#### **2. Reporting and Payment by Growers**
- **Monthly Sales Reporting Requirement**:
  - Every grower who sells potatoes **outside Alberta or for export** (excluding sales to a dealer or a dealer’s agent) must:
    - At the end of each **calendar month**, calculate the total value or quantity of potatoes sold in interprovincial or export trade.
- **Payment Deadline**:
  - The grower must **pay the applicable levy** to the Alberta Potato Commission **on or before the 15th day of the following calendar month**.
  - Payment must be made at the Commission’s office in **Lethbridge, Alberta**.

> This creates a structured, monthly reporting and payment cycle to ensure timely revenue collection and transparency.

#### **3. Levy Collection by Dealers**
- Any **dealer** who purchases potatoes from a grower **with the intent to resell them interprovincially or for export** must:
  - **Deduct the required levy** from the amount paid to the grower.
  - **Pay the full levy amount** directly to the Alberta Potato Commission **on or before the 15th day of the month following the month of sale**.

> This mechanism ensures that the levy is collected even when a grower sells directly to a dealer, and the dealer acts as an intermediary. The dealer bears responsibility for ensuring the levy is properly deducted and remitted.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

- To **recoup marketing costs** associated with transporting, grading, packaging, and distributing Alberta potatoes to other provinces or abroad.
- To ensure **fair and equitable cost-sharing** among producers, especially when their potatoes are sold beyond provincial borders.
- To **support market stability** and provide the Commission with funds to manage infrastructure, quality control, and promotion of Alberta potatoes.
- To **maintain transparency and accountability** through regular reporting and timely payment.

---

### **Legal Basis**
- This Order is enacted under **Section 4** of the *Alberta Potato Order, C.R.C., c. 133*, which grants the Alberta Potato Commission the authority to establish levies on potato production for marketing purposes.

---

### **Practical Impact**

- **Growers** must maintain accurate records of their sales outside Alberta to comply with monthly reporting and levy obligations.
- **Dealers** must implement internal procedures to deduct the levy from each sale and remit it promptly.
- The **Commission** uses collected levies to fund marketing, quality assurance, and industry development initiatives.

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Potato Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export) Order* establishes a clear, enforceable system for collecting marketing levies from Alberta potato producers who sell their crops outside the province or internationally. It balances the need for revenue generation with practical operational requirements by assigning specific responsibilities to growers and dealers, setting defined timelines, and ensuring compliance through transparent reporting and payment mechanisms. This regulation remains a foundational tool in the economic and regulatory framework of Alberta’s potato industry.
