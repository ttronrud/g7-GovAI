### **Detailed Summary of the Cartierville Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially titled: **"Cartierville Airport Zoning Regulations"**.
- It may be cited as such and governs land use, building height restrictions, and spatial boundaries in proximity to **Cartierville Airport**, located in the **Province of Quebec**.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Cartierville Airport**, a designated aviation facility in Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation calculations. Defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the end of a runway strip. The lower end is a horizontal line perpendicular to the runway centerline at the strip end. It extends 350 feet on each side of the centerline of the runway (strip), with a horizontal extent of 10,000 feet from the strip ends. For the outer ends (200 feet above strip elevation), the surface is projected outward at a specific elevation. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane centered on the ARP, located **150 feet above** the ARP’s assigned elevation. However, **exceptions apply** in certain lots (see below). |
| **Strip** | A 700-foot-wide rectangular area of the airport specifically designated for aircraft takeoff and landing in a particular direction. Includes the runway itself. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface. It rises at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally) until it intersects the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. |

> **Note**: The horizontal surface is **196 feet above sea level** (instead of 150 feet) for specific parcels in the **Parish of St. Laurent**, including:
> - Lot 365
> - Lot 365-1
> - Part of Lot 367 (West of CN Railway right-of-way)
> - Lots 369-2, 370-6, 367-110, and 2660

> The **airport reference point is deemed to be 104 feet above sea level**, regardless of actual topographic measurements.

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, that are:
  - Adjacent to or in the **vicinity of Cartierville Airport**
  - Specifically described in **Part II of the Schedule**

> This includes both private and public parcels within a defined geographic boundary, primarily in the **Parish of St. Laurent** and partially in the **Parish of Ste-Geneviève**, County of Jacques-Cartier.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

**No person may construct or erect any building, structure, or object (or add to an existing one)** on any land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of such structure exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of the highest point**:

1. **Horizontal Surface**  
   - Defined by a detailed, winding boundary line that traces a path across the land, forming a large polygonal zone around the airport.
   - The boundary is described in a complex series of bearings and distances, beginning at the **high water mark on the South shore of Rivière des Prairies** and ending at a point on the **Northwesterly boundary of Côte-Vertu Road**.
   - This surface is **150 feet above the ARP** (104 feet above sea level), **except** in the listed lots where it is **196 feet above sea level**.

2. **Approach Surfaces**  
   - Two approach surfaces extend from each end of the **strip designated 10-28**.
   - Each surface extends **350 feet on each side** of the centerline of the strip.
   - The centerline is **100 feet west of the northwestern edge of the existing 150-foot-wide runway**.
   - The outer ends of the approach surfaces are **200 feet above the elevation at the strip ends**, and are measured **10,000 feet horizontally from the strip ends**.
   - The **threshold point** is located **950 feet from the 28 end** of the runway along the centerline.

3. **Transitional Surfaces**  
   - These surfaces rise from the **outer lateral limits** of the strip and its approach surface.
   - They slope at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot up per 7 feet horizontally).
   - They extend upward until they meet the horizontal surface or another transitional surface.
   - Their exact shape and position are defined on **Plan No. M-2460**, dated **January 25, 1963**, held in the Department of Transport (Ottawa).

> These surfaces collectively define the **maximum allowable height** for any structure or object within the regulated zone.

#### **5. Geographic Boundaries and Parcel List**

The regulations apply to a **specific list of lots and parts of lots** located in the **Parish of St. Laurent** and **Parish of Ste-Geneviève**. These include:

- **Lot 37** through **Lot 87**, with numerous subdivisions (e.g., 37-1 to 37-26, 42-7-1 to 42-7-41, etc.)
- Specific sub-lots such as:
  - 78-118-1, 78-119-1, 78-120-1, ..., 78-199, 78-201
  - 82-34 to 82-94, 82-100 to 82-161
  - 87-3 to 87-145, 87-224 to 87-233

> These parcels are **not randomly selected**; they form a **buffer zone** around the airport, especially near runways and approach paths, to minimize visual and operational interference with aircraft.

---

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- To **protect flight paths** and **approach corridors** by limiting the height of structures near the airport.
- To **maintain clear visibility** and **unobstructed airspace** for pilots.
- To provide **clear, legally enforceable boundaries** for land use through precise geometric definitions and elevation limits.

The use of **astronomical bearings** and **specific elevation references** ensures accuracy in alignment with the airport’s runway orientation and topography.

---

#### **7. Key Technical and Legal Notes**

- **Elevation Reference**: The ARP is **set at 104 feet above sea level**, even if natural topography differs. This creates a standardized baseline for all height determinations.
- **Height Limits Are Absolute**: Any structure exceeding the height of the **horizontal, approach, or transitional surfaces** at its highest point is **prohibited**.
- **Applicability to All Structures**: Applies to **new constructions**, **expansions**, and **additions** to existing buildings.
- **Public Road Allowances Included**: Even road rights-of-way adjacent to the airport are subject to the same height restrictions.
- **Historical Basis**: The boundaries and plan (M-2460) are based on **1963 data**, which may require periodic review or update due to land development or changes in airport operations.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are **enforceable by municipal or provincial authorities** responsible for land use planning and zoning.
- Violations may result in **fines, demolition orders, or legal action**.
- Compliance is typically monitored through **zoning inspections**, **building permits**, and **height verification** during construction.

---

#### **9. Exceptions and Variations**

- The **horizontal surface height is increased to 196 feet** in certain lots due to their proximity to the airport and the need for greater clearance.
- These exceptions are **not universal** and are limited to specific parcels listed in the schedule.
- The **approach surface** is only defined for **strip 10-28**, indicating that other runways or strips may have different or less restrictive requirements.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Cartierville Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a **comprehensive and technically precise framework** for controlling building heights near the airport. By defining **three key surfaces** (horizontal, approach, and transitional), using **detailed geographic boundaries**, and applying **elevation-based restrictions**, the regulations aim to:

- Protect aviation safety
- Prevent visual and physical interference with flight operations
- Ensure consistent enforcement across a defined geographic area

The regulation reflects a **proactive approach to urban planning in proximity to airports**, balancing development with safety and operational needs. It remains a critical tool for land use management in the St. Laurent region of Quebec.
