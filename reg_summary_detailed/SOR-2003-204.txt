Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Continuation of Amalgamated or Merged Corporations Regulations**  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue, pursuant to **paragraph 304(1)(o) of the Excise Act, 2001**.  
**Regulation Number:** S.C. 2002, c. 22  
**Effective Date:** July 1, 2003  

---

### **Purpose and Scope of the Regulation**

This regulation serves to **amend or clarify the application of provisions in Parts 5 and 6 of the Excise Act, 2001**, specifically in the context of **corporate amalgamations or mergers**.  

The key objective is to define and prescribe the **"prescribed purpose"** under **section 213 of the Excise Act, 2001**, which governs the treatment of excise tax liabilities and reporting obligations when corporations merge or amalgamate.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Prescribed Purpose for Application of Parts 5 and 6 (excluding Section 213):**  
   - The regulation establishes that **any provision of Parts 5 and 6 of the Excise Act, 2001, other than Section 213**, may be applied to a corporation that has undergone an amalgamation or merger **only for a prescribed purpose**.  
   - This means that the application of these provisions (such as those relating to excise tax administration, reporting, or compliance) is not automatic or broad; it must serve a specific, clearly defined objective.

2. **Definition of "Prescribed Purpose":**  
   - The term "prescribed purpose" refers to a specific, legally defined reason or function for which the application of the provisions in Parts 5 and 6 is justified.  
   - The regulation **does not define the specific purposes** in detail within the text provided — instead, it relies on the government's authority under the Excise Act to prescribe such purposes through formal rules or guidance.  
   - In practice, this ensures that tax authorities can apply excise-related rules post-merger in a way that is **transparent, consistent, and aligned with the intent of the law**.

3. **Exclusion of Section 213:**  
   - Section 213 of the Excise Act, which deals with the **continuation of tax liabilities or obligations** following a merger or amalgamation, is **exempt from this prescribed purpose requirement**.  
   - This implies that Section 213 operates independently and may apply directly to the successor corporation without needing to be justified by a "prescribed purpose."

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- **Clarity and Predictability:** By defining a "prescribed purpose," the regulation provides legal certainty for taxpayers and tax administrators. It ensures that excise rules are applied consistently and only in contexts where they serve a legitimate administrative or fiscal objective.
- **Prevents Overreach:** It acts as a safeguard against the arbitrary or expansive application of excise regulations in post-merger scenarios.
- **Alignment with Corporate Restructuring:** The regulation supports the smooth transition of excise obligations during corporate reorganizations, ensuring that tax compliance is preserved without creating undue burden or ambiguity.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on July 1, 2003**.  
- This date marks the start of their operational application, meaning that all entities involved in amalgamations or mergers after this date must comply with the prescribed purpose framework when applying the relevant excise provisions.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted administrative tool** designed to ensure that excise tax rules are applied appropriately and fairly in the context of corporate mergers and amalgamations. By limiting the application of Parts 5 and 6 (excluding Section 213) to a clearly defined "prescribed purpose," it enhances legal clarity, promotes consistency in tax administration, and supports the integrity of excise compliance during corporate restructuring.

It reflects the government’s effort to balance flexibility in corporate reorganization with the need for regulatory stability and accountability in tax law enforcement.
