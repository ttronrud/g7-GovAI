### **Background and Context**

This regulation addresses two key issues related to the employment of **indeterminate employees** in the Canadian public service:

1. **Re-application of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)** to positions previously excluded under a specific Order in Council.
2. **Exclusion of certain provisions of the PSEA** from applying to specific indeterminate employees facing job displacement due to organizational changes.

The regulation was developed in response to a decision by the **Public Service Commission (PSC)** that applying certain employment protections to certain displaced indeterminate employees would be **neither practicable nor in the best interests of the public service**.

### **Key Provisions and Actions**

#### **1. Re-application of the PSEA to Positions Excluded Under Order P.C. 2012-437b**

- **What it means**:
  - On April 5, 2012, the Government issued **Order in Council P.C. 2012-437b**, which excluded certain positions from the application of the PSEA.
  - This exclusion was intended to allow flexibility in managing workforce changes, particularly in cases involving reorganization or restructuring.
  - This regulation **reverses that exclusion** by formally re-applying the full scope of the PSEA to those previously excluded positions and the individuals currently occupying them.

- **Scope**:
  - Applies to **all positions** excluded under P.C. 2012-437b.
  - Applies to **all employees** currently serving in those positions.
  - Restores the full employment rights and obligations under the PSEA, including protections related to fair treatment, notice, consultation, and job security.

- **Implication**:
  - Employees in these positions now have access to the full suite of employment rights and protections under the PSEA, such as:
    - Rights to reasonable notice of termination
    - Rights to job security and reassignment
    - Rights to consultation and participation in decisions affecting their employment
    - Eligibility for protection against unfair dismissal or arbitrary removal

#### **2. Exclusion of Specific PSEA Provisions from Application to Certain Displaced Indeterminate Employees**

- **What it means**:
  - The regulation **excludes** the application of several specific sections of the PSEA to **indeterminate employees** who:
    - Are appointed or deployed to an indeterminate position
    - Are affected by a **relocation of their work unit**
    - **Do not wish to relocate**
    - Are no longer required due to:
      - Lack of work
      - Discontinuance of a function
      - Transfer of work or function outside the public service
    - **Have not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer**

- **Sections Excluded from Application**:
  - Section 16, paragraph 22(2)(a)(c)
  - Subsection 29(3)
  - Sections 30, 31
  - Sections 39.1 to 48d (a broad range of provisions relating to job security, reassignment, and termination)
  - Subsection 51(4)
  - Section 77e (which relates to the right to a reasonable job offer)

- **Key Excluded Rights**:
  - These sections generally provide **job security**, **protection against dismissal**, **rights to reassignment**, and **protections in the event of workforce reductions**.
  - By excluding these provisions, the PSC is effectively **removing the obligation** to provide reasonable job offers or to offer reassignment in cases where:
    - The employee does not want to relocate
    - The work unit is being moved or dissolved
    - There is no future work for the employee

- **Conditions for Exclusion**:
  - The employee must be an **indeterminate employee** (i.e., not hired for a fixed term or specific project)
  - The employee must be **appointed or deployed** to the position
  - The employee must **not wish to relocate** or have their services no longer required
  - The employee must **not have received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer**

### **Legal Basis and Rationale**

- **Section 20 of the PSEA** allows the Public Service Commission to:
  - Consult with the employer
  - Make decisions about the application of the Act
  - Re-apply or exclude provisions based on practicality and public interest

- **Justification for the Decision**:
  - The PSC concluded that applying the full scope of the PSEA to these displaced employees would:
    - Be **practically unworkable** (e.g., due to lack of available positions or reassignment options)
    - Be **inimical to the operational needs** of the public service (e.g., cost, efficiency, restructuring)
    - Cause **unrealistic expectations** or legal challenges in cases where no suitable alternative roles exist

- **Consultation Requirement**:
  - Prior to making this decision, the PSC **consulted with the employer** (the government department or agency responsible for the work unit), ensuring that organizational realities were taken into account.

---

### **Policy Objectives**

1. **Flexibility in Public Service Restructuring**:
   - Allows departments to restructure work units without being legally bound to offer reassignment or job guarantees in all cases.

2. **Practicality and Efficiency**:
   - Recognizes that in some cases, relocations or functional changes are inevitable, and employees may not be able to accept new assignments or locations.

3. **Avoiding Unnecessary Legal and Financial Burdens**:
   - Prevents departments from being forced to offer job guarantees or reassign employees when no viable options exist.

4. **Balancing Employee Rights with Organizational Needs**:
   - While protecting employee rights generally, the regulation acknowledges that **some employees may be displaced without recourse** under certain circumstances.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **pragmatic and balanced approach** to managing workforce changes in the Canadian public service. It:

- **Restores full employment protections** to employees in positions previously excluded under P.C. 2012-437b, ensuring consistency and fairness in employment rights.
- **Excludes certain job security provisions** from applying to displaced indeterminate employees in specific circumstances (e.g., relocation, lack of work), recognizing the practical challenges of reorganization.

While it may reduce some protections for displaced employees, it is grounded in a formal consultation process and justified by the PSC’s determination that such protections are neither feasible nor in the public interest under those specific conditions.

This regulation underscores the **importance of balancing employee rights with organizational flexibility** in a dynamic public service environment.
