**Detailed Summary of the Ross River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

The *Ross River Airport Zoning Regulations* are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt regulations governing airport zoning. These regulations were proposed under **Section 5.5** of the same Act and were publicly published in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette Part I* (January 29 and February 5, 1994), and in two issues of *The Whitehorse Star* (February 3 and 4, 1994), providing interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to submit representations to the Minister.

After public consultation, the regulations were formally adopted and come into effect as a legally binding instrument.

### **2. Name and Citation**

- The regulations are officially titled:  
  **"Ross River Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
  and may be cited as such.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several key terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Ross River Airport, located in the vicinity of Ross River, Yukon Territory. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed point on the airport’s centerline of runway 08–26, located 838.2 meters from the threshold of runway 26. This point serves as the origin for all elevation and distance measurements. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 08–26). These surfaces define safe zones for aircraft during approach and landing. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the elevation of the ARP. However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to 9 meters above ground. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the landing zone, including the runway itself, specifically 90 meters wide and 1,796.4 meters long, centered on the runway’s centerline. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 vertical-to-horizontal ratio, until they intersect the outer surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 703.3 meters above sea level.

### **4. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all land**—including public road allowances—that lies **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, as precisely delineated in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

The outer boundary of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the Airport Reference Point (ARP). This creates a zone of influence extending 4 kilometers from the airport's central point.

### **5. Core Prohibition – Height Restrictions**

No person may:

- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object (including extensions or additions to existing structures),  
- **If the highest point of that structure exceeds** the elevation limits defined by any of the following three surfaces:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This restriction ensures that aircraft approaching or operating at the airport are not obstructed by tall structures, which could compromise visibility, safety, or flight operations.

### **6. Detailed Description of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway 08 and 26)**

Each approach surface is an inclined plane rising from the end of the strip (runway) at a ratio of **1 meter vertically to 40 meters horizontally** (i.e., 1:40 slope).

- **Horizontal distance**: The plane rises to an imaginary horizontal line located **3,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the strip.
- **Width of the plane**: The outer ends of this horizontal line are **345 meters** from the centerline of the runway.
- **Elevation of the top line**: The imaginary horizontal line is **75 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

> This ensures a safe buffer zone for aircraft during final approach, especially in adverse weather or low-visibility conditions.

#### **B. Outer Surface**

- A horizontal plane set at **45 meters above the ARP elevation (703.3 m)**.
- **Exception**: Where this plane would fall below **9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent unrealistic or unsafe height limits in low-lying areas.

> This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure within the 4,000-meter radius zone.

#### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal), extending from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**.
- These surfaces rise until they intersect with the **outer surface**.
- They serve as a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface, ensuring a consistent and safe height gradient.

#### **D. Strip (Runway 08–26)**

- **Length**: 1,796.4 meters  
- **Width**: 90 meters (45 meters on each side of the centerline)  
- This is the main operational area of the airport where aircraft take off and land.

### **7. Visual and Spatial Reference**

All defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, and strip) are based on the **Ross River Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2995**, dated **December 30, 1992**. This plan serves as the authoritative spatial and dimensional reference for the regulation.

The plan includes:

- The location of the ARP
- The dimensions and orientation of the strip
- The slopes and extents of the approach and transitional surfaces
- The outer boundary (4,000-meter circle)

Thus, the regulation is not arbitrary—it is grounded in a professionally developed and approved zoning plan.

### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**: To prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
2. **Visibility and Navigation**: To maintain unimpeded visibility for pilots, especially during low-visibility or night operations.
3. **Environmental and Operational Integrity**: To preserve the functional integrity of the airport and its surrounding airspace.
4. **Public and Private Land Use Management**: To guide land development in the vicinity of the airport, ensuring that structures do not interfere with aviation operations.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are enforceable by the **Minister of Transport**.
- Any individual or entity constructing or modifying a structure within the regulated zone must ensure that **no part of the structure exceeds the height limits** defined by the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces.
- Violations could result in legal action, including demolition or fines, depending on enforcement policies.

### **Conclusion**

The *Ross River Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive and science-based framework for land use around Ross River Airport. By defining precise elevation and spatial boundaries—through approach surfaces, outer surfaces, and transitional surfaces—the regulations ensure that aviation safety remains the top priority in the development and use of land near the airport. The regulation is both technically detailed and legally grounded, reflecting a balance between public development and the operational needs of a critical aviation facility.

These rules are a vital component of Canada’s national aviation safety infrastructure and serve as a model for similar airport zoning regulations in remote or high-altitude regions.
