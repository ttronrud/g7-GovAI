**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2017-4 and Designation of the Minister of Status of Women as a Member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada

**Date of Issuance:**  
January 10, 2017 (original Order in Council), with the repeal and designation occurring under a subsequent statutory instrument.

**Legal Authority:**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **National Health and Welfare Vote No. 65** of the **Schedule to Appropriation Act No. 3, 1976** (S.C. 1974–75–76, c. 102). This legislative framework grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) the power to make orders related to the administration of federal programs, including those under the Department of Health and Welfare—specifically those concerning women’s issues.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2017-4 (January 10, 2017):**  
   The regulation formally repeals the previously issued Order in Council P.C. 2017-4. This earlier order had likely established or maintained a prior structure or designation for the coordination of women’s policy, possibly including a specific body, committee, or administrative mechanism. By repealing it, the government removes the previous legal framework, effectively ending its provisions and any associated administrative functions.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Status of Women as a Member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada:**  
   The regulation designates the **Minister of Status of Women** as a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**. This is a formal and constitutional designation that grants the minister a status within the federal government’s highest policy and advisory body.

   - **Purpose of the Designation:**  
     This designation empowers the Minister of Status of Women to:
     - Co-ordinate federal policy related to the status of women across government departments and agencies.
     - Serve as a central point of authority and accountability in advancing gender equality, women’s rights, and gender-based programming.
     - Participate in high-level policy discussions, including those involving the Cabinet and the Privy Council, to ensure that gender equity considerations are integrated into broader national policy development.

   - **Administrative Role:**  
     The Minister is also tasked with administering programs and initiatives related to the status of women. This includes oversight of funding, program delivery, and monitoring of outcomes in areas such as:
     - Gender-based violence
     - Women in leadership and employment
     - Access to education and healthcare
     - Indigenous women’s issues
     - Family and child well-being

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Policy Strengthening:** The designation enhances the visibility, authority, and institutional standing of women’s policy within the federal government.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination:** By placing the Minister on the Privy Council, the government signals a commitment to integrating gender equality into all levels of decision-making.
- **Accountability and Oversight:** The Minister now has formal standing to represent and advocate for women’s issues in intergovernmental and national forums.
- **Successor to Previous Framework:** The repeal of P.C. 2017-4 indicates a policy reset or modernization of the approach to women’s policy, likely to streamline governance or reflect evolving priorities.

**Context and Background:**

This regulation reflects a broader governmental effort to institutionalize gender equality as a core national priority. The designation of the Minister of Status of Women as a Privy Council member is consistent with Canada’s commitment to advancing women’s rights and equity, as reflected in national policy documents such as the *Canadian Women’s Policy Framework* and the *Gender Equality Strategy*.

It also aligns with international obligations, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (particularly Goal 5 on Gender Equality), and domestic commitments under the *Equality Statutes* and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation serves as a formal and constitutional step to strengthen the federal government’s commitment to advancing the status of women. By repealing an outdated order and formally designating the Minister of Status of Women as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council, the government establishes a more robust, visible, and authoritative framework for coordinating and administering women’s policy across Canada.

It underscores the importance of gender equality as a cross-cutting issue and ensures that women’s issues are formally integrated into the highest levels of federal governance.

*Note: While the original Order in Council P.C. 2017-4 is not detailed here, its repeal suggests it may have been a temporary or interim arrangement. The current designation is intended to provide a permanent and institutionalized role for the Minister of Status of Women.*
