The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-237, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2015-237, section 1**, which stands for *Statutory Instrument 2015-237, Section 1*. This is a legal instrument issued by the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context) to amend or remove existing regulations.
- **Frequency of Repeal Indication**: The repeated line "[Repealed, SOR/2015-237, s. 1]" suggests that the regulation was formally repealed multiple times or that the repealing provision was applied repeatedly — however, in legal terms, a regulation is typically repealed once, and such repetition may reflect a formatting or data-entry error rather than actual multiple repeals.
- **Legal Implication**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer in force. Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures previously established by the regulation are no longer applicable. Entities or individuals relying on the regulation must now refer to current, active legislation or regulations.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** to summarize because the regulation referenced has been **fully repealed** by **SOR/2015-237, section 1**. The repeated entries are likely a technical or typographical duplication and do not indicate a different or ongoing regulatory provision.

👉 **Final Note**: This regulation is **no longer in effect** and should not be referenced in current legal or operational contexts. For current regulations, one should consult the official legislation database (such as the Canadian Legal Information Institute or the Government of Canada’s regulations portal) and search for the specific subject matter of the repealed regulation.
