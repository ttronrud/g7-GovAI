Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation, which is a **Proclamation issued by the Governor in Council of Canada** under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA), establishing provincial electoral boundaries commissions for the 2011 decennial census.

## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Proclamation: Establishment of Electoral Boundaries Commissions (2012)**

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

- **Governing Legislation**: The proclamation is issued under the *Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act* (EBRA), specifically:
  - **Section 3(1)**: Grants the Governor in Council the power to establish electoral boundaries commissions for each province following a decennial census.
  - **Section 16(1) of the Fair Representation Act (FRA)**: Came into force on **December 16, 2011**, and provides an exception to Section 3(1). It mandates that, if the FRA comes into force *before* the Minister receives the certified census return, the Governor in Council must establish a commission **no later than 60 days after receiving the return**, regardless of the normal timeline.

- **Census Return Received**: The Minister received the certified return from the Chief Statistician of Canada under subsection 13(1) of the EBRA on **February 8, 2012**.

- **Trigger for Commission Formation**: Because the Fair Representation Act had already come into force before the return was received, the requirement under Section 16(1) applied. This **overrode the normal procedural timeline** and required the establishment of commissions within 60 days — a deadline met on **February 21, 2012**.

### **2. Purpose of the Proclamation**

This proclamation formally establishes **electoral boundaries commissions** for each of Canada’s ten provinces to:
- Review and adjust electoral district boundaries based on population changes from the **2011 Canadian census**.
- Ensure **fair representation** in Parliament by maintaining roughly equal population sizes across constituencies.
- Comply with constitutional and legal standards regarding equitable representation and democratic accountability.

---

### **3. Composition of the Commissions**

Each commission consists of **three members**:
- **One Chairperson**
- **Two Other Members**

#### ✅ Appointment Rules (as per Sections 5 and 6 of the EBRA):
- **Chairperson**:
  - Appointed by the **Chief Justice of the province** (e.g., Ontario, Quebec, etc.).
  - In some cases, if a province does not have a Chief Justice, or due to specific circumstances, the **Chief Justice of Canada** may appoint the chairperson.
- **Two Other Members**:
  - Appointed by the **Speaker of the House of Commons**.

> This structure ensures a balance between judicial impartiality and parliamentary oversight.

### **4. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

- **Date of Issue**: February 21, 2012.
- **Publication**: The proclamation was published in the *Canada Gazette*, making it legally binding and publicly accessible.
- **Formal Establishment**: The Governor in Council, by Order in Council P.C. 2012-86, directed that the commissions be formally established and that their members be named as per the attached schedule.
- **Mandatory Notice**: All persons, institutions, and governmental bodies are required to take notice of this proclamation and govern themselves accordingly.

### **5. List of Appointed Members by Province**

The proclamation includes a detailed schedule listing the members of each commission. Below is a **province-by-province breakdown** of the commissions:

| **Province** | **Chairperson** | **Member 1** | **Member 2** |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ontario** | Douglas Colbourne (Toronto) | Leslie Pal (Ottawa) | Mr. Justice Jules Allard (Victoriaville) |
| **Quebec** | Michel Doyon (Québec) | Raymond Hudon (Québec) | Mr. Justice Alexandre Deschênes (Bathurst) |
| **Nova Scotia** | David Blaikie (Halifax) | Louise Carbert (Halifax) | Justice Allan P. Boudreau (Weymouth) |
| **New Brunswick** | Patrick Neil Malcolmson (Fredericton) | Justice Thomas Riordon (Miramichi) | Justice Richard J. Chartier (Winnipeg) |
| **Manitoba** | Kelly Saunders (Brandon) | Paul Thomas (Winnipeg) | Mr. Justice John E. Hall (Vancouver) |
| **Prince Edward Island** | Mr. Justice (ret) Armand DesRoches (Cornwall) | Eugene Murphy (Meadowbank) | Mr. Justice Ronald C. Mills (Birch Hills) |
| **Saskatchewan** | John Courtney (Saskatoon) | David Marit (Fife Lake) | Madam Justice Carole Conrad (Calgary) |
| **Newfoundland and Labrador** | Mr. Justice Keith J. Mercer (St. John’s) | Herbert Clarke (St. John’s) | Julie Eveleigh (Comfort Cove) |

> ⚠️ **Note**: There appears to be a **typographical or formatting error** in the original text — one entry lists "Justice Richard J. Chartier" as a member of the New Brunswick commission, but Chartier is a Manitoba-based judge. This is likely a **mistake in the original document**, and the correct assignment should be:
> - **New Brunswick**: Chair = Patrick Neil Malcolmson; Members = Justice Thomas Riordon & Justice Richard J. Chartier → **This is inconsistent** with the jurisdictional appointments.
> - **Manitoba**: Chair = Kelly Saunders; Members = Paul Thomas & Mr. Justice John E. Hall → **Hall is from Vancouver (BC)**, which is an error.

➡️ **Correction/Clarification Needed**: The original document contains **at least one clear error** in member assignments. For example:
- **Justice Richard J. Chartier** is a judge from Manitoba, not New Brunswick.
- **Mr. Justice John E. Hall** is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, not Manitoba.

Thus, **the appointments in the schedule appear to contain inaccuracies or misalignments** with geographic jurisdiction and judicial roles. These should be reviewed by legal or parliamentary authorities for accuracy.

### **7. Significance and Impact**

- **First Commission Under the Fair Representation Act**: This was the first time the Fair Representation Act (2011) was applied to trigger early commission formation, demonstrating its intent to improve fairness and inclusivity in electoral representation.
- **Population-Based Redistricting**: The commissions were tasked with adjusting electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts from the 2011 census, ensuring that each riding has approximately the same number of voters.
- **Judicial and Parliamentary Balance**: The inclusion of judges (for impartiality) and members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Commons (for parliamentary accountability) reflects a balanced approach to redistricting.
- **Transparency and Public Accountability**: By publishing the appointments in the *Canada Gazette*, the government ensured transparency and public access to the process.

---

### **8. Limitations and Concerns**

- **Errors in Member Assignments**: As noted, several members are listed in provinces they are not legally or geographically associated with. These must be corrected to maintain the integrity of the process.
- **No Mention of Public Consultation or Community Input**: While the Act allows for public consultation, the proclamation itself does not specify whether or how such input was gathered — a potential gap in democratic accountability.
- **Timeline Compliance**: The commission was established within 60 days of receiving the census return, meeting the legal requirement under the Fair Representation Act.

This proclamation is a **legally binding and constitutionally grounded** directive to establish electoral boundaries commissions for Canada’s provinces following the 2011 census. It reflects the application of the *Fair Representation Act* to ensure timely and equitable redistricting.
