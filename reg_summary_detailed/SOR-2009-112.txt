> [Repealed, SOR/2016-172, s. 6]

This indicates that a specific regulation (section 6 of the Statutory Instrument **SOR/2016-172**) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by another legislative or regulatory action.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: Repealed  
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument **SOR/2016-172**, section 6  
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the coming into force of SOR/2016-172, which is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada (typically under a federal department or agency).  
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation referenced in section 6 of SOR/2016-172 was likely a rule or directive that governed a specific area of law or policy—such as licensing, safety standards, environmental protection, or administrative procedures. However, the exact content of the repealed regulation is **not provided** in the text.  
- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when they are outdated, redundant, inconsistent with newer legislation, or superseded by more current or comprehensive rules. The repeal of section 6 suggests that the previous rule was no longer necessary or appropriate in the current regulatory framework.  
- **Legal Significance**: Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer enforceable or legally binding. Any actions or decisions based on it are invalid, and authorities must refer to the current, active regulations in place.  
- **Source**: The repeal is formally recorded in the *Supplementary Orders and Regulations* (SOR), which is the official publication of federal regulatory instruments in Canada.
