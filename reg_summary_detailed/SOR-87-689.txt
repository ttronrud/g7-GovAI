**Detailed Summary of the Special Services (Excise) Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Special Services (Excise) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of National Revenue**, under **paragraph 125(a)** of the *Excise Act* (R.S.C. 1970, c. 15 (1st Supp.), s. 13). These regulations establish the rules governing **special excise services**—specific duties performed by excise officers outside normal working hours or at designated locations.

These regulations may be cited as the **Special Services (Excise) Regulations**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Excise Act*, which provides the legal framework for excise administration in Canada.
- **Authorized Hours**:  
  Defined as the period between **8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.**, excluding **one hour for a meal break**, during any day that is **not a Saturday or a public holiday**.  
  → This establishes the baseline for normal working hours for excise officers.

### **What Constitutes a "Special Service"?**

A "special service" is defined as any service performed by an excise officer at the request of a person in charge of goods subject to excise, **outside the scope of regular duties**. Specifically, the following qualify as special services:

1. **Outside Authorized Hours**  
   Any service performed **after authorized hours** (i.e., outside 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) on the **premises** of:
   - A distiller
   - A brewer
   - A tobacco manufacturer
   - A tobacco packer
   - A person holding a **special temporary licence** under subsection 262(1) of the Excise Act

2. **At a Location Other Than the Premises**  
   Any service performed **at any time** at a location **other than the premises** listed above.

3. **At a Bonded Manufactory or Bonding Warehouse**  
   Any service performed **at any time** at a bonded manufactory or bonding warehouse.

> ⚠️ **Important Exception**:  
> Supervision of inventory stock-taking required by subsection 32(2) of the Excise Act **during authorized hours** is **not** considered a special service. This ensures that routine, time-bound audits within standard working hours do not trigger special service fees.

---

### **Fees for Special Services**

The person requesting the special service must pay a fee based on the **duration** of the officer’s involvement:

- **First two hours (or portion thereof)**: **$54**  
- **Each additional hour (or portion thereof)**: **$27**

> Example:  
> If an officer spends 3 hours performing a special service, the fee would be:  
> $54 (for first 2 hours) + $27 (for the third hour) = **$81**

> ⚠️ **Meal or rest breaks** taken by the officer **during the service are not counted** in the time spent.  
> → Only **actual working time** is charged.

---

### **Multiple Officers Performing a Service**

If **more than one officer** is required to perform a special service, the total chargeable time is the **sum of all individual times** spent by each officer.

> Example:  
> Officer A spends 1.5 hours; Officer B spends 2.5 hours → Total chargeable time = 4 hours  
> Fee = $54 (first 2 hours) + $27 × (2 hours) = $108

---

### **Transportation Costs (When Not Provided)**

If the person requesting the service **does not provide transportation**, and the officer must use a **personal vehicle**, the requester must pay the **greater of two amounts**:

1. The rate approved by the **Treasury Board** as of **October 1, 1990**, for the use of personal conveyances by public servants.  
2. A flat fee of **$5**

> → This ensures a minimum standard for transportation costs while allowing flexibility based on actual rates.

> ⚠️ The rate is fixed to **October 1, 1990**, meaning it does not adjust for inflation or current market conditions. This creates a **stable, predictable cost** for service providers.

---

### **Accommodation and Meal Costs (When Not Provided)**

If the person requesting the service **does not provide accommodation or meals**, and the officer must obtain them, the requester must pay:

- An amount based on the **Treasury Board-approved rates** as of **October 1, 1990**, for public servants' accommodation or meals.

> → These rates are again **fixed** and apply only to the standard public servant allowances from that date.

> ⚠️ This ensures consistency and transparency in cost recovery for incidental expenses.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

1. **Cost Recovery Mechanism**:  
   The regulations provide a clear, structured way to recover costs associated with excise officers performing duties outside normal hours or at non-standard locations.

2. **Fairness and Predictability**:  
   By setting fixed fees and using historical Treasury Board rates (October 1, 1990), the government ensures that costs are predictable and equitable for both officers and businesses.

3. **Administrative Clarity**:  
   Clearly defines what qualifies as a "special service," excludes routine activities (like authorized-hour stock-taking), and separates service time from breaks.

4. **Enforcement and Accountability**:  
   Requires businesses to pay for transportation and meals when not provided, promoting responsibility and reducing burden on the government.

5. **Historical Basis**:  
   The use of **October 1, 1990** as a reference point suggests these rates were established during a period of fiscal planning and may reflect inflation-adjusted or standard rates at that time. This may limit their relevance in modern economic contexts.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Outdated Reference Date**:  
  The use of rates from **October 1, 1990**, may render the regulations **out of date** in today’s economic environment. Inflation and changes in public servant travel and accommodation standards have likely increased actual costs.

- **No Modernization or Review Mechanism**:  
  The regulations do not provide for periodic review or adjustment of fees, which could lead to **disproportionate costs** for businesses today.

- **Scope Limitation**:  
  Applies only to specific types of businesses (distillers, brewers, tobacco manufacturers, bonded facilities), so it may not cover all excise-related services.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Special Services (Excise) Regulations* establish a **clear, rule-based framework** for charging fees when excise officers perform duties outside standard working hours or at non-standard locations. The regulations ensure cost recovery while maintaining administrative clarity and fairness. However, due to the **fixed, outdated reference date** (October 1, 1990), the fees may no longer reflect current operational or economic realities. A review and potential modernization of these rates would be advisable to ensure both fairness and practicality in today’s regulatory environment.

📌 **Summary in One Sentence**:  
The Special Services (Excise) Regulations define and price excise officer services performed outside regular hours or at non-standard locations, with fees based on time spent and fixed historical rates for transportation and meals, excluding routine stock-taking during authorized hours.
