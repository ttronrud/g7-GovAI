### **Key Elements of the Regulation**

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**  
   The regulation formally transfers certain powers, duties, and functions previously held by the **Minister of Industry** to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**. This transfer is not a change in the agency itself, but a reallocation of ministerial oversight and accountability.

2. **Subject Matter of the Transfer**  
   The transfer specifically pertains to the **Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario (FEDAO)**.  
   - FEDAO is a federal agency established to promote economic development in Northern Ontario.  
   - Its mandate includes supporting infrastructure, business development, workforce training, and regional economic growth in the northern regions of Ontario.

3. **Legal Basis for the Transfer**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision allows the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to reassign responsibilities between ministers, typically to improve efficiency, align policy priorities, or reflect shifts in government priorities.

4. **Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**  
   While not explicitly stated in the regulation itself, such transfers are generally driven by:
   - A strategic realignment of federal responsibilities to better match current policy goals.
   - A desire to strengthen coordination between economic development and social policy, particularly in regions with significant social and economic challenges.
   - The recognition that Northern Ontario’s development requires integration with employment, social services, and community well-being — areas more directly aligned with the mandate of the Minister of Employment and Social Development.

5. **Effect of the Transfer**  
   - The **Minister of Employment and Social Development** now assumes responsibility for all ministerial functions related to FEDAO, including:
     - Oversight of FEDAO’s strategic planning and operations.
     - Approval of funding and program initiatives.
     - Accountability for outcomes related to employment, skills training, and economic inclusion in Northern Ontario.
   - The **Minister of Industry** no longer exercises direct authority over FEDAO, though the agency may continue to operate under its existing statutory framework.

6. **No Change to Agency Structure**  
   The transfer does not alter the legal structure, mandate, or operational independence of FEDAO. The agency continues to exist and function under its original charter, but now falls under the policy and administrative oversight of a different minister.

### **Legal and Administrative Significance**

- This regulation reflects a broader trend in Canadian federal governance of **inter-ministerial realignment** to enhance policy coherence and regional equity.
- It demonstrates how the federal government can reorganize ministerial responsibilities without amending legislation, using existing statutory authority.
- The transfer strengthens the integration of economic development with social outcomes — a key focus in addressing regional disparities in Canada.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation effectively transfers the ministerial oversight of the **Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario** from the **Minister of Industry** to the **Minister of Employment and Social Development**. It is a formal, legally grounded administrative action under the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, designed to align policy priorities with regional needs and to ensure that economic development initiatives in Northern Ontario are supported by a broader social and employment framework.
