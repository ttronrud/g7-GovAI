**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

### **Regulatory Context**
This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), specifically pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the Act. These subsections empower the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to **decide whether to add a species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** (Schedule 1 to SARA) or to **approve the inclusion of a statement explaining the decision** in the public registry under **section 120** of the Act.

The regulation makes two key decisions:

1. **Not to add the Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (*Thunnus thynnus*) to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.**  
2. **Not to add the Yellowmouth Rockfish (*Sebastes reedi*) to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk.**

In both cases, the Minister of the Environment has recommended non-listing, based on advice from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFoO), and the final decision has been approved by the Governor General in Council.

Additionally, the regulation **approves the inclusion of a public statement** explaining the rationale for these decisions in the official public registry under section 120 of SARA, ensuring transparency and public access to the decision-making process.

## **1. Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (*Thunnus thynnus*) – Decision Not to List**

### **Background**
- The Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (ABT) is a highly migratory species found in the North Atlantic, including Canadian waters.
- It was previously assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2011, which raised concerns about its status.
- However, since then, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) has conducted a comprehensive stock assessment in 2014 and updated its data.

### **Key Reasons for Non-Listing**

#### **a. Socio-Economic Impacts of Listing**
- Listing the ABT as **endangered** under SARA would trigger **general prohibitions** under the Act, including:
  - Prohibition on commercial harvesting (directed and incidental catch),
  - Closure of charter boat fisheries,
  - Closure of Aboriginal commercial-communal fisheries.
- These closures would have **significant and immediate socio-economic consequences** for:
  - Coastal communities,
  - Fishing industries,
  - Aboriginal communities that rely on ABT-related livelihoods.
- Most stakeholders who participated in the consultation process—including **provincial governments, Aboriginal organizations, and industry groups**—supported the non-listing option.

#### **b. Limited Conservation Benefit from Listing**
- ICCAT sets and allocates the **Annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC)** among member nations, including Canada.
- If Canada were to list the ABT under SARA and close its fishery:
  - The **Canadian quota would likely be reallocated to other ICCAT member countries**.
  - This would result in **no net reduction in fishing mortality** for the species.
  - Therefore, listing would **not lead to a meaningful improvement in the species’ conservation status**.

#### **c. Loss of Critical Monitoring and Data**
- The Canadian fishery currently provides **key, high-quality data** on ABT abundance through:
  - Comprehensive tagging programs,
  - Dockside and at-sea monitoring,
  - Accurate post-release mortality estimates.
- Closing the fishery would **eliminate these data sources**, impairing the ability to monitor stock health and inform future management decisions.

#### **d. Positive Population Trends**
- ICCAT’s 2014 stock assessment found that:
  - The **western stock of ABT has been increasing** in recent years.
  - Projected biomass is expected to **continue rising under current catch levels** (2,000 tonnes in 2015 global TAC).
- This indicates that the species is **not currently in immediate danger** and is showing signs of recovery.

### **Management Pathway if Not Listed**
If the ABT is **not listed under SARA**, it will remain under the **Fisheries Act**, managed according to:
- ICCAT’s recommended TAC,
- Scientific advice,
- The **National Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF)**.

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) will:
- Draft and update an **Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP)** aligned with the SFF,
- Conduct a **risk assessment of current catch monitoring** across all fleets,
- Review **at-sea observer coverage** to improve data collection,
- Update and strengthen **monitoring documentation** to enhance data quality and ecological understanding.

These actions are expected to improve:
- Accuracy of mortality estimates,
- Knowledge of ABT’s ecological interactions,
- Overall sustainability of the fishery.

## **2. Yellowmouth Rockfish (*Sebastes reedi*) – Decision Not to List**

### **Background**
- Yellowmouth Rockfish is a deep-water groundfish species found in Canadian waters, particularly in the Pacific.
- It is part of the **integrated groundfish fishery**, managed under the Fisheries Act.

### **Key Reasons for Non-Listing**

#### **a. Significant Socio-Economic Harm from Listing**
- Listing the Yellowmouth Rockfish would trigger **general prohibitions** under SARA, including:
  - Prohibitions on harvesting,
  - Restrictions on fishing activities.
- This would result in **immediate and significant negative socio-economic impacts** on:
  - Groundfish fisheries,
  - Fishing communities,
  - Indigenous and coastal economies.
- The incremental conservation benefits of listing would be **minimal or negligible**.

#### **b. Effective Current Management Under the Fisheries Act**
- The species is currently managed under a well-established framework:
  - **Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs)**,
  - **Total Allowable Catches (TACs)** based on scientific advice,
  - **Mandatory 100% at-sea and dockside monitoring**,
  - **Accountability for all rockfish catches** (both retained and released).
- Since the **Commercial Groundfish Integration Program (CGIP)** was implemented in 2006:
  - All reported rockfish catches have **remained within TAC limits**,
  - Conservation objectives have been **successfully met**.

#### **c. Healthy Population Status**
- Current harvest levels are only **1% of the current biomass**.
- The Yellowmouth Rockfish is currently in the **"healthy zone"** of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF).
- Therefore, **no adjustment to TAC is proposed at this time**.
- If the population declines below the healthy zone in the future, TAC will be **adjusted based on updated scientific assessments**.

#### **d. Ongoing Management Improvements**
- DFO will continue to:
  - Update stock assessments more frequently,
  - Improve the timeliness of management responses,
  - Strengthen monitoring and reporting mechanisms.

These measures ensure that conservation outcomes are maintained without the need for SARA listing.

## **Overall Rationale and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Summary |
|-------|--------|
| **Conservation Effectiveness** | Listing neither species under SARA would not significantly improve their conservation status due to existing international management (ICCAT for ABT) and robust domestic controls (Fisheries Act for Yellowmouth Rockfish). |
| **Socio-Economic Considerations** | Both decisions prioritize **economic stability and community well-being**, particularly for coastal and Indigenous communities dependent on these fisheries. |
| **Scientific Basis** | Decisions are grounded in **recent stock assessments (2014 ICCAT)** and **ongoing monitoring data** indicating stable or improving populations. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | The public statement attached to the regulation explains the rationale and is made available in the public registry under section 120 of SARA, fulfilling transparency requirements. |
| **Compliance with SARA Principles** | The decisions are consistent with the **principles of SARA**, including the requirement to balance species conservation with socio-economic impacts and the need for evidence-based decisions. |

## **Conclusion**

This regulation reflects a **pragmatic and science-based approach** to species at risk management. It demonstrates that:

- Not all species under threat require listing under SARA, especially when:
  - They are effectively managed under existing frameworks,
  - Their populations are stable or improving,
  - Listing would cause disproportionate socio-economic harm,
  - Conservation outcomes are already being achieved through current management tools.

By choosing **non-listing**, the Government of Canada:
- Avoids unnecessary regulatory burdens,
- Maintains effective fisheries management,
- Supports sustainable livelihoods,
- Ensures that conservation efforts are targeted where they are most needed.

This decision underscores the importance of **adaptive management**, **international cooperation**, and **evidence-based policy** in the implementation of the Species at Risk Act.
