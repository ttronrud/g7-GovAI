**Detailed Summary of the *Undeliverable and Redirected Mail Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Undeliverable and Redirected Mail Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish the rules governing how mail that cannot be delivered (undeliverable mail) or has been redirected due to a valid request (redirected mail) is processed, handled, and disposed of by **Canada Post Corporation**.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Redirected Mail**:  
  Mail that cannot be delivered as addressed because the **addressee has formally requested** that it be redirected to a different address. This request must be filed with Canada Post. The mail is then delivered to the **forwarding address** specified in the request — provided the sender does not object.

- **Undeliverable Mail**:  
  Mail that **cannot be delivered to the addressee** for any reason. This includes:
  - Mail where delivery is **prohibited by law**,
  - Mail **refused by the addressee**, or
  - Mail where the **sender has not paid postage due** on demand.

  *Note:* The term "request to redirect mail" and "address mail" have been **repealed** (removed) under previous amendments (SOR/88-442 and SOR/90-16).

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to:
- **Undeliverable mail**
- **Redirected mail**

They govern the procedures for handling both types of mail, including redirection, return, disposal, and fees.

---

### **4. Redirection of Mail (General Rules)**

#### **General Principle**
- Subject to **Section 5 and 6**, and **on payment of the applicable fee**, redirected mail shall be delivered to the addressee at the **forwarding address** provided in the request.

#### **Exemptions to Redirection**
- **Mail addressed to an individual at the address of an organization or commercial enterprise** (e.g., a company, association, or business) **shall not be redirected** to that individual, even if the individual has filed a request.  
  → *Purpose:* Prevents abuse of redirection for personal use in commercial settings.

- **Mail with "or occupant" or similar wording** on the address (e.g., "John Smith or occupant") **shall not be redirected**.  
  → *Purpose:* Protects privacy and prevents misdelivery to non-residents.

- **Mail bearing a request for return to sender** (on cover) and where the sender has entered into an agreement with Canada Post for return → **must be returned to sender**.

- **If the sender requests that mail not be redirected**, it will not be redirected, even if a request form was submitted.
