The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the same statutory instrument:

> [Repealed, SI/2013-59, s. 5]  
> [Repealed, SI/2013-59, s. 5]

This indicates that a specific regulation (or provision) has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2013-59**, under **section 5** of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially cancelled and no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2013-59 (SI 2013/59), which was enacted in the United Kingdom (as SI numbers typically follow UK legislative conventions).
- **Section Repealed**: Section 5 of SI 2013/59 specifically removed or revoked the provision previously in force.
- **Implication**: Any legal effect, obligations, or rights derived from the repealed regulation are no longer valid. It has been superseded or replaced by a new provision, or simply removed from the legal framework.
- **No Content Provided**: The actual text or content of the original regulation is not included in the input. Therefore, a detailed summary of its substance (e.g., purpose, scope, provisions) cannot be provided without access to the original regulation prior to repeal.

### Conclusion:

The provided information does not contain the actual regulation being repealed—it only states that it was repealed by SI 2013/59, section 5. As a result, **a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be offered**. The only factual summary is that:

> A specific regulation was formally repealed by Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2013/59, meaning it is no longer legally effective. Without the original text of the regulation, its content, purpose, or application cannot be described in detail.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal, which can be found in official legal databases such as legislation.gov.uk or the UK Statutory Instruments database.
