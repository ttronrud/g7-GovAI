**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: General Import Permit No. 2 (Import of Chickens Permit)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued by the **Acting Prime Minister** of Canada, acting under **Section 8 of the Import Permit Regulations**. This provision grants the government the authority to issue general import permits when necessary to facilitate the importation of specific goods under controlled conditions.

The permit is formally titled:  
**"The Import of Chickens Permit"**  
and is designated as **General Import Permit No. 2**, effective from **January 15, 1979**.

---

**2. Scope of the Permit**  
This permit authorizes any individual to import certain goods into Canada, specifically those listed in **Item 19 of the Import Control List**. The goods covered under this permit are:

- **Chickens** (in any form)  
- **Other specified poultry or chicken products**, as defined in the Import Control List (though the full list is not provided here).

However, the permit applies only under **two specific conditions**:

**3. Conditions for Eligibility**

**Condition 1: Personal Use Limitation**  
A person may import goods under this permit if:
- The goods do **not exceed 9 kilograms (kg) in net weight per shipment**;  
- The goods are imported **for the personal use of the importer or a member of the importer’s household**.

This means:
- The import is strictly for private, non-commercial use.
- The quantity per shipment is capped at 9 kg.
- The recipient must be either the importer themselves or a family member living in the same household.

**Condition 2: Specific Form of Chicken Products**  
A person may also import:
- **Chickens that are contained in a jar or can**  
This is a distinct category, not subject to the 9 kg weight limit or personal use requirement. It appears to allow for the importation of preserved or canned chicken products, possibly for dietary or cultural reasons.

**4. Customs Documentation Requirement**  
All shipments of goods covered under this permit must be accompanied by a completed and validated customs entry form. On that form, the importer must clearly indicate one of the following endorsements:
- “Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 2”  
- “Importé selon la Licence générale d’importation no 2”  
*(The French version is included for bilingual compliance, indicating Canada's official bilingual policy.)*

Failure to include this endorsement may result in the shipment being rejected or subject to further scrutiny by customs authorities.

**5. Legal Status and Revocation**  
This permit was originally issued on **January 5, 1979**, and became effective on **January 15, 1979**.  

However, the regulation is **revoked** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 83-181, Section 2**, which was enacted in 1983. This means that **General Import Permit No. 2 is no longer valid or in force as of the date of revocation**.

> **Important Note**: The permit is **no longer applicable** under current Canadian law. Its revocation indicates that the government has determined that the importation of chickens under these specific conditions is no longer necessary or appropriate, possibly due to changes in trade policy, public health concerns, or updated import controls.

**6. Key Implications and Interpretation**

- This permit was a **temporary, narrow-scope exception** to standard import restrictions, allowing limited personal imports of chickens.
- It reflects a **public health or cultural consideration**, possibly related to the importation of food products for religious, dietary, or traditional purposes.
- The 9 kg limit and personal use requirement suggest that the government aimed to prevent commercial or large-scale importation, protecting domestic markets and food safety.
- The inclusion of canned chickens indicates a possible allowance for preserved food items, which may have been culturally significant or difficult to source domestically.

**7. Conclusion**  
General Import Permit No. 2 (the "Import of Chickens Permit") was a short-term, targeted regulatory measure allowing individuals to import limited quantities of chickens—either under personal use conditions or in canned/jarred form—for personal consumption. It was issued in 1979 and **revoked in 1983** (SI/83-181, s. 2), rendering it **no longer valid or enforceable** under current Canadian law.

This regulation is of historical interest and serves as an example of how the Canadian government may issue temporary import permits to address specific consumer or cultural needs, while maintaining controls on volume, origin, and purpose of imports.
