**Detailed Summary of the *Schedule 1 Chemicals Regulations* (S.C. 1995, c. 25)**  
*Under the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act*

---

### **Overview**
The *Schedule 1 Chemicals Regulations* (S.C. 1995, c. 25) are a Canadian regulatory framework established under the **Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act (CWCIA)**. These regulations govern the **production, use, acquisition, possession, and transfer** of **Schedule 1 chemicals**—toxic substances or precursors listed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Annex on Chemicals. The primary objective is to **prevent the misuse of these chemicals for chemical weapon development** while allowing legitimate, non-military scientific and medical research and applications.

The regulations are administered by the **National Authority** (currently the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry or a designated body under the CWCIA), and they are designed to ensure **public safety, environmental protection, international compliance, and national security**.

## **Core Regulatory Principles**

### 1. **Maximum Authorized Quantity**
- The **total aggregate quantity** of Schedule 1 chemicals authorized in Canada at any time **shall not exceed one tonne (1,000 kg)**.
- This cap ensures that large-scale stockpiling or production is prohibited.

---

### 2. **Licensing Requirements for Individuals and Facilities**

A licence is required for any individual who resides in Canada to **produce, use, acquire, or possess** a Schedule 1 chemical, **unless exempted**.

#### **Conditions for Licence Authorization**
To obtain a licence, the following conditions must be met:
- **Public health, safety, environment, international relations, and national defence/security are not at risk.**
- Activities must be for **research, medical, pharmaceutical, or protective purposes**.
- The **aggregate annual production** per facility must not exceed **10 kg per year**.
- Authorized quantities must be **proportional and consistent** with the stated purpose.

#### **Single Facility for Protective Purposes**
- There can be **only one licensed facility** in Canada authorized to produce Schedule 1 chemicals **for protective purposes** (e.g., chemical defence research).

#### **Licence Term**
- Maximum duration: **Three years**.
- Renewals are possible, but must be applied for in advance.

#### **Licence Issuance and Identification**
- Each licence is assigned a **unique number and date of issue**.
- The licence must be issued, amended, or renewed by the National Authority.
