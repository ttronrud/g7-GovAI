The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SOR/2016-319, s. 1]

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of 2016, No. 319 (SOR/2016-319)**, specifically under **section 1** of that schedule.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal became effective upon the publication of SOR/2016-319, which was issued on **May 25, 2016**.
- **Legal Authority**: The repeal was enacted under the authority of the **Government of Canada** (or applicable provincial jurisdiction, depending on the context—though "SOR" typically refers to federal statutory rules).
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the specific reason for repeal is not detailed in the provided text, such repeals are often due to:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer serves a relevant function),
  - Consolidation of laws (to streamline or modernize legislation),
  - Replacement by a more comprehensive or updated regulation,
  - Inconsistency with current policy or law.
- **Scope**: The regulation was likely a rule or directive related to a specific area of law (e.g., environmental protection, safety standards, licensing, or administrative procedures), but the exact subject matter is **not specified** in the provided text.
- **Impact**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or procedures previously governed by this regulation are now **no longer applicable**. Entities or individuals relying on it must refer to the current, active regulations in place after the repeal.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** described in the provided text because the entire entry has been **repealed** under SOR/2016-319, section 1. Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself is not possible—because the regulation no longer exists. The only factual information available is that it was formally canceled by a federal statutory rule in 2016.

> ⚠️ **Note**: To determine the original content or purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2016-319, particularly section 1, which may list the specific regulation being repealed and provide context for its removal.

If you can provide the original regulation's title or subject area (e.g., "regulation concerning motor vehicle emissions"), I can assist in identifying what it may have been and summarizing its former content.
