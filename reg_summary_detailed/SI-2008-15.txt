1. **Legal Status**: The regulation is no longer in force and has been officially removed from the legal framework.
2. **Reason for Repeal**: It may have been repealed due to:
   - Obsolescence (outdated or no longer relevant),
   - Supersession by a newer, more comprehensive or updated regulation,
   - Inconsistency with current law,
   - Redundancy or overlap with other regulations,
   - Legislative modernization or streamlining.
3. **Legal Effect**: Any actions or obligations previously governed by the repealed regulation are now governed by either a successor regulation or are no longer enforceable.
4. **Public Access**: The repeal is typically published in the Canada Gazette (in Canada) or the Official Journal of the United Kingdom (in the UK), or in the relevant national legislation database.

To provide a detailed summary, the specific title and subject matter of the regulation (e.g., "The Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations 2015" or "The Employment Standards Regulation 2016") would be required.
