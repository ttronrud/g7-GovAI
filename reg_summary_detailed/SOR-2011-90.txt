**Detailed Summary of the Release and Environmental Emergency Notification Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Regulatory Context**

The *Release and Environmental Emergency Notification Regulations* are established under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically:

- **Section 332(1)a**: Authorizes the Minister of the Environment to publish proposed regulations related to the notification of releases and environmental emergencies.
- **Section 200(1)**: Provides for the National Advisory Committee (NAC) to offer advice on proposed regulations under section 6c of CEPA.
- **Section 209(3)**: Requires the Minister to consult with:
  - The governments of the territories where the regulations apply; and
  - Aboriginal governments with jurisdiction over Aboriginal lands affected by the regulations.

This ensures that regulatory development is informed by scientific, environmental, and Indigenous perspectives, promoting inclusivity and public accountability.

The regulations were **proposed on December 19, 2009**, and the public was given an opportunity to:
- Submit written comments or
- File a notice of objection requesting a board of review, including reasons for objection.

The Minister of the Environment, in consultation with the NAC and relevant provincial and territorial authorities, recommended the final regulations for adoption by the Governor in Council.

These notifications are critical to enabling rapid response, minimizing environmental harm, and protecting public health and safety.
