**Detailed Summary of the Public Lands Licensing Order**

**Title:**  
*Public Lands Licensing Order*  
*(Revoked: SOR/85-911, Section 1)*

---

**Overview:**  
The Public Lands Licensing Order (PLLO) is a regulatory instrument that grants authority to the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** to issue licenses for specific activities involving the use of public canals in Canada. Although the Order is now **revoked** (as per SOR/85-911, Section 1), it historically provided a legal framework for the permitting and management of infrastructure and utility operations on or near canals, particularly those serving Indigenous territories or northern regions.

**Key Provisions and Authorizations:**

1. **Licensing Authority:**  
   The **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development** is authorized to issue licenses on behalf of Her Majesty (the Crown) to permit the following activities:

   - **Erection, laying, maintenance, and operation** of:
     - Telegraph, telephone, and power transmission wires and cables
     - Water, sewer, drain, and oil pipelines

   These activities are permitted **on, over, under, and across canals**, indicating a broad scope of physical access and infrastructure placement.

2. **Boathouse Construction and Use:**  
   The Minister may authorize:
   - The **erection, placement, and maintenance of boathouses** at designated sites on canals.
   - Designation of such sites is determined by the **Superintending Engineer** of the specific canal.

3. **Mooring and Anchoring (Limited Navigation Draft):**  
   Individuals or entities may:
   - **Moor or pull ashore** vessels at sites where the water depth is **less than the normal navigation draft** of the canal.
   - These sites are also designated by the **Superintending Engineer** of the canal.

4. **Water Extraction (Domestic, Agricultural, Industrial Use):**  
   The Minister may authorize the **drawing of water** from canals for:
   - Domestic use
   - Agricultural purposes
   - Industrial purposes  
   *(Exclusion: Water power is not permitted under this provision.)*

   **Limitations on Water Draw:**
   - Pipes used for extraction must not exceed **12 inches in diameter**.
   - The total flow rate must not exceed **1,500 gallons per minute**.

5. **Fire Protection Water Use:**  
   Water may be drawn from canals specifically for **fire protection purposes**, such as supplying fire hydrants or firefighting equipment.

6. **Discharge of Water and Effluents:**  
   Entities may discharge water, drainage, or effluents into canals, **provided** that:
   - Such discharges are **settled and/or purified** to the satisfaction of the **General Superintendent of Canals**.
   - The requirement for purification or settling is **conditional** and depends on the assessment of the General Superintendent, who has discretion to determine whether discharges are environmentally acceptable.

7. **Rental Determination:**  
   The Minister has the authority to **determine rental fees** for the use of canal rights granted through these licenses. This includes setting rates for:
   - Pipeline access
   - Boathouse use
   - Water extraction
   - Other permitted activities

---

**Key Administrative Bodies Involved:**

- **Superintending Engineer of the Canal:**  
  Responsible for designating specific sites for:
  - Boathouses
  - Mooring/anchoring (based on draft limits)

- **General Superintendent of Canals:**  
  Holds discretionary authority to assess and approve the **quality of effluents** before allowing their discharge into canals. This role ensures environmental protection and regulatory compliance.

**Important Notes and Context:**

- **Revocation Status:**  
  This Order was **officially revoked** by **SOR/85-911, Section 1**, which means it is no longer in force. Its provisions have been superseded by more modern legislation, likely reflecting changes in land use, environmental regulation, and federal administrative structures.

- **Jurisdictional Focus:**  
  The Order appears to have been primarily relevant to **public canals in Indigenous or northern territories**, given the Minister's portfolio of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This suggests a historical focus on infrastructure development in remote or under-served regions.

- **Environmental and Regulatory Safeguards:**  
  The inclusion of effluent treatment requirements and limits on water extraction shows an early attempt at balancing infrastructure needs with environmental protection—particularly through the role of the General Superintendent.

- **Exclusions:**  
  The prohibition of **water power** use (e.g., hydroelectric generation) reflects a deliberate policy choice to preserve canal water for other essential uses and avoid environmental or navigational disruption.

**Conclusion:**  
The Public Lands Licensing Order was a foundational regulatory tool enabling the Crown to authorize infrastructure and utility operations on public canals. It provided a structured, rights-based system for water use, pipeline installation, and boating access, with environmental and operational safeguards. However, due to its revocation in 1985, it is no longer applicable. Its historical significance lies in illustrating early federal efforts to manage natural resources and public infrastructure in Indigenous and northern regions, with a balance between development and environmental stewardship. Modern regulations now govern such activities under updated environmental, land use, and Indigenous rights frameworks.
