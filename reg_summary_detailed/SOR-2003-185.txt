### **Regulation Summary: Foreign Institutions Subject to the Canadian Residency Requirements Regulations (Insurance Companies)**

#### **Legal Authority and Source**
- **Issued by**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
- **On the recommendation of**: The Minister of Finance  
- **Under Section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act**  
- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465 (amending or enacting the regulation)  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 47 (original or foundational reference to the regulation framework)

> This means the regulation is formally enacted through the Canadian government’s legislative process, specifically under the authority granted by Section 1021a of the *Insurance Companies Act*, which deals with the residency and regulatory oversight of foreign entities operating in Canada’s insurance sector.

---

#### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of these regulations is to **establish the residency requirements for foreign institutions** involved in the insurance industry in Canada. Specifically, it defines when a **foreign holding body corporate** is considered subject to Canadian residency rules under the *Insurance Companies Act*, particularly for the purposes of regulatory oversight, taxation, and compliance.

#### **Key Definition: "Holding Body Corporate" of a Foreign Institution**
Under **subsection 167(2)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*, a "holding body corporate" is prescribed (i.e., formally recognized) if **both** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Incorporation Outside Canada**  
   - The holding body corporate is **incorporated or formed** in a jurisdiction **other than**:
     - An Act of Parliament (federal law), or  
     - An Act of a provincial legislature (provincial law).  
   - In simpler terms: It is not established under Canadian law (either federal or provincial). This excludes entities formed under Canadian legislation.

2. **Primary Business Activity**  
   - The holding body corporate, **together with the entities it controls**, must be engaged **primarily** in the business of **providing financial services**.  
   - This includes activities such as insurance, investment management, banking, or other financial intermediation.  
   - The "whole" of the group (holding company and its subsidiaries) must be viewed as operating primarily in this sector.

> This definition ensures that only foreign entities with a clear financial services focus — and not mere holding companies for non-financial purposes — are subject to Canadian regulatory and residency requirements.

---

#### **Regulatory Impact and Scope**
- The regulation applies to **foreign institutions** that meet the above criteria.  
- It brings these entities under the **Canadian Residency Requirements Regulations (Insurance Companies)**, which govern:
  - Whether such entities are considered "resident" in Canada for regulatory purposes.
  - Their compliance with Canadian insurance laws, capital requirements, reporting obligations, and transparency standards.
- This ensures that foreign entities offering financial services through Canadian subsidiaries or partnerships are subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as domestic insurers.

---

#### **Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.  
- Registration in the Gazette is the official step that makes the regulation legally enforceable.  
- This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication, allowing regulators and industry participants to adjust their operations accordingly.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Regulatory Oversight**:  
   - Helps Canada maintain control over foreign financial institutions that may have a significant impact on the domestic insurance market.

2. **Residency Determination**:  
   - Clarifies which foreign entities are considered "resident" in Canada for regulatory purposes, which affects taxation, licensing, and reporting obligations.

3. **Prevention of Regulatory Arbitrage**:  
   - Prevents foreign entities from using shell companies or non-Canadian incorporation to avoid Canadian oversight.

4. **Alignment with International Standards**:  
   - Supports Canada’s compliance with global financial regulatory frameworks, such as those from the OECD and the Financial Stability Board.

5. **Clarity for Industry**:  
   - Provides clear criteria for foreign financial institutions to understand whether they fall under Canadian regulatory jurisdiction.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a formal framework to identify and regulate **foreign holding companies** that operate primarily in financial services and are not incorporated under Canadian law. By defining the conditions under which such entities are considered "holding bodies" under Canadian insurance law, the regulation strengthens Canada’s ability to ensure financial stability, protect consumers, and maintain regulatory integrity in the insurance sector.

It is a key tool in Canada’s broader strategy to monitor and regulate cross-border financial activities, especially in the insurance industry.
