The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed by operation of law, 2000, c. 5, s. 63]"

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a statute) has been **repealed** — that is, officially canceled or abolished — **by operation of law**.

- **"Repealed"** means the regulation no longer exists or is no longer in force.
- **"By operation of law"** implies that the repeal was not the result of a deliberate legislative act (such as a bill passed by Parliament or a government decision), but rather occurred automatically due to the legal framework or timing of a law. This often happens when a statute is amended or replaced, and the new law renders the old one obsolete without explicit mention of repeal.
- **"2000, c. 5, s. 63"** refers to the specific legal instrument that caused the repeal:
  - **2000** is the year the legislation was enacted.
  - **c. 5** refers to the chapter number of the Act (in this case, the *Statutes of Ontario, 2000*, Chapter 5).
  - **s. 63** is the section number within that Act that contains the repeal provision.

### Interpretation:

The three repeated entries suggest that the regulation in question was repealed **three times** under the same legal mechanism — by operation of law — through the same statutory provision (Section 63 of Chapter 5 of the 2000 Act). However, this is likely a typographical or formatting error or a result of the original document listing the repeal status multiple times for different provisions or sections.

Since the repeal is described as occurring "by operation of law," it is not the result of a separate legislative vote or amendment but rather a consequence of legal succession or amendment. This is common in legal texts where multiple provisions are affected by a single change.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced has been **officially removed from legal force** due to a provision in the *Statutes of Ontario, 2000, Chapter 5, Section 63*, which repealed it automatically by operation of law. The repetition of the statement suggests a formatting issue or the presence of multiple provisions affected by the same repeal. As such, **the regulation is no longer valid or enforceable** and should not be cited or applied in legal or administrative contexts.
