### **2. Triggering Events Requiring Notification to Quarantine Officers**

A vessel’s person-in-charge (e.g., captain) must notify the relevant quarantine officer **if any of the following conditions occur** during a voyage:

#### ✅ Conditions That Trigger Notification:
1. **Death of a crew member or passenger** on board.
2. **Illness symptoms** in any crew or passenger, including:
   - Temperature ≥ 38°C (100°F) that persists for **two days or more**, or is accompanied by:
     - A rash
     - Jaundice
     - Glandular swelling (e.g., swollen lymph nodes)
   - **Severe diarrhea** that interferes with work or normal activity.
3. **Timeframe for Notification**:
   - The person in charge must notify the quarantine officer **at least 24 hours before estimated arrival**.
   - Notification must occur **between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.** (local time).
   - The notification must be made **by radio**.

4. **Additional Triggers**:
   - The vessel has been in a country **suspected or confirmed to have smallpox** within **14 days** of estimated arrival in Canada.
   - The vessel has been in a country **suspected or confirmed to have plague** within **60 days** of estimated arrival.
   - The vessel’s **de-ratting certificate** has expired or is about to expire.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These disease-specific thresholds (smallpox, plague) reflect the historical concern with highly infectious and contagious diseases. Smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980, and plague is now rare and monitored under specific public health protocols.

### **3. Required Information to Be Provided Upon Notification**

When notifying the quarantine officer, the vessel’s person in charge must provide the following details:

| Information Item | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Name and nationality of the vessel | Full name and country of registration |
| Ports called at during the voyage | List of all intermediate stops |
| Nature of cargo | Type and description of goods being transported |
| Crew size | Total number of crew members |
| Passenger count | Number of passengers on board |
| Port of destination and owner/agent | Name of destination port and vessel owner (or agent in Canada) |

| Carrying of a body | Whether any deceased person’s body is being transported |
| Estimated time of arrival (ETA) | Arrival date and time at destination port |
| Immunization status for smallpox | Number of people **without valid proof of smallpox vaccination** |
| De-ratting certificate details | Date and place of issuance of any de-ratting certificate or exemption |

> 🔍 This information was intended to allow quarantine authorities to assess risk and determine whether isolation, inspection, or medical screening was needed upon arrival.

### **4. Designated Quarantine Stations by Port**

Each Canadian port has a designated **quarantine station** where notifications must be sent. The stations are:

| Province/Region | Designated Quarantine Station |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island | Halifax, Nova Scotia |
| New Brunswick | Saint John, New Brunswick |
| Newfoundland | St. John’s, Newfoundland |
| Quebec or via St. Lawrence River | Montreal, Quebec |
| British Columbia | Vancouver, British Columbia |
| Hudson Bay | Churchill, Manitoba |

> 📌 This system ensured that vessels arriving at specific ports were directed to the appropriate public health authority for inspection and monitoring.

### **6. Key Observations and Historical Context**

- **Outdated Disease Focus**:
  - The regulation focuses on **smallpox and plague**, both of which are now **extinct or extremely rare** globally.
  - Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980; plague is now monitored only in specific high-risk areas.
  - The requirement for smallpox immunization records is obsolete.

- **Outdated Procedures**:
  - Reliance on **radio communication** (not digital or satellite-based) is outdated.
  - No mention of modern public health surveillance systems, such as real-time data sharing, digital health passports, or travel health advisories.

- **Repeal Context**:
  - The regulation was **repealed in 2006** (SOR/2006-332) as part of a broader modernization of Canada’s public health and border health regulations.
  - Modern disease monitoring is now governed by:
    - The *Public Health Act*
    - The *Infectious Diseases Act*
    - The *Health Protection and Promotion Act*
    - The *Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)* and *Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)* collaboration
    - Travel health advisories and risk-based screening

### ✅ Summary in Plain Language

This regulation **required ships and aircraft arriving in Canada** to notify public health officials **if there were signs of serious illness or death** among crew or passengers. It also required reporting if the vessel had been in a country with suspected outbreaks of smallpox or plague or if its rodent control certificate had expired.

It included detailed reporting requirements and designated quarantine stations per port. However, because:
- Smallpox and plague are no longer significant threats,
- Communication methods have evolved,
- Public health systems are now more integrated and data-driven,

👉 **This regulation has been officially repealed and replaced** by current, more flexible, and scientifically updated public health measures.

### 🚩 Important Note for Users
**Do not use this regulation for current compliance, legal advice, or operational planning.**  
For current quarantine and health screening requirements, refer to:
- [Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)](https://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca)
- [Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)](https://www.cbsa.gc.ca)
- The *Public Health Act* and *Infectious Diseases Act*

## ✅ Final Verdict:
> **This is a historical, repealed regulation** that reflects Canada’s pre-2000s approach to international disease control. It is **no longer in effect** and should not be used as a basis for current health or maritime/aviation compliance.
