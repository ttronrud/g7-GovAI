## **I. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- **Purpose**: To ensure that member financial institutions (depository institutions) accurately and timely disclose information about deposits that are:
  - Co-owned by two or more individuals;
  - Held in trust (by a trustee or nominee broker);
  - Held under a designated "special income arrangement" (e.g., RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, etc.);
  - Held through nominee brokers or professional trustees.

- **Legal Authority**:
  - Paragraph 11(2)(g)a of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*;
  - Section 14c of the Act’s schedule (which outlines disclosure obligations for deposits).

This by-law replaces the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Joint and Trust Account Disclosure By-law (SOR/95-279)**, which is now repealed.

## **II. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*. |
| **Determination Date** | The key date used to define when disclosure obligations arise. It is either: <br> - The filing date of a winding-up petition (if a winding-up order is initiated before the majority of insured deposits are paid), or <br> - The date when one of the events listed in subsection 14(2.1) of the Act first occurs (e.g., insolvency, closure, or significant financial distress). |
| **Senior Officer** | For a nominee broker or professional trustee (non-individual): <br> - CEO or board member; or <br> - An officer who reports directly to a CEO or board. For individuals, it is the person performing similar roles. |
| **Special Income Arrangement (SIA)** | Includes the following registered plans: <br> - RRSP (section 5(1)) <br> - RRIF (section 5(2)) <br> - TFSA (section 5(3)) <br> - Tax-Free First Home Savings Account (section 5(3.1)) <br> - Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) (section 5(4)) <br> - Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) (section 5(5)) |

> Each of these is considered a distinct type of SIA under the by-law.

## **III. Disclosure Requirements by Deposit Type**

All disclosures must be made **on the member institution’s records before the determination date**.

---

### **1. Co-Owned Deposits**
- Must be disclosed by:
  - Indicating that the deposit is **co-owned**;
  - Listing **each co-owner’s full name**.

> Applies to any deposit where two or more individuals jointly hold ownership.

---

### **2. Trusts (Non-Nominee Broker / Non-Professional Trustee Accounts)**

#### Subsection 6(1): Basic Trust Disclosure
- Must indicate the deposit is **held in trust**;
- List **each trustee’s name** and **one trustee’s address**.

#### Subsection 6(2): Trust with Beneficiary

> These disclosures apply **only if the deposit is not a nominee broker deposit or a professional trustee account**.

---

### **3. Special Income Arrangement (SIA) Deposits with Trustee Role**

If a depositor is acting as a **trustee for another person** (e.g., managing a TFSA for a child), and the deposit is **not** a nominee broker deposit or a professional trustee account:

- Must disclose:
  - The **type of SIA**;
  - The **name and address** of the individual for whose benefit the arrangement is established.

> This ensures clarity about who the actual beneficiary is, even if the depositor is acting in a trustee capacity.

---

### **4. Nominee Broker Deposits**

Nominee brokers act as intermediaries to hold deposits on behalf of beneficiaries.

#### General Disclosure Rules (for all nominee broker deposits):
- Must indicate the deposit is **held in trust by a nominee broker**;
- Must list the **nominee broker’s legal name and address**.

#### Additional Requirements:

##### Subsection 6(2): With Beneficiary
- Must include:
  - The **alphanumeric code** assigned to the beneficiary (as per rules below);
  - The code must be consistent across all deposits held under the **same type of SIA** at the same institution.

##### Subsection 6(3): Beneficiary Interest
- Must specify:
  - The **amount or percentage of interest** associated with the alphanumeric code.

##### Special Disclosure for SIA Deposits:
- If the deposit is held under an SIA, the **type of SIA** and **each alphanumeric code** assigned to beneficiaries must be disclosed.

---

### **5. Alphanumeric Code Assignment Rules (for Nominee Brokers)**

These rules govern how codes are assigned to beneficiaries:

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **No duplicate codes** | A nominee broker must not assign the same alphanumeric code to more than one beneficiary. |
| **Same code for same SIA type** | For a beneficiary, all deposits made under the **same type of SIA** at the **same member institution** must share the same code. |
| **Same code for same institution (non-SIA)** | For deposits not held under an SIA, all deposits made by the same nominee broker at the same institution must share the same code. |
| **Different SIA types may share a code** | A beneficiary can have **different codes** for different SIA types (e.g., one for RRSP, one for TFSA), but **same code can be reused** across different SIA types. |

> This ensures consistency and traceability in tracking beneficiary interests.

---

### **6. Information to Be Provided to CDIC (by Nominee Broker)**

Under **paragraph 7(1)(b)** of the schedule, the nominee broker must provide the following to CDIC:

- The **type of SIA**, if any;

  - The code itself;
  - The **name of the individual** for whose benefit the arrangement exists;
