The provided text consists entirely of repeals of specific sections of a regulation, listed multiple times with references to statutory rules (SOR — Statutory Rules of Ontario). However, **no actual regulation content** is included — only repeated declarations that certain sections have been **repealed** (cancelled or removed) by subsequent amendments.

Here is a detailed summary of what the information means:

---

### 🔍 Summary of the Provided Text:

**1. Nature of the Content:**
- The text does **not describe a regulation** in detail.
- Instead, it lists multiple instances of **repeals** of sections of a prior regulation.
- Each line follows the format:  
  `[Repealed, SOR/XXXX-XXXX, s. X]`  
  This means: *"Section X of the regulation published in Statutory Rule (SOR) XXXX-XXXX has been repealed."*

**2. Repeal Details:**
- The regulation referenced was originally published under **SOR/99-362** and **SOR/2013-204**.
- Multiple sections (s. 2, s. 5, and several instances of s. 1) from these rules have been repealed.
- Specifically:
  - **SOR/99-362, s. 2** and **s. 5** were repealed.
  - **SOR/2013-204, s. 1** was repealed **multiple times** (appears 13 times in the list — likely due to repetition or formatting error).

> ⚠️ Note: The repeated entries (e.g., "Repealed, SOR/2013-204, s. 1" appearing 13 times) suggest either:
> - A formatting or data entry error.
> - A list that was copied incorrectly, possibly from a database or legal document.
> - A list of multiple sections being repealed, but only one section (s. 1) is actually being referenced.

**3. Legal Implications of Repeal:**
- When a section of a regulation is repealed:
  - It is **no longer in force**.
  - Any legal obligation, requirement, or rule previously established by that section is **removed**.
  - The repeal takes effect as of the date specified in the new regulation (in this case, SOR/2013-204).
- Repeals are typically used to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Align regulations with current policy or legislative intent.
  - Simplify or modernize legal frameworks.

**4. Context of SOR/2013-204:**
- SOR/2013-204 is a Statutory Rule issued in Ontario in 2013.
- It is likely a **regulatory amendment or consolidation** that updated or replaced earlier rules.
- The fact that it repeals multiple sections (including s. 1) suggests that the regulation was either:
  - Replaced entirely.
  - Streamlined to remove redundant or conflicting provisions.

**5. Status of the Original Regulation:**
- The original regulation (likely related to **Ontario's environmental, health, or administrative regulations**) is **no longer in effect** for the repealed sections.
- As of now, **those sections are void and unenforceable**.
- Any current legal interpretation or enforcement must refer to the **current, non-repealed version** of the regulation or to a successor rule.

### ✅ Conclusion:

There is **no active regulation** described in the provided text.  
Instead, the content is a **list of repeals** — indicating that **certain sections of a prior Ontario regulation (originally SOR/99-362 and later amended by SOR/2013-204) have been formally removed** from legal force.

➡️ **Key Takeaway**:  
The regulation referenced has been **fully or partially repealed**, and the listed sections are **no longer valid** under Ontario law.  
To understand current legal requirements, one must refer to the **current version of the regulation**, if any, or to the **replacing or successor regulation**.

### 🔎 Recommendation:
To determine the **original purpose** of the repealed regulation (e.g., environmental protection, waste management, health standards), one would need to:
- Consult the original SOR/99-362.
- Review the full text of SOR/2013-204.
- Check official Ontario government databases (e.g., [www.ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca) or the *Regulations Act* database).

Without the original regulation text, a detailed summary of its content or purpose cannot be provided.
