**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Purpose of the Remission:**  
   The primary objective of this regulation is to correct a financial error in the calculation of equalization payments to certain provinces. Specifically, the Government of Canada had overpaid equalization funds to a province due to an overstatement in the amount of *mutual fund trust capital gains refunds* used in the equalization payment formula.

2. **Nature of the Error:**  
   - The equalization payment formula used by the federal government to determine how much financial support to provide to provinces is based on a number of factors, including provincial income, population, and other economic indicators.
   - One of the components used in the calculation was the amount of capital gains refunds paid to mutual fund trust beneficiaries.
   - It was discovered that the amount of these capital gains refunds was *overstated* in the official records used to compute equalization payments.
   - As a result, the equalization payments made to the affected province were higher than they should have been — leading to an overpayment.

3. **Scope of the Remission:**  
   - The remission applies to a **specific province** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** attached to the regulation.
   - The amount of remission is specified in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
   - The overpayments are limited to the fiscal years beginning **April 1, 1993**, and ending **March 31, 2001** — a period of nine fiscal years.

4. **Fiscal Period Covered:**  
   The adjustment applies to equalization overpayments made during the following fiscal years:
   - 1993–1994  
   - 1994–1995  
   - 1995–1996  
   - 1996–1997  
   - 1997–1998  
   - 1998–1999  
   - 1999–2000  
   - 2000–2001  

   (Note: The regulation covers the years from 1993 to 2001, inclusive.)

5. **Reason for the Overpayment:**  
   The overstatement of mutual fund trust capital gains refunds led to an inflated calculation of the province’s net fiscal position, which in turn resulted in an overestimation of its eligibility for equalization funding. Since equalization payments are intended to balance provincial fiscal capacity, this overstatement created a financial imbalance.

6. **Remission Mechanism:**  
   The regulation authorizes the **cancellation or repayment** of the overpaid equalization amounts. This means that the province will no longer be required to repay the overpaid funds, and the federal government will formally remit the amount back to the province (or adjust its financial records accordingly), effectively correcting the error.

7. **Public Interest Justification:**  
   The Governor General in Council has determined that it is in the public interest to make this adjustment. This is typically the case when correcting a material error in a fiscal calculation that affects provincial finances and public trust in the federal fiscal system.

**Implications and Significance:**

- **Fiscal Integrity:** This regulation reinforces the accuracy and transparency of federal-provincial financial arrangements by correcting a significant data error.
- **Provincial Fiscal Equity:** By remitting the overpayment, the regulation ensures that provinces are not unfairly burdened by financial obligations due to a technical error in the calculation of equalization payments.
- **Accountability and Transparency:** It demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to accountability in fiscal policy and its willingness to correct mistakes when identified.
- **Impact on Provincial Budgets:** The province receiving the remission will have its net fiscal position corrected, potentially improving its financial stability during the period in question.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a targeted correction of a financial overpayment made to a specific province under the *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act*. It stems from an error in the capital gains refund data used in equalization calculations and results in the remission of a specified amount for the fiscal years 1993 to 2001. The action was taken in the public interest, under statutory authority, and serves to ensure fiscal accuracy and fairness in Canada’s federal-provincial financial system.
