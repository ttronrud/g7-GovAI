Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Transport**.
- It is grounded in **subsection 5.4(1) of the Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1)**, which defines the term *"airport site"*.
- This provision allows the government to designate specific lands as being required for the use of an airport, based on the need for aviation infrastructure and public safety.

#### **2. Title to the Lands**
- The **title to the lands** referenced in the schedule is **vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This means that the ownership of the land is held by the federal government (as representative of the Crown), not by private individuals or provincial authorities.
- This federal ownership is critical because it enables the government to designate and use the land for public purposes, such as airport development, without requiring land transfers or private consent.

#### **3. Declaration of Airport Site Use**
- The regulation **formally declares** that the lands listed in the attached schedule are **required for use as an airport**.
- This declaration is not merely a designation but a legal affirmation that the land is **intended and necessary** for the operation and development of an airport facility.
- The declaration serves as a **public and legal basis** for:
  - Land use planning,
  - Infrastructure development,
  - Zoning and environmental assessments,
  - Potential future expansions or operations of the airport.

#### **4. Specific Land Designation – Pickering Airport Site**
- The lands in question are specifically identified as part of the **Pickering airport site**.
- The schedule lists the **land titles** of the parcels included in the declaration.
- **Exclusions**: Two specific parcels are **exempted** from the declaration:
  - Land described in **instrument D165716**
  - Land described in **instrument D494890**
  - These instruments are registered in the **Registry Division of Durham**, Ontario.
- The exclusions suggest that these parcels are either:
  - Not part of the airport development,
  - Subject to different land use or private ownership,
  - Reserved for other purposes (e.g., residential, agricultural, or conservation).

#### **5. Location and Mapping Reference**
- The designated lands are located in the **Province of Ontario**.
- They are **visually identified** on a specific plan:
  - **Plan Index No. 97-30-1**, dated **July 30, 1997**.
  - The plan shows the lands **outlined in blue**, indicating the area designated for airport use.
- The plan is held on record at **Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC)** in **North York, Ontario**.
- This provides a **geographic and administrative reference** for stakeholders, including planners, local governments, environmental agencies, and the public.

#### **6. Purpose and Implications**
- The declaration serves several key functions:
  - **Legal justification** for the federal government to use the land for airport purposes.
  - **Facilitation of development** by establishing a clear, official boundary and purpose.
  - **Protection of the land** from unauthorized development or use that would interfere with airport operations.
  - **Support for regulatory processes**, such as environmental assessments, infrastructure planning, and land-use agreements.

#### **7. Regulatory Context**
- This regulation is part of a broader framework under the **Aeronautics Act**, which governs the establishment, operation, and development of airports in Canada.
- The use of the term *"airport site"* under subsection 5.4(1) ensures that only lands meeting specific criteria (e.g., proximity to air traffic, operational needs, safety) are designated for such use.
- The federal government retains control over these lands, which allows for consistent national standards in aviation infrastructure.
