**Detailed Summary of the *Potable Water on Board Trains, Vessels, Aircraft and Buses Regulations* (S.C. 1996, c. 8)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Potable Water on Board Trains, Vessels, Aircraft and Buses Regulations*, enacted under the authority of the *Department of Health Act*, establishes comprehensive standards for the provision, handling, and safety of potable (drinkable) water on board conveyances that transport passengers across Canada. These regulations are designed to protect public health by ensuring that water used for drinking, food preparation, handwashing, and ice production is free from harmful contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, and chemical or radiological pollutants.

The regulations apply specifically to large-scale interprovincial or international transportation services and do not extend to urban transit or certain limited domestic voyages.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Contamination** | The presence of chemical, physical, radiological, or microbiological substances in water — *excluding disinfection* — in quantities that render or may render the water non-potable. |
| **Disinfection** | A process (chemical, physical, or radiological) intended to inactivate human pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Part of a broader decontamination process. |
| **Operator** | A person or entity engaged in transporting passengers commercially. |
| **Passenger** | A traveler under a contract of carriage; excludes crew members (e.g., pilots, drivers, masters). |
| **Potable Water System** | Equipment used on board for handling, treating, storing, or distributing water for passenger use (excluding containers or bottled water). |
| **Potable Water Container** | A refillable container used for water that meets specific standards (excluding prepackaged bottled water). |
| **Vessel** | Any boat, ship, or watercraft used for transportation. |

## **Scope and Applicability**

### **Who Must Comply?**
Operators authorized to transport **at least 25 passengers** on any of the following conveyances **must comply**, unless exempted:

- Aircraft  
- Vessels used for **interprovincial or international transport**  
- Buses used for **interprovincial or international transport**  
- Trains used for **interprovincial or international transport**, or on railways declared to serve the general advantage of Canada  

> ⚠️ **Exemptions Apply To:**
> - Conveyances used solely for **urban transit** (e.g., city buses, subways).
> - Vessels that travel through Canada without stopping for passenger embarkation/disembarkation and have both departure and destination outside Canada.
> - Vessels operating entirely within a single province, traveling through another province or country without stops for passengers.

### **Foreign Operators**
- Section 12, paragraph 13(c), and sections 19 and 22 **do not apply** if a foreign operator makes **only one stop** in Canada for passenger boarding or alighting.

---

## **Purpose of Water Provision**

Water must be provided for the following **critical purposes**:
1. **Drinking, handwashing, and oral hygiene** by passengers  
2. **Food preparation**, including:
   - Cleaning food-contact surfaces
   - Washing utensils (kitchenware, tableware, etc.)
   - Handwashing of food handlers
3. **Ice production** for:
   - Contact refrigeration of food
   - Adding to beverages

> ✅ All provided water must be **potable** and **in sufficient quantity** to meet passenger needs.

---

## **Water Source Requirements**

Water must come from one of the following sources:
- A **potable water system** (must meet regulatory requirements)
- A **potable water container** (must meet requirements)
- A **bottle of prepackaged water**

### **Critical Safety Standard: E. coli**
- Water from systems or containers must **not exceed the maximum acceptable concentration of *Escherichia coli* (E. coli)** — which is **"none detectable" per 100 mL**.
- This is a key indicator of microbiological safety.

---

## **Prevention of Contamination**

### **General Provisions**
- Operators must ensure water is **free from contamination at the point of withdrawal from the supply source**.
- For vessels, **water must not be loaded from harbors or ports** — only from open waters during transit.

### **Decontamination of Salt Water**
- Saltwater may be made potable via:
  - **Reverse osmosis** or **distillation**, or both
  - Plus any other necessary decontamination process

### **Decontamination of Fresh Water**
- Fresh water must undergo:
  - **Filtration**
  - **Disinfection**

> ⚠️ Despite these exceptions, **no water may be loaded from a harbor or port** — even if decontaminated later.

---

## **Ice Safety Requirements**

### **On-Board Ice**
- Must be made from water that meets **sections 4–7** (i.e., potable, free from contamination).
- Must comply with **guidelines in section 5** (e.g., microbiological safety).
- Prevent contamination during:
  - Loading
  - Movement
  - Storage
- Use of tools like **ice scoops or tongs** to avoid direct contact and contamination.

### **Off-Board Ice**
- May be used **only if** measures are taken to ensure it is free from contamination when taken from the supplier.

---

## **Design and Operation of Potable Water Systems**

Systems must be designed, constructed, and operated to:
1. Protect the system during **loading of water**
2. Prevent **backflow**
3. Protect **filling connections and cross-connections**
4. Prevent **tampering**

> ✅ Components must be **clearly identifiable** (e.g., labeled) to avoid confusion with other systems.  
> ✅ Each storage tank and filling point must have a **visible, legible label**.

---

## **Water Sampling and Testing Requirements**

### **Sampling Sites and Frequencies**

| Conveyance | Sampling Sites | Frequency |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Aircraft** | Tap in galley/bar; tap in one lavatory; if missing, substitute taps | Options:  
- Once every 3 months (min. 45 days between samples)  
- Once every 6 months (min. 90 days) + disinfection every 4 months  
- Once every 12 months (min. 180 days) + disinfection every 3 months |
| **Rail Cars (trains)** | Tap in galley/bar; tap in one lavatory; if missing, substitute taps | Options:  
- Once every 12 months (min. 180 days)  
- Once every 24 months (min. 360 days) + disinfection every 4 months  
- Once every 36 months (min. 540 days) + disinfection every 3 months |
| **Vessels** | Tap in galley/bar; tap in one lavatory; if missing, substitute taps | Options:  
- Once every 3 months (min. 45 days)  
- Once every 6 months (min. 90 days) + disinfection every 4 months  
- Once every 12 months (min. 180 days) + disinfection every 3 months |

> 📌 **Sampling must occur at specific locations**:
> - Galley or bar
> - One lavatory facility
> - If no tap available, another tap in a different location
> - If only one tap exists, that tap is sufficient

### **Testing Method**
- Samples must be analyzed using **Part 9000 of the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater**, jointly published by:
  - American Public Health Association (APHA)
  - American Water Works Association (AWWA)
  - Water Environment Federation (WEF)

> This method is updated periodically and is internationally recognized for microbiological testing.

## **Corrective Actions Upon Contamination**

If water fails to meet standards or contamination is suspected:

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - **Disinfect, decontaminate, repair, or replace** the potable water system
   - **Flush** the system to ensure all contaminants are removed before use
   - **Investigate** the cause of contamination
   - **Assess** all other conveyances in the operator’s fleet to determine if they were also affected

2. **Scope of Action:**
   - If only a **portion** of the system is repaired or cleaned, **only that part** needs disinfection and flushing.

3. **Post-Corrective Sampling:**
   - After disinfection or repair, **new water samples must be taken** from the same sites to verify the water is now free from contamination.

---

## **Routine Disinfection and Flushing Requirements**

A potable water system must be disinfected and flushed under the following conditions:

- **At the frequency** specified in the schedule for the conveyance type (linked to sampling frequency)
- **Before placing the system into service** or returning it after seasonal shutdown
- **After any repair, cleaning, or maintenance activity** that could lead to contamination

> Example: After a repair, only the affected section needs disinfection.

---

## **Recordkeeping Requirements**

Operators must maintain detailed, accessible records for all relevant activities. Records must be retained for **at least 12 months** after the event or sample date, with exceptions:

| Record Type | Retention Period |
|
