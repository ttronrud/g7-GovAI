**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument:**
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Central and Eastern Portions of the South Slave Region) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**
The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer)** in order to **facilitate the negotiation and conclusion of Aboriginal land agreements** in the Central and Eastern portions of the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories.

This withdrawal ensures that these lands are not subject to competitive bidding or commercial development during a critical period when Indigenous communities are engaging in land claims and treaty processes.

---

### **Scope of Withdrawal:**

1. **Withdrawn Lands:**
   - The tracts listed in **Schedule 1** are **withdrawn from disposal**, including **surface rights**.
   - The tracts listed in **Schedule 2** are **withdrawn from disposal**, including **both surface and subsurface rights**.

2. **Duration of Withdrawal:**
   - The withdrawal is effective for a period of **two years**, beginning on the date the Order comes into force.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exceptions):**

Despite the general withdrawal, the following activities or interests are **explicitly excluded** from the provisions of Section 2 (which would otherwise apply to all disposals):

#### **1. Mineral and Resource Activities:**
- **Locating a mineral claim** by a holder of a prospecting permit granted *before* the Order came into effect.
- **Recording a mineral claim** that was referred to in paragraph (a) or located *before* the Order came into effect.
- **Granting a lease** under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person with a recorded claim, if the lease covers an area within the recorded claim.
- **Issuance of a significant discovery licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of an exploration licence issued *before* the Order came into effect, if the licence covers the same area as the exploration licence.
- **Issuance of a production licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*:
  - To a holder of a significant discovery licence (referenced above), if the production licence covers the same area.
  - To a holder of an exploration or significant discovery licence issued *before* the Order came into effect, if the production licence covers the same area.
- **Issuance of a surface lease** under the *Territorial Lands Act* to a holder of a recorded claim or interest under mining or petroleum laws, **if the lease is required to allow the holder to exercise rights** under the claim or interest.
- **Renewal of an interest** (e.g., mining or surface rights) that existed prior to the Order.

> These exclusions ensure that existing rights and ongoing development activities — particularly those initiated before the Order — are not disrupted.

### **Reference Maps and Land Designations (Land Working Group Recommendations):**

Two key sets of land parcels are specifically referenced based on recommendations from the **Land Working Group**, composed of representatives from:
- The **Athabasca Denesuline** (a First Nations community)
- The **Government of Canada**

These maps are **1:250,000 scale reference maps** that identify specific parcels of land. Copies of these maps have been deposited with the **Regional Manager, Land Administration, at Yellowknife, NWT**.

#### **1. Surface Lands:**
- All parcels shown as **Surface Lands** on the recommended maps are subject to withdrawal.
- **Existing interests remain unaffected**, including any **renewal options**.

#### **2. Surface-Subsurface Lands:**
- All parcels shown as **Surface-Subsurface Lands** on the recommended maps are subject to withdrawal.
- **Existing interests remain unaffected**, including any **renewal options**.

> This ensures that while the land is withdrawn from disposal, existing rights (such as leases, mineral claims, or development rights) are preserved and protected.

### **Key Principles and Implications:**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Aboriginal Land Agreements Priority** | The Order prioritizes Indigenous land rights and negotiations by removing lands from the public disposal pool during the negotiation phase. |
| **Non-Disruption of Pre-existing Rights** | Activities initiated before the Order (e.g., mineral claims, leases) are protected and continue without interference. |
| **Clarity and Certainty** | The regulation provides clear boundaries and exclusions to prevent confusion among stakeholders (e.g., mining companies, Indigenous groups, government agencies). |
| **Inclusive Process** | The involvement of the Land Working Group — including Athabasca Denesuline — reflects a collaborative and culturally sensitive approach to land governance. |
| **Temporary Nature** | The two-year withdrawal is not permanent; after this period, the lands may become available again for disposal, unless further agreements are reached. |

---

### **Conclusion:**

This Order is a **strategic, temporary measure** designed to support the negotiation of Aboriginal land agreements in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories. By withdrawing specific tracts from disposal — while protecting pre-existing rights and allowing continuity in mineral and energy activities — the regulation balances **Indigenous self-determination**, **resource development interests**, and **legal certainty**.

It underscores the federal government’s commitment to **meaningful engagement with First Nations** in land governance and reflects a broader policy shift toward **Aboriginal land rights and co-governance** in Canada’s northern territories.

**Final Note:**  
This Order does not create new rights or obligations. It only restricts the *disposal* of certain lands for a defined period. All rights (including renewal rights) that existed prior to the Order remain intact and are not affected.
