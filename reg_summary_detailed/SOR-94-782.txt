**Detailed Summary of the Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 5**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Territorial Lands Act**, specifically **paragraph 29(1)(a)**, which permits the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to authorize certain employees of the Government of Canada to acquire interests in territorial lands within the Northwest Territories (NWT).

This Order is formally titled:  
**"Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 5"**  
and serves as a statutory instrument enabling specific government employees to acquire land rights through assignment from current lessees.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this Order is to **facilitate the acquisition of specific parcels of land in the Northwest Territories by designated Government of Canada employees**. These acquisitions are not for private development or profit but are intended to support government operations, infrastructure, or environmental monitoring activities.

The land is being acquired via **assignment from the current lessee**, meaning the employee does not purchase the land directly from the Crown but instead obtains the interest by transferring it from the existing leaseholder, under the terms and conditions permitted by the Territorial Lands Act.

---

### **7. Significance and Context**
This Order reflects a **limited, targeted use of government land acquisition powers** under the Territorial Lands Act. It underscores:
- The government’s ability to assign land to employees for operational needs  
- The balance between enabling administrative efficiency and protecting Crown interests, especially in natural resource sectors  
- The importance of **mineral rights protection** in federal land management, particularly in regions like the NWT with significant natural resource potential  

Such orders are typically issued in response to specific operational requirements—such as establishing facilities for public services, environmental monitoring stations, or administrative offices—where direct land ownership is necessary for effective service delivery.

---

### **8. Conclusion**
The **Government Employees Land Acquisition Order, 1994, No. 5** authorizes two specific employees of the Government of Canada to acquire surface rights to defined parcels of land in the Northwest Territories through assignment from current lessees. The acquisitions are strictly limited to surface use, with **all mineral and hydrocarbon rights expressly reserved** for the Crown. This Order ensures that government operations can proceed efficiently while maintaining legal and environmental safeguards over natural resources.

It exemplifies a practical application of federal land policy in northern Canada, balancing administrative necessity with resource stewardship.
