**Detailed Summary of the New Brunswick Primary Forest Products Order (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2)**

---

### **Overview**

The *New Brunswick Primary Forest Products Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, under **Section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. This Order establishes the framework for the regulation of the **interprovincial and export marketing** of *primary forest products* in New Brunswick, specifically through designated **Forest Products Marketing Boards**.

The Order is designed to ensure fair, orderly, and sustainable marketing practices for forest product producers, particularly those operating on private woodlots, by enabling the Boards to regulate trade beyond provincial borders and to manage financial aspects such as levies, reserves, and loss-sharing mechanisms.

### **Key Definitions**

The Order introduces and defines several key terms that govern its application:

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Natural Product Act (S.N.B. 1999, c. N-1.2)*, as amended from time to time.  
   → This Act provides the legal foundation for the regulation of natural products, including forest products, and is central to the Board’s authority.

2. **Board**  
   Refers to a **Forest Products Marketing Board** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**.  
   → Each Board is responsible for a specific region or type of forest product and operates under a defined marketing plan.

3. **Plan**  
   Refers to the **Marketing Plan** established by regulation (as amended over time) and listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule** for each Board.  
   → The Plan outlines the rules, pricing mechanisms, marketing strategies, and operational procedures for the Board’s jurisdiction.

4. **Primary Forest Product**  
   Defined as:  
   → Any **unmanufactured product derived from forest trees** of **hardwood or softwood species**.  
   → **Exclusions**:  
     - Products from **coniferous trees cut for sale as Christmas trees**.  
     - **Maple sap products** (e.g., maple syrup).  
   → This definition ensures that only raw, unprocessed timber or wood-based products are covered under the Order.

5. **Private Woodlot, Producer, and Regulated Area**  
   These terms are defined in **Column 2 of the Schedule** for each Board.  
   → They specify:  
     - Who qualifies as a *producer* (e.g., forest owners or operators).  
     - What constitutes a *private woodlot* (i.e., land owned by individuals or entities for timber production).  
     - The geographic *regulated area* where the Board has jurisdiction over production and marketing.

### **Core Powers and Authority of the Boards**

Each Board is granted broad powers to regulate the **marketing of primary forest products** in two key areas:

#### **1. Interprovincial and Export Trade Regulation**
- Boards are authorized to regulate the **sale, distribution, and export** of primary forest products produced by producers on private woodlots within their regulated area.
- This includes setting rules for pricing, quality standards, market access, and trade practices in both **interprovincial markets** (e.g., to other provinces) and **export markets** (e.g., to international buyers).

#### **2. Exercise of Powers Equivalent to Local Marketing Authority**
- With respect to persons and property **within New Brunswick**, the Board may exercise **all or any powers** that it would otherwise have under:
  - Its **Marketing Plan**  
  - The **Natural Product Act**  
  → This allows Boards to maintain consistent standards and oversight across both local and external markets.

---

### **Levies and Charges**

The Boards have the authority to:

- **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities in New Brunswick who are involved in:
  - The **production** of primary forest products  
  - The **marketing** of those products  
  → These levies apply only to producers operating on private woodlots within the Board’s regulated area.

- **Classify producers into groups** (e.g., small producers vs. large-scale operations) and **set different levies or charges** for each group.  
  → This enables equitable and flexible financial structures based on producer size, output, or market role.

- **Use collected levies and charges for specific purposes**, including:
  - Creating **financial reserves** (to cushion against market downturns)  
  - Covering **operational expenses** (e.g., marketing, administration)  
  - Paying for **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of forest products (e.g., price drops, market volatility)  
  - **Equalizing or adjusting** the financial returns among producers  
    → For example, if a small producer sells a lower price due to market forces, the Board may use funds to compensate them, ensuring more equitable outcomes.

> This financial mechanism supports **producer stability** and **market fairness**, especially in volatile or unpredictable markets.

---

### **Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized in the official gazette).  
→ This ensures immediate applicability upon formal adoption.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this Order are:

1. **Market Stability**  
   To prevent price volatility and ensure stable markets for primary forest products through coordinated regulation.

2. **Fairness Among Producers**  
   To ensure that all producers—especially small and medium-sized ones—benefit from market outcomes, including through loss-sharing and reserve mechanisms.

3. **Sustainable Development**  
   To promote responsible forest management and long-term viability of the forestry sector in New Brunswick.

4. **Interprovincial and Export Competitiveness**  
   To enable New Brunswick producers to participate effectively in broader Canadian and international markets through structured, transparent marketing practices.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Excluded products**:  
  - Christmas tree conifers (cut for sale)  
  - Maple sap-based products (e.g., syrup)  
  → These are excluded from the scope of this Order, likely because they are considered distinct in terms of production, value chain, or market dynamics.

- **Local marketing** is not the sole focus; the Order emphasizes **interprovincial and export trade**, reflecting a focus on broader economic integration.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *New Brunswick Primary Forest Products Order* is a significant piece of regulatory policy that empowers **Forest Products Marketing Boards** to manage the **marketing and financial sustainability** of primary forest products across New Brunswick and beyond. By allowing Boards to:

- Regulate interprovincial and export trade  
- Impose and classify levies  
- Use funds for reserves, expenses, and loss sharing  

...the Order promotes **economic stability, equity, and long-term viability** in the province’s forestry sector.

It operates within the legal framework of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act* and the *Natural Product Act*, ensuring that the regulatory process is grounded in established legal authority and aligned with provincial economic goals.
