**Detailed Summary of the "Export of Logs Permit" Regulation**

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Export of Logs Permit* and may be cited as **General Export Permit No. Ex. 5**. This permit serves as a general authorization allowing specific types of wood logs to be exported from Canada under defined conditions.

---

**2. Scope of Authorization**  
Any individual or entity (including private individuals, companies, or organizations) may export logs of all kinds of wood from Canada to any country, provided that the export complies with the conditions outlined in this permit. The authority is granted under the general framework of Canadian export regulations and is administered through the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), specifically through the collector of customs at the Canadian port of exit.

**3. Eligible Exported Logs**  
Only specific types of peeled or processed wood logs are authorized under this permit. The following categories qualify for export:

- **Peeled poles, peeled piling, or peeled crib timber** with a **top diameter of 11 inches or less**.  
  - "Peeled" means the outer bark has been removed.  
  - "Poles" are long, straight, cylindrical logs typically used for construction or support.  
  - "Piling" refers to timber used for foundation support, especially in wet or unstable ground.  
  - "Crib timber" is used in the construction of retaining walls or cribbing systems.  
  - The diameter restriction ensures that only smaller-dimension logs are eligible, likely to reduce environmental and forestry concerns.

- **Posts or pitprops**  
  - "Posts" are vertical timber elements used in fencing, construction, or structural support.  
  - "Pitprops" are timber supports used historically in mines to prop up underground workings.  
  - These items are typically processed and may be used in construction or industrial applications.

- **Boomsticks or swifters used as bindings on floating booms**  
  - "Boomsticks" are long, sturdy timber supports used in floating structures (e.g., on rivers or lakes).  
  - "Swifters" are used to secure or bind floating booms (used in transportation or temporary structures).  
  - These items must be used in their original functional form and not altered for other purposes.

> **Note**: The permit does **not** cover unpeeled logs, large-diameter logs (over 11 inches), or logs intended for general lumber or timber products. Only processed, specific types of logs are eligible.

**4. Requirement for Certification**  
To export under this permit, the exporter must present a **certificate** to the collector of customs at the Canadian port of exit. This certificate must be:

- **Satisfactory to the collector of customs**  
- Clearly stating that the export consists of one of the authorized types of logs (as listed above)

The certificate serves as official documentation that the export meets the conditions of General Export Permit No. Ex. 5 and is essential for customs clearance.

**5. Reporting Requirements (Customs Act Compliance)**  
If the exported goods are subject to reporting obligations under the *Customs Act* (e.g., for customs declarations, value reporting, or tracking), the reporting form must include one of the following statements:

- **In English**: “Exported under the authority of General Export Permit No. Ex. 5”  
- **In French**: “Exporté en vertu de la Licence générale d’exportation no Ex. 5”

> This requirement ensures transparency and traceability of exports under this permit. It also helps customs authorities verify that the export was authorized under the correct regulatory framework.

---

**6. Purpose and Regulatory Context**  
This permit is designed to:

- Facilitate the export of specific, non-forest-product timber items that are processed or have limited environmental impact.  
- Reduce the need for individual, case-by-case permits for small-scale, non-essential timber exports.  
- Promote compliance with Canadian forestry and environmental policies by restricting exports to logs that are already processed and not considered high-risk in terms of deforestation or ecological harm.

---

**7. Key Limitations and Exclusions**  
- **Not applicable to**:  
  - Unpeeled logs  
  - Logs with a top diameter greater than 11 inches  
  - Logs intended for general lumber, plywood, or sawn timber  
  - Logs not used in the specified functional applications (e.g., boomsticks used for other purposes)

- **Not a blanket export license**: It is highly specific and only applies to the listed types of processed logs.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Export of Logs Permit (General Export Permit No. Ex. 5)* provides a streamlined, regulated pathway for the export of certain processed wood products from Canada. It is intended to balance trade facilitation with environmental and regulatory oversight. Exporters must ensure compliance with the strict product type, size, and documentation requirements to legally export under this permit. The inclusion of the required statement on customs forms further supports regulatory accountability and transparency.
