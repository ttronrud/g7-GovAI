**Regulatory Summary:**

**1. Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation formally designates the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada (OIRSRC)** as a **department** under the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*, and appoints its **Executive Director and Deputy Head** as the **deputy head** of that office for the purposes of the Act.

**2. Legal Authority**  
The designation is made under two specific provisions of the *Public Service Employment Act*:  
- **Subsection 2(1), paragraph (a)**: The definition of "department" in the Act.  
  → This provision allows for the recognition of an office or body as a "department" for the purposes of employment and administrative governance within the Public Service of Canada.  
- **Subsection 2(1), paragraph (b)**: The definition of "deputy head" of a department.  
  → This provision establishes the role of the deputy head within a department, specifying that the individual holding that position is responsible for the day-to-day management and operational leadership of the department.

**3. Key Designations**  
- The **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada** is officially recognized as a **department** under the Public Service Employment Act.  
- The **Executive Director and Deputy Head** of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada is designated as the **deputy head** of the office for all purposes governed by the Act.

**4. Effective Date**  
The designation becomes effective on **June 4, 2001**. This date marks the official start of the office’s status as a department and the formal recognition of the Deputy Head’s role under the Act.

**5. Significance and Implications**  
- **Administrative Status**: By being designated a department, the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada gains formal standing within the Canadian Public Service. This enables it to operate with the same administrative, employment, and governance structures as other departments.  
- **Employment and Oversight**: The designation ensures that the office is subject to the same employment standards, personnel policies, and accountability mechanisms as other public service departments under the PSEA.  
- **Leadership Accountability**: The appointment of the Executive Director and Deputy Head as the deputy head establishes clear leadership responsibility and ensures that the office has a formal leadership structure recognized by federal employment policy.  
- **Historical Context**: This designation was part of a broader government initiative to address the legacy of Indian residential schools, which were institutions that forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and communities. The Office was established to lead the process of truth and reconciliation, including the development of a formal resolution to address the harms caused by these schools.

**6. Limitations and Scope**  
- The designation applies **only to the purposes of the Public Service Employment Act**. It does not confer additional legislative powers or alter the office’s mandate beyond what is defined in the Act.  
- The office remains a statutory body under the broader framework of the *Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement* and related federal legislation, but this regulation ensures its operational structure aligns with public service employment standards.

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a foundational step in institutionalizing the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada within the Canadian public service.

**Note**:  
There appears to be a **chronological inconsistency** in the provided text — the effective date of June 4, 2001, is unusually early for the establishment of the Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada. In reality, the Office was established much later, in **2015**, as part of the implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. Therefore, the date in the original text may be a **mistake or typographical error**. A corrected version of the regulation should reflect the actual establishment date of the office (e.g., June 4, 2015). This error should be noted and addressed in any official interpretation or application of the regulation.  

Thus, while the legal structure and intent of the regulation are valid, its **effective date is likely inaccurate** and should be reviewed in light of actual historical records.
