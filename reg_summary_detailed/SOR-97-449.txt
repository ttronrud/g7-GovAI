### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation grants specific **privileges and immunities** to certain experts—specifically **Inspectors, Inspection Assistants, and Observers**—who are conducting missions on behalf of the **Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)** in Canada.

### **Key Definitions in the Order**

1. **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC):**  
   Refers to the *Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction*, adopted on January 13, 1993, in Paris. This is the international treaty that establishes the legal framework for the elimination of chemical weapons globally.

2. **Convention:**  
   Refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the *Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act*. This is the foundational international legal instrument that governs the rights and immunities granted to UN bodies and their personnel.

3. **Organization:**  
   Refers to the **Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)**, established under **Article VIII of the Chemical Weapons Convention**. The OPCW is the international body responsible for implementing the CWC, including verifying compliance with chemical weapons prohibitions through inspections.

### **Privileges and Immunities Granted**

The regulation grants to **Inspectors, Inspection Assistants, and Observers**—acting as experts performing missions for the OPCW—the following **privileges and immunities in Canada**, **to the extent required for the exercise of their functions**:

- **Immunity from civil and criminal liability** in Canada arising from their official duties during the course of their missions.
- **Immunity from arrest and detention** in Canada while performing their functions.
- **Immunity from search and seizure** of personal property or documents related to their official duties.
- **Exemption from certain administrative and procedural requirements** that might otherwise interfere with their inspection work (e.g., customs procedures, entry restrictions, or local reporting obligations).
- **Freedom of movement** within Canada to carry out inspection activities.

These privileges and immunities are derived from **Article VI of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations** (the "Convention"), which provides a legal basis for such protections for personnel of international organizations engaged in official duties.

> **Note:** The privileges and immunities are **limited to the extent required** for the performance of their specific functions. This means they do not extend beyond what is necessary for carrying out inspections, and they are not absolute or unlimited in scope.

### **Scope of Application**

- Applies specifically to individuals performing **inspection missions** for the OPCW in Canada.
- Includes three categories:
  - **Inspectors** – Main personnel conducting inspections of chemical weapons stockpiles or facilities.
  - **Inspection Assistants** – Support staff assisting inspectors in carrying out field inspections.
  - **Observers** – Individuals observing inspections to ensure transparency and compliance (e.g., for verification purposes).

These experts are recognized as **"experts performing missions for the Organization"** under the CWC framework.
