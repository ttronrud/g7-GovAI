**Detailed Summary of the Textiles and Apparel Remission Order, 2014**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**

This regulation, known as the *Textiles and Apparel Remission Order, 2014*, was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, under **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j); S.C. 1997, c. 36).

This provision allows for the **remission (i.e., refund or cancellation) of customs duties** that were previously paid or payable under the Customs Tariff, in specific circumstances where there was an administrative error by the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** in issuing authorizations for remission.

The Order is a **corrective measure** to address past administrative errors related to the initial remission orders that were issued during the early stages of the remission program for textiles and apparel imports.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to:

- **Correct an administrative error** committed by the CBSA in the issuance of remission authorizations for certain textile and apparel imports.
- Provide a **formal and legally binding mechanism** to refund customs duties that were improperly or erroneously withheld or applied.
- Ensure **fairness and accuracy** in the customs duty system by allowing eligible companies to recover duties that were mistakenly not remitted.

### **4. Conditions for Eligibility**

To qualify for remission, a company must meet **all three of the following conditions**:

#### **(a) Import Period**
- The goods must have been **imported into Canada between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012**.

> This establishes a time-bound window for eligibility, ensuring the remission applies only to imports within a specific five-year period.

#### **(b) Authorization Date**
- The **authorization for remission** must have been issued to the company **on or before December 31, 2012**.

> This condition ensures that only remission authorizations issued within a reasonable timeframe (i.e., not retroactively) are eligible, and prevents claims for authorizations issued after the deadline.

#### **(c) Application Deadline**
- An **application for remission must be submitted to the CBSA by the deadline specified in column 2 of Schedule 2** of the Order.

> Each initial remission order (as listed in column 1 of Schedule 2) has a **distinct application deadline**. These deadlines are tied to the original remission orders and are critical for timely processing.

> If the application is submitted **after** the deadline, the company will **not** be eligible for remission under this Order.

### **5. Calculation of Remission Amount**

- The **amount of remission granted to each company** is determined **based on the original remission order** under which the authorization was issued.
- This means the refund amount is **not arbitrary**; it is directly calculated from the terms of the initial remission order that was issued to the company.
- The remission is **not a general refund** but a **specific, calculated refund** based on the original duty amount that was improperly retained.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- This Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- Registration is a formal legal step required for a regulation to become enforceable.

---

### **7. Key Legal and Administrative Implications**

- **Administrative Error Correction**: The Order acknowledges that the CBSA made an error in its initial processing of remission requests. This reflects a commitment to accountability and accuracy in customs administration.
- **Time-Sensitive Process**: The strict deadlines (especially the application deadline in column 2 of Schedule 2) emphasize the importance of timely action by companies. This may serve as a deterrent against delayed claims.
- **Limited Scope**: The remission applies only to a **specific group of companies** and **specific import periods**, indicating it is a targeted, corrective measure rather than a broad policy change.
- **No Retroactive Application**: The Order does not extend beyond the defined import and authorization periods, reinforcing the principle of fairness and predictability.

### **8. Practical Impact on Businesses**

For the listed companies:

- They may be eligible to **recover customs duties** that were incorrectly withheld or applied during the 2008–2012 period.
- They must **review their records** to confirm that:
  - The goods were imported within the 2008–2012 window.
  - The remission authorization was issued by December 31, 2012.
  - They submitted a formal application by the deadline in Schedule 2.
- They must **act promptly** to meet the application deadline, as missing it will result in disqualification.

### **9. Conclusion**

The *Textiles and Apparel Remission Order, 2014* is a targeted, legally grounded correction to past administrative errors in the customs remission process. It provides a clear, structured pathway for eligible textile and apparel companies to recover duties that were improperly retained due to CBSA administrative oversight.

It reflects a balance between **correcting past mistakes** and **maintaining procedural rigor** through defined eligibility criteria, deadlines, and calculation methods. The Order serves as both a **corrective and preventive tool** in the broader framework of customs administration and trade policy.
