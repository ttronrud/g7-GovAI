## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Regulations Designating Regulatory Provisions for Purposes of Enforcement (Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999)**

---

### **1. Legal Background and Context**

This regulation was issued under the authority of the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, specifically:

- **Section 332(1)a** of CEPA 1999: Grants the Minister of the Environment the power to publish proposed regulations designating specific provisions of the Act for enforcement purposes.
- **Section 286.1c** of CEPA 1999: Authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to adopt and promulgate those proposed regulations after public consultation.

The regulation was **first proposed** and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 2, 2011**, giving stakeholders (industries, environmental groups, the public) a formal opportunity to:
- Submit written comments, or
- File a **notice of objection** requesting that a **board of review** be established to examine the regulation.

This public consultation process ensures transparency, accountability, and stakeholder input before enforcement measures are finalized.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of these Regulations is to **designate specific provisions of CEPA 1999** as being enforceable by the Canadian government. This means that these provisions are no longer merely advisory or general policy statements — they become **legally binding and subject to enforcement actions** by environmental authorities.

In particular, the designated provisions are intended to be enforceable under **paragraph 272(1)(h)** of CEPA 1999, which provides that the Minister may enforce provisions that relate to:
> "the prevention or reduction of pollution or the protection of the environment."

Thus, the regulation enables the government to take legal action against individuals or entities that violate these designated environmental standards.

### **4. Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 80 of the Environmental Enforcement Act (S.C. 2009, c. 14)** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered (officially published) after that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that enforcement mechanisms are activated in alignment with the broader enforcement framework established by the Environmental Enforcement Act.

> **Note**: These regulations were **in force as of June 22, 2012** (as referenced in SI/2012-47), indicating that they were finalized and implemented by that date.

### **5. Key Enforcement Implications**

By designating these provisions as enforceable, the government gains the legal authority to:

- **Issue compliance notices** to businesses or individuals.
- **Initiate enforcement actions** (e.g., fines, penalties, orders to stop or correct violations).
- **Conduct inspections and audits** to verify compliance.
- **Pursue legal remedies** if violations occur, including court action or administrative penalties.

This designation strengthens the **enforceability and practical application** of CEPA 1999, making it a more effective tool for protecting the environment from pollution and harmful practices.
