**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title of Regulation:**  
Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat

**Legal Basis:**  
- The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207).  
- This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reassign the control and supervision of certain federal public administration functions between different ministers.

**Subject of the Transfer:**  
The **Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat (CICS)** — a federal entity responsible for supporting intergovernmental coordination between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments.

**Transfer Details:**  
- The **control and supervision** of the CICS is being transferred from the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.

**Purpose and Context:**  
This transfer reflects a strategic realignment of responsibilities within the federal government to better align administrative oversight with the policy priorities of the receiving ministry. The Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat plays a key role in facilitating cooperation, policy coordination, and communication between federal, provincial, and territorial authorities on matters such as infrastructure, emergency management, and public safety.

By moving the secretariat under the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, the federal government is signaling a greater emphasis on intergovernmental coordination in areas related to public safety, emergency preparedness, disaster response, and national resilience. This reorganization may enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-jurisdictional planning and response efforts, particularly in times of crisis.

**Legal Authority and Process:**  
- The Governor General in Council acts on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, ensuring that the transfer is politically and administratively sound.  
- The transfer is not a change in the entity’s structure or mandate but a shift in **administrative oversight and reporting lines** within the federal public service.  
- The transfer is governed by the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which provides a legal framework for such reallocations without requiring new legislation for each case.

**Relevant Statutes:**  
- *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  
- *Regulations of the Public Service Act* (R.S., c. P-34) — which provides the foundational rules for public service administration and reporting structures.

**Impact:**  
- The CICS will continue to operate under its core mandate of supporting intergovernmental dialogue and coordination.  
- However, its day-to-day management, policy direction, and reporting structure will now fall under the authority of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.  
- This may lead to increased integration of intergovernmental coordination into emergency management and public safety policy frameworks.

**Note on Terminology:**  
- "Control and supervision" in this context refers to administrative authority over staffing, budgeting, policy development, and operational oversight — not ownership or legal jurisdiction of the secretariat’s functions.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization aimed at improving intergovernmental coordination in the realm of public safety and emergency preparedness. By transferring the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Communities to the Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the federal government strengthens its capacity to manage cross-jurisdictional challenges related to safety, risk, and emergency response. The move underscores a strategic shift in how intergovernmental relations are managed in Canada, aligning them more closely with national safety and resilience priorities.
