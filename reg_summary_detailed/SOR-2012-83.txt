**Detailed Summary of the Appointment or Deployment of Alternates Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The *Appointment or Deployment of Alternates Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Public Service Commission, under **Section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General to make regulations to implement or clarify provisions of the Act, particularly in areas involving employment practices, job transitions, and employee rights within the federal public service.

**Regulatory Reference**  
These regulations are published in *Statutory Codification 2003, c. 22, sections 12 and 13*.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Alternate**  
   - An *alternate* is defined as an *indeterminate employee* who is formally appointed or deployed to take on the duties of an *opting employee*.  
   - Importantly, the alternate is not a permanent employee in the position but is placed temporarily or provisionally in the role of the opting employee.  
   - The term "indeterminate" means the employee does not have a fixed-term or permanent contract and may be subject to change or termination based on organizational needs.

2. **Opting Employee**  
   - An *opting employee* is an indeterminate employee whose work unit is being relocated, and who chooses not to relocate, or whose services are no longer required due to:
     - Lack of work;
     - Discontinuance of a function;
     - Transfer of work or a function outside the public service.
   - Crucially, the opting employee has **not received a guarantee of a reasonable job offer** in another position within the public service.  
   - This definition ensures that employees who are displaced due to organizational restructuring or closure are protected under the Act, and that those without a reasonable alternative job offer are eligible for alternate deployment.

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply **only to alternates** and **exclude them from certain provisions** of the Public Service Employment Act that typically govern employment rights, duties, and protections. Specifically, alternates are **not subject to** the following provisions:

- **Section 16, paragraph 22(2)(a)** – which may relate to notice periods or job security in certain circumstances.
- **Subsection 29(3)** – which may pertain to employment rights during restructuring.
- **Sections 30, 31, and 39.1 to 48** – which cover various aspects of employment, including job security, termination, and reemployment rights.
- **Subsection 51(4)** – which may involve protections during restructuring or reassignment.
- **Section 77** – which may relate to the rights of employees in the context of redundancy or transfer.

This exclusion is significant because it means that alternates are treated as *distinct from regular employees* during the period of their deployment, and are not entitled to the same protections or rights as other employees during restructuring or reassignment.

### **Key Obligations of an Alternate**

1. **Irrevocable Resignation**  
   - Upon appointment or deployment, the alternate must submit an **irrevocable resignation** from their current position in the public service.  
   - This resignation must be **accepted by the deputy head** of the relevant department or agency.  
   - The resignation must take effect **no later than five (5) days after the date of appointment or deployment**.

2. **Prohibition on Performing Duties**  
   - The alternate is **not permitted to perform the actual duties** of the opting employee’s position.  
   - This means the alternate is not to act in the role, take on responsibilities, or carry out tasks associated with the position, even if they are formally assigned to it.  
   - This restriction ensures that the alternate remains a placeholder or substitute, not a functioning employee in the role.

3. **Termination of Employment Status**  
   - The alternate **ceases to be an employee of the public service** on the day the irrevocable resignation takes effect.  
   - This effectively ends their employment relationship with the government, and they are no longer considered a public servant for any purposes under the PSEA.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day they are **registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, which is the official publication for federal statutes and regulations.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to provide a **structured, transparent, and legally defined process** for managing employee transitions during organizational changes — particularly when a work unit is being relocated or functions are being discontinued.

By creating a mechanism for deploying an alternate to a position vacated by an "opting employee," the government ensures that:

- There is continuity in service during transitions;
- Employees who are displaced due to restructuring are not left without a temporary role;
- The rights and obligations of both the opting employee and the alternate are clearly defined;
- The public service maintains legal compliance and fairness in employment practices.

However, the exclusion from key employment protections underscores that alternates are **not entitled to the same job security or rights** as regular employees, reflecting the temporary and non-employment nature of their role.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **No Job Security**: Alternates have no guarantee of continued employment or rehire.
- **No Duty Performance**: They cannot perform actual work in the role — only serve as a placeholder.
- **Final Employment End**: Their employment ends upon resignation, which is binding and irrevocable.
- **Restructuring Tool**: These regulations serve as a tool for managing workforce reductions or relocations without triggering full redundancy or severance processes.

### **Conclusion**

The *Appointment or Deployment of Alternates Regulations* establish a formal, legally binding framework for the temporary assignment of public service employees to fill roles vacated by those who choose not to relocate or whose services are no longer needed. While designed to ensure operational continuity during restructuring, the regulations clearly limit the rights and status of alternates, treating them as temporary placeholders who are not entitled to the same protections as regular employees. This reflects a balance between administrative flexibility and the need to uphold employment standards within the public service.
