The proclamation is grounded in two primary statutes:

- **Subsection 3(4) of the Business Development Bank of Canada Act**:
  - This provision states that the **Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC)** is, for all purposes, an **agent of the Crown**.
  - As a result, under the *Financial Administration Act*, **all issued shares of BDC’s subsidiaries are owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
