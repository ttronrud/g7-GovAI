### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this Order is to:
- **Authorize specific employees of the Government of Canada** to acquire legal interests (specifically, leasehold interests) in certain lands located within the **Northwest Territories (NWT)**.  
- This authorization allows federal employees to use government-owned land for personal, non-commercial purposes—specifically, for seasonal dwelling use.

### **3. Scope of Authorization**
- The Order authorizes **one named federal employee** to acquire an interest in a defined parcel of land.
- The employee is **Roselle Marie Scott**, a **Postal Clerk** employed by the **Canada Post Corporation**.
- The land in question is:
  - **Lot Numbered 1015**
  - Located on the **southerly shore of Prelude Lake**
  - Within **Quad 85 I/12** of the Northwest Territories
  - As shown on the **plan of survey of Record Number 65767**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Record at Ottawa**

### **4. Nature of the Interest Granted**
- The interest granted is a **lease** for the purpose of a **seasonal dwelling**.
- The lease is intended for **personal and residential use**, not commercial or industrial development.
- The lease covers the **entire area of Lot 1015**, with specific exclusions.

---

### **5. Exclusions and Reservations**
The Order explicitly **reserves and saves** the following rights:
- **All mines and minerals**, including:
  - Solid minerals (e.g., gold, uranium)
  - Liquid minerals (e.g., oil, natural gas)
  - Gaseous minerals (e.g., methane, natural gas)
- The **right to work** these minerals is retained by the Crown or relevant mineral rights holders.
- This means that while the employee may live on the land seasonally, they **do not have ownership or rights to extract or develop mineral resources** from the lot.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially recorded in the appropriate land registry system).
- Registration is a formal legal step that makes the Order enforceable under territorial land laws.

---

### **7. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This Order demonstrates how the federal government, through administrative procedures, can facilitate access to land for federal employees in remote areas, particularly in the NWT, where land use is often constrained by remoteness and limited housing options.
- It reflects a balance between:
  - **Employee needs** (providing housing for federal workers)
  - **Crown land stewardship** (preserving mineral rights and preventing unauthorized development)
- It is consistent with broader federal policies on land use, especially in northern regions, where land is often held in trust by the Crown and subject to strict use regulations.
