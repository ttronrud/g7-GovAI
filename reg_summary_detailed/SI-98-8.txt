**Detailed Summary of the Charitable Goods Remission Order (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2))**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The Charitable Goods Remission Order was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue. This action is authorized under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General to make orders related to the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes and duties under specific conditions.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **grant tax and duty remission** on goods donated by **non-residents of Canada** to **eligible Canadian institutions**. These institutions include:

- Religious organizations  
- Charitable organizations  
- Educational institutions  

This provision aims to encourage international charitable giving by reducing or eliminating the tax burden associated with such donations.

**3. Scope of Tax Remission**  
The Order provides for the **remission of the following taxes and duties**:

- **Excise taxes** under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act*, which typically covers taxes on goods such as fuel, tobacco, and certain manufactured products.  
- **Any other taxes** imposed under other parts of the *Excise Tax Act* that may apply to the donated goods.  
- **Customs duties** under **Section 21 of the Customs Tariff**, which are duties levied on imported goods entering Canada.

In essence, the Order eliminates the obligation to pay these taxes or duties on goods that are donated from a non-resident to a Canadian charitable, religious, or educational institution.

**4. Applicability Conditions**  
The remission applies **only when**:

- The **donor is a non-resident of Canada** (i.e., not a citizen or resident of Canada).  
- The **goods are donated** (not sold or otherwise transferred for commercial purposes).  
- The **recipient is a religious, charitable, or educational institution operating in Canada**.  

The donation must be made directly to the institution and not through a third party or intermediary in a way that circumvents the intent of the regulation.

**5. Exclusions**  
The Order does **not** apply to:

- Donations of goods that are subject to other tax regimes or are used for commercial or profit-making activities.  
- Goods donated to institutions that do not meet the defined categories (e.g., non-charitable, non-religious, or non-educational).  
- Donations that are not made in the context of charitable, religious, or educational purposes.  

**6. Repeal Clause**  
This Order is **repealed (cancelled or revoked)** on **January 1, 1998**. This means that the tax remission benefits provided by the Order no longer apply after that date. The repeal indicates that the policy was temporary or superseded by subsequent legislation or regulatory changes.

**7. Effective Date**  
The Order **came into force on January 1, 1998**, despite being issued in 1991. This suggests a delay in implementation, possibly due to administrative processes, legislative review, or policy alignment. The effective date marks when the remission benefits became operational for donations made or received from that point onward.

**Key Takeaways**  
- This Order is a **temporary, targeted relief measure** to encourage charitable giving from non-residents to Canadian institutions.  
- It provides **significant tax advantages** by eliminating excise taxes and customs duties on donated goods.  
- The benefits are **limited in scope and duration**, with the policy ending on January 1, 1998.  
- It reflects a broader policy goal of promoting international charitable cooperation and reducing barriers to cross-border donations.  

**Note on Current Relevance**  
As the Order was repealed in 1998, it is **no longer in effect** and does not apply under current Canadian tax law. Present-day tax treatment of donated goods from non-residents would be governed by current provisions of the *Excise Tax Act*, *Customs Tariff*, and other relevant legislation, which may differ significantly from the 1991 policy.  

For current tax implications, individuals or organizations must consult the most up-to-date guidance from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
