The provided text consists of three identical references to a repealed regulation:

**[Repealed, SOR/2006-319, s. 5]**

### Detailed Summary:

This notation indicates that **a specific section (section 5) of a regulation** was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **SOR/2006-319**, which is the **Statutory Instrument of 2006, No. 319**.

- **SOR** stands for "Statutory Instrument of the Regulations" (in Canadian legal terminology, these are secondary legislation issued under the authority of an act of Parliament).
- **2006-319** refers to the 319th statutory instrument issued in 2006.
- **Section 5** of the regulation previously in force was **officially removed or canceled** by this instrument.

### Key Points:

1. **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation referenced in section 5 is **no longer in force**. It has been **repealed**, meaning it is legally invalid and cannot be applied or enforced.

2. **Reason for Repeal**: While the specific reason for the repeal is not detailed in the provided text, such repeals are typically undertaken for one or more of the following reasons:
   - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
   - It was redundant due to the enactment of a new or more comprehensive regulation.
   - It conflicted with other laws or created administrative complexity.
   - It was superseded by a more effective or modern version.

3. **Legal Implications**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions that were previously set out in section 5 of the regulation are **no longer applicable**. Entities or individuals who previously relied on that section must now refer to the current, surviving provisions of the regulation or to a new one that has replaced it.

4. **Source of the Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2006-319**, which is a formal legislative instrument. This means the repeal was approved by the government and published in the Canada Gazette or the official journal of regulations.

5. **Need for Further Research**: Without the full text of the original regulation or the specific content of section 5, it is not possible to determine what the original section governed (e.g., licensing, reporting requirements, fees, etc.). To understand the substance of what was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to repeal or the explanatory notes accompanying SOR/2006-319.

### Conclusion:

The entry "[Repealed, SOR/2006-319, s. 5]" means that **Section 5 of a previously existing regulation has been formally canceled by Statutory Instrument 2006-319**. It is no longer legally enforceable. The regulation itself may have been part of a broader framework (such as a licensing, environmental, or safety regulation), but its specific content is now obsolete and must be replaced or referenced through current legislation. For precise details on the original subject matter, further research into the full text of the repealed regulation or the explanatory material of SOR/2006-319 is required.
