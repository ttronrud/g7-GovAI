### **Detailed Summary of the Fort St. John Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The **Fort St. John Airport Zoning Regulations** were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6 of the Aeronautics Act**. This establishes the legal foundation for regulating land use around Fort St. John Airport to ensure safety, operational efficiency, and environmental protection for aviation operations.

These regulations are formally titled the **Fort St. John Airport Zoning Regulations** and are binding on all relevant landowners and occupiers within the designated zone.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to Fort St. John Airport located in **Townships 83 and 84, Range 18, West of the Sixth Meridian**, in British Columbia.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point used as a datum for elevation and boundary measurements. It is marked by a brass monument set in concrete and is located:
  - 121.894 meters **northeasterly** from and **perpendicular to** the centerline of Runway 11–29.
  - Starting from a point 1,083.078 meters **southeasterly** along the centerline of Runway 11 from **Airport Control Monument 403**.
  - The **elevation of the ARP is fixed at 684.5 meters above sea level**.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (specifically for Runways 02–20 and 11–29). It has a slope of **1 meter vertically to 50 meters horizontally** (i.e., 1:50 gradient), rising to intersect with the outer surface. For certain runways, the surface becomes horizontal after a certain distance.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending outward from the **lateral edges** of the runway strip and its associated approach surfaces. It ensures a smooth transition between the runway and the outer surface, helping to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during landing or takeoff.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface located above and around the airport, designed to protect aircraft during approach and departure. It defines the maximum allowable elevation for any structures or natural features within the airport zone.

- **Strip**: The rectangular area of the landing surface designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (e.g., Runway 02–20 or 11–29).

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all lands**—including public road allowances—that fall within or directly under the following areas:

- The lands **within** the airport boundaries; and  
- The lands **directly beneath** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.

This includes both developed and undeveloped land adjacent to the airport.

---

#### **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing ones),  
- **Whose highest point exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

  - The **approach surface**,  
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - The **transitional surface**.

This restriction ensures that no physical obstruction—whether man-made or natural—will interfere with aircraft during critical phases of flight (e.g., landing or takeoff).

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**
If **natural growth** (such as trees, shrubs, or vegetation) on any land subject to these regulations exceeds the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This provision allows for proactive management of vegetation that could pose a hazard to aviation safety.

---

#### **6. Prohibition on Bird Attraction**
No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may:
- Use that land for the **disposal of waste** that is **edible or attractive to birds**.

This rule is designed to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which are a major safety concern in aviation operations.

---

#### **7. Outer Limits of the Regulated Zone**
The outer boundary of the regulated land area is defined in a detailed, precise **descriptive boundary description** using legal survey terminology. The boundary is composed of a series of directional bearings and distances from the airport reference point, with key features including:

- **Radial distances of 4,000 meters** from the ARP in multiple directions (e.g., north, northeast, southeast, etc.).
- Specific intersections with:
  - Road allowances (e.g., between Sections 22 and 21, Sections 23 and 24).
  - Major roads (e.g., Alaska Highway, Road No. 146, Road No. 259).
  - Section boundaries (e.g., Section 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 30, 31).
  - Runway approach surfaces (e.g., approach surfaces to Runways 02, 11, 20, 29).
- Bearings and grid lines (e.g., 313°10′06″, 43°10′46″) are used to ensure accuracy in positioning.

This boundary ensures that the zoning zone extends sufficiently to protect aircraft during approach and departure, while respecting existing land uses and infrastructure.

#### **8. Approach Surface Descriptions (by Runway)**

Each approach surface is described in detail, based on the **Department of Transport’s Fort St. John Airport Zoning Plan No. (Z) B.C. 1427, dated January 20, 1981**.

| Runway | Approach Surface Description |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **02–20** | Inclined plane (1:50 slope) rising to outer surface. Horizontal section extends to a line 15,000 meters from the runway end, 2,400 meters from centerline. At this point, the surface is 298.68 m above the end elevation. |
| **20** | Inclined plane (1:50 slope) rising to outer surface. Horizontal section extends to a line 15,000 meters from the end, 2,400 m from centerline. At this point, the surface is 281.11 m above the end elevation. |
| **11–29** | Inclined plane (1:50 slope) rising to outer surface. Horizontal section extends to a line 15,000 meters from the end, 2,400 m from centerline. At this point, the surface is 291.55 m above the end elevation. |
| **29** | Inclined plane (1:50 slope) rising to outer surface. Horizontal section extends to a line 15,000 meters from the end, 2,400 m from centerline. At this point, the surface is 285.15 m above the end elevation. |

> **Note**: The slopes are consistent across all approach surfaces (1:50), ensuring uniform safety margins for aircraft approaching from different directions.

#### **9. Outer Surface (Not Fully Provided in the Text)**
Although the text cuts off mid-sentence at the end ("The outer surface, shown on Department of Transport..."), it is implied that the outer surface is a **curved or conical surface** extending outward from the approach surfaces and transitional surfaces, designed to:
- Prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during flight.
- Provide a safe clearance zone around the airport.
- Be defined by specific elevation contours and radial distances from the ARP.

It is likely defined similarly to other airport zoning regulations—such as a **circular or elliptical surface** with a specified elevation gradient—ensuring that no structure or natural feature exceeds a safe height.

---

#### **10. Purpose and Objectives**
The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: Prevent obstructions (natural or man-made) from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.
2. **Consistent Zoning**: Provide clear, measurable boundaries and elevation limits to guide land use decisions.
3. **Environmental Protection**: Reduce bird-related hazards by prohibiting the disposal of bird-attractive waste.
4. **Regulatory Clarity**: Offer a legally enforceable framework for landowners and developers operating near the airport.

---

#### **11. Enforcement and Compliance**
- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue **directions** to remove excessive vegetation.
  - Enforce compliance through legal means if necessary.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction.
