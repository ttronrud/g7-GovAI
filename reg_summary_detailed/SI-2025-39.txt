### **Regulatory Summary: Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Minister for International Trade**

#### **Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.
- It is authorized by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**.
- This reflects a formal reorganization of governmental responsibilities within the federal public service, specifically involving the transfer of certain functions between ministries.

#### **Nature of the Transfer**
- The **powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** are being **transferred** to the **Minister for International Trade**.
- The transfer is **specific and limited**: it applies only to the powers, duties, and functions that are explicitly defined under **subsection 53(2)** of the *Customs Tariff Act*.

> 🔍 *Note: Subsection 53(2) of the Customs Tariff Act outlines the responsibilities of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in relation to customs matters, including the administration of international trade agreements, tariff classifications, and coordination with international bodies on trade policy.*

#### **Scope and Effect**
- The transfer does **not** extend to all functions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
- It is **focused on trade-related responsibilities** that fall under the purview of customs and tariff administration, which are now being managed by the Minister for International Trade.
- This reassignment is intended to **streamline trade policy governance**, improve coordination between foreign policy and trade policy, and align governmental structures with evolving economic priorities.

#### **Legal References**
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** – Original enactment of the transfer provision in the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.
- **R.S., c. P-34** – Reference to the *Public Service Act* (or related legislation), which may provide the framework for public service restructuring.
- **S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 191(1)** – A later amendment or update to the original provision, likely clarifying or reinforcing the transfer.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36** – An earlier legislative reference, possibly establishing foundational provisions related to ministerial duties or public service reorganization.

#### **Purpose and Rationale**
- The transfer aims to:
  - Enhance **interdepartmental coordination** between foreign affairs and international trade.
  - Reflect a growing recognition that **trade policy**—especially in the context of global supply chains, tariffs, and international agreements—requires specialized oversight.

#### **Implications**
- The **Minister for International Trade** now assumes responsibility for:
  - Administering customs tariff regulations.
  - Engaging in international trade negotiations and agreements.
  - Coordinating with customs authorities and international partners on trade compliance and policy.
- The **Minister of Foreign Affairs** retains other core foreign policy functions (e.g., diplomacy, international relations, consular services), but **no longer holds authority over customs tariff administration** as defined in subsection 53(2).

#### **Important Clarifications**
- This is **not a full transfer** of the Minister of Foreign Affairs’ portfolio.
- The transfer is **legally limited** to the specific powers and duties enumerated in subsection 53(2) of the *Customs Tariff Act*.
- The change may reflect a broader **restructuring of federal government departments** to better respond to global trade dynamics and economic challenges.
