### **Detailed Summary of the Kimmirut Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Kimmirut Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. A-2)**, specifically pursuant to **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a** of the Act. These provisions empower the Minister of Transport to regulate land use near airports to ensure aviation safety and operational integrity.

- A **notice of proposed regulations** was first published in two successive issues of the *Nunatsiaq News* on **February 10 and 17, 2012**, followed by publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 19 and 26, 2011** (note: the date appears to be a typographical error—likely intended as 2012).
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity** for stakeholders—including local communities, developers, and aviation authorities—to submit written representations or objections to the proposed rules.
- The final regulations were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **To prevent land use or development adjacent to or near Kimmirut Airport** that could compromise the **safe operation of aircraft**.
2. **To prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications**, including radio, radar, and navigation systems used by aircraft and airport support facilities.

These protections are essential in remote Arctic environments where aviation is a primary mode of transportation and emergency response.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined within the regulations to ensure clarity and consistency in their application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Kimmirut Airport, located in the vicinity of Kimmirut, Nunavut. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | The geometric center of the runway thresholds, located at grid coordinates 6,968,964.095 N, 455,341.745 E (latitude 62°50′53″ N, longitude 69°52′38″ W). It lies 321.06 m from the end of runway 17–35’s strip surface and is at an elevation of 44.37 m above sea level. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined surface extending from each end of the runway (runway approaches 17 and 35), rising at a **1:20 slope** (1 meter vertically per 20 meters horizontally). It extends 2,500 meters from the runway end and has outer ends 280 meters from the runway centerline and 125 meters above the end elevation. |
| **Outer Surface** | A circular imaginary surface extending **4,000 meters** from the ARP at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but **not less than 9 meters above ground** (to prevent penetration below ground level). |
| **Strip Surface** | A rectangular surface associated with the runway (runway 17–35), 60 meters wide (30 meters on each side of the centerline), 642.12 meters long, running from threshold 17 to threshold 35. Elevation changes gradually between the two ends, with a defined slope pattern. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined surface rising at a **1:5 slope** (1 meter vertically per 5 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip surface and approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects the outer surface. |
| **Zoning Plan** | Plan No. E3269, prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services and dated December 1, 2008, which serves as the spatial reference for all surfaces and boundaries. |

#### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kimmirut Airport** within a **circular boundary of 4,000 meters radius** centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

- This includes:
  - Land **under water**
  - Public road allowances
  - All areas within the defined geometric zones

This broad scope ensures that both terrestrial and submerged areas are protected from aviation hazards.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities and Developments**

Several activities are strictly prohibited within the designated zones:

##### **(a) Construction or Placement of Structures**
- No person may **construct, erect, or place** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures) on the regulated lands **if any part of it penetrates**:
  - The **approach surface**
  - The **outer surface**
  - The **transitional surface**

> *This prevents tall structures (e.g., towers, buildings, trees) from obstructing aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.*

##### **(b) Use or Development Causing Signal Interference**
- No person may **use or develop** any land **under the outer surface** in a way that causes **interference with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical service facilities (e.g., radar stations, communication towers)

> *This protects the integrity of air traffic control and navigation systems.*

##### **(c) Growth of Natural Vegetation**
- No person may allow **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) to grow in such a way that it **penetrates**:
  - Approach surface
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surface

> *This prevents vegetation from interfering with aircraft visibility or creating hazards during flight operations.*

##### **(d) Wildlife Attraction**
- No person may use or permit the use of lands for activities that **attract wildlife**, especially **birds**, which could pose a **direct hazard to aviation safety** (e.g., bird strikes).

> *This is critical in Arctic regions where bird populations can be unpredictable and dangerous to aircraft.*

---

#### **6. Exceptions and Permissible Uses**

Despite the strict prohibitions, **one important exception** is granted:

- A person **may use or permit the use** of regulated lands as a **site for an open water storage reservoir** (e.g., for water supply or emergency purposes) **for a period of 48 hours or less**.

> *This allows for temporary, non-structural, and short-term water storage without violating the core safety provisions.*

> *Note: This exception does not apply to long-term reservoirs or permanent water storage facilities.*

---

#### **7. Effective Date**

The regulations **come into force** on the day when the requirements specified in **subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.

- As of the document's note, the regulations were **in force as of April 2, 2013**.
- The exact date of enforcement may depend on administrative processes, such as ministerial certification or public consultation completion.

---

#### **8. Geospatial and Measurement Standards**

All coordinates and elevations are based on precise, standardized systems:

- **Grid Coordinates**: Measured in meters using the **1983 North American Datum, Zone 19, UTM projection**.
  - A combined average scale factor of **0.9996102** was applied to ensure accuracy.
- **Elevations**: Based on the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum (CGVD28)**, which is the official vertical reference system in Canada.

These standards ensure that the spatial boundaries and elevation data are accurate, consistent, and compatible with national geospatial databases.

---

#### **9. Visual Representation and Zoning Plan**

- The full spatial layout of all surfaces (approach, strip, transitional, outer) is illustrated in **Plan No. E3269**, dated December 1, 2008.
- The plan provides:
  - Precise grid coordinates
  - Azimuths and distances
  - Elevation profiles
  - Surface boundaries

This plan serves as the **primary reference tool** for enforcement, planning, and compliance checks.

### **Conclusion**

The **Kimmirut Airport Zoning Regulations** represent a comprehensive and science-based framework designed to **protect aviation safety** in a remote and environmentally sensitive region of Nunavut. By defining strict boundaries and prohibiting certain developments and activities near the airport, the regulations ensure:

- Safe aircraft operations (takeoff, landing, approach)
- Uninterrupted communication and navigation signals
- Protection from natural and man-made hazards (e.g., trees, wildlife)

The regulations balance **aviation safety** with **local community needs**, allowing limited exceptions (e.g., temporary water storage) while maintaining robust protection for critical airspace and ground zones.

They are a model example of how federal environmental and transportation regulations can be tailored to meet the unique challenges of Arctic aviation infrastructure.
