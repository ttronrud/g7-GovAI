## 📋 Prescribed Information for Claiming Input Tax Credit

The regulation specifies **different levels of required documentation** depending on the **total amount paid or payable** for the supply or group of supplies. These tiers are designed to balance **accuracy, compliance, and administrative burden**.

---

### 🟢 Tier 1: Total Amount < $100

When the total amount paid or payable is **less than $100**, the registrant must have the following:

1. **Name of the supplier or intermediary** (or the name under which they do business).
2. If an invoice is issued:
   - The **date of the invoice**.
3. If no invoice is issued:
   - The **date when tax became payable** (i.e., the date tax was paid or became due).
4. The **total amount paid or payable** for all supplies involved.

> ✅ *This tier applies to small, low-value transactions and reduces compliance requirements for minor purchases.*

---

### 🟡 Tier 2: Total Amount ≥ $100 and < $500

When the total amount is **$100 or more but less than $500**, the registrant must have:

1. **Name of the supplier or intermediary** and their **registration number** (assigned under section 241 of the Act).
2. All information from Tier 1 (date, total amount, etc.).
3. **Additional information** if tax is separate from the price:
   - The **amount of tax paid or payable** for each supply or for all supplies.
4. **If PST is payable** (on taxable, non-zero-rated supplies):
   - The **total of:**
     - Tax under Division II of Part IX of the Act (i.e., GST),
     - Provincial Sales Tax (PST) on each taxable supply.
   - A **clear statement** that this total includes both GST and PST.
5. **If the amount paid includes tax**:
   - A **statement** that tax is included in the amount paid.
6. **Total tax rate** (for taxable, non-zero-rated supplies):
   - The combined rate(s) at which tax was paid.
7. **Amount paid** for each such supply or the total for supplies with the same tax rate.
8. **Status indication**:
   - If two or more supplies have different statuses (e.g., one taxable, one exempt), the status of each taxable, non-zero-rated supply must be clearly indicated.

> ⚠️ *This tier increases requirements as transaction size grows, ensuring better traceability and tax accuracy.*

---

### 🔴 Tier 3: Total Amount ≥ $500

For transactions of **$500 or more**, registrants must provide **all information from Tiers 1 and 2**, plus:

1. **Recipient’s details**:
   - Full name of the recipient.
   - Name under which the recipient does business.
   - Name of the recipient’s **duly authorized agent or representative** (if applicable).
2. **Terms of payment** (e.g., cash, cheque, bank transfer, credit card, etc.).
3. A **detailed description of each supply** sufficient to identify it (e.g., product name, quantity, service type, date, etc.).

## ⏱️ Effective Dates

- **Section 1** (general provisions): Came into force on **April 1, 1997**.
- **Section 2 and subsections 3(1), (2), and (4)**: Apply to supplies made **after April 23, 1996**.
- **Subsection 3(3)**: Applies to supplies made **after March 1997**, **except**:
  - For supplies made **before February 1998**, **paragraph 3(b)(iv)** of the regulation (as enacted by subsection 3(3)) **does not apply** — meaning those pre-1998 transactions were exempt from certain requirements.

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Interpretations

1. **Supporting Documentation Must Be Valid and Issued by the Registrant**  
   Only documents **validly issued or signed by the registrant** (i.e., the supplier or intermediary) qualify. This ensures authenticity and accountability.

2. **Status Matters**  
   The regulation explicitly requires identification of supply status (exempt, zero-rated, taxable) — especially when multiple supplies are involved. This is crucial because:
   - Exempt supplies do not generate tax credits.
   - Zero-rated supplies have zero tax, but may still be eligible for credit on input taxes.
   - Taxable supplies (non-zero-rated) generate tax that must be accounted for.

3. **Tax Inclusion Clarity**  
   The requirement to state whether tax is included in the amount paid helps prevent errors in credit calculations.

4. **Electronic Records Are Valid**  
   The regulation recognizes **computerized or electronic data systems** as acceptable forms of documentation — reflecting modern business practices.

5. **Historical Context**  
   This regulation was part of early efforts to implement **GST input tax credit rules** in Canada. It predates the full integration of the GST/HST system and reflects a transitional phase in tax administration.
