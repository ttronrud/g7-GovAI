**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Beef Cattle Research, Market Development and Promotion Agency Proclamation (2002)**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, formally known as the **Canadian Beef Cattle Research, Market Development and Promotion Agency Proclamation**, was issued on **January 17, 2002**, by **Adrienne Clarkson**, Governor General of Canada, acting on the advice of the Privy Council. It establishes a statutory body under the *Farm Products Agencies Act* (FPA Act) to promote and support the beef industry in Canada.

The proclamation creates the **Canadian Beef Cattle Research, Market Development and Promotion Agency (Agency)**, tasked with advancing the marketing, production, and research related to beef cattle, beef, and beef products. The agency is designed to represent the interests of producers, importers, processors, and retail stakeholders across Canada.

- The Governor in Council must be satisfied that a **majority of the aggregate producers and importers** (where applicable) support the creation of the agency.
- In this case, the Governor in Council found that a majority of Canadian producers and importers of beef cattle, beef, and beef products support the establishment of the Agency.
