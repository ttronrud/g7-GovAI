**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Powers from the Minister for International Development to the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada  
**Legal Basis:**  
- Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207)  
- Relevant provision: Paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Act  
- Statutory reference: R.S., c. P-34 (the *Public Service Act*, as amended)

**Summary of the Provision:**

Her Excellency the Governor General, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, transfers to the **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada** the **powers, duties, and functions** of the **Minister for International Development** specifically in relation to the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDAC)**.

---

**Key Elements Explained:**

1. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   The Minister for International Development, who previously held responsibility for overseeing PEDAC, is no longer responsible for the agency’s operations or policy direction. Instead, the authority over PEDAC is now vested in the **President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**.

2. **Who is the President of the King’s Privy Council?**  
   This is a constitutional office, typically held by the **Prime Minister** (or, in some cases, another senior minister). The President of the Privy Council serves as the head of the federal government’s executive branch and is responsible for the coordination of government policy and the administration of key agencies. In this context, the transfer reflects a shift in administrative oversight to a higher-level, policy-coordinating body.

3. **Scope of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer is **specific** — it applies only to the powers, duties, and functions related to the **Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada (PEDAC)**. It does not extend to other responsibilities of the Minister for International Development, such as foreign aid programs or international development policy in general.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which allows the Governor General (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign functions between federal ministers and other government officials or bodies, particularly in the context of public service restructuring or efficiency.

5. **Purpose and Context:**  
   This transfer likely reflects a broader government effort to:
   - Improve coordination of economic development initiatives in the Pacific region;
   - Align PEDAC’s mandate more closely with the federal government’s strategic policy priorities;
   - Strengthen oversight of regional development programs under the authority of a senior, high-level official (the President of the Privy Council);
   - Streamline the management of international development and economic development agencies.

6. **Implications:**  
   - The **Minister for International Development** will no longer have direct authority over PEDAC’s operations, budget, or strategic planning.
   - The **President of the Privy Council** now acts as the **de facto head of PEDAC**, with the power to appoint officials, approve programs, and ensure alignment with national policy.
   - This may also signal a shift in how regional development agencies are governed, emphasizing interdepartmental coordination and strategic oversight over ministerial control.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a formal reorganization of federal government responsibilities. It transfers the administrative and policy oversight of the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada from the Minister for International Development to the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada. This change is intended to enhance strategic coordination, improve accountability, and align regional economic development with broader federal policy objectives. The transfer is legally sound and authorized under existing public service legislation, and it reflects a shift in how federal agencies are managed in the post-ministerial era.
