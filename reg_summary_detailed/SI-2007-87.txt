**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Testing of Unregistered US Military Herbicides, including Agent Orange, at CFB Gagetown – Ex Gratia Payments Order"**

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**, establishes a program of **ex gratia (voluntary, non-liability) lump sum payments** for individuals affected by exposure to unregistered U.S. military herbicides—particularly **Agent Orange**—at **Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Gagetown** between 1966 and 2011. The payments are intended to provide financial compensation to those who developed certain serious medical conditions as a result of such exposure, without admitting liability on the part of the Crown.

---

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Minister**  
   Refers to the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**, who is responsible for administering the payment program and making decisions regarding applications.

2. **Primary Caregiver**  
   Defined as the adult person who:
   - Immediately before the individual's death, was **primarily responsible, without remuneration**, for providing care;
   - Resided in the **principal residence** of the individual for a **continuous period of at least one year**;
   - Maintained the individual or was maintained by the individual.  
   This definition ensures that the person receiving the payment is someone who had a close, ongoing caregiving relationship with the affected individual.

### **Eligibility Criteria for Ex Gratia Payment**

An individual must meet **all** of the following conditions to be eligible for a $20,000 lump sum payment:

#### **1. Medical Diagnosis**
The individual must have been diagnosed with **one or more** of the following medical conditions:
- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  
- Soft tissue sarcoma  
- Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma  
- Hodgkin’s disease  
- Chloracne  
- Respiratory cancers (lung/bronchus, larynx, or trachea)  
- Prostate cancer  
- Multiple myeloma  
- Acute and subacute (or early onset) transient peripheral neuropathy  
- Porphyria cutanea tarda  
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus  
- Spina bifida  

> *Note:* The condition must have been diagnosed **between June 1, 1966, and June 30, 2011**.

#### **2. Exposure or Connection to CFB Gagetown (1966–1967)**  
At any time between **June and September of either 1966 or 1967**, the individual (or, in the case of spina bifida, a biological parent) must have:
- Worked or lived at CFB Gagetown;  
- Been posted to or trained at CFB Gagetown; **or**  
- Resided in a community (as determined by the Minister) that lies **within 5 kilometers of the perimeter of CFB Gagetown**.

> *Note:* This exposure window is very specific—only June to September 1966 or 1967—and focuses on the period when herbicide testing (including Agent Orange) was conducted at the base.

### **Payment to Primary Caregivers (Post-Death Provisions)**

- If the individual **dies before receiving payment**, the **primary caregiver** (if any) is entitled to receive the payment.
- If the individual **dies before applying**, the **primary caregiver may apply on behalf of the individual**.
- If the **primary caregiver dies before receiving payment**, **no payment is made** to them or any other party.

> This reflects a focus on the personal, familial connection to the individual and ensures that compensation is passed to someone who had a direct caregiving role.

---

### **Application Requirements**

- Applications must be submitted **no later than June 30, 2011**, unless **circumstances beyond the applicant’s control** (e.g., illness, disability, or other unforeseen events) justify a later submission.
- Applications must be supported by **evidence** that the Minister considers necessary, such as:
  - Medical records  
  - Employment or residency documentation  
  - Testimony or affidavits  
  - Proof of time spent at or near CFB Gagetown

> The requirement for supporting evidence ensures that claims are substantiated and not made arbitrarily.

---

### **End of the Program**

- The Minister shall **cease making payments under this Order on December 30, 2011**.  
> This means the program was **time-limited**, closing after a specific deadline to ensure a finite and manageable compensation initiative.

---

### **Appeal Process**

Applicants who are dissatisfied with a decision may:
1. **Request a first-level review** in writing within **60 days** of receiving the decision (or a longer period if circumstances beyond the applicant’s control apply).
2. If dissatisfied with the first-level review, they may request a **second-level review** within **60 days** of receiving that decision (again, with possible extension for exceptional circumstances).

> This structured appeal process provides a clear path for individuals to challenge decisions, ensuring accountability and fairness in the administration of the payments.

---

### **Legal and Financial Implications**

- A payment made under this Order **does not constitute an admission of liability** by the Crown (Government of Canada).  
> This is crucial—it means the government is not acknowledging that exposure caused the illness, only that it is providing compensation based on eligibility criteria.

- The Order **does not apply to members of foreign military units**.  
> This excludes foreign service personnel, even if they were stationed at CFB Gagetown, from the scope of the program.

---

### **Purpose and Context**

This regulation was developed in response to:
- Historical use of **unregistered U.S. herbicides**, including **Agent Orange**, during military training exercises at CFB Gagetown in the early 1960s.
- Scientific concerns that these chemicals may cause long-term health effects, such as cancers and other chronic diseases.
- A need to provide **financial support** to Canadian civilians and veterans who may have been exposed and developed health issues as a result.

The program is part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to address health impacts from environmental exposures during military operations.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a targeted, time-bound, and evidence-based approach to providing financial support to individuals affected by exposure to U.S. military herbicides at CFB Gagetown. It balances compassion with administrative feasibility, ensuring that only those with verifiable exposure and qualifying health conditions receive compensation. While it does not acknowledge liability, it serves as a meaningful gesture of recognition and support for those impacted by historical environmental exposures during military training.

The program's closure in 2011 underscores its role as a **limited, corrective measure** rather than a long-term policy. It remains a significant example of how Canadian veterans’ and public health policy can respond to past environmental harm through structured, transparent, and fair compensation mechanisms.
