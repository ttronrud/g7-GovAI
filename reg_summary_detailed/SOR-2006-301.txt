## **Key Provisions and Detailed Summary**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

- The regulations are made under specific subsections of the *Insurance Companies Act*:
  - **294(1)a, (3)a, (6)a**: These relate to civil remedies for breaches of insider information rules.
  - **1021(1)b**: Provides authority for civil remedies in connection with the conduct of directors, officers, or insiders.

> These provisions allow the regulator to impose **civil penalties or injunctive relief** when an insider violates rules related to the use or disclosure of confidential information.

---

### **2. Definition of "Prescribed Percentage of Voting Rights" – Paragraph 294(1)(d) of the Act**

> **Key Provision**:  
> For the purpose of paragraph 294(1)(d) of the Act, the **prescribed percentage of voting rights** attached to all outstanding shares of an insurance company or insurance holding company is **10%**.

#### **Meaning and Significance**:
- This establishes a **threshold** for what constitutes a "significant shareholder" or "insider" in terms of voting power.
- A person who owns **10% or more** of the voting rights in an insurance company or holding company is considered a **"relevant insider"** under the Act.
- This threshold triggers additional obligations and potential civil liability if such individuals use confidential information to trade shares or participate in transactions.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is not a general insider trading rule but is specifically tailored to the insurance sector due to its unique regulatory environment and risk profile.

### **3. Definition of "Take-Over Bid" – Subsection 294(3) of the Act**

> **Key Provision**:  
> A *take-over bid* means a take-over bid under any legislation listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.

#### **What Does This Mean?**

- The regulation references **specific provincial and federal securities legislation** that defines a "take-over bid" (such as the Securities Act in various jurisdictions).
- It ensures that the definition of a take-over bid used in the context of civil remedies under the *Insurance Companies Act* aligns with **existing provincial and federal securities laws**.

#### **Relevant Legislation (from the Schedule)**:
The following laws define "take-over bid" and are referenced:
- *Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5* (Ontario)

> ✅ **Purpose**:  
> To ensure **consistency and legal clarity** across jurisdictions by using the **official, jurisdiction-specific definitions** of "take-over bid" as defined in the relevant securities legislation.

### **4. Prescribed Circumstances for Insider Trading Exemptions – Paragraph 294(6)(c)**

> **Key Provision**:  
> The following circumstances are **exempt** from the insider trading prohibition under paragraph 294(6)(c) of the Act:

1. **Purchase or sale as agent under a specific unsolicited order**  
   → The insider acted as an agent (e.g., broker, custodian) to execute a purchase or sale that was **specifically requested by a third party** and not solicited by the insider.

2. **Purchase or sale under participation in an automatic plan**  
   → The transaction occurred as part of an **automatic dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)**, **share purchase plan**, or similar program that the insider **entered into prior to acquiring confidential information**.

3. **Purchase or sale to fulfill a legally binding obligation**  
   → The transaction was required by a **pre-existing legal or contractual obligation** (e.g., pension plan, trust agreement) entered into **before** the insider obtained confidential information.

4. **Purchase or sale as agent or trustee in circumstances described in (b) or (c)**  
   → This includes cases where the insider acts in a fiduciary capacity (e.g., trustee, agent) under the same conditions as above.

#### **Significance**:
- These provisions create **important exceptions** to the insider trading rule, recognizing legitimate and lawful financial behavior.
- They protect individuals from being penalized for **routine, pre-existing, or legally mandated transactions** that do not involve misuse of confidential information.
- The exemptions require **proof of timing and pre-existence** — the plan or obligation must have been in place **before** the confidential information was acquired.

> 🔍 Example:  
> A director who automatically reinvests dividends in their own shares through a DRIP plan **before** learning of a company’s financial downturn is not liable for trading on that information.

---

### **5. Effective Date**

> The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Statutes of Canada*.

> This means they are immediately effective upon official publication and registration, allowing for prompt enforcement and compliance.
