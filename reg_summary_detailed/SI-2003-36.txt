### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Respecting the Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Subsurface Lands in the Northwest Territories**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Issuance**
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council.
- **Recommendation**: Made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- **Legal Basis**: Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**.
- **Purpose**: To withdraw specific subsurface lands from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of disposition) to facilitate the development of a **hydroelectric power generating plant near Bluefish Lake** in the Northwest Territories.

---

#### **2. Scope and Effect of the Order**
- **Subject Matter**: Certain subsurface lands located in the **Northwest Territories**, specifically in the **Mackenzie District**, near **Bluefish Lake**.
- **Effective Date**: The withdrawal from disposal becomes effective on the **day the Order is made**.
- **Applicable Section**: Sections 3 and 4 of the Territorial Lands Act apply **except as otherwise specified** in the Order.
- **Exclusion of Certain Dispositions**:  
  This Order **does not apply** to:
  
  - Dispositions of **substances or materials** under the **Territorial Quarrying Regulations**.
  - The **locating of claims** by holders of a prospecting permit who obtained the permit **before** the Order came into force.
  - The **recording of claims** that were already located or recorded before the Order was made.
  - The **granting of leases** under the **Canada Mining Regulations** to individuals with **recorded claims**, where the lease covers land within the recorded claim.
  - The **issuance of significant discovery licences** under the **Canada Petroleum Resources Act** to holders of exploration licences issued **before** the Order, where the discovery licence covers land subject to the exploration licence.
  - The **issuance of production licences** under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act to holders of:
    - A significant discovery licence (issued before the Order), where the production licence covers land under that discovery licence.
    - An exploration licence or significant discovery licence (issued before the Order), where the production licence covers land under those licences.
  - The **granting of surface leases** under the Territorial Lands Act to holders of:
    - Recorded claims under the Canada Mining Regulations, or
    - Interests under the Canada Petroleum Resources Act,
    where the surface lease is **required to allow exercise of rights** under the claim or interest.
  - The **renewal of interests** (e.g., mining or petroleum rights) that were already in place prior to the Order.

> ✅ **Key Purpose of Exclusions**: These exclusions ensure that existing rights and ongoing development activities—particularly those initiated before the Order—are not disrupted. This preserves legal continuity and prevents unintended interference with pre-existing mining or exploration rights.

#### **3. Specific Parcel Withdrawn from Disposal**
A **specific parcel of land** is explicitly named and described in the Schedule (attached to the Order), located in the **Mackenzie District**, near Bluefish Lake.

##### **Legal Description of the Parcel**:
- **Location**:  
  - Approximate coordinates:  
    - Latitude: 62° 40′ N  
    - Longitude: 114° 15′ W  
  - Situated within the **district of Mackenzie**, Northwest Territories.

- **Commencement Point**:  
  - Survey monument **"I. Pit. M.R. W. 112"** on the **southerly limit** of the transmission line right-of-way from **Yellowknife Hydro Development to Thompson-Lundmark Mine**.  
  - This point is referenced on a **plan of survey approved by Frederic Hatheway Peters**, Surveyor General of Dominion Lands, dated **January 21, 1942**, record number **39,836** in the Legal Surveys Division.

- **Survey Path (in sequence)**:
  1. **N 11° 06′ E** for 75 ft → to iron pin on northerly limit of transmission line.
  2. **N 11° 35′ E** for 1,412 ft → to iron pin.
  3. **N 25° 11′ W** for 1,492 ft → to iron pin on southerly bank of Bluefish Lake.
  4. **N 55° 12′ W** for 1,853 ft → to iron pin.
  5. **S 52° 24′ W** for 269 ft → to iron pin.
  6. **S 12° 24′ E** for 1,145 ft → to iron pin.
  7. **S 23° 53′ E** for 2,481 ft → to **post #4** of lot 153, group 964 (survey approved October 24, 1941, record #39,802).
  8. **S 0° 06′ 30″ E** along westerly boundary of lot for 499 ft 9/10 → to post #3 of the lot.
  9. **S 77° 42′ E** for 376 ft → to iron pin.
  10. **N 59° 28′ E** for 525 ft → back to **point of commencement**.

- **Total Area**:  
  - **77 acres and 16/100 of an acre** (approximately 31.1 hectares), with a tolerance of "more or less."

- **Exemptions from the Description**:  
  - All land **within the waters of**:
    - Yellowknife River  
    - Bluefish Lake  
    - Prosperous Lake  
  are **excluded** from the parcel being withdrawn.

> 🔍 This precise legal description ensures clarity and enforceability, allowing for accurate mapping and boundary determination by land authorities.

---

#### **4. Repeal Clause**
- The Order **repeals** a previously existing parcel or tract of land described in the same manner as above (the one just described), which may have previously been subject to different land use or disposal rules.
- This indicates that the **prior designation or status of that parcel is formally canceled**, and the current Order supersedes it in terms of disposal status.

> ⚠️ This repeal likely serves to eliminate outdated or conflicting land designations and aligns the legal status of the land with the new hydroelectric development objective.

---

#### **5. Strategic and Environmental Context**
- The primary **objective** of this Order is to **enable the development of a hydroelectric power plant** near Bluefish Lake.
- By withdrawing the subsurface lands from disposal, the government ensures that:
  - No third-party interests (e.g., mining or drilling companies) can acquire rights to the subsurface beneath this area.
  - The land is reserved exclusively for **hydroelectric infrastructure development**.
- This reflects a **public interest decision** prioritizing clean energy and regional development over private land speculation or extraction.

---

#### **6. Key Implications**
| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Land Use Control** | The subsurface of the specified area is now off-limits to commercial disposal or mining. |
| **Development Priority** | The hydroelectric project gains legal priority and protection from competing land uses. |
| **Legal Continuity** | Pre-existing rights (e.g., exploration permits, claims) are preserved, ensuring stability for existing stakeholders. |
| **Environmental Protection** | Helps protect the ecological integrity of Bluefish Lake and surrounding watersheds by restricting subsurface development. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Provides clear boundaries and exclusions, reducing ambiguity for developers, regulators, and landowners. |

---

#### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **targeted land-use intervention** designed to support the construction of a hydroelectric facility near Bluefish Lake in the Northwest Territories. It formally withdraws a defined parcel of subsurface land from disposal under the Territorial Lands Act, ensuring that the area remains available for infrastructure development. Importantly, the Order respects existing rights and legal processes by excluding certain pre-existing claims and licences from its scope. The precise legal description and the inclusion of a repeal clause enhance the regulatory certainty and historical accuracy of the land designation. This action supports sustainable energy development while maintaining legal integrity and environmental stewardship.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
*The Governor General, on the Minister’s recommendation, withdraws a specific parcel of subsurface land near Bluefish Lake from disposal to enable hydroelectric development, while preserving existing mining and exploration rights established prior to the Order.*
