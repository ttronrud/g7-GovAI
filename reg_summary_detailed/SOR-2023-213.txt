### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Regulation Title and Legal Basis**
- **Title**: *Order Exempting Certain Navigable Waters Located in Quebec from the Application of Section 23 of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act*
- **Legal Authority**: 
  - Based on **section 24(1)a** of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* (CNWA), which empowers the Governor in Council to exempt certain navigable waters from specific provisions of the Act.
  - The exemption is made under the authority of **section 57 of S.C. 2019, c. 28**, and references to prior statutes including **R.S., c. N-22** and **S.C. 2012, c. 31, s. 316**, which provide the foundational legal framework for the Act and related provisions.

#### **2. Background and Rationale**
- The **Minister of Transport** received an application seeking to exempt specific navigable waters listed in a schedule attached to the Order from the application of **Section 23 of the Canadian Navigable Waters Act**.
- Section 23 of the CNWA typically imposes obligations related to the **protection, management, and conservation of navigable waters**, including requirements for environmental assessments, permits, and regulatory oversight for activities that may affect water quality or ecosystem integrity.
- The **Governor in Council** (the federal Cabinet, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) concluded that granting this exemption would be **in the public interest**.

#### **3. Key Provisions of the Order**
- **Exemption Scope**:
  - The navigable waters **listed in the schedule** to this Order are **exempt from the application of Section 23** of the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act*.
  - This means that activities occurring within these waters (such as development, dredging, construction, or other interventions) are **not subject to the regulatory requirements** imposed by Section 23, including environmental assessments or permitting processes under that section.
- **Geographic Scope**:
  - The exemption applies **only to navigable waters located in the province of Quebec**.
  - The schedule specifies the exact bodies of water (e.g., lakes, rivers, or connected waterways) to be exempted.

#### **4. Definition and Boundary Clarification**
- **Water Boundary Definition**:
  - The water boundary of each lake included in the exemption includes the **mouths of all connecting waterways**.
  - This ensures that even if a lake is connected via streams or channels, the entire system is considered under the exemption, preventing regulatory gaps or inconsistencies.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**.
- **Note**: The Order was published and came into force on **October 25, 2023**.

#### **6. Regulatory Implications**
- **Relief from Regulatory Burden**:
  - Stakeholders (e.g., developers, municipalities, or Indigenous communities) operating or planning activities within the exempted waters are **no longer required to comply with the environmental and navigational protections under Section 23**.
- **Public Interest Justification**:
  - The exemption is justified on the grounds that it supports **economic development, infrastructure projects, or specific community needs** in Quebec, where the benefits of development outweigh the environmental risks, or where alternative management approaches are deemed sufficient.
- **Potential for Future Review**:
  - While the exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis, it may be subject to periodic review or challenge if new environmental concerns arise or if public interest changes.

#### **7. Limitations and Scope**
- The exemption is **limited to the specific waters listed in the schedule**.
- It does **not** apply to other navigable waters in Canada or to areas outside Quebec.
- It does **not** exempt activities from other parts of the CNWA (e.g., sections related to navigation safety, fish habitat, or Indigenous rights), unless otherwise specified.

#### **8. Significance**
- This Order represents a **flexible application of federal environmental regulation**, allowing for targeted relief in specific geographic and economic contexts.
- It reflects a balance between **environmental protection** and **economic development**, particularly in regions where traditional regulatory pathways may be impractical or overly burdensome.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation grants a **limited, targeted exemption** under the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* to specific navigable waters in Quebec from the environmental and management requirements of **Section 23**. The exemption is based on a public interest determination and is effective from **October 25, 2023**. It includes all connected waterways in the boundary of each lake and is designed to support development or management activities in those areas without triggering the full regulatory framework of the Act.

> **Note**: This summary assumes the text refers to the *Canadian Navigable Waters Act* as amended and that "section 23a" mentioned in the opening is a typographical or interpretive error—since the actual exemption is under **Section 23**, and the legal basis cites subsection **24(1)a**. The reference to "section 23a" appears to be an error or misstatement in the original text.
