### 2. **Scope of the Benefit**

- The **duty-free treatment** (tariff benefit) under the CCFTA is extended to:
  - **Apparel**
  - **Fabric and made-up goods**
  - **Spun yarn**

- **Only up to the annual quantitative limits** set in the CCFTA Annex C-00-B, Appendix 5.1, Schedules 5.B.1, 5.B.2, and 5.B.3.

> ⚠️ **Importance of Quantitative Limits**:  
> This means that even if goods meet all other criteria, the **total volume** of these goods that can be imported from Chile annually is capped. These limits prevent over-reliance on Chilean exports and maintain balance in trade.

### 3. **Conditions for Eligibility (Compliance Requirements)**

To qualify for the tariff benefit, importers or owners must satisfy **two key procedural and documentary conditions**:

#### ✅ Condition 1: **Written Declaration by Importer**

  - Accounted for under **subsection 32(1), (3), or (5)** of the *Customs Act*, **or**
  - Subject to a **refund application under paragraph 74(1)(d)** of the *Customs Act*,
- The importer must submit a **written declaration** (in English or French) stating that:
  > *"The certification referred to in paragraph (b) is in the possession of the importer or owner."*

> This ensures that the required exporter certification is available and not lost or withheld.

#### ✅ Condition 2: **Exporter Certification**
- At the time of **release of goods**, or **at any time after** the importer provides the declaration above, the importer must present:
  - A **certification from the exporter** (in English, French, or Spanish), containing:
    - The **statement specified in the form** (attached as a schedule),
    - All **requested information** (e.g., origin, production details, fiber source, etc.).
  - A **copy of the applicable invoice or sales agreement**.
- If the certification is in **Spanish**, it must be **translated into English or French** upon request by a customs officer.

> This certification is critical to verify that the goods:
> - Were produced in Chile,
> - Used raw materials from outside the free trade area,
> - Comply with the technical and origin rules of the CCFTA.

### 4. **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the day that **Section 51 of the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 14) comes into force.
