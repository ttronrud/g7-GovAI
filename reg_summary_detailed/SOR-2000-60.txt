Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation titled *"Portions of the Canada Ports Corporation Divestiture Regulations"* as provided:

---

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Canada Ports Corporation Divestiture Regulations**

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The regulation is issued by the **Treasury Board**, acting on the recommendation of the **President of the Treasury Board**.
- It is authorized under two key provisions:
  - **Paragraph 42.1(1)(u)a of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA)** – which allows the Treasury Board to make regulations relating to the superannuation of certain public servants.
  - **Paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)** – which empowers the Treasury Board to make regulations governing the administration of public service superannuation.

> This establishes that the regulation is a legally binding instrument under federal public service superannuation law.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**

#### **Who Does This Regulation Apply To?**
- Applies to a person who:
  - Ceases to be employed in the **public service**;
  - Becomes employed by a **new employer** as a result of an agreement between **Her Majesty in right of Canada** and that new employer;
  - The new employer is defined as a person or body carrying out activities previously managed by a portion of the **Canada Ports Corporation (CPC)**.

> This regulation specifically addresses the **transition of public service employees** from the Canada Ports Corporation to new private or public-sector employers following the divestiture of CPC.

#### **Exclusions**
- Does **not apply** to a person who:
  - Subsequently becomes **re-employed** by the new employer.
- Sections 4 to 9 **do not apply** to a person who has exercised an option under subsection 3(2) of the PSSA (likely referring to a voluntary early retirement or transfer option).
- Sections 12, 13, and 13.01 of the PSSA **only apply** to a person **on and after the date they cease employment with the new employer**.

> This means the regulation only governs the **initial transition period** from public service to new employment, not subsequent re-employment or long-term service with the new employer.

---

### **3. Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### **(a) Eligibility to Exercise Superannuation Options**
- Despite the general rule, **a person who would have been eligible** to exercise an option under:
  - Subsection 12(3) of the PSSA (related to early retirement or pension options), or
  - Section 13.01 of the PSSA (related to survivor benefits),
  
  **may exercise such an option** **no later than one year after** they cease to be employed in the public service and become employed by the new employer — **even if they would have otherwise been ineligible due to these regulations**.

> This is a critical exception that ensures **fair access to pension options** for employees transitioning from public service to private employment, especially those who might otherwise lose eligibility due to timing or status changes.

#### **(b) Effect of Exercising an Option**
- A person who exercises an option under subsection (2) (likely referring to the early retirement or pension option) is **deemed not to have become employed by the new employer** for the purposes of:
  - These Regulations;
  - Sections 83 to 99 of the **Public Service Superannuation Regulations** (which govern pension rights, survivor benefits, and other entitlements).

> This means the individual is **not entitled** to:
  - Any further pension or survivor benefits under sections 12, 13, or 13.01 of the PSSA upon leaving the new employer.
> This provision effectively **terminates their status as a public servant in the new employer context** once they exercise an option.

### **4. Benefits and Entitlements for Employees Who Die While Employed by the New Employer**

These provisions clarify **survivor and child benefits** for employees who die during their employment with the new employer.

| Benefit | Provision |
|--------|----------|
| **Death Benefit** | Under subsection 12(8) of the PSSA, the **survivor and children** of a deceased employee are entitled to a **return of contributions**. |
| **Survivor Allowances** | Under subsection 13(3) of the PSSA, survivors and children are entitled to allowances described in **paragraphs 12(4)(a) and (b)** of the Act (e.g., survivor pension or child allowance), **subject to limitations** in subsections 12(4) and (5). |

> These benefits are **specifically extended** to employees who transitioned from the public service to a new employer due to the divestiture of the Canada Ports Corporation.

---

### **5. Child Allowances for New Employer Employment**

- Under subsection 26(2) of the PSSA:
  - A **child born to, adopted by, or who becomes a stepchild** of the employee **during the period** from:
    - The day the employee **ceases to be employed in the public service**, to
    - The day the employee **ceases to be employed by the new employer**,
  
  is entitled to an allowance under **Part I of the Act** (i.e., the basic superannuation scheme).

> This ensures that children born or adopted during the transition period are **not excluded** from superannuation benefits due to the change in employment status.

---

### **6. Timing of Key Periods**

- The **one-year period** referred to in **paragraph 10(5)(a)** of the PSSA (likely relating to a grace period for claiming benefits or options) **begins on the date the person ceases to be employed by the new employer**.

> This is significant because it aligns the benefit period with the actual start of employment with the new employer, not the earlier date of public service termination.

---

### **7. Pensionable Service and Age Determination**

- **Pensionable service** under sections 12 and 13 of the PSSA includes:
  - The period of service with the **new employer**, from:
    - The date the person **ceases to be employed in the public service**, to
    - The date the person **ceases to be employed by the new employer**.

> This means the employee’s time with the new employer is counted toward their pensionable service, even though they were not originally a public servant during that time.

- The **age of the person** when they cease to be employed in the public service is defined as:
  - Their age **on the day they cease to be employed by the new employer**.

> This avoids confusion about age calculations during the transition period.

---

### **8. Classification of Contributors**

- Any person to whom these regulations apply is considered a **Group 1 contributor** under the Public Service Superannuation Act.

> Group 1 contributors are typically those in the federal public service and are subject to the standard superannuation rules. This classification ensures consistency in how their benefits are calculated and administered.

---

### **9. Effective Date**

- These regulations **come into force on February 14, 2000**.

> This marks the official start of the application of these rules to employees transitioning from the Canada Ports Corporation to new employers.
