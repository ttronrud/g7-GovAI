**Detailed Summary of the Whitehorse Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled the **Whitehorse Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. It establishes zoning and height restrictions for land and water adjacent to Whitehorse Airport in the Yukon Territory, primarily to ensure aviation safety by controlling structures near runways and approach paths.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several critical technical terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Whitehorse Airport**, including all lands and waters in its vicinity.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographic point used as a datum for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 2,276 feet above sea level** for all purposes under these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the end of each runway strip, perpendicular to the runway’s centerline. It ensures clear visibility for aircraft during approach. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary surface that extends above and around the airport. It is a flat plane at **150 feet above the ARP elevation**, but if this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, it is capped at **30 feet above ground**. This surface defines the upper limit for development in the broader airport area. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.

- **Strip**: A designated rectangular area of the airport’s landing surface, including runways, used for take-off and landing in a specific direction. Each strip has defined dimensions and is described in **Part V of the Schedule**.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the **lateral edges** of a strip and its associated approach surfaces. It connects the strip’s edges to the outer surface and ensures a smooth, safe transition in elevation. Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:
- All **land and underwater areas** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Whitehorse Airport.
- The **outer limits** of these areas are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are currently part of the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or operational facilities) are **exempt** from these restrictions.

This means that while the regulations govern development around the airport, they do not apply to land that is already formally designated as airport property.

### **4. Height Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on any land or water subject to these regulations,
- **If the highest point of such structure exceeds** the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of that point**:

#### a) **Approach Surfaces**
- These are inclined planes extending from each runway end.
- Each approach surface has a specific **slope ratio** (e.g., 1:50 or 1:40) and extends horizontally and vertically from the runway end.
- For example:
  - Runways **13L, 13R, 31R, 31L** have approach surfaces with a **1:50 slope** (1 foot rise per 50 feet run).
  - Runways **18 and 36** have a **1:40 slope** (1 foot rise per 40 feet run).
- Each surface rises to a horizontal line:
  - 200 feet above the elevation at the runway end (for 13L, 13R, 31R, 31L).
  - 152 feet (for 18) and 150 feet (for 36) above the end elevation.
- Horizontal reach: 10,000 feet from the end of the runway.
- The outer ends of these horizontal lines are **2,000 feet** from the runway centerline (for 13L, 13R, 31R, 31L) or **858 feet** (18) and **850 feet** (36) from the centerline.

> These surfaces ensure aircraft have unobstructed visibility during approach and landing.

#### b) **Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary surface at **150 feet above the airport reference point (2,276 ft)**.
- If the 150-foot plane is **below 30 feet above ground**, then the actual restriction is **30 feet above ground**.
- This surface defines the upper limit for all structures outside the immediate approach zones.

> The outer surface acts as a broad safety buffer to prevent obstructions in the airspace above the airport.

#### c) **Transitional Surface**
- An inclined plane rising from the **edges of each strip** and its **approach surfaces**.
- Slope: 1:7 (1 foot rise per 7 feet run), perpendicular to the runway centerline.
- Extends upward and outward until it intersects with:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent strip.
- This ensures a smooth, gradual transition in elevation between the runway edge and the outer surface, avoiding abrupt changes that could interfere with aircraft operations.

### **5. Specific Descriptions of Runway Strips**

Each runway strip is precisely defined in **Part V of the Schedule**:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **18–36** | 500 ft (250 ft on each side) | 2,950 ft |
| **13R–31L** | 1,200 ft (600 ft on each side) | 8,600 ft |
| **13L–31R** | 1,200 ft (600 ft on each side) | 7,200 ft |

These strips are shown on **Department of Transport Plan No. E.1012**, dated **January 19, 1972**, which serves as the official reference map.

### **6. Geographical Boundaries (Outer Limits)**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined in **Part II of the Schedule** and include:

- A **specific point**:
  - The **southwesterly corner of former Lot 17, Group 804**, Canada Lands Surveys Records Plan No. 40188.
  - Located **372 feet east** from the centerline of runway 13L–31R.
  - **630 feet south** along the centerline of runway 13L–31R from the intersection of runways 13L–31R and 18–36.

- Two sets of parallel lines:
  - Drawn **13,000 feet** on opposite sides of the centerline of **runway 13R–31L**.
  - Perpendicular lines drawn **10,000 feet** north and south from the **ends of the strip** (excluding Indian Reserve No. 8 – Lot 226, Group 5, Plan 24100).

> These boundaries define the maximum extent of the regulated zone.

### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations are **binding on all individuals and entities** who propose to build or modify structures on land or water within the defined zones.
- All structures must remain **below the elevation of any of the approach, outer, or transitional surfaces** at their location.
- The **Department of Transport Plan No. E.1012 (January 19, 1972)** is the official reference document for all spatial descriptions and is used for:
  - Mapping the boundaries.
  - Identifying the exact locations of approach surfaces, strips, and transitional surfaces.
  - Verifying compliance during development approvals.

---

### **8. Historical Note**

- The **Minister** is noted as having been **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**, indicating that this regulation may no longer be in force under current ministerial authority. However, the content appears to be preserved in its technical form, possibly as a historical or archived regulation, or as a foundational document still referenced in current aviation safety planning.

> This suggests that while the regulation may no longer be actively enforced, its **technical specifications remain relevant** for land-use planning, airport safety, and aviation design.

---

### **9. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is **aviation safety**:
- To ensure **clear visibility** for pilots during approach and landing.
- To prevent **obstruction of critical flight paths** by tall structures.
- To maintain **consistent and predictable airspace geometry** around the airport.

By defining precise elevation limits and geometric surfaces, the regulation provides a **scientific and measurable framework** for land use and development near the airport.

### **10. Summary in Plain Language**

These regulations set strict **height limits** on buildings and structures near Whitehorse Airport. Any construction or addition must not rise above specific **imaginary planes** that extend from the runways and their ends. These planes include:

- **Approach surfaces** (sloped planes from runway ends) to ensure safe aircraft visibility.
- An **outer surface** (flat plane at 150 feet above airport reference point) to protect the broader airspace.
- A **transitional surface
