**Detailed Summary of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**

These regulations are made under **subsection 7(1)a** of the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act") and are approved by the **Provincial Minister of Newfoundland and Labrador**. This approval ensures that the regulations align with provincial interests and are consistent with the shared objectives of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord, particularly in the area of offshore petroleum regulation.

The Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources) has formally enacted the regulations under **subsection 202.01(1)c** of the Act, which authorizes the establishment of administrative monetary penalties for violations of offshore petroleum activities.

---

### **2. Scope of the Regulations**

The regulations establish a framework for **administrative monetary penalties (AMPs)** to be applied to violations related to offshore petroleum operations in the Canadian Atlantic region — specifically between Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador.

#### **Types of Violations Covered**

The following actions constitute violations that may be prosecuted under the Act and these regulations:

1. **Contravention of provisions in Part III of the Act or regulations made under Part III**  
   - Specifically, any provision listed in **Column 1 of a Part of Schedule 1**.

2. **Contravention of directions, requirements, decisions, or orders issued under Part III of the Act**  
   - These include formal directives issued by regulatory authorities to operators.

3. **Contravention of terms or conditions of:**
   - An **operating licence** or **authorization** issued under Part III of the Act
   - An **approval or exemption** granted under Part III of the Act

> These violations are all subject to enforcement under **Sections 202.01 to 202.93** of the Act, which govern the administrative penalty process.

### **3. Classification of Violations: Type A vs. Type B**

Violations are categorized into two types based on their severity and nature:

| Violation Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Type A Violation** | A contravention of a provision in **Column 1 of Schedule 1** (e.g., safety, environmental, or operational standards). |
| **Type B Violation** | A contravention of a **direction, requirement, decision, or order** under Part III of the Act, or of a **term or condition** of a licence, approval, or exemption. |

> **Key Point**: All violations are either Type A or Type B, and the classification determines the applicable penalty amount.

### **4. Penalty Structure Based on Gravity Value**

The amount of penalty imposed depends on the **total gravity value** assigned to the violation, calculated as follows:

#### **Steps to Determine Total Gravity Value:**
1. **Identify each relevant criterion** listed in **Column 1** of the gravity table (in the regulations).
2. **Assign a gravity value** (from Column 2) to each criterion, based on the **specific circumstances** of the violation.
   - Lower gravity value = less serious
   - Higher gravity value = more serious
3. **Sum the gravity values** across all applicable criteria to arrive at the **total gravity value**.

#### **Penalty Amounts by Violation Type:**
- **Type A Violation**: Penalty = amount in **Column 2** of Schedule 2 (corresponding to the total gravity value).
- **Type B Violation**: Penalty = amount in **Column 3** of Schedule 2 (corresponding to the total gravity value).

> This structure allows for **proportionality** in penalties — more serious violations (with higher gravity values) result in higher fines.

### **5. Service of Regulatory Documents**

The regulations specify how documents (e.g., notices of violation, penalty notices, or compliance requirements) must be served to ensure legal validity and due process.

#### **For Individuals:**
- Leave a copy with the individual.
- Leave a copy with an adult household member at the individual’s last known address or usual residence.
- Send a copy via **registered mail, courier, fax, or electronic means** to the individual’s last known address or residence.

#### **For Non-Individuals (e.g., companies, organizations):**
- Leave a copy at the head office or place of business with an officer who appears to manage or control it.
- Send a copy via **registered mail, courier, or fax** to the head office or place of business.
- Send a copy via **electronic means (not fax)** to an officer or individual who manages or controls the entity.

#### **When is Service Considered Complete?**
- **Left with a household member**: On the day it is left.
- **Sent by registered mail or courier**: On the **10th day after** the date shown on the postal/courier receipt.
- **Sent by fax or electronic means**: On the **day of transmission**.

> This ensures clarity and legal certainty regarding when a notice is deemed "served" for enforcement purposes.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 66 of the Energy Safety and Security Act** comes into force.  
However, if the regulations are **registered (published) after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provides a clear timeline for implementation and ensures alignment with broader federal safety and security legislation.

---

### **7. Key Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several important functions:

- **Enforce compliance** with offshore petroleum safety, environmental protection, and operational standards.
- Provide a **clear, transparent, and proportionate penalty system** that responds to the seriousness of violations.
- Promote **accountability and deterrence** among offshore operators.
- Ensure **cooperative enforcement** between federal and provincial authorities under the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord.
- Offer **predictability and fairness** in administrative penalties through a structured gravity-based system.

---

### **8. Practical Implications for Operators**

- Operators must understand the **differences between Type A and Type B violations** and how they affect penalty levels.
- They must ensure compliance with all **provisions, directions, and licence conditions** to avoid penalties.
- In the event of a violation, operators must respond promptly to **service of notices** and may be required to submit a gravity assessment to justify the penalty.
- The **gravity value calculation** requires careful review of facts and circumstances, including:
  - The nature and scope of the violation
  - Whether it was intentional or negligent
  - Past compliance history
  - Impact on safety or environment

---

### **9. Final Notes**

- The regulations were **first published in February 2016** and remain in force as of that date.
- They reflect a **collaborative regulatory approach** between Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador, emphasizing shared responsibility in managing offshore energy activities.
- The use of **gravity-based penalties** introduces a more nuanced and context-sensitive enforcement mechanism than fixed fines.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Administrative Monetary Penalties Regulations* provide a comprehensive, fair, and enforceable system for addressing non-compliance in offshore petroleum operations. By classifying violations into Type A and Type B categories and applying penalties based on a calculated gravity value, the regulations balance regulatory rigor with proportionality. Combined with clear service rules and a defined effective date, they form a robust legal framework to ensure safety, environmental protection, and operational integrity in the region’s offshore energy sector.
