**Detailed Summary of the Refund of Duties on Obsolete or Surplus Goods Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**  
The *Refund of Duties on Obsolete or Surplus Goods Regulations* were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of National Revenue. This action is authorized under **Section 112 of the Customs Tariff**, which provides the legal framework for the refund of duties in specific circumstances—particularly when goods are obsolete or surplus.

---

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a clear and structured process for applying for a refund of duties paid on imported goods that are no longer needed or have become surplus to the importer’s requirements. This ensures that importers are not unfairly burdened with duties on goods that are no longer in use or have been rendered obsolete due to changes in demand, technological advancement, or other business factors.

**3. Requirements for an Application for Refund**  
To qualify for a refund under **Section 110 of the Customs Tariff**, an applicant must submit the following two key documents:

- **(a) A Certified Document Identifying Obsolete or Surplus Goods**  
  The applicant must provide a document that is **certified by an authorized officer** (such as a customs officer or a designated government official). This certification must clearly identify the specific goods as being obsolete or surplus. The certification serves as official verification that the goods no longer serve their intended purpose or are no longer required for the importer’s operations.

- **(b) A List of Relevant Accounting Documents**  
  The applicant must also submit a list of the documents required under **Part I of the Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations** that pertain to the importation of the goods in question. These documents typically include:
  - Import declarations
  - Commercial invoices
  - Packing lists
  - Bills of lading or airway bills
  - Customs entry forms
  - Payment records
  - Any other supporting documentation that confirms the importation and duty payment.

This list ensures transparency and accountability in the refund process by verifying that all necessary records related to the original importation have been preserved and are available for review.

**4. Exception for Lack of Certified Officer**  
In cases where **an authorized officer is not available** to provide the required certification, the regulations allow for a substitution. In such instances, **non-certified documentation** that contains **substantially equivalent information** may be used in place of the certified document. For example:
- A business report or internal memo from the importer’s management that clearly states the goods are obsolete or surplus
- A letter from a supplier or consultant indicating the goods are no longer needed
- A detailed inventory report showing the goods are no longer in use

The key requirement is that the substituted documentation must **contain sufficient and clear evidence** to demonstrate that the goods are obsolete or surplus, even if it is not formally certified by a government officer.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
These regulations came into force on **January 1, 1998**. This means that all applications for duty refunds under this regime must be submitted on or after this date, and the rules apply to goods imported on or after that date.

---

**6. Key Implications and Practical Considerations**  
- **Importers must maintain accurate records** to support any refund claim, especially under Part I of the Accounting Regulations.  
- The certification requirement emphasizes the need for official validation, which may add administrative burden—however, the substitution provision provides flexibility in practical scenarios.  
- The regulations promote fairness by ensuring that only legitimate cases of obsolete or surplus goods receive refunds, preventing misuse of the system.  
- The rules are aligned with broader customs administration principles of accountability, transparency, and compliance.

**Conclusion**  
The *Refund of Duties on Obsolete or Surplus Goods Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 36) provide a clear, enforceable, and practical framework for refunding duties on goods that are no longer needed. By requiring certified documentation and a comprehensive list of import records, the regulations ensure that refunds are granted only in genuine cases. The flexibility to use non-certified documentation in certain circumstances supports real-world business needs while maintaining the integrity of the customs process. These regulations remain in effect as of the date of this summary and continue to serve as an important tool in the administration of Canadian customs duties.
