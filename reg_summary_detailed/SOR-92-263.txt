**Detailed Summary of the Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**
The regulations are issued under the authority of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is grounded in two specific provisions of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*:
- **Subsection 92(2)** of the Act, which authorizes the Governor General in Council to make regulations as necessary for the administration and operation of cooperative credit associations.
- **Section 463** of the Act, which provides the legislative basis for setting fees related to security certificates issued by such associations.

**Regulatory Title:**
The regulations are officially titled the *Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* and may be cited as such.

**Effective Date:**
The provisions of these regulations come into force on **June 1, 1992**.

**Core Provision:**
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish a maximum fee that a cooperative credit association may charge when issuing a security certificate in connection with a transfer of membership interests or shares.

Specifically, the regulations **limit the fee to a maximum of five Canadian dollars (CAD)**. This fee applies to any security certificate issued by a cooperative credit association as a result of a transfer of membership interests or shares.

**Scope of Application:**
- The regulation applies to all cooperative credit associations authorized under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.
- It governs the fee charged at the time of issuing a security certificate to verify or document a transfer of ownership or membership interest.
- The fee is not a charge for administrative processing, legal services, or other ancillary services, but specifically for the issuance of the security certificate itself.

**Purpose and Intent:**
The regulation aims to:
- Ensure transparency and fairness in the transfer process by setting a clear, reasonable cap on fees.
- Prevent excessive or arbitrary charges that could burden members, particularly smaller or rural cooperative members.
- Promote access to transfer services and maintain the integrity of cooperative governance structures by ensuring affordability.

**Key Limitations:**
- The fee cannot exceed **$5.00**.
- The association may charge **less than $5.00**, but not more.
- The regulation does not cover fees for other services such as transfer registration, legal advice, or administrative processing — those are outside the scope of this specific regulation.

**Legal Citation:**
The regulations are part of the *Statutes of Canada, 1991, Chapter 48* (S.C. 1991, c. 48), which includes the original *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* and related amendments.

**Conclusion:**
The *Security Certificate Transfer Fee (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* provide a clear, enforceable cap on fees for issuing security certificates during transfers within cooperative credit associations. By limiting the fee to five dollars, the regulation ensures affordability, promotes equitable access to membership transfer services, and supports the stability and accessibility of cooperative financial institutions in Canada. This regulatory measure is a key component of financial governance within the cooperative credit sector.
