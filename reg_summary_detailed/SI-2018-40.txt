The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)* in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and significance:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order Acknowledging Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments (S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Date of Enactment:**  
2002 (as part of the statutory instrument S.C. 2002, c. 29)

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Recognition of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The regulation formally acknowledges that the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has completed and submitted scientific assessments for specific species listed in the annexed schedule. These assessments are required under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA).

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The action is grounded in subsection 23(1) of SARA, which mandates that the Minister of the Environment must receive and consider assessments from COSEWIC regarding species at risk. Upon receipt of these assessments, the Minister is required to act on them in determining whether a species should be listed as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under the Act.

3. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   This Order serves as an official confirmation that the assessments have been received and are now part of the regulatory process. It is not a decision on listing status itself, but rather a procedural step that enables the Minister to proceed with the formal evaluation and potential listing of species under SARA.

4. **Scope:**  
   The regulation refers to a schedule (annex) that lists specific species for which COSEWIC has completed its assessments. These species are subject to further review and potential designation under the Act based on the scientific findings.

5. **Procedural Significance:**  
   This step is critical in the SARA process because:
   - It validates the scientific basis of the risk status of species.
   - It triggers the next phase of the process, where the Minister may propose a listing decision.
   - It ensures transparency and accountability by documenting that assessments have been received and reviewed.

6. **No Immediate Listing Decision:**  
   Importantly, this Order does not itself list any species as at risk. That determination is made later by the Minister of the Environment, following consultation with COSEWIC, scientific experts, and other stakeholders.

**Context within the Species at Risk Act (SARA):**

- SARA (1996) is a federal law designed to prevent wildlife extinction and promote the recovery of species at risk in Canada.
- COSEWIC is an independent, scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species and providing expert recommendations to the government.
- The process under SARA involves:
  1. COSEWIC conducting scientific assessments.
  2. The Minister receiving and reviewing those assessments.
  3. The Minister making a formal decision on listing (endangered, threatened, special concern).
  4. The establishment of recovery strategies and action plans for listed species.

---

**Implications:**

- This Order ensures that the government is legally and procedurally aligned with the scientific assessments of species at risk.
- It provides a clear record of the timeline and process in the conservation of biodiversity.
- It supports the implementation of conservation measures, as listing under SARA can lead to legal protections, habitat conservation, and recovery planning.

**Conclusion:**

The regulation S.C. 2002, c. 29 is a procedural instrument that formally recognizes the receipt of COSEWIC assessments for specific species. It marks a key milestone in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*, ensuring that scientific evaluations are properly integrated into the government’s decision-making process. While it does not itself designate species as at risk, it is an essential step toward protecting Canada’s biodiversity through legally sound and science-based conservation efforts.
