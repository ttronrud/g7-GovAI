### **Detailed Summary of the New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)**  
*Enacted under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*

---

## **I. Background and Legal Basis**

The **New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)** were adopted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to **subsection 89(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*.

This regulation was preceded by a **proposed version** published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **October 30, 2004**, under subsection **332(1)a** of CEPA 1999. The proposed regulations provided a public opportunity for stakeholders to submit **comments or objections** to the proposed rules, including requests for a **board of review** to assess the scientific or regulatory merits of the proposed requirements.

After considering public input, the final regulations were enacted to establish **mandatory notification requirements** for manufacturers and importers of **new chemicals and polymers** not already on the Domestic Substances List (DSL), with the goal of assessing their potential toxicity and environmental impact under CEPA 1999.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The regulations define key terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* |
| **Animal / Plant** | Includes parts but excludes single-celled organisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses) without tissue/organ structure |
| **Polymer** | A substance composed of molecules with one or more monomer units covalently bonded; >50% of molecules have ≥3 monomer units; molecular weight distribution due to variation in monomer count |
| **Monomer unit** | The reacted form of a monomer in a polymer |
| **Reactant** | A substance used in polymer manufacturing that becomes part of the polymer’s chemical composition (includes monomers) |
| **Reactive functional group** | Atoms or groups expected to undergo chemical reactions |
| **Chemical** | A substance that is *not* a polymer |
| **Biochemical** | A substance produced by microorganisms or derived from plant/animal proteins/nucleic acids |
| **Biopolymer** | A polymer produced by microorganisms or derived from plant/animal proteins/nucleic acids |
| **Anionic/Cationic Polymer** | Polymers with net negative or positive charge, respectively |
| **CAS Registry Number** | Unique identification number assigned by the American Chemical Society |
| **DSL (Domestic Substances List)** | List of substances already assessed and deemed safe under CEPA 1999 |
| **NDSL (Non-domestic Substances List)** | List of substances not yet assessed and not on the DSL; subject to notification requirements |
| **Site-limited intermediate substance** | A substance manufactured and consumed at the same site, or transported to another site for consumption |
| **Export-only substance** | A substance manufactured and exported without domestic use |
| **Research and Development (R&D) substance** | A substance being investigated for technical viability, performance, or product improvement—not for commercialization |
| **Test marketing** | Market exploration where product improvement is *not* the primary objective |
| **Safety Data Sheet (SDS)** | Must meet requirements under the *Hazardous Products Regulations* |

> **Note**: The term "government" in subsection 3(1) of CEPA does *not* apply to "government agencies" in these regulations.

## **III. Regulatory Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Ensure early identification** of potentially toxic substances before they enter widespread use.
2. **Provide the Minister of the Environment** with sufficient data to determine whether a chemical or polymer is:
   - **Toxic** or
   - **Capable of becoming toxic** (under section 64 of CEPA 1999)
3. **Enable risk assessment** and informed decision-making regarding inclusion on the **Domestic Substances List (DSL)** under section 87 of CEPA 1999.
4. **Establish clear timelines and information requirements** for manufacturers and importers to submit data prior to exceeding certain thresholds in annual production or import volumes.

## **IV. Structure of the Regulations**

The regulations are organized into **four parts** and several **schedules**:

| Part | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Part 1 & 2** | Specify the **information requirements** for chemicals and polymers based on type, volume, and use |
| **Part 3** | Covers **administrative matters**, including timelines, exemptions, and data submission procedures |
| **Part 4** | Outlines **obligations of the Ministers** (Environment and Health) in reviewing and assessing submissions |

### **Schedules (Information to be Submitted)**

| Schedule | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Schedule 1** | Information required for **chemicals** (R&D, site-limited intermediates, export-only) when volume exceeds 1,000 kg/year |
| **Schedule 2** | Additional data for **biochemicals**, including nucleic acids and enzymatic capability |
| **Schedule 3** | Information required for **polymers** (R&D, site-limited intermediates, export-only) when volume exceeds 10,000 kg/year |
| **Schedule 4** | Data required for **NDSL chemicals** when volume exceeds 1,000 kg/year |
| **Schedule 5** | Additional data for **NDSL chemicals** when volume exceeds 10,000 kg/year |
| **Schedule 6** | Data required for **non-NDSL chemicals** when volume exceeds 10,000 kg/year |
| **Schedule 7** | Lists of **polymer types** that qualify for reduced regulatory requirements |
| **Schedule 8** | Lists of **reactants** used in polymer production |
| **Schedule 9** | Information required for **polymers** (excluding those in section 6) when volume exceeds 1,000 kg/year |

> **Flowcharts in Schedules 9–11** provide an overview of the information pathways and decision trees for different substance types and volumes.
