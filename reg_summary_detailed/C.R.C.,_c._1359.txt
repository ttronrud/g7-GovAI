**Detailed Summary of the *Public Service Superannuation Special Election Regulations***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially known as the **Public Service Superannuation Special Election Regulations**. They are designed to address a specific administrative and legal issue related to **incorrect advice** given to public servants about the eligibility of certain periods of service for pension purposes under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* (the "Act").

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, which governs the pension system for members of the Canadian public service.
- **"Superannuation Act"**: Used interchangeably with the Act, and carries the meaning assigned to it in the Act.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to a **contributor under the Act** who belongs to a specific class of individuals who:
- Received **erroneous advice** from a person in the Public Service (whose ordinary duties included giving advice on contributions under the Superannuation Act or the Act),
- Were **misinformed** that a period of their prior or subsequent service could be counted toward their pensionable service **without them having to pay contributions** for that service.

This misadvice led them to:
- **Fail to elect** (or fail to elect within the prescribed time frame) to pay contributions for that service, which would normally be required under the Act.

---

### **4. Right to Elect (Special Election)**
A person described in section 3 (i.e., one who received erroneous advice and failed to elect) may now **elect** to count the previously excluded service period for pension purposes — **even if they are not currently employed in the Public Service**.

#### Conditions for Election:
- The election must be made **within one year** of the day on which the **President of the Treasury Board** formally advises the individual that:
  - The service period can be counted;
  - The election can be deemed to have been made **within the prescribed time limit** under the Act.

> This provision provides a **one-year window** for individuals to correct a past mistake due to misleading advice.

---

### **5. Form and Legal Requirements of Election**
- The election must be submitted in the **form prescribed by the President of the Treasury Board**.
- All general rules in the Act regarding how elections are made (e.g., form, submission, validity) **apply mutatis mutandis** (with necessary adjustments) to this special election.
- **Exception**: Sections 19 of the Act (which may deal with specific procedural rules or exemptions) do not apply in this context.

---

### **6. Contribution Obligations Upon Election**
When a person makes such a special election, they are **required to pay the contribution** that would have been due had they elected **within the prescribed time period** under the Act.

#### Specific Provision:
- The contribution must be paid **immediately upon receipt of the erroneous advice**.
- The amount is calculated based on the contribution rate as set out in **Section 6 of the Act**, as it stood **at the time immediately after** the individual received the erroneous advice.

> This ensures that individuals do not benefit from the mistaken service credit without compensating for the missed contribution obligation.

---

### **7. Adjustment of Previous Elections (Deemed Election)**
If a person who received erroneous advice:
- Had already made an election under **clause 5(1)(b)(iii)(K)** of the Act (which allows counting of service without contribution) for the **same service period**, **but**:
  - Made that election under **another clause** (e.g., (A), (F), (G), (H), or (I)) of the Act — **or**
  - Made it earlier under clause (K), but for a **different** erroneous advice,

Then:
- That earlier election is **deemed to have been made** at the time of receiving the **erroneous advice**, **within the required time limit**.
- This deemed election is treated as if it were made under the **correct statutory provision** (e.g., clause (K)) at the time of the advice.

> **Result**: An adjustment is made to the contributions already paid:
  - Either through a **refund** (if overpaid), or
  - Through a **reduction in the number of future instalments** (if underpaid).

> For the purpose of calculating this adjustment, the election is treated as if it had been made under **Section 4** (the special election rule).

---

### **8. Special Provision for Service Periods Exceeding 35 Years**
A person described in section 3 who:
- Would have a **total pensionable service period exceeding 35 years** if the service in question were added to their existing pensionable service,
- And who **would not otherwise be eligible** for such a benefit,

May make a special election under the same rules as in section 4 — **provided they meet the one-year deadline**.

> This ensures that individuals who would otherwise qualify for a higher pension due to the inclusion of a previously non-counted service are not unfairly excluded.

---

### **9. Determination of Adjustments**
- The **President of the Treasury Board** has the authority to determine:
  - Whether a **refund** or **reduction in contributions** is needed,
  - The **amount and method** of adjustment.
- However, **no contribution may be required** for a period of service that exceeds the limits specified in **paragraph 4(2)(a) or (b)** of the Act.

> This sets a **ceiling** on how much service can be retroactively included — preventing unlimited retroactive benefits.

---

### **10. Purpose and Policy Intent**
These regulations serve several key policy objectives:
- **Correcting errors** caused by misleading or erroneous advice from public service officials.
- **Providing fairness** to individuals who were not given proper information about their pension rights.
- **Ensuring compliance** with the Act’s contribution requirements — individuals must pay for service they are counting, even if they were misled.
- **Preventing abuse** by limiting retroactive inclusion to specific time frames and service periods.
- **Maintaining pension system integrity** while allowing for corrective action in cases of clear administrative error.
