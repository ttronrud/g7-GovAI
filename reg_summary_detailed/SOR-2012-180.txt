**Detailed Summary of the CJFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *CJFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish specific rules of origin for goods under a trade agreement—specifically, the **Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (CJEGA)**.

These regulations are part of the broader framework designed to ensure that goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Jordan Free Trade Agreement (CJFTA) meet defined origin criteria. The regulations were published under **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)** and are referenced in **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which provides the foundational legal basis for such rules.

### **Definition of "Casual Goods"**

In these regulations, the term **"casual goods"** is defined as:

> *Goods other than goods imported for sale or for an industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use.*

This means that casual goods are **not intended for resale or for use in a business or industrial context**. Instead, they are typically imported for **personal use, private consumption, or non-commercial purposes**—such as household items, personal items, or goods used in personal or domestic settings.

This distinction is crucial because the rules of origin for casual goods differ from those for commercial or industrial goods, which are subject to more rigorous production and value-addition requirements.

### **Origin Determination for Casual Goods Acquired in Jordan**

A key feature of these regulations is the simplified origin rule for **casual goods acquired in Jordan**. Under the regulations, such goods are considered to **originate in Jordan** and are therefore eligible to benefit from the **Jordan Tariff** (i.e., preferential tariff treatment under the CJFTA) if **either of the following conditions is met**:

#### **Condition 1: Marking in Accordance with Jordanian Marking Laws**
- The goods must bear a **mark** that:
  - Complies with **Jordan’s marking laws**, and
  - Clearly indicates that the goods are the **product of Jordan or Canada**.

> This marking requirement ensures transparency and traceability of origin, allowing customs authorities to verify the goods' country of origin.

#### **Condition 2: No Mark or No Indication of Non-Origin**
- If the goods **do not bear any mark**, or if there is **no indication** that they are not the product of Jordan or Canada, they are still considered to originate in Jordan.

> This provision provides a **simplified pathway** for goods that may not have visible or official markings—common in personal or informal trade—while still allowing them to qualify for preferential treatment.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 36 of the Canada–Jordan Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (CJEGA), Chapter 18 of the Statutes of Canada, 2012**, comes into force.

> **Note:** The regulations are effective as of **October 1, 2012**, which is the date when Section 36 of the CJEGA was enacted and came into force.

This ensures alignment with the broader implementation timeline of the Canada–Jordan Free Trade Agreement and provides a clear date for compliance and application by Canadian customs authorities and importers.

### **Purpose and Significance**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

1. **Facilitate trade** between Canada and Jordan by simplifying origin rules for casual goods.
2. **Support personal and non-commercial imports**, which may otherwise be subject to higher tariffs due to lack of formal documentation or commercial intent.
3. **Ensure compliance with the CJFTA’s origin requirements** without imposing complex documentation or value-addition thresholds on goods used for personal consumption.

By recognizing casual goods as originating in Jordan when they meet the marking or absence-of-indication criteria, the regulations promote **fair and practical trade access** while maintaining the integrity of the agreement’s origin rules.
