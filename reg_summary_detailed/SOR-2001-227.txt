The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of various provisions in statutory regulations (SORs — Statutory Orders or Regulations), with the majority of the entries citing **SOR/2013-119, s. 267** and other earlier regulations such as **SOR/2005-177, s. 6**, **SOR/2003-387, s. 3**, **SOR/2010-63, s. 2**, and **SOR/2014-51, s. 4**.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Content:**
This list does **not** contain an active, enforceable regulation. Instead, it is a **record of repealed provisions** — meaning that the specific sections of regulations referenced have been officially **removed or cancelled** by subsequent legislation.

**2. Key Repealed Provisions:**
- **SOR/2013-119, s. 267**: This section is mentioned **over 40 times** in the list. It indicates that multiple provisions previously governed by this section have been repealed. SOR/2013-119 is a Statutory Order issued in 2013, likely related to the *Canada Labour Code* or another labor, health, or safety regulation. Section 267 likely dealt with rules concerning employment standards, workplace safety, or worker rights — but the exact content is not provided here.
  
- **SOR/2005-177, s. 6, s. 11, s. 13, s. 22**: These sections were repealed, suggesting that earlier rules on workplace safety, employment conditions, or occupational health standards were removed. SOR/2005-177 may have been a regulation related to workplace safety or health.

- **SOR/2003-387, s. 3, s. 10, s. 12**: This order likely pertains to labor standards or employment practices. The repeal of these sections implies that outdated or superseded rules were removed.

- **SOR/2010-63, s. 2**: A more recent repeal, possibly related to employment or workplace policy.

- **SOR/2014-51, s. 4**: This section was also repealed, indicating a change in policy or administrative framework.

**3. Purpose of the Repeal:**
The repeated citations of repeal (e.g., “Repealed, SOR/2013-119, s. 267”) suggest that:
- The regulations were **outdated**, **inconsistent**, or **in conflict** with newer laws.
- They were **replaced by more modern, comprehensive, or equitable standards**.
- There was a **policy shift** in labor, employment, or workplace safety governance.

**4. Legal and Practical Implications:**
- Any legal obligation or requirement previously derived from the repealed sections is **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal practitioners, employers, and employees must now refer to the **current, active regulations** (e.g., the updated *Employment Standards Act*, *Workplace Safety and Insurance Act*, or other relevant legislation).
- The repeal may reflect a broader effort to **simplify regulatory frameworks**, **improve clarity**, or **align with international best practices**.

**5. Contextual Notes:**
- The repetition of the same repeal notice (e.g., “Repealed, SOR/2013-119, s. 267”) may be due to:
  - A formatting or data entry error.
  - A list of multiple provisions that were all repealed under the same statutory instrument.
  - A database or document that lists each repealed section individually, even if they are part of a broader repeal.

**6. Conclusion:**
This document is **not a regulation**, but rather a **record of legislative changes** — specifically, the **repeal of several outdated or obsolete sections** of previous regulations. The most significant and frequently cited repeal is **SOR/2013-119, s. 267**, which appears to have been the central instrument in removing a range of prior employment or workplace standards.

👉 **In short**:  
The provided text is a list of **repealed regulatory provisions**, primarily from SOR/2013-119 and earlier orders. These provisions have been **officially removed** from the law, likely to modernize, streamline, or replace outdated employment or workplace safety rules.

> ⚠️ Note: Without access to the full text of the original regulations or the specific legal context (e.g., which statute or act SOR/2013-119 is part of), a detailed summary of the *original content* of the repealed sections cannot be provided. However, the **purpose and nature** of the repeal are clear from the structure and context.
