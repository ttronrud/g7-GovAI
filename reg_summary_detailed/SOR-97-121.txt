Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation, structured for clarity, legal precision, and contextual understanding:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order Restricting Certain Immunity in Relation to the United States**

#### **1. Background and Legal Context**

This regulation is an administrative order issued under the **State Immunity Act** (SIA) of Canada, specifically in relation to the **United States of America**. It addresses the issue of **sovereign immunity**—a principle in international law and domestic law that generally shields foreign states and their agencies from legal liability in foreign courts.

The regulation responds to a perceived **gap or overreach** in the immunity granted to certain foreign entities acting on behalf of the United States.

---

#### **2. Key Legal Provisions in the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976**

- The **Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976 (28 U.S.C.)** establishes the conditions under which foreign states and their agencies may be subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
- A critical provision under the FSIA is that **a foreign state or its agency/instrumentality is not immune from suit in U.S. courts if it is a separate legal person** (e.g., a corporation or entity), **unless**:
  - A **majority of its shares or ownership interests** are owned by the foreign state itself, or
  - A **political subdivision** of that foreign state (e.g., a state or local government within the U.S.) holds a majority ownership interest.

This means that **non-state-owned entities** acting on behalf of a foreign government are generally **not immune** from legal action in U.S. courts under the FSIA.

#### **3. Discrepancy Identified by the Governor in Council**

The **Governor in Council** (the Canadian executive authority, acting on the advice of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) observes that:

- The **State Immunity Act** of Canada, in its current application to the United States, **grants broader immunity** to certain entities acting on behalf of the U.S. than what is permitted under the U.S. FSIA.
- Specifically, the Canadian law may **exceed the limits** set by U.S. law, which requires **majority ownership** by the U.S. state or its political subdivisions for immunity to apply.

This creates a **conflict or inconsistency** between Canadian law and U.S. law, particularly in cross-border litigation involving entities that are not wholly owned by the U.S. government.

---

#### **4. Purpose of the Order**

The purpose of this regulation is to **align Canadian sovereign immunity law with the U.S. FSIA** in cases involving entities acting on behalf of the United States.

By restricting the scope of immunity, the Order ensures that **Canadian courts do not grant immunity to foreign entities** (including non-corporate legal persons) that are acting on behalf of the U.S. unless they meet the **ownership threshold** set by the U.S. FSIA.

---

#### **5. Content of the Order (S.C. 1995, c. 5, par. 25(1)(z.3))**

> **"The immunity accorded under the State Immunity Act, in relation to the United States, shall not extend to a legal entity, whether or not it is a corporate entity, wherever registered, that is acting on behalf of, on instructions from or at the request of the United States, unless a majority of the shares or other ownership interest of the legal entity is owned by the United States or a political subdivision of the United States."**

**Key Elements of This Provision:**

- **Scope**: Applies to **any legal entity** (corporations, trusts, foundations, partnerships, etc.) regardless of form or place of registration.
- **Trigger for Immunity Loss**: The entity must be **acting on behalf of, receiving instructions from, or being requested by the United States**.
- **Condition for Immunity**: Immunity **only applies** if **a majority of the ownership interest** is held by:
  - The **United States** (e.g., the federal government), or
  - A **political subdivision** of the United States (e.g., a state government, city, or local authority).
- **Effect**: If the ownership threshold is not met, the entity **loses immunity** in Canadian courts and may be subject to legal action.

---

#### **6. Legal Authority**

The Order is issued **pursuant to Section 15a of the State Immunity Act**. This section empowers the Governor in Council to **make regulations restricting or modifying** the scope of immunity granted to foreign states or their instruments in relation to specific countries, including the United States.

This provision allows for **flexible, policy-based adjustments** to ensure consistency with international legal standards and reciprocal obligations.

---

#### **7. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on February 18, 1997**.
- This date marks the point at which the restriction on immunity becomes legally binding in Canadian courts.

---

#### **8. Significance and Implications**

- **Legal Clarity**: Provides clear, enforceable criteria for when a U.S.-related entity is immune in Canadian courts.
- **International Consistency**: Aligns Canadian law with U.S. legal standards, reducing potential conflicts in cross-border litigation.
- **Judicial Predictability**: Enables Canadian courts to assess whether a foreign entity is immune based on ownership, not just its relationship to the U.S. government.
- **Practical Impact**: Entities like U.S. government contractors, subsidiaries, or foreign subsidiaries operating under U.S. direction may now be subject to Canadian legal proceedings if they do not meet the majority ownership requirement.

---

#### **9. Limitations and Exceptions**

- The Order **does not apply to the U.S. government itself**, nor to its political subdivisions.
- It **does not override** other provisions of the State Immunity Act or other international agreements.
- It applies **only to entities acting on behalf of or under instruction from the U.S.**, not to unrelated activities.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted legislative adjustment** designed to prevent Canadian courts from extending immunity to U.S.-related entities that lack majority ownership by the U.S. government or its political subdivisions. It reflects a commitment to **legal reciprocity**, **international legal harmony**, and **judicial transparency** in cross-border legal matters. By restricting immunity based on ownership, the Order ensures that Canadian legal systems operate in alignment with U.S. sovereign immunity standards under the FSIA.
