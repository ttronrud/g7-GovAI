**Detailed Summary of the Stephenville Airport Zoning Regulations (Canada Gazette, Part I, October 4, 1986)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Procedural Context**

The Stephenville Airport Zoning Regulations are established under **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports to ensure safety and operational efficiency.

Prior to enactment, a **proposed version** of these regulations was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **October 4, 1986**, providing a reasonable opportunity for interested parties (e.g., landowners, municipalities, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport. This public consultation process ensures transparency and stakeholder engagement before final regulation is adopted.

### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulation**

- **Official Title**: *Stephenville Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of **Stephenville Airport**, located in the **electoral district of Port au Port, Province of Newfoundland**.

The regulation governs land use and physical development around the airport with the primary objective of **ensuring aviation safety** by controlling obstructions that could interfere with aircraft takeoff, landing, or approach operations.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation introduces several technical terms essential to understanding the spatial constraints:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Stephenville Airport in Port au Port, Newfoundland. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for measuring distances and elevations. Defined by coordinates: N 5,378,350.07 m and E 301,010.98 m. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway (runway 10–28), rising at a 1:50 slope (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal), reaching a horizontal line 15,000 meters from the runway end and 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. This line is 300 meters above the elevation at the runway end. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, but capped at **9 meters above ground level** if the natural ground is lower than 9 meters. This defines the upper limit for all structures and natural features. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, 300 meters wide (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline) and 3,170 meters long, associated with runway 10–28. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects the outer surface. |

---

### **4. Elevation Datum**

- The **assigned elevation** of the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **15 meters above sea level**.
- All measurements and surface elevations are referenced to this point.
- This establishes a consistent baseline for calculating heights of structures and natural features relative to the airport.

---

### **5. Applicable Land Areas**

The regulation applies to:

1. **All lands within the outer limits** of the area described in **Part VI of the Schedule** (a circular boundary of 4,000 meters radius from the ARP).
2. **All lands directly under portions of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limits.

> This ensures that both the immediate vicinity and extended approach zones are subject to strict height controls.

---

### **6. Height Restrictions on Structures and Objects**

No person may:

- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object, or
- **Add to an existing structure**,  
such that the **highest point** of the object exceeds:

- The **approach surface**,  
- The **outer surface**, or  
- The **transitional surface**.

This restriction applies to all man-made features, including buildings, towers, trees, antennas, and signage.

---

### **7. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) exceeds the elevation of any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier of the land to:
  - Remove the excessive portion of the growth, or
  - Prune it to bring it within the allowable height limits.

> This provision ensures that even natural features do not pose a hazard during flight operations.

---

### **8. Prohibition on Bird Attractants**

- No owner or occupier may allow land under these regulations to be used for:
  - **Disposal of waste** that is **edible or attractive to birds**.

> This is a critical measure to prevent bird strikes, which are a major aviation safety risk.

---

### **9. Geometric and Topographic Descriptions (Based on Public Works Canada Plans)**

All surfaces and boundaries are defined using precise geometric and topographic data from **Public Works Canada zoning plans dated July 31, 1985**, specifically:

#### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located 1,585 meters northeasterly along the centerline of runway 10–28 from its intersection with the westerly end of the strip.
- Then 150 meters northwesterly at right angles from that centerline to the northerly edge of the strip.
- Coordinates: **N 5,378,350.07 m, E 301,010.98 m**

#### **Approach Surfaces (Runway 10 and 28)**
- Each is an inclined plane with a **1:50 slope**.
- Rises to a horizontal line:
  - 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end,
  - 2,400 meters from the runway centerline,
  - 300 meters above the elevation at the runway end.
- These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach phases.

#### **Outer Surface**
- A horizontal plane at **45 meters above ARP elevation**.
- **Exception**: If the ground is lower than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This provides a safe buffer zone for all structures and natural features.

#### **Strip (Runway 10–28)**
- **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline)
- **Length**: 3,170 meters
- Located along the runway 10–28 axis.

#### **Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces** to meet the outer surface.
- These surfaces define the transition between the runway zone and the broader airport boundary.

#### **Outer Limits Boundary**
- A **circular area** with a **radius of 4,000 meters** centered on the Airport Reference Point.
- Defines the maximum extent of regulated land.

### **10. Regulatory Objectives and Safety Implications**

The primary purpose of these zoning regulations is to:

- **Prevent visual and physical obstructions** to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- **Minimize risks** from:
  - Tall structures or vegetation
  - Bird activity
  - Uncontrolled waste disposal
- Ensure **safe and predictable flight paths** by maintaining consistent, predictable terrain and structure profiles.

These measures are critical for **aviation safety**, particularly in remote or rural airports like Stephenville, where terrain and environmental factors can increase risk.

---

### **11. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height and land-use restrictions.
- The regulations are enforceable through administrative or legal action if violations occur.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Stephenville Airport Zoning Regulations** constitute a comprehensive and technically precise set of land-use controls designed to protect aviation safety at Stephenville Airport. By defining clear boundaries, elevation limits, and prohibited activities, the regulation ensures that the airport environment remains free from hazards that could endanger aircraft operations.

The integration of precise geographic coordinates, slope ratios, and reference points reflects a rigorous, science-based approach to airport zoning, consistent with international best practices in aviation safety planning.

**Key Takeaway**:  
These regulations are not merely about building restrictions—they represent a **systematic framework** for managing the physical environment around an airport to ensure **safety, predictability, and operational integrity** in aviation.
