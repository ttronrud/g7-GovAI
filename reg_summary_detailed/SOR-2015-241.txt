**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Critical Habitat of the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) Alberta Population Order*

### **Date of Issuance:**  
November 20, 2015  
(Effective upon registration)

---

### **Legal Basis:**
The regulation is issued under **Section 58 of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)***, which is part of the *Species at Risk Act (S.C. 2002, c. 29)*. Specifically:
- **Section 58(1)**: Requires the identification and designation of critical habitat for listed wildlife species.
- **Section 58(2)**: Excludes from critical habitat designations any area that is already protected under federal legislation (e.g., national parks).
- **Section 58(4)**: Empowers the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to make orders designating critical habitat.
- **Section 58(5)**: Requires consultation with the Minister responsible for Parks Canada (i.e., the Minister of the Environment) when designating critical habitat that overlaps with protected areas.

---

### **Species Involved:**
- **Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi)**  
- The **Alberta population** of this species is listed as a **threatened species** under *Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA*.

---

### **Background and Rationale:**

1. **Threatened Status**:  
   The Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Alberta is recognized as a **threatened species** under SARA, meaning it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**:  
   A formal *Recovery Strategy for the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) Alberta Populations in Canada* was developed and officially registered in the **Species at Risk Public Registry on March 28, 2014**.  
   This strategy identified specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of the species — these areas constitute the **critical habitat**.

3. **Overlap with Protected Areas**:  
   A portion of this identified critical habitat lies within **Banff National Park**, which is a federally protected area under the *Canada National Parks Act*.  
   Under **Section 58(2) of SARA**, any critical habitat located within a place that is already protected by federal law (such as a national park) is **automatically excluded** from the formal designation of critical habitat.

4. **Consultation Requirement**:  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was required, under **Section 58(5)**, to **consult with the Minister of the Environment** (who oversees Parks Canada) before issuing the Order. This consultation ensured that the designation process respected existing protections and avoided duplication or conflict.

### **Key Provisions of the Order:**

- **Designation of Critical Habitat**:  
  The Order formally designates the **critical habitat** for the Westslope Cutthroat Trout Alberta population as identified in the recovery strategy.

- **Exclusion of Protected Areas**:  
  The portion of critical habitat located within **Banff National Park** (as defined in *Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Canada National Parks Act*) is **excluded** from the formal designation under Section 58(1) of SARA.  
  This exclusion is legally mandated and ensures that no additional regulatory obligations are imposed on areas already under federal protection.

- **Applicability of Section 58(1)**:  
  The provisions of Section 58(1) of SARA apply **only to the remaining portions** of the critical habitat that are not already protected. These areas are subject to regulatory measures (e.g., development restrictions, environmental assessments) to prevent harm or degradation.

---

### **Purpose and Intent:**

The primary objectives of this Order are:
- To **formally recognize and protect** the essential areas required for the survival and recovery of the Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Alberta.
- To ensure that **existing federal protections** (such as those in Banff National Park) are respected and not duplicated.
- To promote **species recovery** by limiting activities that could degrade or destroy critical habitat.
- To fulfill the legal and procedural requirements of SARA, including public registry, scientific basis, and inter-ministerial consultation.

---

### **Implementation and Enforcement:**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the federal government (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette).
- It is enforceable under SARA, meaning any proposed activity (e.g., construction, mining, land use change) that may affect the designated critical habitat (excluding Banff National Park) must undergo **environmental assessment** and **protection measures** as required by law.
- The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for enforcing the Order and ensuring compliance with SARA’s requirements.

---

### **Significance:**

This Order represents a key step in the **conservation and recovery** of a native, ecologically sensitive fish species. It:
- Provides clear legal boundaries for habitat protection.
- Balances conservation needs with existing land-use protections.
- Demonstrates compliance with both scientific and procedural requirements of SARA.
- Supports broader biodiversity and ecosystem health in Alberta’s mountainous regions.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation formally designates the critical habitat of the Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Alberta population) under the *Species at Risk Act*, **excluding areas already protected within Banff National Park**. It reflects a careful balance between species conservation and the integrity of existing protected areas, ensuring that recovery efforts are both scientifically sound and legally compliant. The Order is a vital tool in safeguarding this threatened species and promoting its long-term survival in Canada.
