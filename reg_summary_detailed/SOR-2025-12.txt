### **Detailed Summary of the China Surtax Remission Order (2024)**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **China Surtax Remission Order (2024)** is issued under **Section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (S.C. 2005, c. 38, para. 145(2)(j)), and is made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This provision allows for the remission (i.e., cancellation or refund) of surtaxes paid or payable under the **China Surtax Order (2024)** in specific circumstances.

The Order is rooted in Canada’s customs and trade regulations, specifically designed to provide relief from surtaxes imposed on certain imported goods from China, with the aim of supporting Canadian industries and managing trade flows.

---

#### **2. Scope of Remission**
Remission of surtax is granted **only for goods listed in Schedule 1 or Schedule 2** of the Order. The remission applies **only if all specified conditions are met**.

---

### **A. Remission Conditions for Goods in Schedule 1**

Goods listed in **Schedule 1** are subject to the following conditions:

1. **No Prior Order or Finding**  
   The good must **not be the subject of any order or finding** under the *Special Import Measures Act* (S.I.M.A.) on the date of importation.  
   → This means the product must not be under administrative or legal scrutiny (e.g., anti-dumping, countervailing duties, or safeguard measures) at the time of entry into Canada.

2. **Import Period**  
   The good must be imported into Canada **between October 22, 2024, and December 31, 2025**, inclusive.

3. **No Prior Surtax Relief Claim**  
   No other claim for relief (e.g., refund or remission) of surtax has been granted under the Customs Tariff for this good.

4. **No Export to the United States**  
   The good must **not be exported to the United States in the same condition** as it was imported into Canada.  
   → This prevents circumvention of the surtax by re-exporting to the U.S. and avoiding Canadian surtax obligations.

5. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   The importer must **submit a formal claim for remission to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (MPSEP)** within **two years of the date of importation**.

> ✅ **Note**: Schedule 1 includes specific types of steel and aluminum products used in oil and gas, drilling, and industrial applications.

---

### **B. Remission Conditions for Goods in Schedule 2**

Schedule 2 provides **more detailed, product-specific criteria**, particularly for goods classified under certain tariff items. Remission is granted only if:

1. **Importer Must Be Listed**  
   The good must be imported by an **importer specifically listed in Column 1** of Schedule 2.

2. **Import Period Must Be Specified**  
   The good must be imported during the **time period specified in Column 4** of Schedule 2.

3. **All Applicable Conditions in Column 5 Must Be Met**  
   Any additional conditions listed in Column 5 (e.g., material specifications, dimensions, coatings, or standards) must be satisfied.

4. **Same Conditions as Schedule 1 Apply**  
   The following conditions also apply to goods in Schedule 2:
   - No prior surtax relief claim
   - No export to the U.S. in the same condition
   - Claim submitted to MPSEP within two years of importation

> ⚠️ **Important Clarification**:  
> If the description in **Column 2** (product specification) covers only a **subset** of goods classified under the tariff item in **Column 1**, remission is granted **only for those goods described in Column 2** — not the entire category.

> 🔍 Example: If a tariff item covers all aluminum coils, but only a subset (e.g., 3005-H24 with 8 µm coating) is listed in Column 2, remission applies only to that subset.
