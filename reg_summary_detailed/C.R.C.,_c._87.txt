**Detailed Summary of the Hay River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Hay River Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and land-use restrictions around Hay River Airport in the Northwest Territories (NWT), primarily to ensure aviation safety by controlling the physical environment surrounding the airport.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to **Hay River Airport**, located in the vicinity of Hay River, NWT.  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographical point used as a reference for measuring distances and elevations. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 530 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes.  
- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (specifically runways 21-03 and 30-12), designed to ensure aircraft can safely approach the runway without obstruction. The surface has a **1:50 vertical-to-horizontal gradient** (1 foot rise per 50 feet of horizontal distance).  
  - For **runways 21 and 03**: The surface rises 200 feet vertically and extends 10,000 feet horizontally; the outer ends are 1,250 feet from the runway centerline.  
  - For **runways 30 and 12**: The surface rises 1,000 feet vertically and extends 50,000 feet horizontally; the outer ends are 8,000 feet from the centerline.  
- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located **150 feet above the airport reference point (530 ft = 680 ft AGL)**. If this plane is below 30 feet above ground level, a **30-foot ground-level surface** is used instead. This surface acts as a boundary beyond which structures or obstructions are not permitted.  
- **Strip**: The designated area of the airport where aircraft take off and land.  
  - **Runway 21-03 strip**: 500 feet wide (250 ft on each side), 5,525 feet long.  
  - **Runway 30-12 strip**: 1,000 feet wide (500 ft on each side), 6,400 feet long.  
- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces**, rising at a **1:7 gradient** (1 foot rise per 7 feet of horizontal distance). It connects the strip edges to the outer surface and prevents obstructions from interfering with aircraft during approach or departure phases.

All these surfaces are illustrated on **Department of Transport Plan No. E.1180**, dated **September 18, 1975**.

### **3. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) that fall within the following areas:

1. **Lands within the defined boundaries** of the airport area as described in **Part II of the Schedule**.  
2. **Lands directly under any portion of an approach surface** that extends beyond the outer limits defined in Part II.

This means that even land just beneath the approach surface (which may extend far beyond the runway itself) is subject to strict height controls.

---

### **4. Prohibited Activities – Building and Structure Restrictions**

**No person may:**
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land covered by these regulations,  
- **If the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

This rule applies to both new constructions and modifications to existing structures. The restriction is designed to prevent obstacles that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

This ensures that natural features do not become hazards to aircraft operations.

---

### **6. Waste and Bird Attraction Prohibitions**

- No owner or occupier may **use or allow any land** subject to these regulations to:
  - Be used for **disposal or accumulation of waste**, or
  - Accumulate **materials or substances that are edible or attractive to birds**.

This is a critical safety measure to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft.

### **7. Boundary Description – The Legal Perimeter of the Regulated Area**

The regulated land area is precisely defined by a **geometric boundary** described in **Part II of the Schedule**, following a detailed survey path:

1. Begins at the **southwesterly boundary of Lot 27, Plan 40266 (CLSR) 38 (L.T.O.)**, where it intersects a **circle of 13,000 feet radius** centered at the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.  
2. Proceeds **clockwise along the circumference** of this circle to intersect the **easterly boundary of Lot 781, Plan 52725 (CLSR) 397 (L.T.O.)**.  
3. Then moves **south** along the easterly boundary of Lot 781 to its southeast corner.  
4. Proceeds **west** along the southerly boundary of Lot 781 and its straight production across **Woodland Drive** to the northeast corner of Lot 782.  
5. Moves **south** along the easterly boundaries of Lots 782 and 785 to the southeast corner of Lot 785.  
6. Proceeds **west** along the southerly boundaries of Lots 785 and 783, crossing **McKenzie Highway** (as shown on Plan 42253), to intersect the easterly boundary of Lot 665.  
7. Moves **south** along the easterly boundary of Lot 665 to its southeasterly corner.  
8. Proceeds **west** along the southerly boundaries of Lots 665, 645, 646, and 1035, and their straight extensions across intervening roads, to the **southwesterly corner of Lot 1035**.  
9. Moves **north** along the westerly boundaries of Lots 1035 and 1036 until intersecting the **original circle**.  
10. Proceeds **west** along the circumference of the circle back to the **northeasterly boundary of Lot 3** of Plan 40266.  
11. Then follows the **sinuous shoreline of Great Slave Lake** (which forms the northeasterly boundaries of Lots 3, 5, 7, 12, and 14) to the **northwesterly boundary of Lot 27**.  
12. Proceeds **southwesterly** along the northwesterly boundary of Lot 27 to its southwesterly corner.  
13. Finally, moves **southeasterly** along the southwesterly boundary of Lot 27 back to the **point of commencement**.

This creates a **large, irregular polygonal zone** surrounding the airport, incorporating both land adjacent to the airport and areas under the approach surfaces.

### **8. Purpose and Regulatory Objectives**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:

- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions (buildings, trees, waste) from interfering with aircraft during approach, takeoff, and landing.
- Maintain **clear visual and physical corridors** for flight paths and approach surfaces.
- Protect the **integrity of airport operations** by controlling land use and natural features within designated zones.
- Provide a **clear, legally enforceable boundary** for land use around the airport, based on precise geographic and elevation criteria.

---

### **9. Enforcement Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Issue **directions** to remove excessive natural growth (e.g., overhanging trees).
  - Enforce compliance with the height restrictions and waste prohibitions.

This gives the government the power to intervene directly when private landowners fail to comply.

---

### **10. Legal and Practical Significance**

- These regulations are **binding and enforceable** under NWT law.
- They represent a **proactive zoning strategy** focused on aviation safety, not just land development.
- The use of **specific elevation and distance criteria** (e.g., 1:50, 1:7 gradients, 150 ft above ARP) reflects international standards for airport safety zones.
- The inclusion of **natural features** (like Great Slave Lake shoreline) shows that environmental and topographic factors are considered in boundary design.

### **Conclusion**

The **Hay River Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, technically precise set of rules designed to protect aviation safety by strictly controlling the height, use, and development of land surrounding Hay River Airport.
