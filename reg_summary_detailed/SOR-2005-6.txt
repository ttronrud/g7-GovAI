### **Detailed Summary of the Quebec Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations (2004)**

The **Quebec Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations**, adopted on **December 21, 2004**, and made under the authority of the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act* (S.C. 2004, c. 10), establish a comprehensive framework for the registration, reporting, and notification of individuals convicted of sexual offenses within the province of Quebec. These regulations implement and operationalize the requirements of the federal Act, ensuring that sex offenders are required to register their information with designated authorities and that law enforcement agencies can access this data to assist in investigations.

---

## **1. Legislative Basis**
- The regulations are issued under **Section 18** of the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*, which empowers the **Lieutenant Governor in Council** (i.e., the provincial government, through the Minister of Public Security) to create regulations specifying:
  - How sex offenders must report and provide notifications;
  - Who is authorized to collect and register information;
  - The locations of registration centres and their service areas.

---

## **2. Key Provisions and Objectives**

### **A. Reporting and Notification Methods**
Sex offenders whose **main residence is in Quebec** may comply with reporting and notification obligations using the following methods:

| Requirement | Method(s) |
|-----------|----------|
| **Registration (Section 4.3)** | Telephone, facsimile (fax), or electronic mail (email) |
| **Notification (Section 6)** | Telephone, fax, email, or in person |

> **Note**: This provides flexibility and accessibility, allowing offenders to comply without needing to visit a physical office, which improves compliance and reduces barriers—especially for those in rural or remote areas.

---

### **B. Authorized Entities to Collect Information**
Only specific individuals or agencies are authorized to collect information for the purposes of the Act. These include:

1. **Members of the Sûreté du Québec** (Quebec’s provincial police force)
2. **Members of municipal police forces**
3. **Members of native police forces** (e.g., Indigenous police services)

> **Additional Authorization**: Any member or employee of the Sûreté du Québec assigned to the **Centre québécois d’enregistrement des délinquants sexuels de la Sûreté du Québec (CQEDS)** in Montreal is explicitly authorized to register information.

> This ensures that only trained, authorized personnel handle sensitive data, maintaining confidentiality and integrity.

---

### **C. Designation of Registration Centres**
The regulations designate a network of **specific locations** across Quebec as **registration centres**, each serving a defined geographic area.

#### Key Features:
- Each centre is listed in a **Schedule** attached to the regulations.
- The **designated area of service** is specified in the second column of the schedule (e.g., city, municipality, regional county municipality, or reserve).
- The **Centre québécois d’enregistrement des délinquants sexuels de la Sûreté du Québec in Montreal** serves the **entire province of Quebec**.

#### Example:
- **Service de police de Montréal (SAC Nord/Sud/Est/Ouest)** serves different parts of Montreal and surrounding areas.
- **Régie intermunicipale de police de la région de Joliette** serves multiple municipalities including Saint-Charles-Borromée, Notre-Dame-des-Prairies, and Saint-Pierre.
- Rural and remote areas (e.g., MRC de Témiscouata, MRC de la Côte-de-Gaspé, and Indigenous reserves) are also covered through dedicated centres.

> This decentralized structure ensures that offenders in all regions of Quebec—urban, suburban, and remote—can access a nearby registration centre, improving accessibility and compliance.

---

### **D. Service Areas (Geographic Coverage)**
The schedule includes detailed geographic coverage, using standardized abbreviations:

| Abbreviation | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|
| V | City |
| P | Parish |
| C | County |
| M | Municipality |
| CT | Township |
| VL | Village |
| MRC | Regional County Municipality |
| VC | Cree village |
| TR | Reserve territory |
| R | Reserve |
| EI | Indian settlement |
| NO | Unorganized |

> These codes allow for precise mapping of jurisdictional boundaries and ensure that each registration centre serves a clearly defined population.

#### Examples:
- **Régie intermunicipale de police de la Rivière-du-Nord** serves **Piedmont (M), Sainte-Anne-des-Lacs (P), Saint-Hippolyte (P)**.
- **MRC de la Côte-de-Gaspé** includes areas like **New Carlisle (MRC)** and **Grande-Vallée**.
- Indigenous communities (e.g., **Gesgapegiag (R)**, **Obedjiwan (R)**, **Mistissini (VC)**, **Waswanipi (TR)**) are explicitly included, recognizing the unique jurisdictional and cultural contexts of First Nations.

> This ensures equitable access to registration services for all communities, including remote and Indigenous populations.

---

## **3. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the official Quebec government Gazette.

> This ensures immediate implementation upon approval, without delay.

---

## **4. Purpose and Policy Rationale**
The regulations are designed to:
- **Enhance public safety** by enabling police services to monitor and respond to potential threats from registered sex offenders.
- **Ensure accountability** through mandatory reporting and notification.
- **Improve access and compliance** by providing multiple communication methods and geographically distributed registration centres.
- **Respect provincial jurisdiction** by operating under Quebec’s own legal framework, even though the Act is federally enacted.

> The policy reflects a balance between **public safety** and **individual rights**, ensuring that registration is practical, accessible, and legally sound.

## **5. Key Implications and Observations**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| **Accessibility** | Multiple reporting methods (phone, email, in person) reduce barriers for offenders, especially those with mobility or technological limitations. |
| **Decentralization** | Registration centres are spread across all regions, including rural and remote areas, promoting equity. |
| **Indigenous Inclusion** | Specific recognition of reserve territories, Cree villages, and Indian settlements ensures that Indigenous communities are not excluded. |
| **Data Security** | Restriction to authorized personnel (police) limits exposure and misuse of sensitive information. |
| **Provincial Oversight** | The regulation is issued by the Quebec government, reflecting provincial responsibility for implementation and enforcement. |

---

## **6. Limitations and Considerations**
- **No provision for online portals or public access** to offender data (this remains a matter of privacy and public safety policy).
- **No penalties for non-compliance** are detailed in these regulations—penalties are likely governed by the original *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*.
- The **federal nature of the Act** means that Quebec’s implementation aligns with national standards but may differ in operational details (e.g., reporting methods, jurisdictional boundaries).

---

## **Conclusion**

The **Quebec Sex Offender Information Registration Regulations (2004)** provide a clear, practical, and equitable system for managing the registration and notification of individuals convicted of sexual offenses within Quebec. By establishing accessible reporting methods, clearly defined registration centres, and authorized collecting bodies, the regulations ensure that public safety is supported while respecting the rights and needs of offenders and communities across the province.

These regulations are a critical component of Quebec’s broader strategy to enhance crime prevention, improve inter-agency coordination, and maintain public trust through transparency and accountability—within the legal and ethical boundaries set by the *Sex Offender Information Registration Act*.
