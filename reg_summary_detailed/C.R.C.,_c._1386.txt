**Detailed Summary of the *Regional Development Incentives Regulations***  
*(Cited as: Regional Development Incentives Regulations)*

---

### **1. General Overview**

These regulations establish the framework under which the **Minister of the Crown** (or relevant authority) can provide **development incentives** to encourage investment in eligible commercial and industrial operations. The regulations are based on the *Regional Development Incentives Act* (Act), and apply to applications for development incentives submitted under specific timeframes and conditions.

The primary goals of the regulations are:
- To promote economic development in designated regions.
- To ensure that development incentives are tied to tangible outcomes such as job creation, capital investment, and regional economic benefit.
- To protect public funds by setting strict conditions on eligibility, use of assets, repayment obligations, and compliance with employment and procurement requirements.

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **(a) "Act"**
Refers to the *Regional Development Incentives Act*, which provides the legal basis for the development incentives.

#### **(b) "Eligible Assets"**
These are assets approved by the Minister that form part of a facility or commercial facility. **Exclusions** include:
- Land
- Automobiles and other transportation vehicles (except material-handling devices used exclusively on-site)
- Assets normally considered income charges upon acquisition (e.g., depreciation, amortization)
- Intangible assets such as patents, franchises, copyrights, and goodwill

Only **physical, tangible, and directly operational** assets qualify.

#### **(c) "Equity"**
Defined as the total of:
- Share capital
- Earned surplus
- Contributed surplus
- Capital surplus
- Shareholder loans  
*All subordinated to all other forms of debt financing used to fund the operation.*

This represents the applicant’s ownership stake and is used to determine minimum equity requirements.

### **3. Definitions of Operations (Exclusions and Inclusions)**

#### **(a) Commercial Operation**
Any commercial undertaking **excluding**:
- Initial processing operations
- Manufacturing or processing operations (as defined below)
- Resource-based industries

> *Purpose*: To ensure that incentives are not given for basic or non-commercial activities.

#### **(b) Initial Processing Operation**
Operations where the output is a fuel or material primarily used in further processing. **Excluded**:
- Roasting, leaching, or smelting mineral concentrates to produce metals
- Sulphite process wood pulping (if prior to Jan 1, 1972 it produced dissolving or high-alpha pulp)
- Converting wood into paperboard or paper (except newsprint)
- Processing involving significant chemical change (except oil refining)

> *Rationale*: These are considered intermediate or raw material stages, not final commercial products.

#### **(c) Manufacturing or Processing Operation**
Any operation that creates, fabricates, refines, or improves marketability of goods. **Excluded**:
- Transporting or merchandising goods
- Growing, catching, or harvesting natural products
- Extracting minerals
- Energy production (unless part of manufacturing)
- Fertilizer or feedstuff mixing
- Concrete/asphalt mixing
- Drying hides, peat, or Irish moss
- Salt or potash extraction
- Mobile operations
- Construction work
- Repairing (distinct from rebuilding)
- Consumer services
- Publishing (except printing)

> *Clarification*: Only activities that create tangible, marketable outputs qualify.

#### **(d) Resource-Based Industry**
An industry using a principal material that:
- Is naturally occurring
- Is in or near its natural state
- Was not created by human design

Examples: mining, forestry, agriculture (in natural form)

> *Rationale*: These industries are often remote or environmentally sensitive; incentives may be restricted or excluded to avoid over-investment in such sectors.

### **4. Application Timeline and Jurisdiction**

The regulations apply to applications received under the following conditions:

| Scenario | Application Period |
|--------|---------------------|
| Before registration under the Statutory Instruments Act or the 1974 Regulations | Any time before registration |
| After the date in paragraph (a) but before April 1, 1974 | If applicant has not opted for the 1974 Regulations |
| On or after April 1, 1974, within two months after the date in paragraph (a) | If applicant opts for these Regulations |

> **Note**: Applicants may **opt in or out** of the regulations in writing during these periods.

---

### **5. Product Eligibility and Innovation Criteria**

A product must be deemed **newly manufactured or processed** only if:
1. On the date of application, it is **significantly different** from any product manufactured in the past 3 years in the same operation.
2. It **could not have been economically produced** without expanding the facility and acquiring additional assets.

> *Purpose*: Prevents incentives from being used to simply repackage existing products or expand into unprofitable ventures.

---

### **6. Approved Capital Costs**

#### **(a) Facility Capital Costs**
Calculated by summing the approved capital costs of all eligible assets in the facility.

#### **(b) Asset Capital Cost**
Determined by:
- The cost to the applicant, **up to fair market value**
- Reasonable direct costs for design, acquisition, construction, transport, installation, and insurance during construction

> *Minister’s discretion*: Can adjust costs if they exceed fair market value or are not reasonably incurred.

#### **(c) Excess Capital Costs**
- If a development incentive has already been authorized, **no additional capital costs** can exceed **115%** of the original forecasted costs.
- Any excess must be **pre-approved** by the Minister before being incurred.

#### **(d) Significant Facility Changes**
- If new assets cause a significant change in the facility:
  - Must be **notified and approved** by the Minister before any commitments are made.
  - Assets must be **acquired and put into use within 24 months** of commercial production.

> *Objective*: Prevents speculative or unapproved expansions that could undermine incentive integrity.

---

### **7. Job Creation Requirements**

#### **(a) Number of Jobs Created**
Calculated as:
> (Total man-days paid in Year 2 and Year 3) ÷ (Number of days the facility operates during those years)  
Adjusted for circumstances the Minister may determine (e.g., seasonal variation, downtime).

#### **(b) Exclusions**
- Employees not involved in the operation receiving the incentive
- Employees in the **original facility configuration** at the time of application (in case of expansion)

#### **(c) Inclusion of Management Employees**
Employees of a third party managing the facility under a management agreement **are included**.

#### **(d) Cap on Job Creation**
- The actual number of jobs created **cannot exceed 15% above** the number specified and approved in the original authorization.

> *Purpose*: Ensures job creation is realistic and verifiable.

---

### **8. Working Capital and Capitalized Expenses**

- **Working capital** = Excess of current assets over current liabilities (excluding loans), as judged by the Minister to be necessary for full production capacity.
- **Capitalized expenses** = Costs that are:
  - Necessarily incurred in bringing the facility into operation
  - Capable of being treated as capital expenditures (not income charges) under normal accounting standards

> *Example*: Installation costs, site preparation, engineering design.

---

### **9. Offer and Acceptance of Incentives**

- Any offer of a development incentive is open for **90 days** from the date of issuance.
- The offer **must specify a start date** for construction or installation of fixed assets.
- If construction **does not begin by that date**, the offer is **automatically withdrawn**.

> *Ensures accountability and timely implementation.*

---

### **10. Minimum Thresholds for Incentive Authorization**

A development incentive **will not be authorized** unless:
- For **capital-cost-based** incentives: Approved capital costs exceed **$30,000**
- For **job-based** incentives: Approved capital costs exceed **$60,000**

> *Thresholds prevent trivial or non-economic investments from receiving incentives.*

---

### **11. Equity Requirement**

The applicant must provide a **minimum equity** of:
- **20% of approved capital costs** (for new facilities)
- **20% of approved capital costs + book value of existing assets** (for expansions/modernizations)

> *Equity must be provided by the day production begins.*

> *Purpose*: Ensures private investment and reduces public risk.

### **12. Conditions Attached to Incentives**

#### **(a) Employment of Local Residents**
Applicant must **train and employ** to the maximum extent practicable individuals **resident in the designated region** at the time of application.

#### **(b) Canadian Manufacturing Opportunities**
Applicant must provide **reasonable opportunities** for Canadian manufacturers to supply machinery/equipment, provided it is competitive in price, performance, and delivery.

> *Promotes domestic supply chains and local industry growth.*

#### **(c) Adjustment for Changes in Assistance**
If the value of assistance (e.g., loan terms) changes after authorization, the development incentive may be **adjusted** to reflect the change.

> *Includes present value differences between market rates and favorable loan/lease terms.*

#### **(d) Insurance Proceeds in Case of Disaster**
If the facility is destroyed by fire, flood, or other force beyond the applicant’s control within:
