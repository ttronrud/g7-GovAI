### **Overview**

The *Export Permits Regulations* are a set of rules established under the *Export and Import Permits Act* (the "Act") by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

They came into force on **April 15, 1997**, and govern the conditions under which Canadian entities may export specific goods and technologies—particularly those subject to national or international controls—while ensuring that such exports align with foreign policy, national security, and international obligations.
