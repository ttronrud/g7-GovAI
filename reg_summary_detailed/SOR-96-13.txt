| **Mineral** | Any naturally occurring, homogeneous constituent of the lithosphere (e.g., metals, rock-forming substances), **but excludes**: <br> - Petroleum, natural gas, or related hydrocarbons <br> - Soil, peat, groundwater, or non-hydrocarbon gases |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Natural Resources of Canada (or any person authorized to act on their behalf). |

> ⚠️ *Note: The exclusion of hydrocarbons is significant — this regulation does not cover oil and gas exploration.*

## 📝 Core Provisions and Regulatory Framework

### 1. **Grant of Leases**
- The Minister may grant a lease to any individual or entity for the **exclusive right** to search for, win, and extract one or more minerals located on Crown-owned land in any province.
- **Lease duration**: Initially **10 years**, renewable under specific conditions.

> ✅ *This replaces the older regulations and provides a modern, standardized framework.*

---

### 2. **Tender Requirement (Competitive Bidding)**
- **By default**, the Minister must **call for tenders** and grant the lease to the person offering the **highest bid**.
- This ensures **fair competition** and **transparent allocation** of mineral rights.

> 🚫 Exception: A lease may be granted **without a tender** if the applicant is the **registered owner of the surface rights** of the land.

---

### 3. **Lease Form and Minimum Rental**
- All leases must follow the **form set out in Schedule I**.
- **Minimum annual rental**: **$1 per acre per year**, payable in advance.
  - First payment due upon execution of the lease.
  - Subsequent payments due on the same date each year.

> 🔍 *This ensures a baseline revenue stream for the Crown, regardless of the mineral value.*

---

### 4. **Geological Limitations and Mineral Grouping**
- A lease may **limit the right to search for and extract minerals** to a specific:
  - Geological zone
  - Volume of rock
  - Area within the province
- If multiple minerals are involved, the lease may restrict rights to those minerals **only when found together** (e.g., gold and silver in the same ore body).

> 💡 This promotes targeted exploration and reduces overreach.

---

### 5. **Flexibility for Special Circumstances**
- The Minister may **deviate from the standard lease form** in rare cases (e.g., unique geology, environmental concerns, or technological needs), **provided**:
  1. The **minimum rental of $1/acre/year is not reduced**.
  2. A **royalty other than the standard one** may be included **only if**:
     - The Minister deems it necessary
     - To implement an agreement under **section 6** (consolidation or joint development)

> 📌 This allows for tailored arrangements without undermining core revenue protections.

---

### 6. **Consolidation and Joint Development Agreements**
- The Minister may enter into **agreements with mineral operators** to:
  - Consolidate their interests
  - Merge or combine operations
  - Promote joint ventures or cooperative development
- Such agreements may be used to:
  - Improve efficiency
  - Reduce environmental impact
  - Facilitate large-scale development

> 🏗️ Examples: Joint ventures between multiple companies; unit operations (shared infrastructure).

---

### 7. **Amendments to Leases**
- With **Minister’s consent**, a lease may be amended to:
  - Reflect changes in operations
  - Adjust operational terms
- **But**:
  - The **minimum rental of $1/acre/year cannot be reduced**.
  - Amendments cannot include new royalty structures unless tied to a section 6 agreement.

> 🔐 Ensures financial stability and prevents erosion of Crown revenue.
