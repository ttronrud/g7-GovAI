### **1. Scope and Applicability**
- **Title**: These Rules may be cited as the *Military Rules of Evidence*.
- **Applicability**: They apply to **all court martial proceedings**, regardless of geographical location.

### **3. General Principles of Evidence**

#### **A. Admissibility of Evidence**
- **General Rule**: The court **shall not admit irrelevant evidence**.
- **Relevant Evidence**: All **relevant evidence must be admitted and considered**.
- **Exceptions**: Evidence may be excluded only if it is irrelevant or prejudicial.

> ⚖️ *Principle*: Evidence must be directly connected to the facts at issue.

---

#### **B. Requirements for Consideration of a Fact**
A fact may only be considered by the court **if evidence has been adduced through one of the following methods**:
1. Oral testimony of a witness in court (Parts III–IV).
2. Production and inspection of documents in court (Parts III–IV).
3. Inspection or viewing of real evidence (Part IV).
4. Admission by the prosecutor of a fact to narrow the issue (for procedural convenience).
5. Judicial confession (under section 37).

> ❌ *Exception*: The court **shall not consider a fact unless evidence has been presented**—no presumptions or assumptions.

---

#### **C. Burden of Persuasion**
- **Default Burden**: The **prosecutor bears the burden** of persuading the court **beyond reasonable doubt** of every essential element of the charge.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If the accused seeks **acquittal on grounds of insanity**, the **accused bears the burden** of proving the required type and degree of insanity.
  - If a material fact (other than insanity) requires the accused to bear the burden under the *Criminal Code* or NDA, that burden applies in court martial proceedings.
  - Where the NDA specifically assigns a burden, it applies.

> ✅ *Burden of Persuasion*:
> - The accused satisfies the burden if they establish the **probable truth or existence** of the fact.
> - The **burden of producing evidence** initially lies with the party having the burden of persuasion.
> - This burden **shifts to the opposing party** when:
>   - The first party presents evidence that reasonable men would consider sufficient to prove the fact; or
>   - The fact is established by a **rebuttable presumption of law** (under section 13).

> 🔁 *Shifting Burden*: Encourages active evidence production and promotes fairness.

---

#### **D. Rebuttable Presumptions of Law (Section 13)**
- Applies when the offence is in issue.
- A presumption arises when a certain fact is proven (e.g., a person was in a place at a time), and another fact is presumed to follow (e.g., they committed an act).
- The presumption **can be rebutted** by evidence showing the fact is unlikely.

> 📌 Example: If a soldier is found at a location during a crime, a rebuttable presumption may arise that he was involved—unless proven otherwise.
