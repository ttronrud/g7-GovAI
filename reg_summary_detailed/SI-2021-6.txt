The regulation you have provided is a formal notice issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, specifically referencing the recognition and acknowledgment of scientific assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under *Section 23(1)* of the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which empowers the Minister of the Environment to acknowledge and adopt scientific assessments made by COSEWIC regarding the status of wildlife species. This provision is part of the legislative framework designed to identify, assess, and protect species at risk in Canada.

**Key Provisions and Content:**

1. **Issuing Authority:**  
   The regulation is made by His Excellency the Administrator of the Government of Canada in Council. This means it is a formal, government-wide decision adopted by the federal Cabinet, reflecting a collective governmental action.

2. **Recommendation by the Minister of the Environment:**  
   The decision to issue the regulation is based on a recommendation from the Minister of the Environment. This ensures that the government’s official actions are aligned with environmental policy and scientific advice.

3. **Acknowledgment of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   Upon the coming into force of this Order, the Government of Canada formally acknowledges receipt of the scientific assessments prepared by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). These assessments evaluate the current status of specific species—including their risk of extinction, population trends, distribution, threats, and ecological requirements.

4. **Species Covered:**  
   The assessments relate to species listed in an annexed schedule to the regulation. This schedule specifies the exact species that have been evaluated by COSEWIC and are the subject of this acknowledgment. The species may include mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants that are considered at risk of extinction.

5. **Purpose of the Acknowledgment:**  
   The formal acknowledgment serves several key purposes:
   - It confirms that the Government of Canada has received and recognized the scientific findings of COSEWIC.
   - It establishes a foundational step in the SARA process, which may lead to the designation of species as "endangered," "threatened," or "special concern" under the Act.
   - It provides a basis for the Minister to determine appropriate conservation measures, including the development of recovery strategies and action plans.

6. **Legal Effect:**  
   While this regulation itself does not immediately classify species as at risk, it is a critical procedural step in the legislative process. It triggers the next phase of SARA implementation—formal designation of species under the Act, which may follow through a subsequent regulatory order or ministerial decision.

7. **Reference to Statutory Source:**  
   The regulation is cited as *S.C. 2002, c. 29*, which refers to the *Species at Risk Act* as amended and in force in 2002. This indicates that the regulation is part of the legal framework established under SARA and is consistent with the Act’s mandate to conserve biodiversity.

**Context and Significance:**

This regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to science-based conservation. By formally recognizing COSEWIC’s assessments, the government ensures that species at risk are identified through rigorous, independent scientific evaluation. This step is essential for protecting biodiversity and fulfilling Canada’s obligations under international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The regulation also underscores the importance of intergovernmental and interagency collaboration—COSEWIC, as a scientific body, provides expertise, while the federal government acts as the policy and regulatory authority.

**In Summary:**  
This regulation is a formal government acknowledgment of COSEWIC’s scientific evaluations of specific wildlife species. It marks a key milestone in the SARA process, enabling the government to proceed with formal risk designations and the implementation of conservation measures. It is a procedural and foundational element in Canada’s national strategy to protect species at risk.

*Note:* The regulation does not itself list or designate species as at risk. That designation typically follows subsequent ministerial decisions based on the COSEWIC assessments. The actual listing and protection measures are governed by further orders under SARA.
