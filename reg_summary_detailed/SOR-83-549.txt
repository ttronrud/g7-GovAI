---

### **2. Name and Citation**

- The regulation is officially titled: **"Pêcheurs Unis du Québec Regulations"**.
- It may be cited as such in legal or administrative contexts.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

#### **Minister**
- Refers to the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** of the Canadian government.

#### **Pêcheurs Unis du Québec (PUQ)**
- A **cooperative incorporated under the laws of the Province of Quebec**.
- Must have its **business office located in Montreal, Quebec**.
- Represents a group of fishermen and is central to the regulation’s target.

#### **Private Lender**
- Any individual or entity that:
  - Is **approved by the Minister**;
  - Is **not** one of the following:
    - The **Government of Canada**;
    - The **government of any province**;
    - An **agency of any government** (including federal, provincial, or territorial agencies) or any company effectively controlled by such a government or its agencies;
    - A **municipal corporation** (e.g., city or town councils).

> This definition excludes public sector entities and ensures that only private, non-governmental lenders can apply for insurance under the program.

---

### **4. Scope of Insurance Coverage**

Under the regulation, the Minister may provide **insurance for loans made to PUQ**, but only if the loan serves two specific objectives:

1. **Promoting the growth, efficiency, or international competitiveness of PUQ**;  
2. **Fostering the expansion of Canadian trade through PUQ**.

> The insurance is not a general loan guarantee but is tied directly to the economic goals of supporting the cooperative and enhancing Canadian trade.

---

### **5. Maximum Insurance Amount**

- The total amount of insurance provided by the Minister **shall not exceed $5.0 million**.
- This cap applies to the aggregate value of all insured loans under the program.

> The $5 million limit is a financial ceiling set by Parliament through appropriation acts and is strictly enforced.

---

### **6. Approval Process and Conditions**

#### **Application Requirement**
- A **private lender** wishing to have a loan to PUQ insured must:
  - Submit a formal **application to the Minister**;
  - Provide **all information and documentation** that the Minister may reasonably require to assess the application.

> This ensures transparency, due diligence, and accountability in the lending and insurance process.

#### **Ministerial and Treasury Board Approval**
- The Minister has discretion to approve the insurance.
- Any decision must be **approved by the Treasury Board**, which ensures fiscal responsibility and alignment with government budgetary policies.

---

### **7. Insurance Payment Terms**

- When a private lender demands repayment of a loan **for which insurance has been provided**, the amount payable by the Minister to the lender **shall not exceed the amount of insurance in effect on the date of the demand**.

> This means:
> - The insurance only covers the **original amount of the loan** as it existed at the time of repayment demand.
> - There is **no interest or profit component** included in the insurance payout.
> - The payout is **limited to the insured principal amount** at the time of repayment request.

> This protects the government from overpayment and ensures that insurance is used as a risk mitigation tool, not a subsidy.

### **8. Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Targeted Support** | The program supports only loans that directly benefit PUQ’s operations and Canadian trade. |
| **Private Sector Involvement** | Encourages private capital to fund cooperative enterprises, while shielding lenders from default risk. |
| **Fiscal Responsibility** | Strict limits ($5 million) and Treasury Board oversight ensure the program remains within government budget constraints. |
| **Exclusion of Public Entities** | Prevents government entities from receiving insurance, avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring private sector participation. |
| **Risk-Based Insurance** | Insurance is not a guarantee of repayment but a limited financial safety net tied to the date of demand. |

---

### **9. Legal and Policy Context**

- These regulations reflect a **policy of economic development** aimed at strengthening Canadian cooperatives and supporting small-to-medium enterprises in key sectors (here, fishing).
- The fishing industry, particularly in Quebec, has historically faced financial volatility due to market fluctuations and environmental factors.
- By enabling private lenders to offer loans to PUQ with government-backed insurance, the regulation helps **improve access to capital** for cooperatives while reducing the risk of financial loss for private investors.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Pêcheurs Unis du Québec Regulations* establish a **targeted, limited insurance program** designed to:

- Facilitate private financing for a key cooperative in Quebec;
- Support the economic development and competitiveness of PUQ;
- Promote Canadian trade;
- Maintain fiscal discipline through strict caps and oversight.

It is a **narrowly focused policy instrument** that balances public support with private sector participation, ensuring that financial risk is shared appropriately and that taxpayer funds are used efficiently and transparently.

**Note**: These regulations are no longer in force as of 2023, having been superseded by modern financial regulatory frameworks and changes in federal support for cooperatives. However, they remain historically significant as an early example of targeted government insurance for private-sector cooperatives in Canada.
