### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Citation**: The repeal is specified in **SOR/2008-116, section 12**.

  - Legal entities, individuals, or government bodies must now refer to current, active regulations that have replaced or superseded it (if applicable), or to other relevant statutes.

- **Contextual Note**:
  - The repeated entries (nine times) suggest a possible formatting or data entry error, likely intended to emphasize the repealing action. However, in legal databases, such repetition is not standard and does not add substantive content. It may reflect a technical glitch or duplication in a digital record.
