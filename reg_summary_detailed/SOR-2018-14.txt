### **1. Regulatory Authority and Background**

This regulation, known as the *Quebec Sheep Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* (SOR/92-91), was issued by **Les Éleveurs d’ovins du Québec** (the Sheep Producers of Quebec), formerly known as the *Office des producteurs d’agneaux et de moutons du Québec* (Office of Sheep and Goat Producers of Quebec). It operates under the authority granted by **Sections 3 and 4 of the Quebec Sheep and Wool Order**.

The primary purpose of this Order is to establish and enforce a framework for **marketing levies** that producers must pay when their sheep are sold in **interprovincial (within Quebec)** and **international (export) trade**. These levies support the development, stability, and sustainability of the sheep and wool industry in Quebec.

  A person who:
  - Raises or produces sheep on their own behalf or on behalf of another person, or
