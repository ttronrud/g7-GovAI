**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Diplomatic, Consular and International Organizations’ Property Grants Order**

---

### **1. Purpose and Background**
This regulation, known as the **Diplomatic, Consular and International Organizations’ Property Grants Order**, was issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board. It was enacted under **Department of External Affairs Vote 10a of Appropriation Act No. 3, 1978–79**, and serves to **revoke three outdated Orders in Council**:

- P.C. 1956–1646 (November 1, 1956)  
- P.C. 1959–804 (June 25, 1959)  
- P.C. 1976–2233 (September 14, 1976)  

These prior orders had established mechanisms for granting tax relief to municipalities and provinces for real estate taxes, local improvement costs, and development/redevelopment taxes on property owned by diplomatic, consular, and international organizations. This new Order replaces them with a modern, clear, and consistent framework.

> **Note**: The regulation is **not published in the Canada Gazette Part II**, which means it is not officially accessible in the public record through the standard federal gazette system. However, it is referenced in the context of SI/76-106 (Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 110, No. 19, October 13, 1976), which confirms its legal status.

**The Diplomatic, Consular and International Organizations’ Property Grants Order**

### **3. Key Definitions**

#### a) *Diplomatic Property*  
Refers to real property in Canada that is owned by:
- A **foreign government** or the **head of its diplomatic mission**, and is used for:
  - The **chancery or offices** of the diplomatic mission, or  
  - The **official residence** of the head of the mission  
- A **foreign government** and is used for:
  - The **chancery or offices** of a consular post or trade commission, or  
  - The **official residence** of the head of such a post or commission  
- An **international organization** and is used for:
  - The **chancery or offices**, or  
  - The **official residence of the head of a mission** of that organization  

> This definition ensures that only property directly related to diplomatic, consular, or international missions is eligible for grants.

#### b) *International Organization*  
Means an organization recognized under the **Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act**.  
This includes entities such as the United Nations, World Bank, or other multilateral organizations with formal recognition and treaty-based status in Canada.

### **4. Grant Provisions**

#### a) **Grants to Municipalities (Section 3)**  
On receipt of a **formal application** from a municipality (in a form prescribed by the Minister of Finance), the Secretary of State for External Affairs may provide grants to the municipality in respect of diplomatic property, including:

1. **Grants in lieu of real estate taxes and local improvement costs**  
   - Amount equal to what would have been paid under the **Municipal Grants Act** if the diplomatic property were considered **federal property** as defined in that Act.  
   - This ensures municipalities receive compensation equivalent to what they would receive if the property were owned by the federal government.

2. **Grants in lieu of development or redevelopment taxes**  
   - Amount and type equivalent to what would be payable under the **Development Tax and Redevelopment Tax Grant Regulations**, *if those regulations applied* to the diplomatic property.  
   - This provides financial relief for development-related charges that might otherwise fall on the municipality.

> **Key Point**: These grants are not automatic; they require a formal application and are based on a principle of parity—municipalities are compensated as if the property were federal.

#### b) **Grants to Provinces (Section 4)**  
On receipt of a formal application from a **province** (in a form prescribed by the Minister of Finance), the Secretary of State may provide:

- A **grant in lieu of real estate taxes**  
  - Amount equivalent to what would be paid under the **Real Property Grants Regulations**, if the diplomatic property were considered **federal property** under those regulations.

> **Note**: Provinces receive only real estate tax relief, not development or redevelopment tax relief.

---

### **5. Payment in Annual Installments (Section 5)**

If:
- Real estate taxes, local improvement costs, or development/redevelopment taxes are payable over **more than one year**, and  
- The taxpayer (municipality or province) has the **option to pay in annual instalments** with interest at a rate prescribed by the municipality or province,  

Then the Secretary of State may:
- Pay the grants **in annual instalments**  
- Include **interest** at the same rate prescribed by the municipality or province  

> This provision ensures that financial obligations are manageable and aligns with existing tax payment practices, providing flexibility and fairness in the timing of payments.

### **6. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Revocation of Old Orders** | Removes outdated, potentially inconsistent rules and brings policy alignment with current fiscal and diplomatic practices. |
| **Tax Relief for Municipalities and Provinces** | Provides direct financial support to local governments, preventing them from bearing the full cost of hosting diplomatic missions. |
| **Parity Principle** | Grants are based on what would be paid if the property were federal, ensuring fairness and consistency. |
| **Application-Based Process** | Requires formal applications, ensuring accountability and transparency. |
| **No Development Tax Relief for Provinces** | Provinces receive only real estate tax relief, reflecting differences in provincial and municipal fiscal structures. |
| **Interest on Installments** | Makes the payment structure more practical and equitable for long-term obligations. |

### **7. Legal and Policy Context**

- The regulation operates within the framework of **federal responsibility** for diplomatic and international missions, recognizing their unique status under international law and the **Privileges and Immunities Act**.
- It reflects Canada’s commitment to maintaining good diplomatic relations while ensuring that host communities (municipalities and provinces) are not unduly burdened by property taxes.
- The involvement of the **Minister of Finance** and **Treasury Board** underscores the fiscal accountability and budgetary oversight of such grants.

### **8. Limitations and Exclusions**

- The Order **does not apply** to property used for non-diplomatic or non-mission purposes.
- Grants are **not automatic** and require a formal application process.
- Only **real property** is covered; personal property or intangible assets are excluded.

### **Conclusion**

The **Diplomatic, Consular and International Organizations’ Property Grants Order** establishes a clear, equitable, and administratively sound mechanism for compensating municipalities and provinces when diplomatic, consular, or international organizations use real property in Canada. By replacing outdated provisions with a modern, application-based system grounded in fiscal parity and international obligations, the regulation supports diplomatic stability, promotes fair fiscal distribution, and ensures that local governments are not unfairly burdened by hosting foreign missions.

It is a key instrument in balancing **international diplomacy** with **domestic fiscal responsibility** in Canada.
