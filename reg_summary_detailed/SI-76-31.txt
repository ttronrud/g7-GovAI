**Detailed Summary of the Rail Rate Freeze Compensatory Payments Order**

---

### **Overview**

The **Rail Rate Freeze Compensatory Payments Order** is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Transport Vote 50a** and the **Appropriation Act No. 4, 1975**. This Order establishes the terms and conditions for compensatory payments to certain transportation companies that suffered financial losses due to the **rail rate freeze** implemented in 1973.

The Order is formally titled the **Rail Rate Freeze Compensatory Payments Order** and is designed to provide financial relief to **for-hire highway transportation companies**, **non-federally regulated railway companies**, and **water transportation companies** whose tariffs were directly or indirectly linked to those of federally regulated railways.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Commission**: Refers to the **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)**, the regulatory body responsible for administering the claims process and making determinations on compensation.
  
- **Claim**: A formal request for compensation filed with the Commission under subsection 3(1), based on actual revenue losses resulting from the rail rate freeze.

- **Company**: Includes:
  - For-hire highway transportation companies; or
  - Non-federally regulated railway companies or water transportation companies whose tariffs are **differentially related** to the tariffs of federally regulated railways (e.g., those that adjust based on rail rates).

- **Revenue Foregone**: Defined as the **actual revenues lost** by a company on goods transported, directly as a result of the rail rate freeze. This is not speculative loss but must be tied to real traffic movements.

---

### **Eligibility and Filing Deadlines**

Companies may file claims for compensation within specific timeframes after the Order's publication in the *Canada Gazette*:

- **For the 1973 calendar year**: Claims must be filed **within 30 days** of publication.
- **For the 1974 calendar year**: Claims must be filed **within 90 days** of publication.

> These deadlines are critical and create a strict timeline for claim submission, emphasizing the need for prompt action and documentation.

### **Required Information in Each Claim**

Each claim must include detailed, itemized information for **each movement of goods**, including:

1. **Date of shipment**  
2. **Name and address of shipper and consignee**  
3. **Origin and destination of goods**  
4. **Description of goods**  
5. **Tolls, rates, charges, or allowances** listed on the freight bill  
6. **Total freight charge or revenue**  
7. **Amount claimed for compensation**  
8. **Carrier’s tariff items** for the movement and corresponding tariff items from federally regulated railways that were subject to the rate freeze  
9. **Statement of percentage or specific increases** in highway transport rates that **would have been applied** had the rail rate freeze not occurred, along with the **dates** such increases would have been implemented  
10. **Statement of percentage or specific increases** in highway transport rates and their **effective dates** for the **1971 and 1972 calendar years** (to establish baseline rates and compare with post-freeze conditions)

> This comprehensive data requirement ensures that claims are grounded in verifiable, specific transport data and allows the Commission to assess the impact of the rail rate freeze accurately.

### **Company Obligations**

1. **Record Availability**:  
   Every company must provide a **written undertaking** stating that its records will be made available for inspection by the Commission at a time and place convenient to the company. This ensures transparency and enables audit verification.

2. **Declaration on Manufacturer-Integrated Movements**:  
   Each company must include a **declaration in the form set out in Section 38 of the Canada Evidence Act** stating that **no compensation is being claimed** for movements involving **manufacturer’s goods** where the company is **directly integrated** with the manufacturer or owner of those goods.  
   → This exclusion prevents double compensation and avoids overlapping claims between transport and manufacturing entities.

### **Information Gaps and Estimation Provisions**

If a company cannot provide full information within the required deadlines:

- It may submit **partial data** for the **first full week of each of the following months** in the relevant year (February, May, August, November) for **1973 or 1974**.
- This allows the Commission to **estimate** the total revenue loss and begin processing claims even when full data is not available.
- The Commission may then **require additional data** from the company for other weeks or months if necessary to refine the estimate.

> This provision provides flexibility during data collection challenges but does not waive the obligation to eventually submit complete records.

---

### **Advance Payments and Security Requirements**

Upon receiving a claim and supporting information, the Commission may:

- **Recommend** to the Minister that **advance payments** be made to the company, **not exceeding 20%** of the total amount claimed.
- These payments are **subject to audit** by the Commission.
- The company must **post a security bond** payable to Her Majesty in an amount equal to the advance payments.

> This mechanism provides interim financial relief while ensuring accountability and preventing overpayment.

---

### **Final Determination and Payment**

- The Commission will **review all claims and information** and determine the **total amount of compensation** each company is entitled to receive.
- Based on this determination, the Commission will **recommend to the Minister** that payment be made accordingly.
- The Minister may then **approve and disburse** the recommended amounts.

> The Commission retains authority to **adjust** the final amount at any time, and any **excess payments** made beyond the adjusted amount must be **repaid to Her Majesty immediately**.

---

### **Proportional and Cap-Based Payment Rules**

To ensure fairness and prevent disproportionate or excessive payouts:

1. **Proportional Distribution**:  
   The Commission calculates each company’s share of compensation as a **percentage of the total audited claims** across all companies. This percentage determines the amount paid to that individual company.

2. **Maximum Payment Cap**:  
   - The total compensation to **all for-hire highway transportation companies** shall not exceed **$10,000,000**.  
   - The total compensation to **all non-federally regulated railway companies and water transportation companies** whose tariffs are differentially related to federally regulated railways shall not exceed **$3,000,000**.

> These caps are critical to controlling overall government expenditure and ensuring that the financial burden is shared across sectors, not concentrated in one.

---

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The Rail Rate Freeze Compensatory Payments Order was enacted to:

- **Offset financial losses** suffered by non-federally regulated transportation companies when **railway rates were frozen** in 1973, which disrupted pricing mechanisms in the transport sector.
- **Maintain competitiveness** in the transportation industry by preventing companies from being at a disadvantage due to rigid rail pricing.
- **Provide a structured, transparent, and accountable process** for compensation claims, ensuring that only legitimate revenue losses are compensated.

The Order reflects a balance between **fair compensation** and **fiscal responsibility**, recognizing that while transport companies faced real economic harm, public funds must be used judiciously and in accordance with defined limits.
