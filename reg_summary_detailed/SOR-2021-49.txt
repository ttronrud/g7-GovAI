**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (People’s Republic of China) Regulations**

---

### **1. Background and Purpose**

The *Special Economic Measures (People’s Republic of China) Regulations* were enacted by the Government of Canada under the authority of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**. These regulations are a direct response to the Canadian government's assessment that **gross and systematic human rights violations** have occurred in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

The primary objective of these measures is to **apply targeted economic sanctions** against individuals and entities linked to these human rights abuses, in order to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on the PRC government and to hold accountable those responsible for serious violations.

This action was taken by the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to specific provisions in SEMA:

- Subsection 4(1)a – Prohibiting dealings with individuals involved in gross and systematic human rights violations
- Subsection 4(1.1)b – Targeting senior officials and associated persons
- Subsection 4(2) – Prohibiting transactions involving listed persons
- Subsection 4(3) – Providing for exceptions and exemptions

The regulations came into force upon registration and apply immediately upon publication in the *Canada Gazette*, as required by the **Statutory Instruments Act (paragraph 11(2)(a))**.

### **3. Who Is Considered a "Listed Person"?**

A person is designated as a **listed person** if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

1. **Person involved in gross and systematic human rights violations** in the PRC;
2. **Current or former senior official** of the Government of the PRC;
3. **Associate or family member** of someone who meets either (1) or (2);
4. **Entity** owned, held, or controlled (directly or indirectly) by a person meeting (1), (2), or (3), or acting on behalf of or at the direction of such a person;
5. **Senior official** of an entity listed under (4).

> *Note:* The term "gross and systematic human rights violations" implies widespread, institutionalized abuses—such as torture, arbitrary detention, suppression of dissent, or violations of freedom of expression—rather than isolated incidents.

### **4. Prohibited Activities (Section 3)**

Any individual or Canadian entity (within or outside Canada) is **prohibited from**:

- **Dealing in property** (anywhere in the world) that is owned, held, or controlled by a listed person or by someone acting on their behalf;
- **Entering into or facilitating transactions** related to such property dealings;
- **Providing financial or related services** (e.g., banking, payment processing) in connection with such dealings;
- **Making available goods** (anywhere in the world) to a listed person or someone acting on their behalf;
- **Providing financial or related services** to or for the benefit of a listed person.

These prohibitions apply universally—both to individuals and businesses operating in Canada or abroad.

### **5. Exceptions and Exemptions (Section 3 – Exceptions)**

Despite the broad prohibitions, several critical exceptions are explicitly provided to prevent undue harm to legitimate economic activity or essential services:

| Exception | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-existing contractual obligations** | Payments due under contracts entered into *before* a person became listed, provided they are not made to a listed person or their representative. |
| **Transfers of accounts/funds** | Canadian citizens may transfer funds held by a listed person *on the day they became listed* to a non-listed person. |
| **Loan repayments and enforcement** | Transactions related to loans made *before* listing, including repayments, enforcement of security, and guarantees by guarantors—especially if those loans were made to Canadians. |
| **Social security and retirement benefits** | Payments under the following programs are exempt: <br> - Old Age Security Act <br> - Canada Pension Plan (CPP) <br> - Québec Pension Plan (QPP) <br> - Superannuation, pensions, or retirement savings plans <br> - Disability benefits <br> - Garnishment or pension diversion payments |
| **Legal services** | Financial services required for a listed person to obtain legal representation in Canada regarding these sanctions. |
| **Diplomatic missions** | Transactions required for a diplomatic mission to fulfill its functions under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations** (e.g., maintaining premises, conducting official duties). Applies even if the mission is recalled. |
| **International organizations** | Transactions with entities such as the United Nations, International Red Cross, or any entity with a grant or contribution agreement with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. |
| **Canada–PRC agreements** | Any transaction permitted under formal agreements between Canada and the PRC. |

> These exceptions ensure that the sanctions do not disrupt essential services, international diplomacy, or legitimate financial obligations.

### **6. Ongoing Compliance Obligations (Section 6)**

Certain financial institutions and entities must **continuously monitor** their operations for property owned, held, or controlled by listed persons. This includes:

- **Authorized foreign banks** (under the *Bank Act*)
- **Cooperative credit societies, savings and credit unions, caisses populaires** (regulated by provincial laws)
- **Foreign companies** (under the *Insurance Companies Act*) engaged in insurance business in Canada
- **Companies, provincial companies, societies** (under the *Insurance Companies Act*)

- **Entities engaging in securities business** involving client account opening
- **Provincial entities** authorized to provide investment or portfolio management services

> These entities must conduct **ongoing due diligence** to detect any property linked to listed persons.

### **7. Disclosure Requirements (Section 7)**

Every person or entity listed in Section 6 must **disclose without delay** to either:

- The **Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, or  
- The **Director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)**

the following:

1. The **existence of property** in their possession or control that they believe is owned, held, or controlled by a listed person;
2. **Any information about a transaction or proposed transaction** involving such property.

> This requirement ensures transparency and enables Canadian authorities to act promptly in preventing illicit financial flows.

---

### **8. Immunity from Legal Action (Section 7 – Good Faith Disclosure)**

No legal proceedings (under SEMA or in civil courts) may be brought against a person who makes a **good-faith disclosure** under Section 7. This protects individuals and organizations from liability for reporting suspected violations.

---

### **9. Review and Removal Process (Section 8)**

A listed person may apply in writing to the Minister of Foreign Affairs to have their name **removed from the schedule**.

- The Minister must assess whether there are **reasonable grounds** to recommend removal to the Governor in Council.
- If there has been a **material change in circumstances** since the last application, a new application may be submitted.
- The process is designed to allow for periodic review and accountability, though removal is not automatic.

---

### **10. Name Dispute Resolution (Section 9)**

If a person whose name is **similar or identical** to a listed person claims they are not that individual, they may apply to the Minister for a **certificate confirming they are not the listed person**.

- The Minister must respond within **30 days**:
  - If it is established that the applicant is not the listed person → issue a certificate.
  - If not established → provide notice of determination.

> This helps prevent identity confusion and protects individuals with similar names from unjust designation.
