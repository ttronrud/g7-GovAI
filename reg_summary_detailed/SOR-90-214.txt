### **5. Interpretation and Legal Principles**

- **Periods**:
  - Unless otherwise stated, periods begin at **00:01 h** on the first day and end at **24:00 h** on the last day.
  - If the end date falls in a month earlier than the start month, the period **spans two calendar years** (e.g., from December 2009 to January 2010).
