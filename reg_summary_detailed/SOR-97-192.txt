This regulation establishes a **prohibition on non-Canadians holding broadcasting licences** in Canada.

> **Repealed By**: SOR/96-192 (a later amendment that repealed the original direction, though the core policy remains in effect through subsequent regulations)

## 🔧 Key Provisions and Definitions

### 1. **Core Prohibition**
> **No broadcasting licence may be issued, amended, or renewed to a non-Canadian.**

This means:
- Any individual or entity that is **not a Canadian** (as defined below) is **ineligible** to apply for, receive, or retain a broadcasting licence.
- This applies to all types of broadcasting licences, including those for **broadcasting distribution undertakings** (e.g., cable, satellite, terrestrial distribution).

---

### 2. **Definition of "Non-Canadian"**
A **non-Canadian** is:
- Any person or entity that is **not a Canadian**, as defined in the regulation.

> This is the foundational criterion for ineligibility.

---

### 3. **Definition of "Canadian" (Expanded Scope)**
A **Canadian** is defined broadly to include:

| Category | Key Criteria |
|--------|-------------|
| **Citizens & Permanent Residents** | A citizen of Canada (by Citizenship Act) who is ordinarily resident in Canada; or a permanent resident (by Immigration Act) who has been resident in Canada for ≤1 year after becoming eligible for citizenship. |
| **Government Entities** | Federal, provincial, or local governments, or their agencies. |
| **Corporations (with specific conditions)** | Includes corporations where: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Majority of directors are appointed by government (federal/provincial statute, Governor in Council, or minister); |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Or are "qualified" under specific criteria (see below). |

#### Subcategories of "Qualified" Entities:
These are **exceptions** to the non-Canadian rule — they are allowed to hold broadcasting licences **if they meet strict ownership and governance standards**.

| Entity Type | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Qualified Corporation** | - Incorp. under Canadian or provincial law<br>- ≥80% of directors are Canadians<br>- In share-capital corporations: Canadians own ≥80% of voting shares and votes<br>- In subsidiaries: parent corp. must have ≥66⅔% Canadian ownership and voting control, and must not influence programming decisions |
| **Qualified Successor** | A corporation directly controlled by a Canadian carrier (as defined in Telecommunications Act) or its acquiring corporation, with: |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;• Unchanged control since the direction came into force<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• All directors and CEO are Canadians<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• All voting shares not owned by the Canadian carrier or its acquiring corporation are owned by Canadians<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Operates only within the operating territory of the Canadian carrier<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Does not own shares in any foreign broadcasting distribution licensee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Directors have full control over programming<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• ≥33⅓% of directors are **independent members**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• At least one independent member must be present at any board meeting (quorum requirement)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• No parent or affiliate corporation influences programming decisions |

| **Qualified Cooperative** | ≥80% of members are Canadians; established under federal or provincial cooperative legislation |
| **Qualified Mutual Insurance Company** | Head office in Canada; ≥80% of directors and committees are Canadians |
| **Qualified Pension Fund Society** | ≥80% of directors and committees are Canadians; established under specific federal or provincial pension fund laws |

> These "qualified" entities are **exempt from the non-Canadian ineligibility rule**, provided they meet all the criteria.

---

### 4. **Definition of "Control"**
Control is defined as **any actual or de facto influence** over a corporation — not just legal ownership.

This includes:
- Ownership of securities
- Trusts, agreements, or arrangements
- Influence through contracts or business relationships

> **Key Implication**: Even if a non-Canadian does not own voting shares, if they exert **control through financial, contractual, or operational means**, the entity is deemed a **non-Canadian** and thus ineligible.

---

### 5. **Definition of "Independent Member"**
An independent member is:
- Not an officer, employee, or contractor of the qualified successor or its affiliates
- Not a director of any affiliate corporation
- Free from conflicts of interest
- Capable of acting in the best interests of the corporation

> This ensures **board independence** and **accountability**, especially in programming decisions.

---

### 6. **Definition of Key Terms**
| Term | Explanation |
|------|------------|
| **Acquiring Corporation** | As defined in the *Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations* (SOR/94-667), as of October 25, 1994 |
| **Affiliate Corporation** | Includes Canadian carriers, acquiring corporations, or any entity that controls them |
| **Subsidiary Corporation** | A corporation controlled by another corporation |
| **Voting Share** | Includes shares with voting rights, convertible shares, or options/rights to acquire shares at the time of valuation |

## ⚖️ Key Policy Principles

1. **National Ownership and Control**  
   The regulation ensures that **broadcasting services remain under Canadian ownership and control**, safeguarding national interests and cultural diversity.

2. **Prevention of Foreign Influence**  
   Prevents non-Canadians from exerting control over media content, which could lead to foreign bias, commercial interests, or political interference.

3. **Clear Thresholds for Exceptions**  
   Only **specific, well-defined entities** (e.g., qualified corporations, successors) are allowed to operate, ensuring that the exception is **narrow and transparent**.

4. **Board Accountability and Independence**  
   Requires a **minimum of 33⅓% independent directors** and a **quorum requirement** to ensure that programming decisions are made independently and in the public interest.

5. **Prohibition of Indirect Control**  
   Even indirect control (e.g., through trusts or agreements) can result in ineligibility — meaning **no loopholes** exist based on mere financial ties.

## 🚫 What This Means in Practice

| Scenario | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| A foreign-owned company applies for a TV or radio licence | ❌ **Rejected** – non-Canadian applicant |
| A Canadian-owned company with 80% Canadian directors and shareholders | ✅ **Eligible** – qualifies as a "qualified corporation" |
| A foreign-owned company that owns 30% of a Canadian broadcaster | ❌ **Deemed non-Canadian** – due to control via ownership or agreements |
| A Canadian carrier’s subsidiary operating only in its territory | ✅ **Eligible** – if it meets qualified successor criteria |
| A company with 70% Canadian ownership and 30% foreign ownership | ❌ **Ineligible** – fails the 80% threshold for qualified corporations |

## 📚 Legal Basis and Process

- **Authority**: Section 26(1) of the *Broadcasting Act* allows the Governor in Council to issue directions to the CRTC.
- **Consultation**: Section 26(4) requires consultation with the CRTC before issuing such directions.
- **Implementation**: The CRTC is **directed to enforce** the rule — no licence may be issued or renewed to a non-Canadian.
- **Deemed Control**: If the CRTC determines that an applicant is **controlled by a non-Canadian** (via personal, financial, contractual, or business relationships), the applicant is **automatically deemed a non-Canadian**.

---

## 🔁 Amendments and Repeal

- The original direction was published in **S.C. 1991, c. 11**.
- It was **repealed** by **SOR/96-192** (a later statutory instrument), which may suggest a **reform or replacement** of the policy.
- However, **the core principle remains in effect** — Canada continues to maintain strict ownership rules for broadcasting licences, and similar provisions are found in current CRTC policies and regulations (e.g., under the *Broadcasting Act* and *Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations*).

> **Note**: While formally repealed, the spirit and intent of the regulation are **preserved** in modern broadcasting policy and CRTC
