### **Overview**

The *International Criminal Court Privileges and Immunities Order* is a statutory instrument enacted in Canada under the authority of the **Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act (FMIOA)**. It grants legal recognition and specific privileges and immunities to the **International Criminal Court (ICC)** and certain individuals associated with it, as well as to representatives of foreign states participating in the ICC’s governing body, the **Assembly of States Parties**.

This Order was made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendations of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** and the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific provisions of the FMIOA:

- Subsection **5(1)a**: Authority to make orders relating to international organizations.
- Subsection **5(2)b**: Authority to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations.

The Order is referenced in several legislative sources:
- **S.C. 2002, c.12, s.3** (Statutory authority)
- **S.C. 1995, c.5, par. 25(1)(n)** (Reference to privileges and immunities for international bodies)
- **S.C. 1991, c.41** (Original FMIOA)

### **Key Definitions**

The Order begins with a set of clear definitions to ensure precise interpretation:

1. **Agreement**  
   → Refers to the *Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court*, adopted under the Rome Statute by the Assembly of States Parties.  
   → This agreement establishes the specific privileges and immunities granted to the ICC and its personnel.

2. **Assembly**  
   → The **Assembly of States Parties** established under Article 112 of the Rome Statute.  
   → It is the governing body of the ICC, responsible for overseeing the Court’s operations and making decisions on matters such as budget, appointments, and procedural rules.

3. **Convention**  
   → The *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations*, as set out in **Schedule III** of the FMIOA.  
   → This is a foundational international treaty that provides a legal framework for the privileges and immunities of UN bodies and their representatives. The ICC Order draws upon this convention as a model for its own provisions.

4. **International Criminal Court (ICC)**  
   → The international judicial body established by the **Rome Statute**, tasked with prosecuting individuals for serious international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression.

5. **Rome Statute**  
   → The treaty that established the ICC. Its meaning is defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act* (Canada), which confirms that the Rome Statute is the foundational legal instrument for the ICC.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Legal Capacity of the ICC in Canada**
> *"The International Criminal Court shall have in Canada the legal capacities of a body corporate and, to the extent specified in the Agreement, the privileges and immunities set out in Articles II and III of the Convention."*

- The ICC is recognized in Canada as a **body corporate**, meaning it has the legal status of a法人 (legal person), allowing it to:
  - Enter into contracts,
  - Own property,
  - Sue or be sued,
  - Hold assets,
  - Maintain legal standing in Canadian courts.
- It is granted **privileges and immunities** under **Articles II and III of the UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities** (the "Convention"), to the extent specified in the **Agreement on the ICC’s Privileges and Immunities**.
- These privileges include:
  - Immunity from arrest or prosecution (in certain circumstances),
  - Protection of communications and documents,
  - Freedom from interference with its operations,
  - Exemption from taxation and customs duties.

> **Note**: These rights are not absolute and are limited to those explicitly set out in the Agreement and the Convention, and only to the extent they are applicable to the ICC.

#### **2. Privileges and Immunities for Foreign State Representatives**
> *"Subject to subsection (4), representatives of a foreign state that is a member of or that participates in the Assembly shall have in Canada, to the extent specified in the Agreement, the privileges and immunities set out in Article IV of the Convention."*

- This provision extends the **privileges and immunities** of foreign state representatives (e.g., ambassadors, envoys) to Canada when they are participating in the ICC’s work.
- These rights are derived from **Article IV of the UN Convention**, which grants diplomatic immunity to representatives of foreign states.
- The scope is **limited** to:
  - Representatives of foreign states that are **members** of the Assembly or **participants** in it.
  - The extent of these rights is governed by the **Agreement** (i.e., the ICC-specific agreement), which may tailor or limit the scope of the UN Convention’s provisions.

> **Important Limitation**: The privileges are not automatic or universal. They are conditional upon the representative's role in the Assembly and are subject to the provisions of the Agreement.

#### **3. Privileges and Immunities for ICC Personnel**
> *"Subject to subsection (4), judges, officials and staff of the International Criminal Court and counsel, experts, witnesses and other persons required to be present at the seat of that Court shall have the privileges and immunities set out in Article 48 of the Rome Statute and in the Agreement."*

- This is the most detailed and specific provision.
- It grants **immunities and privileges** to:
  - **Judges**
  - **Officials**
  - **Staff**
  - **Counsel (lawyers)**
  - **Experts**
  - **Witnesses**
  - **Other individuals required to be present at the ICC’s seat** (e.g., in The Hague)
- These rights are drawn from:
  - **Article 48 of the Rome Statute**, which establishes the ICC’s immunity framework for its personnel.
  - The **Agreement on Privileges and Immunities**, which may supplement or clarify the Rome Statute provisions.
- The immunities include:
  - **Immunity from criminal prosecution** in Canada (except for serious crimes such as fraud or corruption committed in Canada),
  - **Immunity from arrest** or detention,
  - **Protection of personal and official communications**,
  - **Exemption from taxation and customs duties**,
  - **Freedom from interference** with their work.

> **Note**: These immunities are **not absolute**. They are subject to exceptions, such as:
  - Crimes committed in Canada,
  - Violations of Canadian law (e.g., serious breaches of public order),
  - Acts of terrorism or fraud.

---

#### **4. Taxation and Liability of Canadian Citizens and Residents**
> *"This Order does not exempt permanent residents of Canada and Canadian citizens from liability for taxes or duties imposed by any law in Canada."*

- A **critical limitation** of the Order:
  - It **does not grant tax immunity** to ICC officials, judges, or foreign representatives.
  - Canadian citizens or permanent residents **remain fully liable** for Canadian taxes (income, property, capital gains, etc.).
  - This ensures that the Canadian tax system is not circumvented by international personnel.
- This provision maintains Canada’s fiscal sovereignty and aligns with international norms that recognize that immunity from criminal prosecution does not extend to tax obligations.

---

#### **5. Coming into Force**
> *"This Order comes into force on the day on which it is registered."*

- The Order is **not effective immediately** upon enactment.
- It becomes legally binding only after it is **registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, the official journal of federal laws.
- The registration date is typically the date of publication, which is usually within a few days of the Order being issued.

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

1. **International Law Compliance**  
   The Order reflects Canada’s commitment to international law and its obligations under the Rome Statute and the UN Convention. It ensures Canada treats the ICC as a legitimate international institution with recognized legal status.

2. **Diplomatic and Judicial Neutrality**  
   By granting immunities, Canada ensures that ICC officials and foreign representatives can carry out their duties without fear of political or legal interference in Canada.

3. **Balance Between Immunity and Accountability**  
   While immunities are granted, they are **not absolute**. The Order explicitly excludes tax liability and allows for prosecution in cases of serious crimes committed in Canada—ensuring that Canada maintains accountability for its own citizens and residents.

4. **Alignment with UN Practice**  
   The use of the UN Convention as a model demonstrates Canada’s adherence to established international norms for diplomatic and international organization privileges.

5. **Jurisdictional Clarity**  
   The Order clarifies which individuals and entities are protected and under what conditions, reducing ambiguity in Canadian courts and government agencies.

### **Conclusion**

The *International Criminal Court Privileges and Immunities Order* is a foundational piece of Canadian legislation that formally recognizes the ICC as a legal entity with corporate status and grants it, and its personnel, specific privileges and immunities in Canada. It also extends similar protections to foreign state representatives participating in the ICC’s Assembly. However, it explicitly **does not extend tax immunity**, preserving Canada’s fiscal jurisdiction. The Order is grounded in international legal instruments and reflects Canada’s role as a responsible and cooperative participant in global justice efforts.

It operates as a **practical and legally sound mechanism** to support the ICC’s mission while respecting Canadian laws, public interests, and the principle of accountability.
