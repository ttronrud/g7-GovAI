The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2016-63, s. 1]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Instruments Regulation (SOR/2016-63)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Repeal Status**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2016-63**, which stands for *Statutory Instrument 2016-63* — a document issued by the Government of Canada that amends or repeals existing regulations.
- **Section Repealed**: Section 1 of SOR/2016-63 specifically contains the repeal of the regulation in question. This means that the original regulation was officially removed from the legal framework and is no longer applicable.
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such repeals typically take effect upon the publication of the statutory instrument in the Canada Gazette or as specified in the instrument itself. In this case, the repeal would have come into effect on or after the date of publication of SOR/2016-63 (which was likely in 2016).

### Implications:
- Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals who previously relied on the regulation must now refer to current, active legislation or regulations that have replaced it (if any).
- The repeal may reflect a change in policy, administrative streamlining, or the consolidation of regulations under a new framework.

### Important Note:
Since the original regulation is not provided, the summary is based solely on the repealing notice. Without the original text of the regulation, it is not possible to describe its content, purpose, or scope. To understand what was repealed, one would need to consult the original regulation that was removed — which may be archived in the *Canada Gazette*, the *Regulations and Statutes Database*, or through official government legal repositories.

### Conclusion:
The entry "[Repealed, SOR/2016-63, s. 1]" signifies that a regulation (or section of a regulation) has been officially canceled by Statutory Instrument 2016-63, Section 1. It is no longer in effect and should not be used as a source of legal authority. For further details, the original regulation must be retrieved from official legal databases.
