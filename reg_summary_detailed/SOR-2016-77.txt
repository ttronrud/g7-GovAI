**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation Title:**  
Order Establishing the Text of a Resolution Providing for the Postponement of the Coming into Force of Specific Subsections of the *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 15(2)** of the *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act*, and is made on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport** by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**. This means the Governor General, acting on the advice of the Minister, formally enacts the order in accordance with the legislative framework established by the Act.

**Purpose of the Order:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **postpone the effective date** of certain provisions of the *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act* by one year. Specifically, it delays the coming into force of the following subsections:

- Section 5.1(2)  
- Section 6(2)  
- Section 7(2)  
- Section 8(2)  
- Section 9(2)  
- Section 10(2)  
- Section 11(2)  
- Section 12(2)

These subsections were originally scheduled to come into force on **August 1, 2016**, but this Order modifies that timeline.

**Key Provisions of the Order:**

1. **Establishment of the Resolution Text:**  
   Pursuant to **subsection 15(1)** of the *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act*, the text of a formal resolution (set out in the attached schedule) is officially established. This resolution outlines the legal basis and intent for postponing the implementation of the specified subsections.

2. **Postponement Period:**  
   The coming into force of the listed subsections is **postponed by one year**. Instead of taking effect on August 1, 2016, they will come into force on **August 1, 2017**.

3. **Effective Date of the Order:**  
   This Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government authority (e.g., the Office of the Registrar of Regulations or the federal legislative register). This ensures that the postponement takes effect immediately upon formal publication, allowing stakeholders to adjust plans accordingly.

**Context and Background:**  
The *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act* was enacted to address concerns about the cost and fairness of rail transportation for grain farmers, particularly in relation to pricing, access, and service standards. The provisions in question likely relate to rail service obligations, pricing mechanisms, or operational requirements that affect grain transport.

The one-year postponement suggests that the government or relevant stakeholders wished to:
- Allow more time for stakeholders (such as farmers, rail operators, and industry groups) to prepare for new requirements.
- Evaluate the practical impact of the provisions in a real-world setting.
- Address potential economic or operational challenges before implementation.

**Legal Significance:**  
This Order is a **legally binding instrument** under the authority of the Act. It does not amend the Act itself but instead modifies the timing of when certain provisions become enforceable. It operates as a formal administrative action that is consistent with the legislative intent of the Act.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation serves as a critical administrative step to delay the enforcement of eight specific provisions of the *Fair Rail for Grain Farmers Act* from August 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017. It ensures that the provisions are implemented in a manner that allows for adequate preparation, stakeholder consultation, and operational readiness, thereby promoting a more equitable and practical approach to grain transport regulation.
