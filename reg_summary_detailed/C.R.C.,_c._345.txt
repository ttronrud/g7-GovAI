**Detailed Summary of the Returned Contributions Interest Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Returned Contributions Interest Regulations*

---

### **1. Citation and Purpose**  
These regulations are formally cited as the *Returned Contributions Interest Regulations*. Their primary purpose is to establish the rules governing the payment of interest on certain contributions to the Superannuation Account under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*. Specifically, they address interest entitlements for contributions that are returned to contributors due to the invalidity of the original election or for other specified reasons.

---

### **2. Definition of "Contribution"**  
The term **"contribution"** is defined in the regulations as:

- An amount paid by or on behalf of a contributor to the Superannuation Account,  
- Under subsection 6(1) of the *Public Service Superannuation Act*,  
- That has been **on deposit in the Superannuation Account for at least two years** from the date it was received, **and**  
- That **cannot be used for its original purpose** because the election under which it was made is **void**.

> **Key Implications**:  
> - The contribution must have been made in accordance with a valid election under the Act.  
> - If the election is later declared void (e.g., due to fraud, error, or procedural flaw), the contribution is no longer usable for its intended purpose (e.g., retirement benefits).  
> - The two-year holding period ensures that only contributions with sufficient time in the account are eligible for interest.  
> - This definition excludes contributions that were paid before April 1, 1967, unless specifically requested.

### **3. Interest Calculation and Payment Schedule**  

#### **Interest Rate**  
Interest is payable at a **fixed rate of 1% per annum** on the amount of the contribution on deposit.

#### **Payment Timing**  
Interest is calculated and payable **quarterly**, on the **last day of each of the following quarters** in each fiscal year:  
- June  
- September  
- December  
- March  

> This means interest is calculated and paid at the end of each quarter, not annually.

#### **Interest Period**  
Interest accrues from:  
- The **first day of the first quarter** that begins **after** the contribution was made into the account,  
- **Until the last day of the quarter immediately preceding** the day the contribution is paid out of the account.

> **Example**:  
> If a contribution is made on January 15, 2023:  
> - The first quarter of interest begins on April 1, 2023 (first quarter of the fiscal year starting April 1, 2023).  
> - Interest will be calculated and paid on June 30, 2023 (end of first quarter).  
> - Interest will continue to accrue until the day before the contribution is withdrawn — e.g., if it is paid out on October 15, 2025, interest will be paid on December 31, 2025 (last day of the quarter before payout).

> **Important Note**: Interest is only calculated for the period **between the date the contribution entered the account and the date it is withdrawn**.

### **4. Exclusion of Pre-1967 Contributions**  

No interest is payable on a contribution where:  
- An amount in respect of that contribution was paid to the contributor **before April 1, 1967**,  
- **Unless** a formal application is made to the **President of the Treasury Board**.

> **Implication**:  
> - Contributions made prior to April 1, 1967 are generally **exempt from interest** under these regulations.  
> - To qualify for interest on such pre-1967 contributions, the contributor must **actively apply** to the President of the Treasury Board.  
> - This provision reflects a historical policy of limited interest entitlements for older contributions, possibly due to administrative or financial constraints at the time.

### **5. Key Principles and Implications**  

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Eligibility Requirement** | Contributions must be at least two years old and must be void due to a flawed election. |
| **Interest Rate** | Fixed at 1% per annum, compounded quarterly (though not explicitly stated, the quarterly calculation implies simple interest over time). |
| **Interest Period** | Accrues from the first day of the quarter after the contribution is received until the quarter before withdrawal. |
| **No Interest on Pre-1967 Contributions** | Automatic exclusion unless a formal application is submitted. |
| **No Interest on Regular Contributions** | Only applies to contributions that are "returned" due to void elections. |

### **6. Practical Application Example**  

**Scenario**:  
A public servant makes a contribution of $10,000 on March 1, 2021, under an election that is later declared void. The contribution remains in the account until it is returned on September 1, 2023.  

**Interest Calculation**:  
- The contribution is eligible because it has been in the account for over two years (from March 1, 2021, to September 1, 2023).  
- The first quarter after the contribution (April 1, 2021) is when interest begins.  
- Interest is calculated quarterly at 1% per annum on the $10,000.  
- Interest is paid on June 30, 2021; September 30, 2021; December 31, 2021; March 31, 2022; June 30, 2022; September 30, 2022; December 31, 2022; March 31, 2023.  
- Interest stops accruing on the quarter before the withdrawal (i.e., after September 30, 2023).  
- Total interest = $10,000 × 1% × 2.5 years (from April 2021 to September 2023) = $250 (approximate, assuming simple interest).  

> Note: The actual interest is calculated quarterly based on the balance, and payments are made on the last day of each quarter.

### **7. Limitations and Exceptions**  
- Interest does **not apply** to contributions made before April 1, 1967, unless formally requested.  
- Interest is **not payable** on contributions that were not void due to a flawed election.  
- Interest is only payable on contributions that are **returned** to the contributor, not on regular withdrawals.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The *Returned Contributions Interest Regulations* provide a clear, structured framework for compensating contributors who have had their contributions returned due to invalid elections. The rules ensure that:  
- Only long-standing, void contributions are eligible for interest,  
- Interest is calculated at a modest but consistent rate (1% per annum),  
- Payments are made on a regular, quarterly basis,  
- Historical contributions (pre-1967) are excluded unless formally applied for.

These regulations serve both as a **financial safeguard** for contributors and as a **transparent mechanism** to address administrative errors or void elections in the public service superannuation system.

---  
**Final Note**: These regulations are part of a broader framework under the *Public Service Superannuation Act*, and their interpretation should be consistent with the legislative intent of ensuring fairness, accountability, and financial prudence in public service retirement arrangements.
