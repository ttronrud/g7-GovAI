**Detailed Summary of the Reproduction of Postage Stamps Regulations**

The *Reproduction of Postage Stamps Regulations* establish specific conditions under which reproductions of Canadian postage stamps may be legally made and published. These regulations are designed to protect the integrity and commercial value of official postage stamps while allowing for limited, non-commercial use in certain contexts.

### **1. General Authorization for Reproduction (Section 2)**  
Reproductions of postage stamps may be made and published under the following circumstances:

- **In Media Contexts**:  
  Reproductions may be used to illustrate or accompany a **news item or article** in a **newspaper, magazine, or periodical**. This allows media outlets to include stamp images for contextual or informational purposes, such as reporting on historical events, philatelic events, or postal history.

- **In Philatelic Publications or Stationery**:  
  Reproductions may appear in:
  - **Philatelic publications or catalogues** (e.g., stamp books, collector guides)
  - **Stationery of philatelic clubs or societies** (e.g., club newsletters, promotional materials)

> **Important Exclusion**:  
> Reproductions **cannot** be made on **envelopes or other similar containers or articles** (such as postal mail items), as this would risk misuse or commercial exploitation of the stamp design.

### **2. Requirements for Legally Permitted Reproductions (Section 2 – Conditions)**  
Any reproduction authorized under Section 2 must meet **one of the following two conditions**:

- **Size Requirement**:  
  The reproduction must be **at least 50% larger or 50% smaller in area** than the original postage stamp.  
  → This ensures that the reproduction is not merely a scaled-up or scaled-down version of the original stamp that could be mistaken for a genuine stamp or used for deceptive purposes.

- **Defacement Requirement**:  
  The reproduction must be **clearly defaced** by a line that is **embodied in the original plate or die** used to produce it.  
  → This means the reproduction must include a visible, intentional line (such as a break or scratch) that is part of the manufacturing process of the original stamp. This serves as a visible identifier that the reproduction is not a direct, unaltered copy and is intended to distinguish it from genuine stamps.

> These conditions are designed to prevent unauthorized commercial use and to ensure that reproductions are clearly distinguishable from authentic stamps.

---

### **3. Material Requirements for Reproduction Plates or Dies (Section 3)**  
Any **plates or dies** used to create reproductions under Section 2 must be made entirely of:

- **Babbit** or  
- **Other soft metal or material**

> This requirement ensures that the reproduction process does not involve high-precision, hard-metal dies that could be used to produce stamps indistinguishable from genuine ones. The use of soft materials limits the potential for creating counterfeit or high-fidelity reproductions that could be used fraudulently.

### **4. Additional Authorization for Public Interest (Section 4)**  
In addition to the general provisions in Section 2, the **Canada Post Corporation** may, at its discretion, authorize the reproduction or publication of postage stamps **if it determines that such action is in the public interest**.

- **Consent Required**:  
  Any such authorization requires **written consent** from Canada Post.

- **How to Apply**:  
  Interested parties must submit a **written application** to:  
  > **Director of Stamp Products**  
  > Canada Post  
  > 2701 Riverside Dr  
  > Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0B1  

- **Purpose of Consent**:  
  This provision allows Canada Post to evaluate whether a proposed reproduction would serve a broader public interest—such as educational, historical, or cultural purposes—without compromising the protection of stamp designs or their commercial value.

### **Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Prevent Unauthorized Use**:  
   The rules prevent the misuse of stamp designs in commercial or misleading contexts (e.g., on envelopes or in products that could be mistaken for genuine postage).

2. **Protect Intellectual Property and Design Integrity**:  
   By requiring size variations or defacement, the regulations ensure that reproductions are not visually identical to original stamps.

3. **Support Educational and Philatelic Use**:  
   The rules allow legitimate use in journalism, philately, and club activities, promoting public interest and collector engagement.

4. **Ensure Oversight and Accountability**:  
   Canada Post retains authority to approve or deny reproductions in the public interest, providing a layer of regulatory control.

### **Conclusion**

The *Reproduction of Postage Stamps Regulations* provide a balanced framework that permits the legal use of postage stamp reproductions in media and philatelic contexts while safeguarding against commercial exploitation and forgery. By imposing strict size, defacement, and material requirements, and by allowing Canada Post to grant additional authorizations for public interest purposes, the regulations ensure that stamp designs remain protected while remaining accessible for educational and informational use.
