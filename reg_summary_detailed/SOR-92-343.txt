### **Detailed Summary of the Repulse Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption Process**

The **Repulse Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the authority of **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports. This regulation was preceded by a **public notice and opportunity for comment**, as required by **Section 5.5** of the Aeronautics Act.

- A proposed version of the zoning regulations was published in:
  - Two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **March 30 and April 6, 1991**.
  - Two successive issues of the *Nunatsiaq News* on **July 5 and July 12, 1991**.
- These publications provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., local communities, landowners, aviation stakeholders) to submit representations or objections to the proposed rules.
- Based on this public consultation, the regulations were formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.

#### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**

- **Official Title**: *Repulse Bay Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: Applies to all lands **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Repulse Bay Airport**, including public road allowances.  
- The specific lands are defined in **Part VI of the Schedule** to the regulation.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several critical technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Repulse Bay Airport, located in the vicinity of Repulse Bay, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. Located on the centerline of runway 163–343, 518.15 meters from the threshold of runway 343. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway strip. It ensures safe aircraft approach by limiting obstructions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, but capped at **9 meters above ground level** if the ARP elevation is too low (i.e., where the plane would be below ground). |
| **Strip** | The main landing area of the airport, including the runway. For runway 163–343, it is **90 meters wide** (45 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,156.3 meters long**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to meet the outer surface. It provides a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: The airport reference point is set at **12.8 meters above sea level**.

#### **4. Key Prohibitions (Zoning Restrictions)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object **on any land covered by these regulations**,  
- If the **highest point** of that structure exceeds the elevation limits defined by any of the following:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This restriction ensures that **aircraft can safely approach and land** without encountering obstacles that could interfere with visibility, flight paths, or aerodynamic performance.

---

#### **5. Detailed Description of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (Runway 163 and 343)**

- Each approach surface is an **inclined plane** with a slope of **1 meter vertically to 30 meters horizontally** (1:30 slope).
- It rises from the end of the runway strip to an **imaginary horizontal line**:
  - Located **2,500 meters horizontally** from the end of the strip.
  - Positioned **295 meters from the centerline** of the runway on either side.
  - At an elevation of **83.3 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

> This creates a buffer zone around each runway end to ensure clear visibility and safe approach paths.

##### **B. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** at **45 meters above the elevation of the ARP (12.8 m ASL = 57.8 m ASL)**.
- However, **if this elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level**, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground**.
- This ensures that even in low-lying areas, the outer boundary of the restricted zone is not below ground level.

> Purpose: Prevents high structures from blocking the sky view for aircraft during takeoff and landing, especially at long distances.

##### **C. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces** up to the **outer surface**.
- Ensures a smooth, gradual transition from the runway area to the outer surface, avoiding abrupt changes in elevation.

##### **D. Boundary of Restricted Area**

- The outer limits of the regulated zone are defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- This circular boundary establishes the **maximum spatial extent** over which the zoning restrictions apply.

---

#### **6. Supporting Documentation**

The regulation references the **Repulse Bay Airport Zoning Plan No. E.2846**, dated **April 23, 1990**, which provides the spatial and geometric basis for all defined surfaces and boundaries. This plan serves as the authoritative reference for the layout and dimensions of the airport and its surrounding zones.

---

#### **7. Regulatory Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **Safety of Air Traffic**  
   - To prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting the height of structures near the airport.

2. **Compliance with Aviation Standards**  
   - To meet international and national aviation safety standards, particularly those related to visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument approaches.

3. **Environmental and Community Protection**  
   - To minimize disruption to local communities and ecosystems by controlling development near the airport.

4. **Public Participation and Transparency**  
   - To ensure that the public had a fair opportunity to comment before final adoption, as mandated by the Aeronautics Act.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement would typically involve:
- Local land-use authorities or the Minister of Transport.
- Inspections of proposed developments.
- Penalties for unauthorized construction or modifications that exceed the height limits.

Developers and landowners must consult with aviation authorities and conduct **height and obstruction analyses** before initiating any construction.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Repulse Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework to protect aviation safety by defining strict height limits for structures near the airport. The regulation uses a combination of **approach surfaces, outer surfaces, transitional surfaces**, and a **circular boundary** to ensure that no structure poses a hazard to aircraft operations. All provisions are grounded in a formal public consultation process and are aligned with established aviation safety standards.

These regulations are a critical component of Canada’s aviation infrastructure management, reflecting a balance between **development needs** and **safety imperatives** in remote northern communities.

--- 

> **Key Takeaway**: This regulation ensures that all structures within a 4,000-meter radius of Repulse Bay Airport must not exceed the defined elevation limits of approach, transitional, or outer surfaces — thereby safeguarding flight operations and maintaining safe air navigation.
