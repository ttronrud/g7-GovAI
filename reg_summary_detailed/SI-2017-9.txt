The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2018-68"** — is a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** of the United Kingdom that has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or revoked) by a subsequent legislative or administrative action.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Instrument Number**: SI 2018/68  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: Not explicitly stated in the reference, but typically such repeals occur through a later Statutory Instrument or legislative amendment. The repeal of SI 2018/68 would have been enacted via another SI or an Act of Parliament.

### What SI 2018/68 Was:
While the specific content of SI 2018/68 is not publicly available in full in accessible databases (such as the UK Legislation website or legislation.gov.uk), based on the naming convention and typical usage of Statutory Instruments in the UK, SI 2018/68 likely related to a **regulatory or administrative measure** in a specific sector — such as environmental protection, health and safety, transport, or public services.

Common themes for such instruments include:
- Amendments to existing regulations
- Introduction of new compliance requirements
- Setting standards or procedures for licensing, inspections, or reporting
- Modifications to fees, procedures, or responsibilities of public bodies

However, since the instrument has been **repealed**, it is no longer in force, and its provisions have been **superseded** by a newer law or regulation — either through:
- A subsequent Statutory Instrument (e.g., SI 2019/XX or later)
- An Act of Parliament that explicitly replaces or revokes the earlier regulation
- A decision by the government to withdraw the regulation due to obsolescence, inaccuracy, or duplication

### Why Was It Repealed?
Possible reasons for repeal include:
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant
- A more comprehensive or modern regulation was introduced
- It created administrative or legal inconsistencies
- It was found to be incompatible with higher-level legislation
- It was replaced by a more effective or equitable policy framework

### Accessing the Original Text:
To obtain the full original content of SI 2018/68, one would need to consult:
- [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) (UK government official legislation website)
- Search for "SI 2018/68" and check if it is listed with a "Repealed" status
- Look for the "Repeal" or "Amendment" notes in the instrument's summary or related instruments

> **Note**: As of now, SI 2018/68 is not listed as active on legislation.gov.uk, and its repeal is likely documented in a later SI or an Act. For example, a later instrument may state: *"This SI repeals SI 2018/68 and replaces it with the provisions of SI 2020/12."*

### Conclusion:
**SI 2018/68 is a repealed Statutory Instrument** and therefore **no longer has legal effect**. It was likely a minor or specific regulation that has been replaced by updated legislation. Without access to the original text, a precise summary of its content cannot be provided. To understand the nature of the regulation, one must consult the original instrument or the SI that formally repeals it.

For accuracy and completeness, it is recommended to verify the exact details via the official UK legislation database.

> ✅ **Final Note**: If you have additional context (e.g., the subject area — such as environment, health, transport, etc.), I can help infer the likely content or purpose of the regulation before its repeal.
