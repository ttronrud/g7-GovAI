**Detailed Summary of the Transport Control Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **Transport Control Regulations** and may be cited as such. These regulations establish a framework for the government’s ability to regulate and control the transportation of goods in bulk across Canada, particularly during times of national emergency, market imbalance, or public interest concerns.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **Bulk Transport Facilities**
- Includes any real or personal property (e.g., ships, rail lines, storage facilities) designed or capable of being used for transporting goods in bulk.
- Specifically includes:
  - **Railway facilities** designed or capable of transporting goods in bulk.
  - **Ships of 1,000 gross registered tons or more** that are designed or capable of transporting goods in bulk.
  - **Storage facilities** used or capable of being used in connection with bulk transport (e.g., silos, warehouses).
- Also includes facilities owned, controlled, or in possession of any operator of transport infrastructure.

> *Note: "Bulk" refers to large quantities of unprocessed or minimally processed materials transported without packaging.*

---

#### **Controller and Deputy Controller**
- **Transport Controller** and **Deputy Transport Controller** are appointed by the **Governor in Council** (the federal executive authority) on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**.
- The **Controller** holds primary authority and oversight.
- A **Deputy Controller** may exercise all powers of the Controller, **subject to**:
  - Restrictions imposed by the Controller.
  - Final review and approval by the Controller.
- Any order issued by a Deputy Controller is **final and binding** unless reviewed, varied, or canceled by the Controller.

---

#### **"Dealing in or with"**
A broad legal term encompassing all actions related to bulk transport facilities or goods:
- Buying, selling, owning, leasing, hiring, lending, borrowing, exchanging, acquiring, importing, storing, supplying, chartering, operating, delivering, transporting, distributing, dispensing, shipping, conveying, installing, or using.

> This ensures that even indirect involvement in transport operations falls under regulatory scrutiny.

---

#### **Equipment**
- Includes any property (real or personal), goods, or materials owned or under control of a person operating bulk transport facilities.
- Covers tools, machinery, vehicles, containers, and other items directly or indirectly involved in transporting bulk goods.

---

#### **Goods in Bulk**
Defined as specific types of raw or semi-processed materials:
- **Grain and grain products** (wheat, barley, rye, oats, corn, flax, flour, mill feed, screenings)
- **Ore and minerals** (crude, screened, sized, refined, concentrated — but not further processed)
- **Ferrous metals** (iron, steel scrap)
- **Sand, stone, gravel**
- **Pulpwood, wood pulp, poles, logs**
- **Coal and coke**
- **Sulphur and phosphate**

> These are the commodities subject to priority control and allocation under the regulations.

---

#### **Order**
An official directive issued under these regulations, which may be:
- **General** (applying broadly across the sector)
- **Specific** (targeting particular goods, facilities, times, or locations)

---

#### **Services**
Any accommodation or service provided by a person who owns, operates, controls, or possesses bulk transport facilities or equipment — including maintenance, loading, unloading, or logistics support.

---

#### **Ship**
As defined in the *Canada Shipping Act*, a ship that is **registered in Canada**.

---

### **3. Powers of the Transport Controller**

The Transport Controller has broad and significant powers to manage the flow of bulk goods through the transportation system. These powers include:

#### **(a) Priority Assignment**
- Can order any person dealing in or with bulk transport facilities to transport certain goods **in priority** over others.
- This allows the government to ensure critical supplies (e.g., food, raw materials) are moved first during shortages or emergencies.

#### **(b) Minimum Quotas and Quantities**
- Can set **minimum amounts** of specific goods in bulk that must be transported during a defined period.
- Ensures that essential commodities are not withheld from the market.

#### **(c) Minimum Ratios or Proportions**
- Can require that certain goods be transported in specific **ratios or proportions** relative to other goods.
- For example, ensuring a minimum percentage of grain is moved alongside coal or ore to maintain supply balance.

#### **(d) Facility Restrictions**
- Can order a person to **limit, discontinue, or cease operating** their transport facilities — **except** for transporting goods designated by the Controller.
- This power allows the government to temporarily shut down non-essential transport capacity during crises.

#### **(e) Facility Utilization and Expansion**
- Can require operators to **extend, furnish, supply, or use** transport facilities, services, or equipment for transporting goods in bulk at specific times, places, and methods.
- Enables the government to mobilize transport capacity during shortages.

#### **(f) Information Requirements**
- Can require any person dealing in or with bulk transport facilities or goods to provide:
  - Specific facts, data, or information.
  - In a prescribed format and within a prescribed time.
- This information may be required **under oath or affirmation**, ensuring accountability and transparency.

> All such information must be submitted to the Controller, who may use it to assess compliance and make informed decisions.

---

### **4. Nature of Orders**
- Orders can be **general** (applying broadly) or **specific** (targeting particular goods, facilities, or operations).
- Violation of any such order is considered a **violation of the Regulations themselves**.

---

### **5. Legal Defences and Immunity**

#### **Defence for Compliance with Government Orders**
- If a person fails to fulfill a prior contract, charter, or obligation (entered into before or after June 1, 1954), and such failure is due to **compliance with a later government order**, then:
  - **Proof of compliance** with the order is a valid **defence** in any legal action or proceeding against that person.

> This protects operators from being penalized for following government directives, even if those directives conflict with prior agreements.

#### **Immunity from Liability**
- The **Controller**, **Deputy Controller**, or any person acting under their authority:
  - Is **not liable** to any individual or entity for anything done or omitted in the exercise of powers granted under these regulations.
- This provides legal protection against personal or financial liability for administrative decisions, especially in times of crisis.

---

### **6. Staff and Organization**
- The Controller may appoint **staff and organizational units** at Ottawa and elsewhere in Canada as needed.
- Appointments follow procedures established by law.

---

### **7. Penalties for Violations**

Violating any provision of the Transport Control Regulations is an **offence** and carries penalties depending on the type of proceeding:

| Type of Proceeding | Penalty |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Summary conviction** (e.g., minor offence, administrative hearing) | Fine not exceeding **$500**, or **imprisonment for up to 6 months**, or both |
| **Indictment** (e.g., criminal trial) | Fine not exceeding **$5,000**, or **imprisonment for up to 5 years**, or both |

> These penalties reflect the seriousness of non-compliance with government-mandated transport controls.

---

### **8. Purpose and Context**
These regulations were designed to:
- Ensure the **national supply of essential bulk goods** (especially food, minerals, and raw materials).
- Prevent market manipulation or hoarding during times of crisis (e.g., war, economic downturn, natural disaster).
- Provide the federal government with **flexible, emergency powers** to manage transport systems when market forces or supply chains are disrupted.

They operate as a **public interest safeguard**, allowing the government to prioritize national needs over private profit or commercial convenience.

### **Conclusion**

The **Transport Control Regulations** are a critical piece of Canadian federal regulatory policy, providing the government with **emergency powers to manage the transportation of essential bulk goods**. They balance the need for national economic stability and public safety with legal protections for operators and officials. While the powers are extensive, they are constrained by procedural safeguards, judicial review, and clear definitions of what constitutes a violation or lawful action.

These regulations remain relevant in modern contexts such as supply chain disruptions, pandemics, or national emergencies, where ensuring equitable and reliable access to vital commodities is paramount.
