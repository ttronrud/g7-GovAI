**Detailed Summary of the Edmonton International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The document is formally titled the *Edmonton International Airport Zoning Regulations* and may be cited as such. These regulations establish zoning controls and spatial restrictions around Edmonton International Airport (EIA) in the Province of Alberta to ensure aviation safety, particularly regarding the physical environment surrounding runways, approach paths, and critical flight zones.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency in interpretation, several key terms are defined:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *Edmonton International Airport*, located in Alberta.
  
- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A fixed geographic point used as a reference elevation and location. It is defined as:
  - Located at **latitude 53°18′33.9″ N, longitude 113°34′57″ W**.
  - Coincides with **Transport Canada coordinate control survey monument No. 710323**.
  - **Deemed to be 712.3 meters above sea level** (m.a.s.l.) for all regulatory purposes.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (runway approach), perpendicular to the runway centerline. It is designed to ensure aircraft can safely approach the runway without interference from terrain or structures.  
  - **Description**:
    - Extends from each end of the runway strip (for runways 01L–19R, 01R–19L, 11L–29R, 11R–29L).
    - Has a slope ratio of **1 meter vertically to 50 meters horizontally**.
    - Rises to an imaginary horizontal line:
      - 15,000 meters horizontally from the end of the runway.
      - 2,400 meters from the runway centerline.
      - 300 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway.
    - Applies to all eight approach ends (four runways, each with left and right configurations).

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane that defines the outer boundary of the airport’s influence zone.
  - **Elevation**:
    - Generally **45 meters above the airport reference point (712.3 m a.s.l. → 757.3 m a.s.l.)**.
    - However, if this elevation is **less than 9 meters above ground level**, the surface is instead set at **9 meters above ground** to prevent overly restrictive or impractical restrictions in low-lying areas.

- **Strip**: The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including the runway and its adjacent safety zones.
  - **Runway 01L–19R**: 300 m wide, 150 m on each side of centerline, 2,863 m long.
  - **Runway 01R–19L**: 300 m wide, 150 m on each side, 3,473 m long.
  - **Runway 11L–29R**: 300 m wide, 150 m on each side, 3,229 m long.
  - **Runway 11R–29L**: 300 m wide, 150 m on each side, 3,777 m long.

- **Transitional Surface**: An inclined plane that connects the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surface to the outer surface.
  - Slope ratio: **1 meter vertically to 7 meters horizontally**.
  - Extends outward from the strip’s lateral limits and approach surfaces.
  - Continues until it intersects with:
    - The outer surface, or
    - Another transitional surface of an adjacent runway strip.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to **all lands** (including public road allowances) that fall within or directly under the following areas:

- The lands **within** the defined boundaries of the airport zone.
- The lands **directly under** any portion of an approach surface that extends beyond the outer limits of the airport zone.

This includes land adjacent to the airport and in its immediate vicinity, particularly within the approach, transitional, and outer surfaces.

---

### **4. Prohibitions on Construction and Development**

**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on land subject to these regulations **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

- Approach surfaces
- Outer surface
- Transitional surfaces

This means:
- All structures (including residential, commercial, or industrial) must remain **below the elevation of these defined surfaces**.
- Even minor additions (e.g., antennas, signs, or rooftop extensions) are restricted if they exceed the height limits.

**Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs, grass) that exceeds the height of any of these surfaces may be removed by the **Minister of Transport** if it poses a safety risk.

---

### **5. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of land under these regulations may:
- Use the land or any part of it for the **disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**

This restriction is critical to prevent bird strikes, which pose a significant hazard to aircraft during takeoff and landing.

---

### **6. Regulatory Basis and Reference Plans**

All spatial descriptions and boundaries are based on the **Edmonton International Airport Zoning Plan No. E.1874**, dated **February 5, 1985**. This plan is the authoritative source for:

- The location and dimensions of approach surfaces
- The layout and size of strips
- The definition of transitional surfaces
- The boundary of the outer limits of the regulated area

This plan is referenced in all sections and serves as the legal and spatial foundation for enforcement.

---

### **7. Boundary Description of Outer Limits**

The outer boundary of the regulated zone is defined by a detailed, legal survey description (a metes-and-bounds description). It begins at a specific point and proceeds through a sequence of directions and distances, tracing a complex perimeter around the airport. Key features include:

- Starting at the **northeast corner of the west half of Section 36, Township 50, Range 25, west of the 4th Meridian**.
- Progressing through:
  - Road allowances
  - Property lots (e.g., Blocks 11, 16)
  - Major streets (e.g., Derrick Avenue, Sparrow Street, 50th Avenue)
  - Railway plans (e.g., C. & E. No. 1, Railway Plan 3274 E.0.)
  - Crossings and intersections with other road plans (e.g., 5047 J.Y., 618 L.Z.)

The boundary ultimately returns to the starting point, forming a closed polygon that defines the **maximum extent of land subject to the zoning restrictions**.

---

### **8. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during approach and landing.
- To **protect flight paths** by maintaining clear zones free of tall structures, vegetation, or hazardous waste.
- To **prevent bird-related hazards** through the prohibition of food or attractive waste.
- To provide a **clear, legally defined spatial framework** for land use, development, and environmental management near the airport.

These measures align with international aviation safety standards and are consistent with Transport Canada’s regulatory framework for airport safety zones.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue directions requiring removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in this regulation.

### **Conclusion**

The *Edmonton International Airport Zoning Regulations* create a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use near Edmonton International Airport. By defining specific surfaces—approach, transitional, and outer—with measurable elevation and spatial parameters, the regulations protect aircraft operations from physical and biological hazards. The rules are enforceable, grounded in a formal survey plan, and designed to balance public development with the paramount need for aviation safety.

These regulations are essential for maintaining the integrity of the airport’s operational environment and serve as a model for similar airport zoning in other jurisdictions.
