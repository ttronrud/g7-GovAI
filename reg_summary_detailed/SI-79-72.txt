**Detailed Summary of the Customs Tariff Remission Order, 1979**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Customs Tariff Remission Order, 1979** was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board**, under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to make orders related to the administration of customs and excise duties, including remissions or adjustments to taxes.

This Order is formally titled the *Customs Tariff Remission Order, 1979* and serves as a legislative instrument to provide tax relief for specific goods under certain conditions.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of the Order is to **remit (i.e., reduce or forgive) a portion of the customs duty and sales tax** payable on certain imported goods. This remission is intended to address a temporary imbalance caused by the fact that a proposed amendment to the Customs Tariff—**Bill C-51**—had not yet been enacted when the Order was issued.

---

### **3. Scope of Remission**

#### **Eligible Goods**
The remission applies to:
- All goods **imported or taken out of warehouse for consumption** on or **after March 27, 1979**.
- All goods that were **previously imported** but for which **no entry for consumption was made before March 27, 1979**.

#### **Amount of Remission**
The amount of duty and sales tax remitted is equal to the **difference** between:
- The **actual customs duty and sales tax** payable on the goods under the existing Customs Tariff and Excise Tax Act at the time of importation, **minus**
- The amount that would have been payable **if Division I of Part I of Bill C-51 had been enacted before March 27, 1979**.

In essence, the remission compensates importers for the **tax burden that would have been reduced** had the proposed changes in Bill C-51 come into effect earlier. This is a form of retrospective tax relief based on the hypothetical impact of the proposed legislation.

> ⚠️ *Note: The remission only applies to the difference in tax — not a full refund or elimination of duty.*

### **4. Exclusions (Goods Not Covered by Remission)**

The remission **does not apply** to certain goods listed in specific tariff items, or to green peas under specific conditions. These exclusions are designed to prevent unintended consequences, particularly in cases where domestic production or market competition is already active.

#### **Excluded Goods (Based on Tariff Items)**

The remission **does not apply** to goods classified under the following tariff items:
- **8704-1**
- **8706-1**
- **8709-1**
- **8715-1**
- **8717-1**
- **8722-1**
- **8728-1**
- **9210-1**

Additionally, **green peas** (not for processing) are excluded **when**:
- They are described in an order made by the **Minister of National Revenue** under **paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Customs Tariff**.
- The goods are imported through **ports in a designated region or part of Canada**.
- The import occurs during **periods fixed by the Minister of National Revenue**.

> This exclusion ensures that green peas used for processing (under item 8720-1) are not subject to remission if they are imported under specific ministerial orders tied to regional market dynamics.

#### **Exclusion for Domestic Market Competition**

The remission also **does not apply** to goods classified under:
- **8702-1**
- **8705-1**
- **8708-1**
- **8712-1**
- **8724-1**
- **9203-1**
- **9205-1**
- **9206-1**
- **9211-1**

And again, **green peas for processing under item 8720-1** are excluded **when**:
- They are imported through ports in a specific region or part of Canada.
- During periods when **similar goods or green peas produced in Canada are being marketed** in that region.

> This exclusion protects domestic producers by preventing tax relief that could undercut local supply and pricing.

### **5. Key Implications and Context**

- **Timing of the Order**: The Order was issued in **1979**, during a period of economic and trade policy transition in Canada. Bill C-51, though not enacted, proposed significant changes to the customs tariff, including adjustments to duties on various goods.
  
- **Policy Rationale**: The remission acts as a **practical bridge** between the existing tariff regime and the proposed changes in Bill C-51. It ensures that importers are not penalized by the delayed enactment of tax reductions.

- **Economic Protection**: The exclusions reflect a **protective policy** toward domestic industries, particularly in agricultural and regional markets. By excluding goods where Canadian production is already active, the government aims to preserve domestic market competitiveness.

- **Administrative Oversight**: The Minister of National Revenue retains significant discretion in determining:
  - Which regions or parts of Canada are affected.
  - When specific import periods apply.
  - Whether certain goods (like green peas) are subject to special orders.

### **6. Summary in Plain Language**

This Order allows importers of certain goods to have **a portion of their customs duty and sales tax refunded** if the tax would have been lower had a proposed law (Bill C-51) been passed earlier. The refund is based on the difference between the actual tax and what the tax would have been under the proposed law.

However, **specific goods** (like certain agricultural products and green peas) are **excluded** from this relief — especially when:
- They are imported into specific regions.
- Canadian-produced versions of these goods are already being sold locally.

This ensures that the tax relief does not undermine domestic industries or create unfair competition.

---

### **7. Legal Significance**
- The Order is a **temporary, targeted measure** to address a gap in tax policy due to legislative delays.
- It demonstrates how Canadian government policy can use **retrospective tax adjustments** to manage economic impacts.
- It reflects a balance between **economic efficiency** (reducing import costs) and **protection of domestic producers**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *Customs Tariff Remission Order, 1979* is a targeted, temporary tax relief measure designed to provide fairness to importers by compensating them for the delay in enacting a proposed tariff reduction. While broad in scope, it is carefully limited to avoid harming domestic industries and ensuring market stability. It remains a notable example of how fiscal policy can be adjusted through administrative orders in the face of legislative delays.
