This regulation establishes specific conditions under which **subsidiaries of an insurance holding company** may hold shares in the parent insurance holding company. It aims to:

### **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (ICA), the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada. |
| **Distribution** | Defined in two parts: <br>1. A trade (buying or selling) by or on behalf of an insurance holding company in **newly issued securities** (shares); <br>2. A trade in **previously issued securities** by any person or group acting in concert who holds **more than 10% of any class of voting shares** of the insurance holding company. |
| **Regulated Securities Entity** | A financial institution whose primary business is dealing in securities and is regulated in its securities activities under: <br>– An Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature; <br>– Or the laws of a foreign country. |

> *Note:* This definition is crucial because it identifies which subsidiaries are eligible to hold shares under the regulation.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. General Limit on Shareholding by Regulated Subsidiaries**
Under **section 753(c)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*, an insurance holding company may permit a subsidiary that is a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares of the holding company — **provided** that:

- The **aggregate value** of shares held by **all such subsidiaries** (that are regulated securities entities)  
  → **does not exceed 1% of the regulatory capital** of the insurance holding company.

> **Exclusion:** Shares referred to in **section 755 of the Act** are excluded from this 1% cap.

> *Regulatory Capital* = The capital amount set by regulators to ensure financial stability and solvency of the insurance holding company.

#### **2. Exception During Share Distribution (Underwriting Activity)**
If a subsidiary of the insurance holding company:
- Is a **regulated securities entity**, and  
- Is acting as a **securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution** (i.e., issuance or sale of new shares) of the insurance holding company,

Then the insurance holding company may **permit the subsidiary to hold shares in excess of the 1% limit** — **until the distribution is completed**.

> This exception is designed to support legitimate underwriting activities and avoid disrupting the process of raising capital through share issuance.

> The excess holding is **temporary** and only applies during the period of the distribution.

### **Regulatory Context and Background**

- These regulations were introduced in response to concerns about **ownership concentration** and **potential conflicts of interest** in insurance holding company structures.
- The 1% cap aligns with broader regulatory objectives to ensure **financial stability**, **separation of business functions**, and **protection of policyholders**.

### **Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulation **comes into force** on the day that **section 753 of the Insurance Companies Act** is activated, as amended by **section 465 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**.
- This means it became effective on **October 24, 2001**, as per the statutory instrument SI/2001-102.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**

This regulation sets clear rules for how subsidiaries of insurance holding companies can own shares in the parent company:

- **Normally**, subsidiaries that are regulated securities firms (like broker-dealers) can only hold shares worth **up to 1% of the parent’s regulatory capital**.
- **Exception**: If a regulated subsidiary is underwriting a share issuance (selling new shares), it can temporarily hold **more than 1%** of shares until the distribution ends.
- The rules are designed to **protect the financial integrity** of the insurance holding company while allowing **flexibility in business operations** like capital raising.
