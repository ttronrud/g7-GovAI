**Detailed Summary of the Sale of Defence Materiel and Services to United Nations Order**

This regulation, titled *The Sale of Defence Materiel and Services to United Nations Order*, establishes the legal framework under which the Government of Canada may sell defence-related materiel or provide defence services to the United Nations (UN) for operational support. Below is a comprehensive and detailed summary of its key provisions:

---

### 1. **Title and Citation**
- The regulation is officially known as *The Sale of Defence Materiel and Services to United Nations Order*.
- It may be cited in legal or official documents using this full title.

---

### 2. **Definition of Key Terms**
- **"Minister"** refers specifically to the **Minister of National Defence**. This individual holds the authority to authorize and oversee the sale of defence materiel or provision of services under this Order.

---

### 3. **Authorization to Sell or Provide Services**
- The **Minister of National Defence** is explicitly authorized to:
  - **Sell defence materiel** (such as equipment, vehicles, weapons, or other military supplies)
  - **Provide services** under the control of the Department of National Defence (e.g., logistics, technical support, training, or operational assistance)
- These actions are permitted **only for the purpose of supporting**:
  - **United Nations operations** established at any time by the UN
  - The **continued operations of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF)**, which is a specific UN peacekeeping mission

> This provision ensures that Canadian defence assets are used in a manner consistent with international peacekeeping mandates and UN mandates, not for commercial or domestic purposes.

---

### 4. **Pricing Mechanism**
- The **price** for any materiel or services sold or provided under this Order shall be set at **the cost to the public**.
- This cost is determined by the Minister, based on:
  - Actual procurement and operational expenses
  - Standard government pricing practices
  - The cost of providing the goods or services to the public sector
- This pricing mechanism ensures that the transaction is **cost-recoverable** and **transparent**, avoiding profit-making or arbitrary pricing.

> Importantly, the price is not market-based or set for profit, but rather reflects the government's actual cost of delivery — aligning with fiscal accountability and public value.

---

### 5. **Annual Reporting Requirement**
- The **Minister is required to report annually to the Treasury Board** on all authorizations made under this Order.
- The report must include:
  - A list of **all individual authorizations**
  - Only those authorizations where the **value exceeds $5,000**
- This reporting requirement ensures:
  - **Accountability** and oversight by the federal financial authority (Treasury Board)
  - **Transparency** in the use of public funds for UN-related defence support
  - Compliance with financial and procurement regulations

> The $5,000 threshold is a practical benchmark to focus oversight on significant transactions while allowing smaller, routine support to be managed without excessive reporting.

---

### 6. **Interdepartmental Consultation**
- For **major requests** (defined as those involving significant value, strategic impact, or sensitive capabilities), the following departments must **act in consultation**:
  - **Department of National Defence** (primary authority)
  - **Department of External Affairs** (now known as Global Affairs Canada; responsible for international relations and diplomatic coordination)
  - **Department of Finance** (responsible for fiscal policy, budget oversight, and financial implications)

> This interdepartmental coordination ensures that:
- Diplomatic considerations are taken into account (External Affairs)
- Financial feasibility and budgetary impact are assessed (Finance)
- National security and strategic interests are balanced (National Defence)

> This collaborative approach prevents unilateral decisions that could have unintended political, financial, or security consequences.
