**Detailed Summary of the Trademarks Regulations (S.C. 2015, c. 36, s. 67)**

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Trademarks Act* (R.S., c. T-13), establish detailed procedural and administrative rules governing how applications for trademark registration, communications with the Registrar of Trademarks, representation by trademark agents, and fees are handled. They provide clarity on requirements for submissions, documentation, representation, language, fees, and timelines, ensuring consistency and fairness in the administration of the Canadian trademark system.

The regulations were adopted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, pursuant to specific sections of the *Trademarks Act* (sections 65a, 65.1b, and 65.2c). They are part of a broader framework designed to streamline and standardize the operation of the Office of the Registrar of Trademarks.
