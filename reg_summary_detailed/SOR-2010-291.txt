## **1. Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation implements the **divestiture of a portion of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food (DAAF)** to a new private employer through a formal agreement between Her Majesty in right of Canada and that new employer. It establishes transitional rules governing the treatment of public service superannuation rights for employees who transition from public service employment to employment with a new private employer.

The regulation ensures that individuals who leave the public service due to this divestiture are not disadvantaged in terms of their superannuation entitlements — particularly regarding **pension rights, return of contributions, survivor benefits, and the timing of eligibility** — while recognizing that their employment status has changed.

---

## **2. Key Definitions and Scope**

### **New Employer**
- A person or entity that, by agreement with Her Majesty in right of Canada, **assumes the functions and activities** previously carried out by a portion of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
- This new employer may be a private corporation or a non-governmental body.

### **Applicability**
- Applies to individuals who:
  - Cease to be employed in the public service **and**
  - Become employed by the **new employer** as a result of the divestiture.
- **Does NOT apply** to individuals who:
  - Become **re-employed** by the new employer (i.e., return to work with the same employer after a prior departure).

> This means the regulation only governs the **initial transition** from public service to private employment due to divestiture — not subsequent re-employment.

---

## **3. Exclusions and Special Provisions**

### **Exclusion for Survivors and Children**
- Sections 4 to 6 of the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA) **do not apply** to:
  - The **survivor** or **children** of a person who:
    - Has **received a return of contributions**, or
    - Has **exercised an option** under subsection 3(2) of the Act (related to transfer of superannuation value).

> This means that survivors and dependents are not subject to the same rules about pension rights or contribution returns during the transition period.

---

## **4. Application of PSSA Sections (Sections 12 to 13.01)**

These sections govern **pension entitlements, death benefits, and survivor benefits**.

- These provisions **only apply to the person on or after the day they cease to be employed by the new employer**.
- This means that **the pension rights and benefits** (such as retirement pensions, survivor benefits, etc.) are calculated and governed **from the date of transition** — not from the original date of service.

> This is a critical point: the individual is treated as having **ceased public service employment** on the day they join the new employer, and all pension-related calculations begin from that point.

---

## **5. Return of Contributions and Transfer Option (Post-2010 Provisions)**

### **Eligibility for Return of Contributions**
- If, **on or after January 1, 2010**, the individual would have been entitled to a **return of contributions** under:
  - Subsection 12(3) or 12.1(4) of the PSSA,
- Then the individual may **request a return of contributions** in writing **within one year** of ceasing public service employment and becoming employed by the new employer.

> This provides a **clear, time-bound window** (one year) for individuals to reclaim contributions they may have made to the public service pension plan.

### **Eligibility to Exercise Transfer Option**
- If, under the same conditions (i.e., on or after January 1, 2010), the individual would have been entitled to **exercise an option** in favor of the **transfer value** under section 13.01 of the PSSA (which allows a transfer of pension value to a private pension plan), then:
  - They may **exercise this option within the same one-year period**.

> This ensures that individuals are not deprived of the right to transfer their pension value to a private pension plan — a significant benefit for those moving into private employment.

> Note: These rights are **only available if the individual would have been entitled** to them under the original PSSA rules. The regulation does not create new entitlements but activates existing ones under specific conditions.

---

## **6. Survivor and Dependent Benefits**

If a person **dies while employed by the new employer**, their **survivor and children** are entitled to one of the following benefits — as if the individual had been employed in the public service:

- **Death benefit** under:
  - Subsection 12(8) or 12.1(8) of the PSSA (which provides a lump sum to dependents upon death).
- **Allowances** under:
  - Subsection 13(3) or 13.001(3) of the PSSA (which may include ongoing payments or survivor benefits).

> This ensures continuity of protection for dependents even after the transition to private employment.

---

## **7. Key Interpretations and Practical Effects**

| Provision | Practical Meaning |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Ceasing public service employment** | A person is deemed to cease public service employment on the day they stop working for the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food and begin working for the new employer. |
| **One-year period for actions** | The one-year period for requesting a return of contributions or exercising a transfer option begins on the day of transition to the new employer. |
| **Pensionable service period** | Includes the period from the day the person ceases public service employment until the day they cease employment with the new employer. This period is **counted toward pension entitlements**. |
| **Age at cessation** | The person’s age at the time of ceasing public service employment is their age on the day they join the new employer. This is used to determine pension eligibility (e.g., retirement age). |

> These interpretations align the new employer transition with the standard rules of the PSSA, ensuring fairness and consistency in pension calculations.

---

## **8. Effective Date**

- These regulations **came into force on January 1, 2010**.
- This date marks the beginning of the application of these transitional rules for individuals transitioning from the DAAF to a new employer.

> The January 1, 2010 threshold is significant because it triggers the **return of contributions and transfer option rights** for individuals who would have been entitled under the PSSA but were previously excluded due to the nature of the transition.

---

## **Conclusion**

This regulation serves as a **critical transitional mechanism** to ensure that employees affected by the divestiture of the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food are not disadvantaged in their retirement or dependant benefits. By aligning their superannuation rights with those of public service employees, it maintains **fairness, consistency, and continuity** in pension entitlements during a major organizational restructuring.

It specifically:
- Preserves the right to **return contributions** and **transfer pension value**,
- Ensures **survivor benefits** are available,
- Clarifies **timing and eligibility** for pension calculations,
- Applies only to **first-time transitions** from public to private employment.

This regulation reflects a balance between public accountability and the need to support employees during major institutional changes.
