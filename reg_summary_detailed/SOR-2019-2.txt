**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Western Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus argyritis) Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Context and Legal Basis**

This regulatory instrument is issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, a Canadian federal law enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), which aims to protect and recover wildlife species at risk across Canada. The specific legal authority for this Order stems from **Section 58** of SARA, particularly subsections **58(4)** and **58(5)**.

- **Section 58(1)** of SARA defines the scope of critical habitat: it applies to the critical habitat of a listed species, as identified in its recovery strategy.
- **Section 58(4)** authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO) to designate and define the critical habitat of a species listed as "threatened" under SARA.
- **Section 58(5)** provides that the designation of critical habitat must be based on scientific and technical information, including the recovery strategy and assessments of the species’ needs.

**2. Species at Stake: Western Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus argyritis)**

- The Western Silvery Minnow is a small, native fish species found in the western regions of Canada, particularly in the Columbia River Basin and associated river systems.
- It is classified as a **threatened species** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** of SARA. This classification indicates that the species is at risk of extinction in the wild due to various threats such as habitat degradation, water diversion, pollution, and climate change.

---

**3. Recovery Strategy and Public Registry**

- A formal **recovery strategy** for the Western Silvery Minnow was developed and submitted to the federal government to identify the specific conditions necessary for the species' survival and recovery.
- This recovery strategy includes a detailed assessment of the **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and reproduction.
- The recovery strategy has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, which is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Government of Canada to provide transparency and accountability regarding species at risk and their conservation measures.

This inclusion ensures that the critical habitat designation is not arbitrary or speculative but is grounded in scientific research and formal planning.

---

**4. Jurisdictional Exclusion Clause**

- The Order explicitly states that **no portion of the critical habitat specified in this Order is located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**.
- Subsection 58(2)b of SARA generally prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas where the species is not currently known to occur or where it is not necessary for the species’ survival.
- By confirming that the designated critical habitat does not fall within such excluded areas, the Order avoids potential legal or procedural conflicts and ensures that the designation is both scientifically valid and legally defensible.

---

**5. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

- The primary purpose of this Order is to **formally designate and define the critical habitat** of the Western Silvery Minnow.
- This designation legally establishes the specific geographic areas that are essential for the species’ survival and recovery. These areas may include:
  - Spawning grounds
  - Nursery areas
  - Areas with suitable water temperature, flow, and substrate
  - Regions with minimal human disturbance or degradation
- Once designated, the critical habitat becomes a **protected area** under SARA, meaning that:
  - Any activities that could destroy, degrade, or adversely affect the habitat are prohibited or require a permit.
  - Federal departments and agencies must consult with the Minister before undertaking actions that may impact the designated habitat.
  - The designation supports the implementation of recovery actions, such as habitat restoration, water flow management, and pollution control.

---

**6. Legal Effect and Enforcement**

- The Order is issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)**, the federal department responsible for the conservation of aquatic species and ecosystems.
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal regulations), ensuring that it becomes legally binding and enforceable upon registration.
- The Order is enforceable under the authority of SARA, and any violation of its provisions may result in legal action, including penalties or remedial orders.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- This Order is a key step in the **recovery and conservation** of the Western Silvery Minnow.
- It provides a clear, legally recognized framework for protecting the species’ essential habitat, which is crucial for its long-term survival.
- It also supports intergovernmental and stakeholder collaboration, including with provincial governments, Indigenous communities, and environmental organizations, to ensure that conservation efforts are coordinated and effective.
- The Order reflects a commitment to science-based, transparent, and accountable environmental policy under SARA.

**Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the Western Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus argyritis) Order*, issued on **December 14, 2018**, is a legally binding designation under the *Species at Risk Act*. It formally identifies and protects the specific areas essential for the survival and recovery of this threatened fish species. The Order is grounded in a scientifically sound recovery strategy, complies with legal requirements, and ensures that no designation conflicts with exclusion provisions in SARA. By protecting the critical habitat, the Order strengthens Canada’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and species recovery.
