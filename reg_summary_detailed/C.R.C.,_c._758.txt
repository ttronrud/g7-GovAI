**Detailed Summary of the Dipropylacetic Acid (also known as 2-Propylpentanoic Acid) Remission Order**

**Title and Citation:**  
This regulatory order is formally titled the *Dipropylacetic Acid (also known as 2-Propylpentanoic Acid) Remission Order* and may be cited accordingly. It serves as a legal instrument issued by a relevant governmental authority—typically the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Bureau of Customs—authorizing a remission (i.e., a reduction or waiver) of customs duties.

**Subject Matter:**  
The order specifically pertains to the chemical compound **dipropylacetic acid**, which is also known by its systematic chemical name, **2-propylpentanoic acid**. This compound may exist in its free acid form or as its **sodium salt**, and may be used in admixed forms (i.e., combined with other substances).

**Scope of Application:**  
The remission applies to all imports of dipropylacetic acid (or its sodium salt), whether or not mixed with other substances, that occur on or after **January 1, 1976**.

**Purpose of the Remission:**  
The primary purpose of this remission is to facilitate access to the compound for **medical use**, specifically in the **treatment of epilepsy**. This reflects a policy objective to ensure that essential pharmaceuticals or medical compounds are available to patients at reduced cost or without undue financial burden due to customs duties.

**Legal Effect:**  
The remission grants a **waiver of customs duties** that would otherwise be payable under the **Customs Tariff** for such imports. This means that importers are not required to pay the standard duty rates on these substances when they are imported for use in treating epilepsy.

**Key Conditions and Limitations:**  
- The remission is **conditional** on the **medically intended use** of the substance in the treatment of epilepsy.  
- The substance must be imported **on or after January 1, 1976**, meaning earlier imports are not covered.  
- The remission applies to both the **free acid** and **sodium salt** forms of the compound.  
- The importation must be for **pharmaceutical or therapeutic purposes**, not for industrial, research, or non-medical applications.  
- The presence of admixtures does not negate the eligibility for remission, as long as the primary purpose remains medical.

**Policy Rationale:**  
This remission is typically grounded in public health policy, aiming to improve patient access to effective treatments for neurological disorders like epilepsy. By reducing or eliminating customs duties on essential medicines, the government supports affordability and availability of life-saving treatments, particularly in cases where the drug is not otherwise widely available or is subject to high cost due to importation fees.

**Duration and Review:**  
While the regulation does not explicitly state a sunset date or expiration clause, such remissions are generally subject to periodic review and may be revised, extended, or terminated based on evolving medical needs, trade policy, or changes in the regulatory framework.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Dipropylacetic Acid (also known as 2-Propylpentanoic Acid) Remission Order* is a targeted, health-related exemption that waives customs duties on specific medical chemicals imported after January 1, 1976, for the treatment of epilepsy. It underscores the government’s role in balancing trade regulations with public health needs by allowing essential medicines to enter the country without the financial barrier of customs duties.

This order is an example of a **remission under the Customs Tariff** designed to serve a specific medical and humanitarian purpose.
