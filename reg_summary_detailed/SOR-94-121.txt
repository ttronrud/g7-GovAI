### **Detailed Summary of the St. Anthony Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Adoption**
These regulations are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports in Canada. The proposed regulations were first published in two successive issues of *The Canada Gazette, Part I* on **February 6 and 13, 1993**, and also in two successive issues of local publications — *The Northern Pen* (March 16 and 23, 1993) and *Le Gaboteur* (March 19 and 26, 1993). This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., landowners, aviation stakeholders, community groups) to submit representations or objections to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, the Governor in Council formally adopted the regulations on the recommendation of the Minister, effective as of the date of publication.

---

#### **2. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled:  
**"St. Anthony Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and serve as the legal framework governing land use and development around St. Anthony Airport.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the following key terms are defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **St. Anthony Airport**, located in the Electoral District of Strait of Belle Isle, Province of Newfoundland. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used for measuring distances and elevations. It is located at **22 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip (runway 11–29). These surfaces are designed to ensure safe aircraft approach paths by preventing obstructions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane set at **45 meters above the ARP**, except where this would result in a height less than 9 meters above ground — in which case, it is capped at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The central landing area of the airport, including the runway, measuring **300 meters in width** (150 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,340 meters in length**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes that extend from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally), until they intersect with the outer surface. |

---

#### **4. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of St. Anthony Airport**, including public road allowances, and specifically includes:

- All land within the **outer limit** (a circular boundary with a radius of 4,000 meters centered on the ARP); and  
- Any land directly beneath portions of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limit.

This means that development or land use within these zones is strictly governed by the height and use restrictions outlined below.

---

#### **5. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Development)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land **if the highest point of that structure exceeds**:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

This restriction ensures that aircraft approaching or departing the airport have unobstructed flight paths and clear visibility.

> 🔍 **Purpose**: Prevents visual or physical interference with aircraft operations, particularly during critical phases like landing and takeoff.

---

#### **6. Prohibition of Interference with Aeronautical Services**

No owner or lessee may:
- Use or develop any part of regulated land in a way that **interferes with signals, communications, or services** used by aircraft or aeronautical facilities (e.g., radar, navigation beacons, air traffic control).

> 🚨 **Examples of interference**: Installing antennas, large reflective surfaces, or structures that block radio signals or visual cues.

---

#### **7. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, bushes) on regulated land grows beyond the elevation of any of the following surfaces:
- Approach surfaces,
- Outer surface, or  
- Transitional surfaces,

Then the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or lessee to **remove the excessive growth**.

> ⚠️ This provision addresses risks posed by tall trees or dense vegetation that could interfere with aircraft visibility or create turbulence hazards.

---

#### **8. Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

No person may:
- Use any part of regulated land for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

> 🐦 **Rationale**: Bird attraction increases the risk of bird strikes — a major aviation hazard — which can lead to catastrophic accidents. This rule helps protect flight safety by eliminating food sources that attract birds to the airport area.

---

#### **9. Location of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)**

The ARP is precisely defined as follows:
- Begin at the **westerly end of runway 11**.
- Measure **610 meters along the centerline of runway 11–29**.
- From that point, turn **southerly at right angles** to the runway centerline for **150 meters**.
- The resulting point is the ARP.

**Coordinates**:  
North: 5,694,747.54 meters  
East: 298,969.50 meters  
**Elevation**: 22 meters above sea level.

> ✅ This point serves as the origin for all spatial and elevation measurements in the regulations.

---

#### **10. Description of Approach Surfaces**

Two approach surfaces are defined — one for each runway end (runway 11 and runway 29):

- **Runway 11 Approach Surface**:
  - Inclined plane rising at a **1:50 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 50 meters horizontal).
  - Extends **15,000 meters horizontally** from the end of the strip.
  - The outer ends of the horizontal line are **2,400 meters from the centerline**.
  - The top of the plane is **300 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

- **Runway 29 Approach Surface**:
  - Same slope (1:50), same horizontal distance (15,000 meters), same outer edge distance (2,400 meters from centerline).
  - Top of plane is **300 meters above the elevation at the end of the strip**.

> ✅ These surfaces provide safe zones for aircraft to descend without encountering obstacles.

---

#### **11. Outer Surface**

- A flat, imaginary plane located at **45 meters above the ARP** (22 m AGL → 67 m above sea level).
- However, if this elevation would place the outer surface **below 9 meters above ground**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground**.

> 📏 This ensures that even in low-lying areas, there is a minimum safe buffer zone to prevent obstructions.

---

#### **12. Strip Dimensions**

- The **strip associated with runway 11–29**:
  - **Length**: 1,340 meters
  - **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the centerline)

> ✅ This is the primary operational area of the airport where aircraft take off and land.

---

#### **13. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces**.
- Rise until they meet the **outer surface**.

> ✅ These surfaces create a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer surface, ensuring that no abrupt changes in terrain or height occur.

---

#### **14. Outer Limit**

- A **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the airport reference point (ARP).
- Defines the boundary of the zone where zoning rules apply.

> 🌍 This creates a buffer zone around the airport to minimize the risk of obstructions and interference with flight operations.

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Flight Safety** | Prevents obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting structure heights and controlling vegetation. |
| **Aeronautical Operations** | Ensures clear lines of sight and unimpeded radio/communication signals for air traffic control and navigation. |
| **Environmental Protection** | Reduces bird strike risks by prohibiting disposal of bird-attractive waste. |
| **Public and Private Land Use** | Applies to all land within 4 km of the airport, including public roads and private properties, enforcing consistent standards. |
| **Transparency and Public Participation** | Followed a formal publication and consultation process to allow stakeholders to voice concerns. |
