Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation you provided:

---

### **Regulation Summary: Transfer of Public Service Functions and Departmental Amalgamation**

#### **1. Legal Authority**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)** and **paragraph 2(b)** of the **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.  
- It is approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, indicating that this is a high-level, cabinet-level decision affecting the structure of federal government departments.

---

#### **2. Key Transfers of Control and Supervision (Under Paragraph 2(a))**

The following public service units are transferred **to the Department of Employment and Immigration** (DEI), with specific exclusions:

##### **A. From the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada**
- **Student Assistance Branch**  
  → Full transfer of control and supervision to DEI.

- **Office of the Assistant Under-Secretary of State (Social Development and Regional Operations)**  
  → Transfer **except** for:
  - The **translation and related services** portion (retained within the original department).
  - The **Native Citizens Directorate** (excluded from transfer).

- **Education Support Branch**  
  → Transfer **except** for:
  - The **Canadian Studies and Special Projects Directorate**.
  - The **Youth Participation Directorate**.

> *This means that while the core functions of education support are moved to DEI, certain specialized directorates focused on cultural studies and youth engagement are retained in the original department.*

##### **B. From the Department of National Health and Welfare (DNHW)**
- **Income Security Programs Branch**  
  → Transferred to DEI.

- **Social Service Programs Branch**  
  → Transferred to DEI, **except**:
  - The **New Horizons/Seniors Independence Programs** (retained in DNHW).

> *This reflects a strategic shift to consolidate social welfare and income support programs under a single department—DEI—while preserving certain senior-focused initiatives that may have unique administrative or programmatic needs.*

---

#### **3. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions (Under Paragraph 2(a))**

- The **Minister of Labour** is granted **all powers, duties, and functions** currently exercised by the Minister of Labour under any Act of Parliament.  
- This transfer is **not limited to specific programs**—it includes all legislative and administrative responsibilities previously held by the Minister of Labour.  
- This implies a **full functional integration** of Labour responsibilities into the new Department of Employment and Immigration, effectively making DEI the new home for Labour policy and administration.

> *This is a significant consolidation, as it merges labour-related policy (e.g., employment standards, workplace safety, occupational health) with employment and immigration functions under one ministerial umbrella.*

---

#### **4. Departmental Amalgamation (Under Paragraph 2(b))**

- Pursuant to paragraph 2(b) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, the following occurs:
  - The **Department of Employment and Immigration (DEI)** and the **Department of Labour** are **amalgamated**.
  - This amalgamation is carried out **under the authority of the Minister of Employment and Immigration**.
  - The **Deputy Minister of Employment and Immigration** will assume **supervisory and administrative leadership** over the combined department.

> *This creates a single, unified department—effectively replacing two separate departments with one—streamlining governance, reducing duplication, and improving coordination across employment, immigration, and labour policy.*

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Administrative Efficiency** | Consolidates overlapping functions (e.g., employment, income security, labour standards) under one department to reduce bureaucracy and improve coordination. |
| **Policy Integration** | Enables a more cohesive approach to employment, social support, and workforce development by unifying policy and implementation. |
| **Service Delivery** | Streamlined reporting lines and oversight may improve responsiveness and service quality for citizens. |
| **Structural Realignment** | Reflects a broader government strategy to reorganize public services for modernization and fiscal efficiency. |

### **Exclusions and Retained Functions**

The regulation explicitly **excludes** certain units and programs to preserve specialized functions or interdepartmental mandates:

- **Translation and related services** (in the Office of the Assistant Under-Secretary)  
- **Native Citizens Directorate** (social development focus, potentially tied to Indigenous rights)  
- **Canadian Studies and Special Projects Directorate** (cultural education)  
- **Youth Participation Directorate** (youth engagement)  
- **New Horizons/Seniors Independence Programs** (senior-focused social services)

> These exclusions suggest that certain culturally or historically sensitive functions are being preserved due to their unique nature or ongoing interdepartmental responsibilities.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **major reorganization** of federal public service structures. It:

- Transfers key social and employment-related branches from the Department of the Secretary of State and the Department of National Health and Welfare to the Department of Employment and Immigration.
- Transfers all Labour-related powers and duties to the new DEI Minister.
- Amalgamates the Department of Employment and Immigration with the Department of Labour into a single, unified department under the Minister of Employment and Immigration and his Deputy.

This move is designed to enhance administrative efficiency, improve policy coherence, and better serve Canadians through integrated employment, social security, and labour programs—while carefully preserving critical, specialized functions.

---

**Note:** This regulation reflects a shift toward centralized, cross-cutting governance in social policy, consistent with broader federal efforts to modernize public service delivery in the late 20th century (e.g., during the 1970s–1980s under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau or later reorganizations under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney). The specific details may vary depending on the historical context of the Act in question (e.g., 1977 or 1980 Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act).
