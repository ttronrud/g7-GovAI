**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: National Battlefields Park By-law**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This regulation is issued under the authority of the **National Battlefields at Quebec Act, 1914** (S.C. 1914, c. 46), specifically **Section 4**, which empowers the Governor General in Council to act on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**. The regulation confirms the **revocation** of the previous *National Battlefields Park By-law* (C.R.C., c. 1042) and the **adoption of a new by-law** in its place, which is now officially recognized as the **National Battlefields Park By-law**.

This by-law is legally binding and governs the use, access, and conduct of individuals within the National Battlefields Park.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Commission**: Refers to *The National Battlefields Commission*, the governing body responsible for managing and overseeing the park.
- **Park**: Denotes all lands owned by or under the jurisdiction, control, or care of the Commission. This includes both owned land and areas managed by the Commission.
- **Sports Field**: A specific designated area within the Park bounded by:
  - **North**: Grande Allée  
  - **West**: Avenue Montcalm  
  - **South**: Avenue George VI  
  - **East**: Avenue Wolfe-Montcalm  
  This area is explicitly designated for organized sports and recreational activities.

> *Note: Several provisions in the original by-law have been repealed*, notably sections related to the "Secretary" (SOR/2002-186, s. 1), pollution of water (s. 2), cycling and skating (s. 3), and animal waste (s. 6). These are now **inactive or deleted**, indicating that the current version reflects an updated or simplified regulation.

### **3. Prohibited Activities (Current Provisions)**

#### **(a) Damage to Property or Environment**
No person in the Park shall:
- Displace, deface, soil, pollute, or otherwise damage any property of the Commission.  
- Pollute water (including water in fountains), throw or deposit any object, bathe in any water, or allow any animal brought into the park to enter or be present in any water body.

> *Note: This provision has been repealed (SOR/2002-186, s. 2)*. Therefore, **this rule is no longer in effect** under the current by-law.

#### **(b) Use of Bicycles, Skateboards, and Similar Devices**
No person shall:
- Ride a bicycle, except on public roads or designated paths.
- Ride a skateboard, roller skates, in-line skates, roller skis, or any similar device, except on paths designated for such use or in areas specifically designated for such activity.
- Engage in any organized sport or game, except on the **sports field** or in other areas explicitly designated for such activities.

> *Note: This provision has been repealed (SOR/2002-186, s. 3)*. As such, **this restriction is no longer active** in the current version.

#### **(c) Animal Management and Waste**
Every person who brings an animal into the Park must:
- Keep it **restrained** by a leash **not exceeding 3 meters in length**, or
- Confine the animal in a **box, cage, or vehicle**.

If an animal defecates in the Park, the person must:
- **Collect the excrement** and
- **Deposit it in a waste receptacle**.

> *Note: This provision was previously repealed (SOR/2002-186, s. 6)*. However, the current version **retains this requirement**, suggesting a possible reinstatement or amendment despite prior repeal. This may indicate that the animal control rule was restored or is now a standalone provision.

### **4. Key Observations and Implications**

- **Significant Repeals**: The original by-law contained several provisions that have been formally repealed through **SOR/2002-186**, including:
  - Restrictions on water pollution and bathing (s. 2)
  - Cycling and skating rules (s. 3)
  - General conduct and animal waste (s. 6)

- **Current Scope**: The **current by-law is significantly more limited** in scope than the original. It appears to focus primarily on:
  - The **sports field** as a designated area for organized sports.
  - **Animal control** (leash requirements and waste collection), which may have been reinstated or retained as a core responsibility.

- **Possible Intent**: The repeals suggest a **reform or modernization** of the park’s management policy. The updated by-law may reflect a shift toward:
  - Greater flexibility in recreation (e.g., allowing more forms of physical activity).
  - A focus on public health, animal welfare, and environmental responsibility through targeted rules.

- **Jurisdictional Clarity**: The definition of the "Park" ensures that the Commission maintains control over all lands under its care, reinforcing its authority to enforce these rules.

---

### **5. Conclusion**

The **National Battlefields Park By-law** (as currently in force) is a **revised and simplified regulation** that:
- Replaces an older by-law.
- Retains only a few key provisions, primarily focused on **animal management** and the **designated use of the sports field**.
- Reflects a **modernization effort**, with the removal of outdated or overly restrictive rules (e.g., bans on cycling, water pollution).
- Emphasizes responsible visitor behavior, especially regarding **animal control and waste disposal**.

Despite the repeal of several sections, the current by-law maintains essential protections for the integrity of the park and the well-being of both visitors and the environment.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This summary is based on the provided text. Since several sections have been repealed, the actual enforcement of the by-law may be limited to only those clauses that remain in force. Visitors should consult the most current official sources or the Commission’s website for up-to-date rules and regulations.
