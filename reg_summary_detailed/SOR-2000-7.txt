The provided text consists of three identical entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2007-303, s. 44]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **Schedule 44 of the Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/2007-303)**, which was published on January 1, 2007.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**:  
  The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed, meaning it is no longer applicable or enforceable under Ontario law.

- **Repeal Authority**:  
  The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2007-303**, which is a statutory instrument (a type of regulatory document) issued by the Government of Ontario. This instrument is formally titled a "Regulation" and was published in the *Ontario Gazette* on January 1, 2007.

- **Section 44 of SOR/2007-303**:  
  Section 44 of this regulation specifically lists the provisions that are being repealed. The fact that the original regulation is cited three times under this section suggests that it was one of several provisions removed by that instrument—possibly a specific rule or directive previously governing a particular area of law (such as licensing, environmental standards, or workplace safety, depending on the original context).

- **Legal Implications**:  
  Since the regulation has been repealed, any legal obligations, requirements, or penalties previously established by it are no longer valid. Entities or individuals who were previously subject to it must now comply with the current, applicable legislation or regulations that have replaced it (if any).

- **Need for Context**:  
  The exact nature of the original regulation (e.g., what it governed—such as a permit requirement, safety standard, or reporting obligation) cannot be determined from this summary alone. To understand the full scope of what was repealed, one would need to refer to the original regulation before repeal or the accompanying explanatory notes in SOR/2007-303.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced is **officially repealed** and **no longer active**. It was removed by **Section 44 of SOR/2007-303**, which was enacted on January 1, 2007. This means that any prior legal obligations derived from it are nullified, and current legal compliance should be based on the current regulatory framework. For precise details about the original regulation’s subject matter, consultation of the full text of SOR/2007-303 or related legislative records is required.
