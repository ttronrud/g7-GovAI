**Detailed Summary of the *Goods for Emergency Use Remission Order***

---

**Order Title:**  
*Goods for Emergency Use Remission Order*

---

**Purpose of the Order:**  
This regulatory order establishes a legal mechanism to grant tax remission (exemption from payment) on certain goods that are temporarily imported into Canada for use during a declared emergency. The goal is to ensure the timely availability of essential goods during urgent, critical situations that exceed the capacity of provincial or municipal authorities to respond.

**Definition of "Emergency" (Section 1):**  
An "emergency" is defined as an urgent and critical situation of temporary nature that meets *all* of the following criteria:

1. **Scale or Nature:**  
   The emergency is of such magnitude or character that it exceeds the capacity or authority of a province or municipality to manage it.

2. **Cause:**  
   The emergency must be caused by one or more of the following:
   - Natural disasters: fire, flood, drought, storm, earthquake, or other natural phenomena  
   - Disease: in humans, animals, or plants  
   - Accidents or pollution  
   - Acts of sabotage or terrorism  

3. **Consequences:**  
   The emergency must result in, or pose a risk of causing:
   - Danger to the lives, health, or safety of individuals  
   - Danger to property  
   - Social disruption  
   - A breakdown in the flow of essential goods, services, or resources  

> *Note:* The definition is comprehensive and includes both immediate threats and systemic disruptions that could threaten public order or essential functions.

**Tax Remission Grant (Section 2):**  
Subject to the provisions of Section 3, the Order grants full remission (exemption) from all taxes under:
- **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which typically covers taxes on specific goods such as fuel, alcohol, tobacco, and certain manufactured products), and  
- **Any other part of the Excise Tax Act** that applies to the goods in question.

> This means that goods temporarily imported for emergency use are exempt from excise taxes, including duties, levies, or other related charges, even though they would normally be subject to such taxes.

---

**Conditions for Tax Remission:**  
- The goods must be **temporarily imported** into Canada.  
- They must be **required for the emergency** as defined above.  
- The remission applies only to goods that are **not consumed or destroyed** during the emergency.  

> Importantly, if goods are consumed or destroyed during the emergency, they are *not* eligible for remission, and the exemption does not apply to those instances.

---

**Post-Emergency Requirement (Section 3):**  
All goods that receive tax remission under this Order — **except those that have been consumed or destroyed during the emergency** — must be **exported from Canada** once they are no longer needed.

> This provision ensures that the temporary importation does not result in a permanent increase in inventory or tax liability. It promotes accountability and prevents the misuse of emergency provisions for long-term commercial gain.

**Key Implications and Objectives:**

1. **Emergency Preparedness and Response:**  
   Enables rapid importation of critical supplies (e.g., medical equipment, food, fuel, or water) during crises without being delayed by tax barriers.

2. **Public Safety and Health:**  
   Helps prevent loss of life, injury, or widespread harm by ensuring essential goods are available when needed most.

3. **Economic Stability:**  
   Prevents disruption in supply chains during emergencies, which could otherwise lead to shortages and social unrest.

4. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   The requirement to export unused goods ensures that the remission is used only for the intended emergency purpose and not for prolonged or speculative use.

5. **Compliance with Tax Law:**  
   The Order operates within the framework of the *Excise Tax Act*, ensuring that tax exemptions are temporary, narrowly defined, and subject to strict conditions.

---

**Limitations and Exclusions:**

- Remission does **not** apply to goods that are consumed or destroyed during the emergency.  
- The emergency must meet the full definition (cause, scale, consequences).  
- The exemption applies only to **temporary imports** — not permanent or long-term entries.  
- The Order does **not** extend to goods subject to other types of taxes (e.g., GST/HST) unless explicitly covered by the Excise Tax Act.  

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *Goods for Emergency Use Remission Order* is a targeted, emergency-based regulatory tool designed to support public safety and operational continuity during critical events. It allows temporary tax relief on essential goods imported for emergencies, while ensuring that unused goods are exported to maintain fiscal integrity and prevent abuse. The order reflects a balance between enabling rapid response and preserving the stability of Canada’s tax system.
