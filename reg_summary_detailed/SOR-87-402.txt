### 🔍 **1. Purpose and Background**
These regulations were introduced to **modernize and standardize the rules governing government procurement** in Canada. They establish a clear framework for how federal government contracting authorities enter into contracts for goods, services, and construction work — including procedures for bidding, security requirements, and ethical compliance.

The regulations are issued under the authority of the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically **subsection 34(1)**, which allows the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board) to amend or replace existing procurement rules.

> **Note**: The original version of these regulations was **repealed in 2019 (SOR/2019-199, s. 2)**, and this document represents the **current version** that was enacted in 1984 and remains in force as a replacement.

> 🔁 **Note**: The requirement to solicit bids has been **repealed in 2023 (SOR/2023-82, s.3)** — this indicates a potential shift toward more flexible procurement methods, though the current version still retains the requirement.

#### Exceptions to Bidding Requirement:
A contracting authority may enter into a contract **without soliciting bids** if one of the following applies:

|---------|------------|
| **Pressing Emergency** | Delay would be injurious to public interest |

| **Nature of Work** | Would not be in the public interest to solicit bids |
| **Only One Supplier Capable** | No alternative supplier exists |

> 💡 These thresholds reflect a balance between transparency and operational necessity.
