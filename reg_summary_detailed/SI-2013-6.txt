**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (South Slave Region) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of transfer)** in order to **facilitate the negotiation and conclusion of Aboriginal land agreements**.

These land agreements are typically negotiated between the Government of the Northwest Territories and Aboriginal peoples (including Métis, First Nations, and other Indigenous communities) to ensure that land rights are recognized, respected, and protected in a fair and culturally appropriate manner.

---

### **Scope of the Withdrawal**

- The Order withdraws **certain tracts of territorial land**, including both:
  - **Surface rights** (rights to use the land above ground)
  - **Subsurface rights** (rights to minerals, oil, gas, or other resources beneath the surface)

- The withdrawal applies to the **entire parcel**, meaning no part of the land can be disposed of (sold, leased, or otherwise transferred) during the specified period.

- **Duration of Withdrawal:**  
  The withdrawal is effective from the **day the Order is made** until **November 30, 2014**.

### **Exclusions – When Section 2 Does Not Apply**

Although the general rule is that the land is withdrawn from disposal, **Section 2 of the Order (which would normally apply to land disposal)** does **not apply** in the following specific circumstances:

1. **Mineral Prospecting Permits**  
   - A person who holds a prospecting permit **granted before the Order came into force** may locate a mineral claim.

2. **Recording of Mineral Claims**  
   - A mineral claim that was **already located or referred to in paragraph (a)** or was **located before the Order came into force** may be recorded.

3. **Grants of Leases under Mining Regulations**  
   - A lease under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* may be granted to a person with a **recorded claim**, provided the lease covers an area within that claim — **even if the land is otherwise withdrawn**.

4. **Significant Discovery Licences (under Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - A significant discovery licence may be issued to a holder of an exploration licence that was issued **before the Order came into force**, **if** the licence covers an area subject to the exploration licence.

5. **Production Licences (under Canada Petroleum Resources Act)**  
   - A production licence may be issued to a holder of a significant discovery licence (as above) or to a holder of an exploration or significant discovery licence issued **before the Order came into force**, **if** the production licence covers land subject to the prior licence.

6. **Surface Leases for Claim Holders**  
   - A surface lease may be issued to a holder of a recorded claim (under mining regulations) or to a person with an interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act*, **if** the lease is required to allow the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest.

7. **Renewal of Interests**  
   - Renewals of existing mineral or surface interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) are **exempt** from the withdrawal.

> These exclusions ensure that **existing mineral exploration and development activities are not disrupted** by the withdrawal, particularly where such activities were already underway or legally established prior to the Order.

### **Geographic Scope – Land Designation**

The withdrawn lands are specifically identified as **Surface-Subsurface Lands** on **reference maps** developed by the **Land Working Group**.

The Land Working Group consists of representatives from:
- The **Northwest Territory Métis Nation**
- The **Government of the Northwest Territories**
- The **Government of Canada**

These maps are **1:250,000 scale reference maps** that identify specific parcels of land in and around the community of **Fort Resolution**.

#### Key Map Details:
- The Order references **five maps** that identify parcels in and around **Fort Resolution**.
- These maps are **officially recommended** by the Land Working Group and have been **deposited with the Regional Manager, Land Administration, in Yellowknife**, ensuring transparency and access to the documentation.

> This geographic focus indicates that the withdrawal is targeted at areas of significant Indigenous interest and potential for land agreements, particularly in the Fort Resolution region — a community with strong Métis presence and land claims history.

---

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

- This Order reflects a **government commitment to Indigenous land rights** and **Aboriginal self-determination**.
- By withdrawing land from disposal, the government ensures that land negotiations can proceed without interference from potential land sales or leasing.
- It supports the **implementation of land claims agreements** and promotes **meaningful consultation** with Indigenous communities.
- The inclusion of both surface and subsurface rights underscores that the withdrawal is comprehensive and protects Indigenous interests in both traditional use and resource development.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, time-limited measure** designed to support the negotiation of Aboriginal land agreements in the South Slave Region of the Northwest Territories. It withdraws specific parcels of land (including surface and subsurface rights) from disposal until **November 30, 2014**, with key exemptions to preserve existing mineral rights and ongoing exploration or development activities. The land is specifically identified on five reference maps around **Fort Resolution**, developed through a collaborative process involving Indigenous representatives and government bodies.

This Order demonstrates a balance between protecting Indigenous land rights and maintaining the legal framework for mineral exploration and development that existed prior to the withdrawal period.

**Note:**  
The Order is now **expired** (as the withdrawal period ended on November 30, 2014), and any future land disposals in these areas would require new regulatory action unless otherwise extended or modified.
