### **Detailed Summary of the Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Cost Recovery Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are established under **subsection 150(1)** of the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act* (the "Act"), which authorizes the publication of proposed regulations and provides for public consultation. A draft version of the *Offshore Petroleum Cost Recovery Regulations* was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **July 11, 2015**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written representations to the **Minister of Natural Resources**.

The regulations were developed in consultation with the **Provincial Minister of Newfoundland and Labrador**, and upon approval of that consultation, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Natural Resources, enacted the regulations under **section 29.1c** of the Act. This legislative process ensures that the regulations reflect both federal oversight and provincial input, particularly in matters involving offshore petroleum operations.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to establish a **transparent, equitable, and cost-recovery mechanism** for the **Offshore Petroleum Regulatory Board (the "Board")** to recover the actual costs associated with its regulatory activities in relation to petroleum projects in Newfoundland and Labrador.

This includes:
- Direct regulatory activities (e.g., assessing applications, issuing licenses)
- Indirect regulatory costs (e.g., office operations, staffing, IT, training)
- Ensuring accountability and financial sustainability of the Board

The system is designed to ensure that operators bear the cost of regulatory oversight, while also allowing for adjustments based on actual performance and compliance.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada–Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic Accord Implementation Act*. |
| **Actual Full Cost** | The full cost confirmed by the Board’s audited financial statements. This is the true cost incurred in a given fiscal year. |
| **Direct Regulatory Activities** | Activities required for the Board to fulfill its regulatory duties, such as reviewing applications, issuing approvals, enforcing compliance, and providing information. |
| **Indirect Regulatory Costs** | Support costs that enable direct activities, including office space, supplies, professional services, communications, travel, human resources, IT, training, and policy development. |
| **Project** | Any work or activity defined under paragraph 138(1)(b) of the Act — including development, production, abandonment, exploratory drilling, or multi-year/seismic programs. |

#### **4. Regulatory Activity Plan and Annual Charge Calculation**

##### **For New Projects**
When an applicant submits a **project description or letter of intent**, the Board must:
1. **Prepare a Regulatory Activity Plan (RAP)** outlining the scope and timeline of regulatory activities.
2. **Calculate the Estimated Annual Charge** based on:
   - The estimated total number of **units of time** required for direct regulatory activities in that fiscal year.
   - Any other direct and indirect costs (excluding those calculated via alternative cost recovery methods).
3. **Notify the applicant in writing** of the RAP and the estimated annual charge.

> *Note:* The units of time are defined as "base units" or "variable units" depending on the nature of the activity.

##### **For Existing Projects**
After the Board submits its annual budget (in accordance with subsection 27(2) of the Act), the Board must:
1. Prepare a **new regulatory activity plan**.
2. Recalculate the estimated annual charge using the same methodology as above.
3. Notify the applicant in writing of the updated plan and charge.

> *This ensures that annual charges are updated to reflect changes in workload or project scope.*

##### **Changes to Project Scope**
If an applicant or operator proposes changes to the project that are not reflected in the original regulatory activity plan, the Board may:
- Recalculate the estimated annual charge.
- Adjust the payable amount accordingly.

> This provides flexibility to accommodate changes in project plans without undermining the cost recovery framework.

---

#### **5. Quarterly Invoicing and Payment**

- The Board issues a **quarterly invoice** equal to **25% of the estimated annual charge** to each applicant or operator who has been notified under paragraph 2(c) or 3(c).
- The applicant or operator must **pay the invoice within 30 days** of receipt.

> This phased payment structure ensures steady revenue flow to the Board while allowing time for final cost reconciliation.

---

#### **6. Annual Cost Adjustment and Final Settlement**

At the end of each fiscal year, the Board must:
1. **Calculate the Actual Full Cost** of implementing the regulatory activity plan.
2. **Determine the Charge Adjustment**:
   - If **actual full cost < estimated annual charge**:  
     → The difference is **credited to the applicant/operator’s account** and **refunded on the next invoice**.
   - If **actual full cost > estimated annual charge**:  
     → The Board issues an invoice for the difference, and the applicant/operator must pay it **within 30 days**.

> This mechanism ensures that operators are not overcharged and that the Board is fairly compensated for actual expenses.

---

#### **7. Units of Time and Cost Recovery Mechanisms**

##### **Base Units of Time**
- Published by the Board under **section 8**.
- Based on estimated time required to perform direct regulatory activities for specific tasks listed in the tables to section 9.
- Used as a baseline for calculating fees.

##### **Variable Units of Time**
- Published under section 8.
- Reflects additional time needed for variable factors (e.g., complexity, number of vessels or aircraft).
- Applied when the scale or scope of activity increases.

##### **Effective Rate**
- Calculated as:
  $$
  \text{Effective Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Direct Regulatory Costs + Indirect Regulatory Costs} - \text{Non-recovered Costs}}{\text{Total Units of Time Spent}}
  $$
- Non-recovered costs include those incurred when the Board performs activities at the request of the Federal or Provincial Minister and are not subject to cost recovery.

> The effective rate is a key component in determining fees and is updated annually.

##### **Heavy Burden Coefficient**
- A multiplier applied when the Board determines that an applicant or operator has:
  - Failed to comply with the Act,
  - Demonstrated negligence, or
  - Failed to respond adequately to Board questions during the application process.
- Increases the fee to reflect the **additional time and effort** required due to non-compliance or lack of diligence.
- Applied only when justified and documented.

> This serves as a deterrent against poor compliance and ensures accountability.

#### **8. Fee Determination Formulae**

Fees are calculated using the following formulas:

| Activity Type | Formula |
|-------------|--------|
| **Standard Activities** | Fee = (Base Units of Time) × (Effective Rate) |
| **Activities with Heavy Burden** | Fee = (Base Units of Time) × (Effective Rate) × (Heavy Burden Coefficient) |
| **Activities involving Vessels/Aircraft** | Fee = (Variable Units of Time × Number of Primary Vessels/Aircraft) × (Effective Rate) × (Heavy Burden Coefficient, if applicable) |

> These formulas ensure fees are proportional to workload and complexity.

#### **9. Daily Access Rate for Geodata Centre**

- Any person **other than**:
  - An academic researcher,
  - The Federal Minister,
  - The Provincial Minister
- Who accesses a **physical sample** at the Board’s geodata centre must pay a **daily access rate**.
- The rate is established and published by the Board via electronic or other means.

> This ensures fair access and recovers operational costs related to physical data access.

---

#### **10. Reimbursement for Non-Standard Activities**

The Board may require full reimbursement for costs related to activities not covered in Parts 1–3, including:

1. **Travel for compliance verification** to another location.
2. **Oil and Gas Committee meetings**.
3. **Technical analysis or process reviews** requested by an applicant/operator.
4. **Public reviews, hearings, or inquiries** related to a specific project.
5. **Participant funding programs** under the *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012*.
6. **Information, products, or services** requested by a person.

> These provisions allow the Board to cover necessary but non-standard operational expenses.

---

#### **11. Interest on Delinquent Payments**

- Interest is charged on overdue amounts at a rate of **1.5% per month**, compounded monthly.
- Interest begins accruing from the **due date** and continues until the payment is received.
- This encourages timely payment and provides financial incentive for compliance.

---

#### **12. Remittance of Fees**

- Fees and charges collected under these regulations must be **remitted quarterly** to the Government of Canada.
- Remittance is subject to the Board’s operational requirements, ensuring that funds are available for regulatory functions.

> This ensures transparency and accountability in financial flows.

---

#### **13. Exemptions and Special Provisions**

##### **Exemption for Projects Paying Full Estimated Costs**
- **Section 3 does not apply** to a project if the applicant or operator has paid **100% of the Board’s estimated costs** for the fiscal year in which the regulations come into force.

> This provides a one-time exemption for projects that fully fund the Board’s initial estimates.

##### **Existing Projects Without a Regulatory Activity Plan**
- All existing projects (before the regulations came into force) that are under the Board’s regulatory authority and **do not have a regulatory activity plan** are considered to have been **previously under
