Certainly. Below is a **detailed, clear, and comprehensive summary** of the provided regulation — the **Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation Band Order** — as issued under the *Indian Act*.

## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation Band Order**

### 🔹 **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
This regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, pursuant to two specific provisions of the *Indian Act*:

- **Paragraph (c) of the definition of "band" in subsection 2(1)** of the *Indian Act*, which allows for the recognition of a band based on ancestry and residency.
- **Subsection 73(3)** of the *Indian Act*, which authorizes the creation of new bands or the expansion of existing ones when there is a need to recognize a group of persons as a distinct band for the purposes of the Act.

The purpose of this Order is to **formally establish the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation as a recognized band under the Indian Act**, thereby granting it legal status and rights under federal law.

---

### 🔹 **2. Definition of "Adoption"**
The Order explicitly states that **"adoption includes adoption in accordance with Innu custom"**.  
This is significant because it recognizes and respects traditional Innu practices of adoption, which may differ from formal legal adoption under Canadian law. It ensures that cultural and customary forms of family formation are acknowledged and protected within the band’s structure.

---

### 🔹 **3. Recognition of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation as a Band**
The body of individuals described in **Section 3 of the Indian Act** is declared to be a **band** for all purposes of the *Indian Act*.  
This band is officially named:  
> **The Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation**

This formal recognition gives the community access to federal programs, services, land rights, treaty-related benefits, and other rights and protections afforded to Indigenous bands under Canadian law.

---

### 🔹 **4. Who Belongs to the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation?**

The membership of the band is defined by the following criteria:

#### ✅ **(1) Persons Identified in Schedule 1**
- All individuals listed in **Schedule 1** (which is not publicly accessible online) are automatically included in the band.
- These are typically individuals who were previously registered or identified as members of the community and are recognized through historical or administrative records.

#### ✅ **(2) Persons of Canadian Innu Ancestry (with specific residency and absence conditions)**
Every other person of **Canadian Innu ancestry** who, on **November 19, 2002**, met **one or more** of the following conditions is also included:

##### ➤ Condition A: Ordinary Resident (No Absence)
- Was **not registered** in the Indian Register on November 19, 2002.
- Was **ordinarily resident** in **Sheshatshiu** (as defined in Schedule 2) on that date.
- Had been **absent for no more than 12 months** and was **ordinarily resident before that absence**.

> This provision allows for individuals who temporarily left the community (e.g., for work, education, or personal reasons) to be included if their absence was short and they had a continuous connection to the community.

##### ➤ Condition B: Absent for More Than 12 Months (for specific, legitimate reasons)
- Was absent from Sheshatshiu for **more than 12 months** due to:
  - Education
  - Employment
  - Incarceration
  - Health reasons (including medical treatments)
- But was **ordinarily resident** in Sheshatshiu **before** the absence.

> This recognizes that people may move away for valid, long-term reasons (like university studies or hospitalization) and still maintain their connection to the community.

##### ➤ Condition C: Absent Due to Adoption or Foster Care
- Was **adopted or placed into foster care** or a similar arrangement.
- At the time of adoption or placement:
  - The individual **or their parents** were **ordinarily resident** in Sheshatshiu.

> This ensures that children adopted within the community or placed in care systems are not excluded from membership, as long as the original family connection to Sheshatshiu existed.

##### ➤ Condition D: Blood or Family Relationship
- Is, by **birth or adoption**, a **relative** of someone who qualifies under any of the above conditions.
- The listed relatives include:
  - Parent, grandparent, great-grandparent
  - Child, grandchild, great-grandchild
  - Brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister
  - Aunt, uncle
  - Niece, nephew
  - First cousin

> This expands membership to include extended family members, ensuring that family ties are preserved and respected under the band’s structure.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This rule is crucial in maintaining cultural continuity and intergenerational belonging within the Innu community.

---

### 🔹 **5. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate federal office (e.g., the Department of Justice or the Registrar of the Indian Register).

This means the new band structure and membership criteria become legally effective immediately upon official registration.

---

### 🔹 **6. Land Designation**
The Order designates a specific parcel of land as belonging to the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation. This land is located in:

- **Electoral District of Lake Melville**
- **Province of Newfoundland and Labrador**

#### 📍 Precise Legal Description (from a survey plan):
The land is described in a detailed **bearing and distance format** based on a certified survey plan prepared by **Neil E. Parrott, CLS, NLS** on **March 31, 2000**.

This plan is recorded in the **Atlantic Office of Natural Resources Canada, Legal Surveys Division** as **Plan No. 2001-002 RSAtl**.

The description begins at a point on the **Ordinary High Water Mark of Little Lake**, which separates the villages of **North West River** and **Sheshatshiu**, and proceeds through a series of bearings and distances to return to the starting point.

> This land description is essential for legal, administrative, and land-use purposes, including:
> - Land claims
> - Resource development
> - Housing and infrastructure
> - Environmental protection
> - Cultural and spiritual significance

---

### 🔹 **7. Access to the Schedule**
The **Schedule to this Order** (which contains the full list of individuals in Schedule 1 and the precise geographic description of Sheshatshiu) is **no longer available online**.

If access is needed:
- Individuals or organizations should contact the **Justice Access to Information and Privacy Office** (Canada) to request a copy under the **Access to Information Act**.

> This highlights a common challenge in Indigenous governance: the lack of public transparency around membership lists and land records, which can hinder community access and accountability.

### 🔹 **8. Significance and Implications**

| Aspect | Importance |
|-------|------------|
| **Cultural Recognition** | Validates Innu traditions, including customary adoption and family ties. |

### 🔹 **Key Notes and Considerations**
- The Order reflects a **renewed commitment to reconciliation** and **Indigenous self-determination**.
- It acknowledges the **historical marginalization** of Innu people, especially those who were not formally registered or who moved away due to external pressures.
- The inclusion of **customary adoption** is a major step toward recognizing Indigenous family structures.
- The **geographic specificity** of the land parcel helps protect the community’s cultural and physical space.
- The **absence of public access to the Schedule** raises concerns about transparency and community empowerment — a point that should be addressed through future policy reforms.
