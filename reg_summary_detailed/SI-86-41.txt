**Detailed Summary of the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff Remission Order**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Purpose**

The *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff Remission Order* (cited as **S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4**) is a statutory instrument made under **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. It was enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, with the primary objective of **promoting diplomatic and consular relations** between Canada and the United States.

This Order grants **remission (exemption)** from certain **customs duties and sales and excise taxes** on goods imported by members of the **United States diplomatic and consular administrative and technical staff** who are stationed in Canada. The remission applies specifically to goods imported for **personal use** or for the **use of their families**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Importer**: A member of the United States diplomatic, consular, administrative, or technical staff stationed in Canada who imports one or more articles into Canada.

---

### **Scope of Remission (Exemption)**

Under **Section 3**, the following taxes and duties are **remitted (exempted)**:

- **Customs duties** under the *Customs Tariff*;
- **Taxes** under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which typically covers taxes on goods such as tobacco, alcohol, and certain luxury items);
- **Any other taxes** imposed under other parts of the *Excise Tax Act* that apply to the imported articles.

> This means that eligible staff members are **not required to pay** these taxes when importing goods for personal or family use.

---

### **Conditions for Remission to Apply**

Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to **three strict conditions**:

1. **Date of Importation**  
   The article must have been imported **on or after September 1, 1985**.  
   → This establishes a minimum date for eligibility, ensuring the policy applies to imports made after a defined threshold.

2. **Approval of Application under Diplomatic Privileges Regulations**  
   The importer must have submitted an **appropriate application** under **Section 5 or 6 of the Customs Diplomatic Privileges Regulations**.  
   → This application must be **approved by or in the name of the Ambassador of the United States to Canada**.  
   → This ensures that the exemption is granted only after formal diplomatic authorization and verification of the staff member’s status.

3. **Timely Claim to the Minister of National Revenue**  
   The importer must **submit a claim for remission** to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date the article was imported into Canada.  
   → Failure to file the claim within this timeframe results in the **loss of the exemption**.

### **Exemption on Disposition (Sale or Transfer) of Goods**

Even after the goods are imported, the exemption extends to the **disposition (sale, transfer, or disposal)** of the goods under specific conditions:

#### **(a) Non-Motor Vehicles**
- If an article (other than a motor vehicle) is imported and remitted under Section 3, **no customs duties or excise taxes are payable** upon its **disposition** (e.g., resale or transfer), **provided**:
  - The article was **in the possession and used by the importer in Canada** for **at least one full year** following importation.

> This allows staff members to sell or transfer non-vehicle items without incurring tax liabilities, as long as they used the item for at least one year in Canada.

#### **(b) Motor Vehicles**
- For **motor vehicles** imported under this Order:
  - No customs duties or excise taxes are payable upon disposition **if**:
    - The vehicle was **in the possession and used by the importer in Canada** for **at least two years** following importation.

> This two-year requirement is more stringent than the one-year rule for non-vehicles, reflecting the higher value and tax implications of motor vehicles.

#### **Exception for Death or Transfer Before Two-Year Period**
- If the **importer dies** or is **transferred from Canada before the two-year period ends**, the exemption on disposition of the motor vehicle **still applies**.  
  → This provision ensures that the exemption is preserved even in cases of sudden personal or professional changes.

### **Key Implications and Practical Effects**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Diplomatic Status Requirement** | Only members of U.S. diplomatic and consular staff (administrative/technical) qualify. General citizens or foreign nationals are not covered. |
| **Time Limit for Claim** | Importers must act promptly—claims must be filed within **2 years** of importation. Delaying the claim voids the exemption. |
| **Application Process** | Requires formal approval by the U.S. Ambassador, ensuring oversight and accountability. |
| **Post-Import Use Requirement** | Goods must be used in Canada for a minimum period (1 year for non-vehicles, 2 years for vehicles) to qualify for tax-free disposition. |
| **Tax-Free Disposition** | Staff can sell or transfer exempted goods without triggering tax liability, promoting flexibility in personal or family needs. |

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- The Order is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to make regulations to implement fiscal and administrative policies, including tax exemptions.
- It operates in conjunction with the **Customs Diplomatic Privileges Regulations**, which govern the formal procedures for granting diplomatic exemptions.

---

### **Policy Rationale**

The Order serves several key public interest objectives:

1. **Support for Diplomatic Relations**: Facilitates the well-being and operational effectiveness of U.S. diplomatic and consular personnel in Canada.
2. **Fairness and Equity**: Provides a consistent, transparent, and legally grounded mechanism for tax relief for staff members in a unique diplomatic context.
3. **Administrative Efficiency**: Streamlines the process of importing personal goods by establishing clear eligibility criteria and procedures.
4. **Revenue Protection**: Limits tax exemptions to specific, well-defined circumstances, preventing abuse or broad tax avoidance.

### **Conclusion**

The *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff Remission Order* provides a **structured, time-bound, and conditionally granted exemption** from customs duties and excise taxes for eligible U.S. diplomatic and consular staff in Canada. It balances **diplomatic needs** with **fiscal responsibility**, ensuring that tax relief is both meaningful and properly regulated.

Importers must meet strict criteria—**import date, formal application, ambassadorial approval, and timely claim filing**—and must demonstrate **actual use of the goods in Canada** over a defined period (one or two years) to maintain the exemption upon disposition. The Order remains a key tool in Canada’s framework for managing international diplomatic privileges and tax exemptions.

**Note**: This Order is not a blanket exemption. It applies only to specific categories of goods and staff, and only under strict conditions. It is also subject to periodic review and potential amendment in light of changing diplomatic practices or fiscal policy.
