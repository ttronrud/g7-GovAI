### **1. Background and Authority**
This regulation, known as the *Quebec Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order*, was issued by **Les Éleveurs de porcs du Québec** (formerly the *Fédération des producteurs de porc du Québec*), under the authority of **Sections 3 and 4 of the Quebec Hog Marketing Order**.  

The purpose of the Order is to establish a system of **mandatory levies** that producers must pay when hogs, sows, or boars are sold or marketed **outside of Quebec** (i.e., interprovincially or for export). These levies are intended to support the stability and sustainability of the pork industry in Quebec by funding marketing, research, and market development initiatives.

### **2. Definitions**

- **Producer**:  
  A person engaged in the **production of hogs, sows, or boars** within the province of Quebec. This includes individuals or entities directly involved in raising and managing swine for commercial purposes.

- **Sow or Boar (produced in Quebec)**:  
  Refers specifically to **sows or boars that are bred or born in Quebec**. This ensures that only animals originating from the province are subject to the levy, reinforcing regional accountability and traceability.

### **3. Levy Structure**

Every producer must pay two types of levies based on the type and weight of the animal:

#### **A. Levy on Hogs (by weight)**
- Applies to **each hog** with a **net weight of at least 65 kg**.
- The levy is calculated as:
  - **$0.0123 per kilogram** of the **hot carcass weight**.
- The **hot carcass weight** is defined in the *Règlement sur la production et la mise en marché des porcs* (Regulation on Pork Production and Marketing), specifically **Section 281 of RLRQ, c. M-35.1**.
  - This refers to the weight of the pig’s carcass immediately after slaughter, before any trimming or processing, and is a standard metric used in the industry to determine market value.

> *Example*:  
> A 100 kg hog would incur a levy of:  
> 100 kg × $0.0123 = **$12.30**

#### **B. Levy on Sows and Boars**
- Applies to **each sow or boar** produced in Quebec.
- A **flat rate of $8.97** per animal, regardless of weight or market value.
- This levy is intended to cover the costs associated with breeding stock, genetic improvement, and reproductive health programs.

> *Note*: The levy applies to **every sow or boar** sold or marketed outside Quebec, whether live or as breeding stock.

---

### **4. Payment and Remittance Requirements**

- Producers must **remit the levies** to the **Commodity Board of Quebec**.
- Payments are due **on or before the 15th day of each month**.
- The levies are calculated based on sales or marketings that occurred during the **preceding month**.

> *Example*:  
> If a producer sells hogs and sows in January, the levy payment must be submitted by **February 15**.

This ensures timely collection and financial planning for the Commodity Board, which uses the funds for industry-wide initiatives such as market development, price stabilization, and research.

---

### **5. Repeal and Replacement**

- This specific Order (SOR/79-727) is **repealed** by **SOR/94-549**, which indicates that it has been replaced by a newer, updated regulation.
- The repeal suggests that the current levy structure may have been revised to reflect changes in market dynamics, industry needs, or regulatory policy.

> *Note*: The original Order (SOR/79-727) was issued in 1979 and remained in effect until 1994, when it was superseded by a revised version. The 2018 reference may reflect a reissue or clarification of the original provisions in modern legal form.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the *Statutes of Quebec* (SOR).
- Registration occurred on **February 19, 2018**, meaning the levy requirements became effective on that date.

### **Key Implications and Purpose**

| Aspect | Significance |

| **Revenue for Industry Support** | Funds are directed to the Commodity Board to support marketing, research, and infrastructure for Quebec’s pork sector. |

| **Regional Focus** | Only animals produced in Quebec are subject to levies, protecting the interests of local producers. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Quebec Hog Marketing Levies (Interprovincial and Export Trade) Order* establishes a transparent, measurable, and equitable system for producers to contribute to the economic and developmental health of Quebec’s pork industry. By charging a weight-based levy on hogs (minimum 65 kg) and a flat fee on sows and boars, the regulation ensures that both large and small producers contribute fairly based on their output. The requirement for monthly remittance ensures financial accountability and timely funding for industry-wide initiatives.

Although this specific Order was originally issued in 1979 and repealed in 1994, its provisions have been **reinstated or clarified in 2018** under updated legal form, indicating ongoing relevance and adaptation to modern agricultural and trade practices.

> **Note**: As this Order has been **repealed by SOR/94-549**, it is likely that the current levy structure is now governed by a different, more recent regulation. Producers should consult the most current version of the Quebec Hog Marketing Order or the Commodity Board for up-to-date requirements.
