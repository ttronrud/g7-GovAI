## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Grade Crossings Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Authority and Purpose**
The regulations are made under the **Railway Safety Act** by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, pursuant to several specific statutory provisions:

- Section 7.1b
- Subsections 18(1)c and (2)d
- Paragraph 23.1(1)(a)e
- Subsection 24(1)f
- Sections 37g and 47 of the *Railway Safety Act*

**Purpose**:  
To ensure the **safety of road and rail users** at grade crossings by establishing standardized design, signage, sightlines, warning systems, and traffic control measures. These regulations apply to both **public and private grade crossings**, with tailored responsibilities based on the type of crossing and its operational characteristics.

## 🔍 Key Definitions (Core Terms)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Grade Crossing** | A road crossing at grade (same level) with railway tracks, or multiple road crossings where railway lines are within 30 meters of each other. |
| **Public Grade Crossing** | A crossing where the road is opened or maintained by a **road authority** and is designed for public use. |
| **Private Grade Crossing** | A crossing not operated or maintained by a public road authority. May be owned or managed by a private entity (e.g., a company or property owner). |
| **Existing Grade Crossing** | A crossing where actual construction began **before November 28, 2014**. |
| **New Grade Crossing** | A crossing where construction begins **on or after November 28, 2014**. |
| **Average Annual Daily Railway Movements (AADRM)** | Total railway movements per year divided by 365 days. Measures rail traffic volume. |
| **Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)** | Total motor vehicle crossings per year divided by 365 days. Measures road traffic volume. |
| **Cross-Product** | Product of AADRM × AADT. Used to assess risk and determine required safety measures. |
| **Design Vehicle** | A standardized vehicle (from the *Geometric Design Guide for Canadian Roads*, 1999) used to determine road and crossing design parameters. |
| **Railway Design Speed** | Speed at which railway equipment is designed to operate (e.g., 97 km/h for passenger trains). |
| **Road Crossing Design Speed** | Speed at which motor vehicles are expected to travel across the crossing (based on road design). |
| **Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)** | Distance a driver needs to see ahead to stop safely, calculated per Grade Crossings Standards. |
| **Storage Distance (D)** | Shortest distance between the nearest rail and the edge of the intersecting road, measured along the centerline. |
| **Sightlines** | Visibility lines required for drivers to see approaching trains and warning signs. Must remain unobstructed. |
| **Traffic Control Devices** | Signs and systems including: Stop sign, Stop Ahead sign, Railway Crossing Ahead sign, Advisory Speed Tab, Prepare to Stop sign, and interconnected traffic signals. |
| **Warning System** | Automated system (not an interconnected signal) that alerts road users to approaching trains via lights, bells, gates, or mechanisms. |

> **Note**: Two adjacent roads crossing the same railway lines are treated as **separate grade crossings**.

## 🚧 Applicability and Exemptions

### ✅ **Applies To**:
- All **public grade crossings**
- All **private grade crossings**, **except** those falling under specific exemptions.

### ❌ **Exemptions (Where Regulations Do Not Apply)**

These exemptions apply **only** if **all** the following conditions are met:

#### 1. **Public Grade Crossing Exemption**
Applies when:
- AADRM < 3
- Railway design speed ≤ 17 km/h (10 mph)
- Crosses ≤ 1 track
- Storage distance ≥ 30 m (unless access is exclusively for pedestrians/non-motor vehicles)
- Whistling is required/allowed
- Cross-product < 2,000

#### 2. **Private Grade Crossing Exemption (Low Traffic)**
Applies when:
- Railway design speed ≤ 17 km/h (10 mph)
- Crosses ≤ 2 tracks
- Cross-product < 100

#### 3. **Private Grade Crossing Exemption (Freight & Passenger Speeds)**
Applies when:
- Freight train speed ≤ 41 km/h (25 mph)
- Passenger train speed ≤ 49 km/h (30 mph)
- Crosses ≤ 1 track
- Storage distance ≥ 30 m (unless pedestrian-only access)
- Cross-product < 100
- **No sidewalk** exists

#### 4. **Zero Traffic Exemption**
- If AADRM = 0 (no trains pass through the crossing)

> ⚠️ **Important**: These exemptions are **not automatic**. They must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the road/rail authority must still comply with relevant safety standards unless explicitly exempted.

## 🏗️ Responsibilities: Public vs. Private Crossings

### 🔹 **Public Grade Crossing**

| Responsibility | Responsible Party |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Railway Company** | Must ensure: |
| - Railway Crossing sign, Number of Tracks sign, Emergency Notification sign | ✅ |
| - Maintenance of Stop sign on same post as Railway Crossing sign | ✅ |
| - Operation and maintenance of warning system | ✅ |
| - Maintenance of crossing surface (except design) | ✅ |
| - Sightlines within railway right-of-way and adjacent land (including removal of trees/brush) | ✅ |

| **Road Authority** | Must ensure: |
| - Design, construction, and maintenance of road approach | ✅ |
| - Traffic control devices (excluding Stop sign on shared post) | ✅ |
| - Design of crossing surface | ✅ |
| - Sightlines on land where road is located (including removal of obstructions) | ✅ |

> 📌 **Notice Requirement**:  
> Upon receiving a notice under **Section 3 of the Notice of Railway Works Regulations**, the railway company must provide the road authority with the following information within **60 days** (or earlier if a change occurs):

- Precise location of the crossing  
- Number of tracks  
- AADRM  
- Railway design speed  
- Warning system in place  
- Whether a Stop sign is on the same post as the Railway Crossing sign  
- Whether whistling is required  

> ⏳ **Deadline for Existing Crossings**:  
> If no notice has been received within 2 years of **November 28, 2014**, the information must be provided **by the day two years after that date**.

> 🔁 **Change Notification**:  
> If there’s a change in any of the above parameters (e.g., increased traffic, speed change), the railway company must notify the road authority **60 days before the change takes effect**.

> 🚨 **Speed Increase Notification**:  
> If the railway design speed increases, the railway company must notify the road authority **60 days before the increase takes effect**, including precise location and new speed.
