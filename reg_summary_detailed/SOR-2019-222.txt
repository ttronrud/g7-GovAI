**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations Specifying Activities that Do Not Constitute Brokering"**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

This regulation was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, under **paragraph 12(e.1)a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**.  

The purpose of these regulations is to **clarify which activities do not constitute "brokering"** under the EIPA — a critical distinction because brokering is generally subject to strict licensing and oversight under Canadian export control laws. By defining specific activities that are *exempt* from being considered brokering, the regulation aims to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens while maintaining national security and export control safeguards.

The regulation is part of **Statutes of Canada, 2018, Chapter 26, Section 12(2)**, and is codified under **R.S., c. E-19** (the Export and Import Permits Act).

### **Key Definitions**

Before outlining the exempt activities, the regulation establishes two key definitions:

1. **Affiliate of a Corporation**  
   A corporation is considered an affiliate of another if:
   - One controls the other, or  
   - Both are controlled by the same corporation.

2. **Control of a Corporation**  
   A corporation is "controlled" by another if the latter has the **ability to exercise control in fact** — meaning practical, not just legal or formal, control over the corporation’s operations, decisions, or governance.

> *Note: This definition focuses on "control in fact" rather than ownership or shareholding alone, allowing for flexibility in assessing real-world influence.*

### **Exempt Activities That Do Not Constitute Brokering**

The regulation explicitly states that the following activities **do not constitute brokering** under the EIPA:

---

#### **1. Brokering Between a Corporation and Its Affiliates**

An activity involving a transaction between a corporation and one of its affiliates is **not considered brokering** if:

- The transaction involves the **movement of a good** (i.e., physical goods being exported or imported),  
  **but** the good is **not** one listed in **Group 9 of the Schedule to the Export Control List**;  
- The good is intended for **end-use by an affiliate** of the corporation.

> **Explanation**:  
> This exemption applies only when the transaction is internal to a corporate group — for example, a Canadian company selling equipment to its subsidiary for use in that subsidiary’s operations. Since the end-use is within the same corporate structure, there is no risk of external diversion or misuse, and thus the activity is exempt from requiring a permit or being classified as brokering.

> **Exclusion Note**:  
> Goods listed in **Group 9** (which typically include items of strategic or sensitive nature — e.g., certain dual-use technologies, advanced electronics, or items with potential military applications) are **excluded** from this exemption. This ensures that sensitive goods remain under strict control.

#### **2. Brokering by a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident (Outside Canada)**

A Canadian citizen or permanent resident (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*) who is **outside Canada** may engage in brokering without being deemed a broker if:

- The transaction involves the **movement of a good**, **not listed in Group 9** of the Export Control List;  
- The brokering is done **on behalf of the employer**;  
- The **employer is not**:
  - A Canadian citizen or permanent resident, **or**
  - An organization incorporated, formed, or organized under Canadian provincial or federal law (i.e., a Canadian entity);  
- The Canadian citizen or permanent resident **does not have the ability to exercise control in fact** over the employer.

> **Explanation**:  
> This exemption recognizes that individuals abroad may assist in facilitating trade transactions for foreign employers. However, the exemption is conditional and safeguards against misuse. Key safeguards include:
> - The good must not be in Group 9 (i.e., sensitive or restricted items).
> - The individual must act as an agent, not a decision-maker.
> - The individual must not have real control over the employer — preventing situations where a foreign national could effectively manage or influence the transaction.

> **Example**:  
> A Canadian citizen living in the U.S. helps facilitate the sale of a non-sensitive piece of machinery to a foreign-owned company in Asia, acting solely as a liaison. If the citizen has no decision-making power over the foreign employer, and the good is not in Group 9, this activity is exempt from brokering rules.

### **Effective Date and Implementation**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **subsection 12(2) of the Export and Import Permits Act (S.C. 2018, c. 26)** comes into force.  
- If the regulations are **registered (published) after** that date, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> *Note: These regulations were officially in force as of September 1, 2019, as indicated in SI/2019-41.*

### **Purpose and Significance**

This regulation serves several important functions:

1. **Reduces Regulatory Burden**:  
   It prevents overly restrictive application of brokering rules in routine, internal corporate transactions or in cases where individuals abroad act as facilitators without control.

2. **Enhances Trade Efficiency**:  
   Allows legitimate business activities — especially within corporate groups or cross-border facilitation — to proceed without unnecessary licensing requirements.

3. **Maintains Security and Control**:  
   By excluding only goods in Group 9 and ensuring that individuals do not have actual control over the employer, the regulation maintains a strong security framework for sensitive items and high-risk transactions.

4. **Clarifies Legal Boundaries**:  
   Provides clear, rule-based guidance on what constitutes brokering, helping businesses, exporters, and government agencies apply the law consistently.

### **Limitations and Exceptions**

- **Group 9 Exclusion**:  
  Any transaction involving goods in Group 9 (e.g., advanced computing hardware, certain chemicals, or surveillance equipment) is **not exempt**, regardless of the circumstances. These remain subject to full export control requirements.

- **Control in Fact Requirement**:  
  The "control in fact" standard is crucial — even if ownership is shared, if one party exercises real influence over decisions, the activity may still be considered brokering.

- **Employer Status Matters**:  
  If the employer is a Canadian entity (citizen, permanent resident, or incorporated under Canadian law), the exemption does not apply.

### **Conclusion**

The *Regulations Specifying Activities that Do Not Constitute Brokering* provide a targeted, practical exemption from the brokering provisions of the *Export and Import Permits Act*. These exemptions are designed to support legitimate business operations — particularly within corporate groups and international facilitation — while preserving Canada’s ability to control sensitive exports and prevent misuse. The rules are carefully structured to balance economic efficiency with national security, ensuring that only non-sensitive, low-risk transactions are exempt from regulatory scrutiny.

These regulations reflect a nuanced approach to export control, recognizing the realities of modern international trade while maintaining essential safeguards.
