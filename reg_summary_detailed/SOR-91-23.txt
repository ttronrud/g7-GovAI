  The regulation was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- **Legal Authority**:  
  It is made under **subsection 277(1)** of the *Excise Tax Act* (now repealed or amended).

  S.C. 1990, c. 45, s. 12 (original enactment).

---

#### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The regulation aimed to **prescribe specific health care services** that would be subject to excise tax under the Excise Tax Act — specifically, for the purposes of **section 10 of Part II of Schedule V**.

> This section defines what constitutes a taxable supply of diagnostic, treatment, or health care services under the Act.

---

#### **Services Prescribed**
The following health care services were formally designated as taxable under the Excise Tax Act:

1. **Laboratory, Radiological, or Other Diagnostic Services**  
   - These are services generally available in health care facilities.  
   - Examples include:
     - Blood tests
     - X-rays
     - MRI or CT scans
     - Urine analysis
     - Pathology testing
   - The term "generally available" implies that these are standard, routine services offered in hospitals, clinics, or medical centers.

2. **Administration of Drugs, Biologicals, or Related Preparations**  
   - This applies **only when administered in conjunction with** the provision of services listed in paragraph (a) above.  
   - In other words, the administration of drugs (e.g., insulin, vaccines, chemotherapy) or biologicals (e.g., blood products, antibodies) is taxable **only if it occurs as part of or alongside** a diagnostic or treatment service.

> 🔍 **Key Point**: The administration of drugs alone — such as a prescription filled at a pharmacy without any associated diagnostic or treatment service — is **not** included under this regulation.

---

#### **Application of the Regulation (Timing and Conditions)**

The regulation applies to **supplies made on or after March 4, 2010**, under the following conditions:

##### **1. Supplies Made After March 4, 2010**
- All such supplies are **automatically subject** to the prescribed rules under section 10 of Schedule V.
- No additional conditions apply.

##### **2. Supplies Made on or Before March 4, 2010**
- The regulation applies **only if** one of the following conditions is met:
  - **All consideration (payment)** for the supply becomes due **after March 4, 2010**, or
  - **Payment is made after March 4, 2010**, even if it was not due before that date.

> ✅ Example:  
> If a patient receives a diagnostic test on January 1, 2010, and the payment is due on June 1, 2010, the supply is **taxable** because the consideration becomes due after March 4, 2010.

##### **Exemption Condition (When the Supply is NOT Taxable)**
- If **any consideration** (i.e., payment or part of it) was **due or paid on or before March 4, 2010**, and
- The supplier **did not charge, collect, or remit tax** under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** (which governs excise tax on health care services) **on or before that date**,  
→ Then the supply is **not subject** to the regulation.

> 🔍 This provision protects certain pre-2010 transactions where tax was not collected, especially in cases where the supplier had no prior obligation or awareness of the tax.

#### **Key Legal and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Taxable Services** | Diagnostic services (lab, radiology) and drug administration when part of a health care service. |
| **Timing Threshold** | March 4, 2010 is a critical date for determining whether a supply is taxable. |
| **Payment Timing** | The due date or actual payment date determines tax applicability. |
| **No Tax on Pre-2010 Payments** | If payment was made or due before March 4, 2010 and tax was not collected, the supply is exempt. |
| **Repeal Status** | This regulation is **no longer valid** — it has been replaced or superseded by newer legislation. |

---

#### **Why Was This Regulation Created?**
- To provide **clarity and consistency** in applying excise tax to health care services.
- To ensure that **tax is collected at the right time**, particularly in transitional periods (e.g., after 2010).
- To align with broader tax policy goals, such as ensuring revenue collection from health care providers.

---

#### **Important Caveat: Current Status**
- This regulation was **repealed in 2002** (SOR/2002-277, s. 3).
- As such, **it does not apply today**.
- Modern tax treatment of health care services in Canada is governed by **current provisions** of the *Excise Tax Act*, particularly:
  - **Section 10 of Schedule V** (which may have been updated or restructured).
  - **Part IX** of the Excise Tax Act (which deals with health care services and tax collection).
- Any current compliance or tax planning involving health care services must be based on **up-to-date, active legislation**.

---

### ✅ Summary in One Sentence:
> This regulation, now **repealed**, originally prescribed diagnostic and drug-administration health care services as taxable under the Excise Tax Act, with tax applicability depending on the timing of payment or when consideration became due, especially after March 4, 2010 — but it is **no longer in force** and should not be used for current tax compliance.

---

### Recommendation:
For any current tax treatment of health care services, consult the **current Excise Tax Act** and seek advice from a **tax professional or regulatory authority** to ensure compliance with **active and applicable rules**.
