| **Canadian-made vehicle** | Less than **one year** |
| **Imported vehicle** | Less than **two years** |

> This provision allows for **flexibility** in cases of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., sudden transfer, death), ensuring that the representative is not penalized for loss of use due to external factors.
