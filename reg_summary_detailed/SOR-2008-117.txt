**Detailed Summary of the Designated Public Office Holder Regulations**

**Regulatory Source and Legal Authority**  
The *Designated Public Office Holder Regulations* were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the President of the Treasury Board. This action is grounded in specific provisions of the *Lobbying Act*:

- **Subsection 2(1)a** of the Lobbying Act: Grants the authority to designate public office holders as "designated" under certain conditions.  
- **Paragraph 12(c.1)b** of the Lobbying Act: Provides the basis for identifying and defining the specific positions that fall within the category of designated public office holders.

These regulations are formally enacted under the legislative framework of the *Lobbying Act* and are referenced in the following statutory instruments:
- S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 67  
- S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 79  
- R.S., c. 44 (4th Supp); S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 66  

**Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and specify which positions within the public sector are considered "designated public office holder" positions** for the purposes of the *Lobbying Act*. This designation is critical because it determines which public officials are subject to the reporting and transparency requirements imposed by the Act, particularly in relation to lobbying activities.

**Key Provision**  
Under **paragraph (c) of the definition of "designated public office holder"** in subsection 2(1) of the *Lobbying Act*, the regulations identify and list the **specific positions and classes of positions** that are legally recognized as occupied by a designated public office holder. These positions are outlined in an attached **Schedule** to the regulations.

The Schedule provides a detailed, official list of:
- Specific job titles (e.g., Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Directors, Secretaries, etc.)  
- Functional classifications (e.g., senior executives in federal departments or agencies)  
- Government departments or agencies where these positions are located  

This list ensures clarity and consistency in determining who is subject to the lobbying disclosure and reporting obligations under the Act.

**Effective Date**  
The regulations came into force on **July 2, 2008**. This date marks the start of the legal application of the designated positions, meaning that from this date onward, individuals occupying any of the listed positions are legally considered "designated public office holders" under the *Lobbying Act*.

**Implications and Significance**  
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By clearly identifying key public officials, the regulations enhance transparency in government decision-making. Lobbying activities directed at these individuals must be disclosed to ensure public trust and prevent undue influence.  
- **Compliance Obligations**: Designated public office holders are required to comply with the reporting requirements of the *Lobbying Act*, including the registration of lobbying activities, disclosure of financial interests, and reporting of communications with lobbyists.  
- **Scope and Application**: The regulations apply only to federal public office holders, as the *Lobbying Act* governs federal lobbying activities. Provincial or municipal offices are not included under this framework.  
- **Legal Clarity**: The Schedule eliminates ambiguity in determining who qualifies as a "designated public office holder," reducing the potential for legal disputes or inconsistent enforcement.

**Conclusion**  
The *Designated Public Office Holder Regulations* serve as a critical administrative tool to implement the transparency provisions of the *Lobbying Act*. By formally listing and classifying specific public positions as designated, the regulations ensure that the most influential and decision-making public officials are subject to robust lobbying disclosure requirements. This strengthens democratic accountability and helps protect the integrity of public policy development in Canada’s federal government.  

These regulations remain in effect as of the date of this summary, unless amended or replaced by subsequent legislation.
