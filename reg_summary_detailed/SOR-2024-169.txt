**Detailed Summary of the Supplementary Rules Respecting Nicotine Replacement Therapies Order (S.C. 2024, c. 17, s. 326; R.S., c. F-27)**  
*Published: Ottawa, August 9, 2024*  
*Effective Date: Day of publication in the Canada Gazette, Part II*

### **Background and Purpose**
The Minister of Health has determined, on reasonable grounds, that the **off-label use** of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs)—that is, using them for purposes other than smoking cessation—may pose a **risk to public health**, particularly among youth and through misleading marketing. To mitigate such risks, the Minister has issued these **Supplementary Rules** under **Section 30.01a of the Food and Drugs Act**, in accordance with the *Natural Health Products Regulations* (NHP Regulations).

This Order establishes **strict controls** on the **sale, labelling, advertising, and manufacturing** of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) to ensure they are used safely, responsibly, and only for their intended purpose: **smoking cessation**, and not for recreational or other purposes.

## **Prohibited Changes Without Licence Amendment**

Despite Section 12 of the NHP Regulations, **a licensee cannot sell any lot or batch** of NRT affected by the following changes **without first submitting an amendment application and obtaining approval**:

1. **Change to a brand name** submitted under paragraph 5(e) of the Regulations.
2. **Addition or substitution of a non-medicinal ingredient** that:
   - Affects the **flavour** of the NRT, but
   - Does **not affect safety or efficacy**.

> This prevents companies from altering the product’s appeal (e.g., changing flavour) without regulatory oversight.
