**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation establishes a formal policy and administrative mechanism for setting parking fees at government-operated parking facilities that are made available to the public. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of its key elements:

---

**1. Purpose of the Regulation:**
The primary objective is to ensure that the cost of using government-provided parking facilities is fairly and appropriately borne by the individuals who utilize them. This reflects a principle of cost recovery—meaning users should pay for the use of public government infrastructure, rather than having the government absorb the expenses.

---

**2. Authority and Legal Basis:**
- The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, which is the formal designation for the Canadian federal government’s executive authority acting on behalf of the Crown.
- It is based on the **recommendation of the Minister of Public Works and the Treasury Board**, indicating that the decision is informed by departmental expertise and financial oversight.
- The legal foundation for this action is **Section 13 of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This section grants the Governor General in Council the power to authorize the Minister of Public Works to issue orders setting fees for government services and facilities, including parking, when such fees are necessary to cover costs and ensure fiscal responsibility.

---

**3. Key Action Taken:**
- The **Minister of Public Works** is authorized to **prescribe parking fees** through a formal **order**.
- These fees are not arbitrary or set internally; they must be based on **prevailing market rates**. This ensures that the pricing is aligned with what the public sector would reasonably charge in a commercial or competitive environment, promoting fairness and transparency.

---

**4. Scope of Application:**
- The regulation applies to **government parking facilities provided to the public**. This includes parking lots, garages, or spaces located on government property or within government buildings that are open to the general public.
- The fees will be payable by **persons using** these facilities, meaning any individual or entity (e.g., visitors, employees, contractors, or the public) who parks in these designated spaces.

---

**5. Principles Underlying the Regulation:**
- **Cost Recovery**: The government is not subsidizing the use of its parking infrastructure; users are expected to cover the operational and maintenance costs.
- **Market Alignment**: Pricing is tied to market rates to ensure competitiveness and fairness, preventing underpricing (which could lead to financial loss) or overpricing (which could discourage public use).
- **Transparency and Accountability**: By basing fees on market rates and allowing public oversight through formal orders, the regulation promotes accountability and public trust.

---

**6. Governance and Oversight:**
- The **Treasury Board** plays a key role in reviewing and approving the fee structure, ensuring that the fees are financially sound and consistent with broader government fiscal policies.
- The **Minister of Public Works** is responsible for implementing the order, including public communication, fee schedules, and enforcement.

---

**7. Implications:**
- **For the Public**: Users will now be required to pay fees for parking at government facilities, which may result in a change in behavior (e.g., reduced use during peak times or increased use of alternative transportation).
- **For Government**: The government can better manage its infrastructure budgets and avoid long-term financial burdens from uncharged parking use.
- **For Policy**: This regulation sets a precedent for other government services (e.g., event venues, public transport hubs) where cost recovery may be needed.

---

**Conclusion:**
This regulation is a clear and legally grounded step toward financial sustainability and equitable cost allocation in the use of public government infrastructure. By authorizing the Minister of Public Works to set parking fees based on market rates, the government ensures that public parking facilities are both accessible and financially viable, while reinforcing fiscal responsibility under the Financial Administration Act.

**In simple terms**:  
The government is now legally allowed to charge the public for using its parking lots—based on what similar parking spaces charge in the private market—so that the cost of providing those spaces is covered by those who use them.
