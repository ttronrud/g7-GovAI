**Detailed Summary of the Railway Safety Appliance Standards Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Scope**

The **Railway Safety Appliance Standards Regulations** establish mandatory safety standards for rolling stock (such as box cars, house cars, and caboose cars) used on railways operated by companies under the jurisdiction of the **Railway Transport Committee (RTC)**.

These regulations apply to:
- All **rolling stock constructed or reconstructed** after **October 1, 1966**, and
- All **railway companies operating railways within the Commission’s jurisdiction**.

### **2. Application of Specific Provisions Based on Date of Construction or Service**

#### **Box and Other House Cars**
- **Pre-October 1, 1966**:  
  Sections 1 to 112 of **Schedule I** apply to box and house cars built or rebuilt before October 1, 1966.

- **On and after October 1, 1966 (or under construction prior to that date)**:  
  Sections **112.1 to 112.44 of Schedule I** apply.

- **All box and house cars in service after December 31, 1982**:  
  These updated sections (112.1 to 112.44) **must be fully applied**, regardless of original construction date.

> This ensures that all such cars in service by 1983 are compliant with modernized safety standards.

---

#### **Caboose Cars with Platforms**
- **Built new or rebuilt after January 1, 1967**:  
  Sections **349.1 to 349.20 of Schedule I** apply.

- **In service after December 31, 1982**:  
  These provisions apply to all caboose cars with platforms in service from that date onward.

> This ensures that caboose safety features, particularly those related to braking and access, meet updated safety benchmarks.
