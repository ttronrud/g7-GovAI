## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Iran) Regulations**

### 📌 **1. Purpose and Background**
The regulations are a **response to the Canadian government’s determination** that the situation in Iran constitutes a **grave breach of international peace and security**, posing a serious risk of international crisis.

These measures are enacted **pursuant to subsections 4(1) to (3) of the Special Economic Measures Act**, which empower the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to impose sanctions against persons or entities engaged in activities that threaten international peace, security, or stability.
