**Detailed Summary of the Consolidated Computer Inc. Enterprise Development Regulations**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
These regulations are officially titled the *Consolidated Computer Inc. Enterprise Development Regulations* and may be cited accordingly. This title reflects their specific application to Consolidated Computer Inc. (CCI), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and headquartered in Toronto.

---

**2. Interpretation Clause**  
All words and expressions used in these regulations are to be interpreted in accordance with their meaning in the broader *Enterprise Development Regulations* (the "Parent Regulations"). This ensures consistency in legal definitions and avoids ambiguity when referencing common terms such as "private lender," "loan," "insurance," or "maturity."

**3. Authority to Provide Insurance (Section 28 Exception)**  
A key provision allows the Board (presumably the governing body or authority responsible for enterprise development under the Parent Regulations) to provide insurance **under Section 28 of the Enterprise Development Regulations**, despite a general restriction in subsection 35(1) of those regulations.

- **Purpose of Insurance**: The insurance is intended to support private lenders who provide loans to facilitate the **leasing of computer products** manufactured by Consolidated Computer Inc.
- **Limit on Insurance Amount**: The insurance coverage may not exceed **99% of the amount of the loan** provided by a private lender.
- **Aggregate Limit**: The total amount of loans (and thus the total insurance coverage) across all such private lenders is capped at **$30 million** in the aggregate.

> This provision effectively creates a targeted exception to the general restrictions on insurance under the Parent Regulations, allowing for risk mitigation in a specific sector (computer product leasing) involving a single, designated corporation (CCI).

**4. Limitation on Repayment to Private Lenders (Section 38 Exception)**  
A critical safeguard is provided under a modification to Section 38 of the Enterprise Development Regulations.

- **Scenario**: If a private lender demands repayment of a loan (as described in subsection 1) **before the loan matures**, and insurance has been provided under Section 28, the repayment obligation from the government (i.e., "Her Majesty") is limited.
- **Maximum Amount Payable**: The amount that the Crown (Her Majesty) will pay to the private lender shall not exceed the **lesser of two amounts**:
  1. The **amount of insurance in effect on the date of the demand**; or  
  2. **99% of the actual loss** incurred by the private lender due to the default or early repayment demand.

> This ensures that:
> - The government does not pay more than the insurance coverage available at the time of the demand.
> - The government does not cover more than 99% of the lender’s loss, preserving fiscal responsibility and preventing overcompensation.

**Key Implications and Objectives**

- **Risk Mitigation for Private Lenders**: The regulations aim to encourage private capital investment in the leasing of computer products by offering a form of government-backed insurance, reducing the risk of loss for lenders.
- **Targeted Support**: The support is narrowly focused on CCI and its computer product leasing activities, avoiding broad application to other sectors or companies.
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: The 99% loss cap and the requirement that payments be limited to the insurance amount at the time of demand prevent excessive government exposure.
- **Compliance with Parent Regulations**: The provisions operate within the framework of the Enterprise Development Regulations, while strategically overriding certain restrictions (35(1) and 38) to serve a specific economic development purpose.

**Conclusion**  
The *Consolidated Computer Inc. Enterprise Development Regulations* establish a special insurance mechanism to support private lending for the leasing of computer products manufactured by CCI. By allowing the Board to provide up to 99% insurance on loans not exceeding $30 million in total, and by limiting government repayment to the lesser of the insurance amount or 99% of the lender’s loss, the regulations balance the need to stimulate private investment with fiscal prudence and regulatory accountability. This targeted intervention reflects a policy of supporting specific high-tech enterprise development in Ontario.
