## 📚 Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act* (the primary legislation governing banks and financial institutions in Canada). |
| **Eligible Canadian Financial Institution** | Has the same meaning as in subsection **370(1)** of the *Bank Act*. This typically includes major Canadian financial institutions such as large banks, credit unions, or insurance companies that meet certain criteria (e.g., size, systemic importance). |
| **Eligible Foreign Institution** | Same definition as in subsection 370(1) of the *Bank Act*. Refers to foreign financial institutions that are deemed to meet the standards for being treated as "eligible" under Canadian regulatory frameworks (e.g., due to size, stability, or regulatory oversight). |
| **Trust and Loan Company** | A body corporate under the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* or a trust or loan corporation incorporated under a provincial statute. These are smaller financial institutions that may hold deposits and provide loans. |

## 💡 Core Concept: Financial Statement Equity

For the purposes of these regulations:

> **Financial statement equity** of an entity =  
> The **sum of**:
> - Shareholders’ equity and members’ equity of the entity, **plus**
> - Minority interests in entities **controlled by** the entity,  
> as reflected in the **consolidated financial statements** of the entity.

✅ This definition ensures that equity is calculated in a way that reflects the full ownership structure, including minority stakes in subsidiaries.

---

## 🧩 Beneficial Ownership Rule (Section 9, 9.1, 9.2, or 371 of the Act)

If **two or more persons** are deemed under specific sections of the *Bank Act* (sections 9, 9.1, 9.2, or 371) to be a **single person** for the purposes of acquiring beneficial ownership of shares or membership interests in a bank, bank holding company, or related entity, then:

➡️ **They are treated as one person** for the purposes of these regulations.  
➡️ This means that ownership thresholds (e.g., control or significant influence) are assessed based on **aggregate beneficial ownership**, not individual ownership.

👉 *Purpose*: Prevents circumvention of ownership rules by splitting ownership among multiple individuals.

---

## 🏦 When Does "Equity" Apply?

The *equity* of a bank or bank holding company is determined based on its structure and ownership. The following scenarios define the equity:

### ✅ Cases Where Equity is Determined as Financial Statement Equity

A bank or bank holding company has **financial statement equity** as its equity if it falls into **any of these categories**:

1. **A widely held bank** (i.e., publicly traded with broad ownership)  
   → OR any other bank **not controlled by any person**

2. **A widely held bank holding company**  
   → OR any other bank holding company **not controlled by any person**

3. **A bank controlled by a widely held bank holding company**

4. **A bank holding company controlled by a widely held bank holding company**

5. **A bank controlled by a widely-held insurance holding company**

6. **A bank holding company controlled by a widely-held insurance holding company**

7. **A bank controlled by an eligible Canadian financial institution**

8. **A bank holding company controlled by an eligible Canadian financial institution**

9. **A bank not controlled by any person other than an eligible foreign institution or a subsidiary of an eligible foreign institution**

10. **A bank holding company not controlled by any person other than an eligible foreign institution or a subsidiary of an eligible foreign institution**

> In all these cases, the **equity is simply the financial statement equity** of the entity.

---

## 🔍 When Equity is Determined by Aggregation (if not covered above)

If a bank or bank holding company **does not fall under the above categories**, then its equity is calculated as follows:

### For a **Bank**:
> Equity =  
> (1) Financial statement equity of the bank **if it is not controlled by a bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company**, **plus**  
> (2) The financial statement equity of **each affiliate** of the bank that is:
> - A bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company, **and**
> - Not controlled by a bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company.

> 🔍 This means: if a bank has subsidiaries or affiliates that are also financial institutions, and those affiliates are not controlled by other financial institutions, their equity is **added** to the bank’s equity.

### For a **Bank Holding Company**:
> Equity =  
> (1) Financial statement equity of the bank holding company **if it is not controlled by a bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company**, **plus**  
> (2) The financial statement equity of **each affiliate** of the bank holding company that is:
> - A bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company, **and**
> - Not controlled by a bank, bank holding company, or trust and loan company.

> 🔍 Same logic applies: equity is the sum of the entity’s own equity and the equity of its **non-controlled affiliated institutions**.

## 🎯 Regulatory Significance

These rules are critical for:

1. **Ownership Monitoring**  
   - Helps regulators identify **concentrations of ownership** or potential **control by a single entity or individual**.
   - Prevents "shell" ownership or hidden control through multiple individuals.

2. **Capital and Risk Assessment**  
   - Equity is a key metric for assessing **capital adequacy**, **risk exposure**, and **systemic stability**.

3. **Anti-Money Laundering & Anti-Terrorism**  
   - Supports due diligence on beneficial ownership, especially in cross-border or complex ownership structures.

4. **Compliance with International Standards**  
   - Aligns with global banking regulations (e.g., Basel III) that emphasize transparency in ownership and capital structures.

5. **Treatment of Foreign Institutions**  
   - Provides a clear framework for how foreign-owned or foreign-controlled banks are treated — particularly in terms of whether they are considered "eligible" and how their equity is assessed.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No automatic assumption of control**: Ownership is only treated as "controlled" if it meets specific thresholds (e.g., 10% or more, or de facto control).
- **Consolidated financial statements are key**: Equity must be derived from official, audited financial statements.
- **Changes in ownership structure** may trigger a reassessment of equity under these rules.
- **Eligibility of foreign institutions** is strictly defined and subject to ongoing review by the Bank of Canada and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This regulation provides a **comprehensive and structured framework** for determining the **equity of banks and bank holding companies** in Canada. It:

- Clarifies what counts as equity,
- Defines how beneficial ownership is aggregated,
- Establishes clear rules for when equity is based on financial statements versus aggregated affiliate equity,
- Addresses both domestic and foreign ownership,
- Supports regulatory oversight, transparency, and financial stability.
