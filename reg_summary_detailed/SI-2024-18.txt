**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Remission Order in Respect of Certain Fees for the Issuance of Identity and Travel Documents (2021 British Columbia Floods)*

---

### **Legal Basis:**
This order is made under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S. c. F-11)**.  
This provision allows the Governor in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to **remit (i.e., waive or forgive) certain fees** associated with the issuance of identity and travel documents when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

---

### **Purpose of the Order:**
To provide **financial relief** to individuals who suffered the loss, damage, destruction, or inaccessibility of their identity or travel documents due to **flooding events in British Columbia** that occurred between **November 15, 2021, and May 31, 2022**. The remission aims to support affected individuals by reducing administrative and financial burdens during a time of natural disaster.

### **Definition of "Document":**
The term *document* includes the following types of official identity or travel documents:
1. **Passport** – as defined in Section 2 of the *Canadian Passport Order*.
2. **Certificate of Citizenship** – as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Citizenship Act*.
3. **Permanent Resident Card** – issued under subsection 53(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*.
4. **Certificate of Identity**.
5. **Refugee Travel Document** – issued under the *United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951)* and its *Protocol (1967)*.

> This means the order applies to a broad range of identity and travel documents commonly used by Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and refugees.

Remission is granted for fees paid or payable under the following specific provisions:

| Fee Source | Specific Reference |

### **Conditions for Remission:**

To qualify for fee remission, a person must meet **all of the following conditions**:

1. **Residence in an Affected Area During the Flood Period:**  
   The individual must have been **in or had their residence in an area in Canada affected by flooding events originating in British Columbia** at some point between **November 15, 2021, and May 31, 2022**.

2. **Document Loss/Damage Due to Flooding:**  
   The document in question (e.g., passport, resident card) must have been:
   - **Lost**
   - **Damaged**
   - **Destroyed**
   - **Rendered inaccessible**  
   **As a direct result of the flooding events** mentioned above.

3. **Application for a Replacement Document:**  
   During the same period (November 15, 2021 – May 31, 2022), the individual (or someone acting on their behalf) must have **submitted a formal application** to replace the lost or damaged document.  
   - The replacement document must bear the **same expiry date** as the original (if applicable).

4. **Submission of Required Declarations and Proof:**  
   The applicant must include **one of the following** with the application:
   - A **declaration** stating that the document was lost, damaged, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible **due to the flooding events**.
   - **Proof** that, at the time of the incident, the individual was a **resident** of an affected area in BC.
   - OR a **declaration** stating that, at the time of the incident, the individual was **in** the affected area.

5. **No Prior Remission:**  
   The fees in question must **not have already been remitted** under **Section 11 of the Passport and Other Travel Document Services Fees Regulations**.  
   This ensures that the benefit is not duplicated or applied more than once.

### **Key Implications and Considerations:**

- **Public Interest Justification:**  
  The order is justified as being in the public interest — recognizing the disproportionate impact of natural disasters on vulnerable populations and ensuring that individuals do not face financial hardship due to unforeseen events beyond their control.

- **Timeframe Specificity:**  
  The eligibility window is strictly defined: **November 15, 2021, to May 31, 2022**. This aligns with the known flooding events in British Columbia during that period, particularly the major floods in the Fraser Valley, Okanagan, and other regions.

- **Proof Requirements:**  
  While a declaration is sufficient in some cases, applicants are expected to provide **some form of evidence** (e.g., residency proof, emergency documentation, or official reports) to substantiate their claim. This helps prevent abuse or fraudulent claims.

- **Exclusivity of Remission:**  
  The regulation prevents double-remission — if a person already received a fee waiver under Section 11, they are **not eligible** under this order.

- **Scope of Coverage:**  
  Applies to both **citizens and permanent residents**, as well as **refugees**, reflecting a broad humanitarian and practical approach.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This remission order is a targeted, disaster-responsive measure designed to:
- Support individuals affected by the 2021 British Columbia floods,
- Reduce financial barriers to obtaining essential identity and travel documents,
- Recognize the legitimate hardship caused by natural disasters,
- Ensure compliance with administrative and regulatory standards through clear eligibility criteria.

It serves as a practical example of how federal government policy can respond to emergencies by providing relief in the form of fee waivers — balancing administrative efficiency with compassion and equity.

**Note:** This regulation is **not retroactive** beyond the specified timeframe and applies only to documents lost, damaged, or destroyed during the defined flood period. Individuals must act promptly and meet all procedural requirements to qualify.
