**Detailed Summary of the *Nursing Home Care Benefits Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Nursing Home Care Benefits Regulations* establish the framework under which **Canada provides financial contributions to provinces** to support the operation of **universal nursing home care benefit programs**. These regulations are administered by the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** and are designed to ensure equitable, sustainable, and transparent funding for long-term care services in nursing homes for residents aged 65 and over.

The regulations are grounded in the **Canada Assistance Plan (CAP)** and are primarily aimed at supporting provinces that have introduced a **universal nursing home care benefit program**—a system that provides care benefits to residents of nursing homes on uniform, non-discriminatory terms, without requiring financial eligibility tests.

## **Key Definitions and Concepts**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Assistance Agreement** | A formal agreement between Canada and a province under the Canada Assistance Plan, governing financial support for nursing home care. |
| **Base Year** | For provinces other than Alberta: the 12-month period immediately before the introduction of a universal nursing home care benefit program. For Alberta: April 1, 1973 to March 31, 1974. |
| **Base Year Payment** | The total amount Canada would have paid to a province under a universal program for the cost of care provided during the base year, based on actual expenditures in nursing homes listed or accepted for listing in the assistance agreement. For Alberta, this is calculated under a specific agreement under section 3. |
| **Care** | Includes skilled nursing, personal, or supervisory care provided by or under the supervision of skilled personnel. |
| **Contribution** | The amount paid by Canada to a province to cover the cost of benefits under its universal nursing home care program. |
| **Contribution Commencement Day** | For provinces with existing programs: January 1, 1974. For others: the later of (1) the day the universal program is introduced, or (2) six months before the province notifies Canada of its intention to enter into an agreement. |
| **Estimate (Population)** | An official estimate certified by the Chief Statistician of Canada of the number of people aged 65+ in a province. |
| **Initial Period** | The first part of a year beginning on the contribution commencement day. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of National Health and Welfare. |
| **Nursing Home** | A residential institution primarily providing care to residents; excludes child care institutions. |
| **Provincial Law** | The legislation and regulations of a province governing its universal nursing home care benefit program, consistent with these regulations. |
| **Resident** | A person residing in a nursing home for care purposes; excludes individuals under the care of child welfare authorities. |
| **Universal Nursing Home Care Benefit Program** | A program that provides benefits to residents of nursing homes on uniform terms and conditions—available to all residents who meet age, care level, or other specified criteria—without requiring financial assessments. Exceptions include programs that require fixed payments, residence periods, premiums, or financial eligibility tests. |
| **Weighted Average** | A province’s calculated average daily operating cost for care in nursing homes, approved by the Minister. |
| **Year** | A 12-month period ending March 31. |

## **Core Principles and Objectives**

1. **Universal Access Without Financial Screening**  
   The central principle is that the program must provide benefits **on uniform terms** to residents who meet specified criteria (age, care level, or group), **without requiring financial assessments** to determine eligibility. This ensures equity and accessibility for seniors in need.

2. **Exemptions for Specific Conditions**  
   While the program must be universal, it may include conditions such as:
   - Fixed payment for care
   - Minimum period of residence in the province
   - Premium payments
   - Financial ability tests (e.g., to determine ability to pay a fixed fee or premium)

   However, such conditions **do not invalidate** the program’s status as "universal" under the regulations.

3. **Funding Mechanism**  
   Canada pays contributions based on:
   - The **base year payment** (historical cost of care)
   - Adjustments for **cost increases** and **population growth**

## **Calculation of Contributions**

### **Annual Contribution Formula**
> Contribution = Base Year Payment × Cost Increase Factor × Population Increase Factor

#### **Cost Increase Factor**
- Ratio of the **per diem cost of care** in the current year (or initial period) to the per diem cost in the base year.
- The per diem cost is defined as the **weighted average** of daily operating costs incurred for care in nursing homes included in the program.

#### **Population Increase Factor**
- Ratio of:
  - Estimated number of residents aged 65+ on **October 1** of the current year
  - To the estimated number of residents aged 65+ on the **first day of the seventh month of the base year** (January 1, April 1, June 1, July 1, or October 1)

> This ensures funding scales with actual population growth among seniors.

---

### **Initial Period Contribution (First Year of Program)**

- For provinces other than Alberta:  
  A proportion of the full annual contribution, based on the **length of the initial period** (e.g., if 6 months, then 50% of the annual amount).

- For **Alberta**:  
  A fixed **one-quarter (25%)** of the base year payment is paid during the initial period.

> This reflects a phased introduction of funding to allow provinces time to transition to the new system.

---

## **Per Diem Cost of Care**

Defined as the **weighted average** of daily operating costs for care in nursing homes included in the program. Operating costs include only those portions of total expenses that can be reasonably attributed to resident care, in accordance with **recognized and generally accepted accounting principles**.

---

## **Agreement Requirements**

Every agreement between Canada and a province must include:

1. **Schedule of Provincial Law**  
   A detailed list of the provincial Acts and regulations governing the universal nursing home care benefit program.

2. **Exchange of Information**  
   Requires regular exchange of **statistical and operational data** between Canada and the province to monitor program performance.

3. **Audit and Record-Keeping Obligations**  
   - The province must maintain records for **five years** for examination and audit by the Minister or designated persons.
   - Must provide copies of relevant provincial laws and regulations.

4. **Funding Mechanism**  
   Canada pays contributions or advances on account of them from the **Consolidated Revenue Fund**.

---

## **Exclusions and Limitations**

- **No Funding for Pre-Commencement Costs**  
  Contributions are **not payable** for care provided **before the contribution commencement day**.

- **No Double Funding**  
  Canada will not fund any cost already covered by another federal grant or contribution under a different Act—only under an **Appropriation Act** specifically authorizing payments for universal nursing home care programs.

---

## **Agreement Duration and Termination**

- The agreement **initially lasts until March 31, 1976**, provided the provincial law remains in operation.
- It may be **renewed annually** by mutual consent of the Minister and the province.
- The agreement may be **amended or terminated** at any time with the approval of the Governor in Council and consent of both parties.
- Schedules to the agreement may be amended by agreement between the Minister (or his designate) and the province.
- Either party may give **notice of termination**:
  - If the province gives notice, the agreement ends after the day specified.
  - If Canada gives notice, the agreement ends after **three months** from the notice date, or after the end of the period specified—whichever is later.

---

## **Reporting and Verification Requirements**

### **Annual Contribution Statement**
- The province must submit a **statement** to the Minister within **one year** of the end of the year or initial period.
- The statement must:
  - Be in a form acceptable to the Minister
  - Be **certified** by:
    - A provincial minister or designated official, or
    - The provincial auditor or designated body (subject to conditions agreed upon by the Minister)

### **Advance Payments**
- Canada may pay **advances** on account of the contribution during the year or initial period.
- Advances are made based on:
  - **Estimates** of the contribution
  - Adjustments to avoid overpayment

#### **Advance Rules**
- **For a full year**:  
  One-twelfth of the most recent estimate, minus any overpayment from prior advances.

- **For an initial period**:  
  One-month portion of the estimate, minus overpayment from prior advances.

> Advances are paid **on or after the 20th day of the month** for which they are made.

---

## **Overpayment and Recovery Mechanisms**

- If the Minister determines that Canada has overpaid a contribution:
  - The province must **repay the excess**.
  - If the repayment is not made, Canada may **recover the amount as a debt**.

- In recovering overpayments, Canada may **deduct the debt** from:
  - Future contributions
  - Future advances
  - Any payments under the assistance agreement

> This ensures fiscal accountability and prevents overfunding.

## **Key Regulatory Outcomes and Impacts**

1. **Equity in Access**  
   The regulations promote universal access to long-term care for seniors, reducing financial barriers and ensuring that care is available regardless
