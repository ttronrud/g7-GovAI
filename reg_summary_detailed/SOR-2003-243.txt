**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Exemption from Approval for Certain Investments in Intragroup Service Entities (Cooperative Credit Associations)*

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is made under the authority of:

- **Paragraph 396(b)a** and **Section 463b** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCAA),  
- On the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**,  
- By **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council** (the formal executive authority of the Canadian government).

**Statutory References:**  
- *S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 314* (provides the enabling power and scope of the regulation)  
- *S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 319* (may relate to procedural or administrative provisions)  
- *S.C. 1991, c. 48* (the original enactment of the CCAA, which contains the relevant provisions)  

**Core Provision:**  
Subsections **390(5)** and **(6)** of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* normally impose requirements for **approval** when a cooperative credit association (CCA) acquires:

1. **Control** of, or  
2. **A substantial investment in**,  
an entity that is classified under **paragraph 390(4)(b)** of the Act.

However, **this requirement does not apply** — i.e., **an exemption is granted** — **if** the financial intermediary activities of the entity in question are **limited to providing services exclusively to**:

- The **association itself**, or  
- The **members of the association’s group** (i.e., the affiliated group of cooperatives or related entities under the association’s control).

**Key Interpretation:**  
- The exemption applies **only when** the entity in question is engaged in **financial intermediary activities** (such as lending, deposit-taking, or investment management) that expose it to **material market or credit risk** — but **only if** those activities are **restricted to serving the association or its group members**.
- This means that if the entity is providing services (e.g., payroll processing, treasury management, administrative support) that do not involve financial intermediation or exposure to market/credit risk, the exemption does not apply.
- The exemption is **specifically designed** to allow cooperatives to invest in or control service entities that support their internal operations without requiring external regulatory approval — promoting operational efficiency and group cohesion.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
To **facilitate internal growth and operational efficiency** within cooperative credit associations by allowing them to establish or expand service entities within their own group without needing prior regulatory approval — provided those entities do not engage in financial activities that pose significant risk to the association or the broader financial system.

**Effective Date:**  
The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*, which is typically the day of publication. This ensures immediate applicability upon formal adoption.

**Significance and Implications:**  
- **Reduces regulatory burden** on cooperative associations by allowing internal service investments without approval.  
- Encourages **group integration** and **cost-sharing** among cooperative members.  
- Maintains **financial prudency** by restricting the exemption to entities whose financial activities are limited to internal, non-market-exposed services.  
- Supports the cooperative model by enabling associations to operate more efficiently through shared services, such as IT, accounting, or risk management, without exposing the group to unnecessary regulatory scrutiny.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a **clear and targeted exemption** from the approval requirement under the CCAA for cooperative credit associations that invest in or acquire control of service entities — as long as those entities only provide financial services to the association or its members and do not expose themselves to material market or credit risk. It balances regulatory oversight with operational flexibility, reinforcing the cooperative principle of mutual support and internal efficiency.
