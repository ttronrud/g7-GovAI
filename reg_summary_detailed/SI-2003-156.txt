The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2012-93" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 93 of 2012 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title or the enabling legislation), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the repealed regulation, as the original text of SI/2012-93 is no longer in force.

In general, when a statutory instrument is marked as "repealed," it means that:

- The regulation was previously enacted to implement or amend a law.
- It was formally revoked by a subsequent legislative or administrative action.
- It is no longer applicable or enforceable.
- Its provisions have been replaced, superseded, or integrated into another regulation or statute.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

1. The full title of SI/2012-93 (e.g., "The [Name of Regulation] 2012").
2. The parent act or enabling legislation under which it was made.
3. The subject matter (e.g., environmental protection, employment standards, transport, taxation).
4. The key provisions or objectives of the regulation before repeal.

For example, if SI/2012-93 were the *Regulation on the Use of Certain Chemical Substances in Food Packaging*, a detailed summary would include:
- The scope of substances covered.
- Requirements for labeling or manufacturer compliance.
- Enforcement mechanisms.
- Timeline or conditions for compliance.

Since the regulation is now repealed, any such details are historical and no longer current.

**Conclusion**:  
SI/2012-93 is a repealed statutory instrument. A detailed summary cannot be provided without the full title and content of the original regulation. The repeal means the regulation is no longer in effect and has been replaced or superseded by another legal instrument. For accurate historical or legal reference, consult the official legislative database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk or the relevant government publication).
