### **Detailed Summary of the Springbank Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **Springbank Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. These rules establish spatial and elevation restrictions around **Springbank (Calgary Satellite) Airport**, located near Calgary, Alberta.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Springbank (Calgary Satellite) Airport. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as a datum for elevation and boundary measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 3,930 feet above sea level** for all purposes. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (strip), perpendicular to its centerline. These surfaces ensure safe aircraft approach by maintaining visibility and clearance from obstacles. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal surface located above the ground, at a constant elevation of **150 feet above the ARP** (3,930 ft = 4,080 ft MSL). If this plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, the surface is instead set at **30 feet above ground**. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, defined by width and length. Includes runways and associated landing areas. Described in **Part V of the Schedule**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Ensures a smooth transition between runway zones and the outer boundary. Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. |

#### **3. Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to:

- All **lands and submerged areas** (including public road allowances) adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport;
- Specifically, those lands whose outer limits are described in **Part II of the Schedule**, **excluding**:
  - Lands that are part of the airport itself;
  - The **Sarcee Indian Reserve No. 145**;
  - Any land that has been formally incorporated into the airport.

> **Important Note**: The regulation was **revoked by SOR/81-179, section 1**, indicating that it is no longer in force. However, the summary reflects its historical content and structure as provided.

---

#### **4. Elevation Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on regulated land if the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following **imaginary surfaces** at the point of location:

1. **Approach Surfaces**
2. **Outer Surface**
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

This means:
- All new or modified structures must remain **below or at the level** of these defined surfaces.
- Even small structures (e.g., fences, towers, signs) are subject to this rule.
- The restriction applies both on land and under water.

---

#### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above surfaces, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision allows regulatory oversight to maintain aviation safety by preventing tall vegetation from obstructing flight paths.

---

#### **6. Geographic Boundaries (Land Description)**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed **legal land description** starting from the intersection of runways 16L-34R and 07-25, then proceeding through a series of directions and boundaries across several sections of land in Alberta.

**Key elements of the boundary description**:
- Begins at the **intersection of runways 16L-34R and 07-25**.
- Proceeds **east along runway 07-25 (1,700 ft)**, then **north 250 ft** to reach the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.
- Continues via a complex chain of directional movements:
  - Along section lines, quarter-section boundaries, road allowances, and right-of-way plans (e.g., **Plan 4851 J.K., Plan 7410359, Plan 3461 J.K.**).
  - Involves movements north, south, east, and west across multiple townships, ranges, and sections.
- Ends back at the starting point, forming a closed boundary.

> This boundary defines the **geographic footprint** of the regulated zone and ensures that only land within this perimeter is subject to the zoning rules.

#### **7. Approach Surfaces (Detailed Description)**

Each approach surface is tailored to the specific runway and has unique slope and dimensions:

| Runway Approach | Slope Ratio | Vertical Rise | Horizontal Distance | Outer End Distance from Centerline | Exclusion |
|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------|
| **34R** | 1 ft vertical : 50 ft horizontal | 1,000 ft above strip end | 50,000 ft from end | 8,000 ft from centerline | Excluded within Sarcee Indian Reserve No. 145 |
| **34L** | 1:40 | 207.5 ft above strip end | 8,300 ft from end | 980 ft from centerline | — |
| **16L** | 1:50 | 1,000 ft above strip end | 50,000 ft from end | 8,000 ft from centerline | — |
| **16R** | 1:40 | 207.5 ft above strip end | 8,300 ft from end | 980 ft from centerline | — |
| **07** | 1:40 | 207.5 ft above strip end | 8,300 ft from end | 980 ft from centerline | — |
| **25** | 1:40 | 207.5 ft above strip end | 8,300 ft from end | 980 ft from centerline | — |

> These surfaces are **illustrated on Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1202 (as revised May 1981)**.

---

#### **8. Outer Surface**

- A **common plane** at **150 feet above the ARP (3,930 ft MSL = 4,080 ft MSL)**.
- If this plane is **less than 30 feet above ground**, the surface is instead set at **30 feet above ground**.
- Purpose: To provide a uniform elevation limit for structures and natural features outside the immediate runway zones.

> This surface acts as a **general safety boundary** for the wider airport area.

---

#### **9. Strip Dimensions**

Each runway strip is defined in terms of width and length:

| Runway | Width | Length |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **16L-34R** | 1,000 ft (500 ft on each side) | 5,400 ft |
| **16R-34L** | 300 ft (150 ft on each side) | 4,400 ft |
| **07-25** | 300 ft (150 ft on each side) | 3,800 ft |

> These strips are also shown on **Plan E.1202 (revised 1981)**.

---

#### **10. Transitional Surfaces**

These surfaces connect the lateral edges of the strips and approach surfaces to the outer surface or to adjacent transitional surfaces.

| Runway | Slope Ratio | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **16L-34R** | 1 ft vertical : 7 ft horizontal | Inclined plane rising from lateral limits of strip and approach surfaces to intersect outer surface or adjacent transitional surface |
| **16R-34L** and **07-25** | 1 ft vertical : 5 ft horizontal | Same structure, steeper slope than 16L-34R |

> These ensure a **smooth, gradual transition** in elevation from the runway edges to the outer boundary, minimizing abrupt changes that could interfere with aircraft operations.

#### **11. Maps and References**

All described surfaces (approach, outer, transitional, and strips) are **graphically represented** on:

- **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1202**, dated **January 8, 1976**, as **revised on May 19, 1981**.

This plan serves as the **primary reference document** for enforcement, planning, and compliance.

#### **12. Status and Legal Note**

> ⚠️ **Revocation Notice**:  
> These regulations were **revoked by SOR/81-179, section 1**. This means they are **no longer legally in effect** as of the date of
