### Key Provisions and Actions:

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**:
   - The **Minister of Industry** is formally transferring responsibility for the **Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec (EDAC-RQ)** to the **Minister of State**, who will be styled:
     - *Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec*
     - *Minister responsible for the Francophonie*
   - This transfer is made **pursuant to paragraph 2(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which authorizes the transfer of public service functions and duties between ministers when deemed necessary for administrative efficiency, policy coherence, or strategic realignment.

2. **Scope of Authority**:
   - The transfer includes **control and supervision** of the portion of the public service known as the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.
   - This means the new minister will have full authority over the agency’s operations, budget, staffing, strategic planning, and implementation of policies related to economic development in Quebec’s regions.

3. **Presiding Role**:
   - The newly designated Minister of State is **ordered to preside over** the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.
   - This establishes the minister as the **chief executive and decision-maker** for the agency, responsible for setting its direction, overseeing its performance, and ensuring alignment with federal economic development goals and Quebec’s unique francophone context.

4. **Effective Date**:
   - The transfer and the new ministerial responsibilities take effect on **July 20, 2004**.
   - All administrative, operational, and reporting functions related to the EDAC-RQ are to be transferred to the new minister on this date.

### Rationale and Context (Implied):

- The reassignment reflects a strategic effort to **better align economic development policy with regional needs**, particularly in Quebec.
- By placing the EDAC-RQ under the purview of a minister responsible for **the Francophonie**, the government emphasizes the importance of supporting francophone communities, promoting linguistic and cultural equity, and ensuring that economic development initiatives respect and advance the interests of French-speaking populations in Quebec.
- This move may also reflect a broader policy shift to decentralize economic development functions and give greater regional responsiveness to local needs.

---

### Significance:

- This regulation marks a significant **restructuring of federal public service governance** within the Department of Industry.
- It underscores the federal government’s commitment to **regional economic development**, particularly in Quebec, and to the **promotion and protection of the Francophonie** through institutional oversight.
- It enhances accountability and ensures that the EDAC-RQ operates under a minister who has both economic development expertise and a dedicated mandate for linguistic and cultural equity.

### Conclusion:

This regulation formally transfers the control and supervision of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec from the Minister of Industry to a new Minister of State with dual responsibilities — economic development and Francophonie. Effective July 20, 2004, the new minister is empowered to preside over the agency, ensuring that regional economic initiatives are both strategically sound and culturally sensitive. The move is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a policy priority toward regional equity and linguistic inclusion in Canada’s economic development framework.
