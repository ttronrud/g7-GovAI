### **3. Core Provisions and Requirements**

#### **(a) Authorization Required for Marketing**
> *No producer shall market turkey in interprovincial or export trade unless an order of the Commodity Board authorizes the producer to do so.*

- **Key Point**: Marketing turkeys outside Manitoba (i.e., to other provinces or internationally) is **not permitted without prior approval** from the Commodity Board.
- This ensures that only producers who meet certain standards (e.g., quality, volume, compliance) are allowed to participate in broader markets.
- The Board may issue marketing authorizations based on market conditions, supply levels, and producer eligibility.

#### **(b) Clearance Certificate Requirement**
> *No person shall transport or deliver for transport turkeys without having obtained a clearance certificate in respect of the turkeys.*

- A **clearance certificate is mandatory** before any turkey can be transported beyond Manitoba.
- The certificate serves as legal and administrative proof that:
  - The turkeys originate from Manitoba;
  - The producer is authorized to market them;
  - The shipment complies with health, safety, and quality standards.

#### **(c) Transporter Obligations During Movement**
Every person transporting turkeys must:

1. **Carry the clearance certificate** in the vehicle during transport.
   - The certificate must be physically present and accessible.
   - This allows for immediate verification in case of inspection.

2. **Produce the certificate upon request** by an inspector.
   - Inspectors have the right to inspect the vehicle and verify the authenticity and validity of the clearance certificate.
   - This ensures accountability and compliance with the regulation.

#### **(d) Post-Transport Reporting Requirement**
> *As soon as possible after the transport of the turkeys, the transporter must report to the Commodity Board:*
> - The **date of transport**  
> - The **quantity** of turkeys transported  
> - The **origin** (farm or producer location)  
> - The **destination** (destination province or country)  
> - The **clearance certificate number**

- This reporting requirement enables:
  - **Traceability** of turkeys from farm to market;
  - **Monitoring of trade flows** for market analysis and policy development;
  - **Enforcement** of compliance and detection of irregularities;
  - **Data collection** for future regulatory decisions.

### **4. Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement**

- The **Commodity Board** is responsible for:
  - Issuing clearance certificates;
  - Authorizing producers for interprovincial and export marketing;
  - Appointing inspectors;
  - Receiving and processing transport reports.
- **Inspectors** have the authority to:
  - Board vehicles during transport;
  - Verify the presence and validity of clearance certificates;
  - Enforce compliance with the Order.
- Violations of this Order (e.g., transporting without a certificate, failing to report, or transporting unauthorized turkeys) may result in penalties, fines, or suspension of marketing privileges.
