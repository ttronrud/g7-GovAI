### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation formally adds **perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)** and its **salts** to **Column 1 of the Virtual Elimination List** under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. The Virtual Elimination List is a tool used by the Canadian government to identify substances that are either no longer produced or used in Canada, or are being phased out due to environmental and health concerns.

By including PFOS and its salts in this list, the regulation signals that the substance is being treated as a **"virtual elimination" candidate**, meaning that its production and use are effectively prohibited in Canada, even if not explicitly banned by law. This step is part of a broader strategy to reduce the environmental persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

### **Key Provisions and Actions**

1. **Addition to the Virtual Elimination List:**  
   - **Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)** and all of its **salts** (e.g., sodium perfluorooctane sulfonate, potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate, etc.) are added to **Column 1** of the Virtual Elimination List.  
   - This list is maintained under **subsection 65(2)** of CEPA 1999 and is updated periodically to reflect substances that are being phased out due to risks to human health and the environment.

2. **Legal Authority:**  
   - The regulation is enacted under **subsection 3(1)** of the *Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Virtual Elimination Act*, which grants the Ministers of the Environment and Health the authority to add substances to the Virtual Elimination List.  
   - This legislative framework was established to address the growing scientific evidence of PFOS's harmful effects, including its persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation in humans and wildlife, and potential links to cancer, liver damage, immune system suppression, and developmental issues.

3. **Effective Date:**  
   - The regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** with the Canada Gazette.  
   - Registration occurred on **December 7, 2008**, and the official issuance date was **January 9, 2009**.  
   - Thus, the regulation became effective on **January 9, 2009**.

### **Environmental and Health Rationale**

- **PFOS** is a synthetic fluorinated compound used in a variety of industrial and consumer products, including:
  - Firefighting foams
  - Water-repellent coatings (e.g., on textiles, carpets, and paper)
  - Stain and water-resistant products
  - Industrial processes (e.g., metal plating, chemical manufacturing)

- Despite being used in small quantities, PFOS is highly **persistent**, **bioaccumulative**, and **toxic**. It resists degradation in the environment and can accumulate in the food chain and human tissues.

- Scientific studies have shown that PFOS exposure is associated with:
  - Increased risk of certain cancers (e.g., testicular, kidney)
  - Liver enzyme abnormalities
  - Reduced immune function
  - Developmental and reproductive toxicity

- The addition of PFOS to the Virtual Elimination List reflects Canada’s commitment to **precautionary principles** in environmental protection and public health.

### **Implications of the Regulation**

- **Phase-out of Use and Production:**  
  While the regulation does not immediately ban all use of PFOS, it effectively **prohibits new production and use** in Canada. This aligns with international efforts (e.g., the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants) to eliminate or severely restrict PFOS.

- **Regulatory Enforcement:**  
  The Ministers of Environment and Health are empowered to enforce compliance through monitoring, inspections, and penalties for non-compliance.

- **Support for Industry Transition:**  
  The regulation provides a clear pathway for industries to transition away from PFOS by promoting the use of safer alternatives and supporting innovation in non-fluorinated technologies.

- **Environmental Monitoring and Research:**  
  The inclusion of PFOS on the list supports ongoing environmental surveillance and health studies to assess the impact of its phase-out.

---

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- The *Perfluorooctane Sulfonate Virtual Elimination Act* was introduced to provide a legal mechanism for the virtual elimination of PFOS, which had already been identified as a substance of concern under CEPA 1999.  
- The Virtual Elimination List is a key tool in Canada’s regulatory strategy for managing hazardous chemicals, particularly those with long-term environmental and health risks.  
- This regulation is part of a broader trend in Canada and globally to eliminate or restrict the use of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) substances.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant step in Canada’s environmental and public health protection framework. By formally adding **perfluorooctane sulfonate and its salts** to the Virtual Elimination List, the government has taken decisive action to reduce human and environmental exposure to a known toxic chemical. The regulation is grounded in scientific evidence, aligned with international standards, and supports the long-term sustainability and health of Canadian communities and ecosystems.

**Note:**  
This regulation is a critical component of Canada’s chemical management strategy and reflects the government’s proactive approach to addressing emerging environmental threats through science-based policy.
