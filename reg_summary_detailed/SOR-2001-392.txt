### **Detailed Summary of the Investment Limits (Bank Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under specific provisions of the **Bank Act**:

- **Section 929a**: Relates to investment limits for bank holding companies in real property.
- **Section 941a**: Addresses the valuation of interests in real property held by bank holding companies.

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations establish precise definitions of key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, which governs banking, financial institutions, and related activities. |
| **Designated Entity** | An entity that is *not* a joint venture, insurance company, securities dealer, or a subsidiary of such. This includes most non-financial entities like real estate developers or private corporations. |
| **Joint Venture** | A real property entity formed by a bank holding company or a designated entity it controls, with a *substantial investment* and *joint control* (regardless of equity distribution). |
| **Real Property Entity** | An entity primarily engaged in holding, managing, or dealing with real property — including incorporated bodies, unincorporated entities, or shares in such entities. |
| **Related Real Property Entity** | A real property entity in which a bank holding company or its designated entity has a *substantial investment* (beneficial ownership), or is controlled by another related real property entity. |
| **Third Party** | Any person *not* the bank holding company, a designated entity controlled by it, or a related real property entity. |
| **Book Value** | For valuation purposes, the book value of an asset (real property, loan, or security) is the value that would appear on a balance sheet prepared under the accounting principles and specifications of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (as defined in subsection 840(4) of the Bank Act). |

#### **3. Exemptions from Certain Provisions of the Bank Act**

Sections 938 to 940 of the Bank Act — which normally impose limits on investments in real property — **do not apply** to:

- A **widely held bank holding company** with **equity of $1 billion or more**; or  
- A bank holding company with **$1 billion or more in equity** that is controlled by:
  - A widely held bank holding company,
  - A widely held insurance holding company,
  - An eligible financial institution (as defined in subsection 370(1) of the Bank Act), *excluding foreign banks*, or
  - A **foreign bank that is widely held**.

> This exemption recognizes that large, well-capitalized institutions with diversified ownership structures are considered less risky and thus subject to fewer restrictions.

---

#### **4. Prescribed Subsidiaries**

For the purposes of sections 938 and 939 of the Bank Act:

- A **prescribed subsidiary** is any subsidiary of a bank holding company **except**:
  - Insurance companies,
  - Securities dealers,
  - Subsidiaries of insurance companies or securities dealers.

> This means that only certain types of subsidiaries are subject to the investment limits in real property.

---

#### **5. Prescribed Percentage Thresholds**

- **Section 938 and 939**: The threshold for triggering investment limits is **70%**.  
  → If a bank holding company or its prescribed subsidiaries hold more than 70% of the equity in a real property entity, the investment is subject to limits.

- **Section 940**: The threshold is **100%**.  
  → If a bank holding company or its subsidiaries hold 100% of the equity in a real property entity, the full investment is subject to stricter scrutiny.

#### **6. Valuation of Interests in Real Property**

This section defines what constitutes an "interest of a bank holding company in real property" and how it is valued.

##### **A. Direct Ownership**
- **Real Property**: Valued at **book value** (gross book value minus accumulated depreciation).
- **Debt Obligations issued for acquisition/improvement of real property**: Valued as the **excess of the book value of the debt over the book value of the real property**.

##### **B. Interests through Related Real Property Entities**
- **Real property in a joint venture or entity with substantial investment**:
  - Valued at **book value** of the real property.
- **Shares/ownership interests** in such entities:
  - Valued at **book value** of the shares/interests.

##### **C. Debt Obligations and Loans**
- **Debt obligations issued by related real property entities**:
  - Valued at **book value** of the debt.
- **Loans made to related real property entities**:
  - Valued at **book value** of the loan.
- **Loans to entities controlled by securities dealers or insurance companies** (or entities controlled by such):
  - Valued at **book value** of the loan.
- **Guaranteed debt obligations**:
  - If the debt is issued by a related real property entity and the guarantee is given by the bank or its designated entity:
    - Value = **excess of face value of guarantee over book value of real property** (if real property is owned by the entity).
    - Otherwise = **face value of guarantee**.
  - For loans guaranteed by the bank or its entity:
    - Value = face value of guarantee (if not secured by real property).

##### **D. Secured Loans or Debt Obligations**
When a loan or debt is secured by **real property** or **shares/ownership interests** of a third party:

- The value of the interest is the **lesser of**:
  1. The **net realizable value** of the third party’s interest in the real property or shares at the time of the security interest;  
  2. A calculated amount based on:
     - **Book value of the loan or debt** (if made by or owned by the bank or designated entity), or
     - **Face value of the guarantee** (if guaranteed by the bank or designated entity),
     - Minus the **total net realizable value of other security interests** given for the same loan/debt,
     - Plus adjustments for the value of the real property or shares involved.

> This ensures that the value of the interest is not overstated due to overlapping security interests.

##### **E. Guarantees and Agreements for Development or Operations**
- **Guarantees to complete development** of real property beneficially owned by:
  - The bank holding company,
  - A designated entity controlled by it, or
  - A related real property entity.
  - → Value = **estimated cost of completing development**.
- **Agreements to support operating or financing costs** of real property:
  - → Value = **amount of funds advanced** under the agreement.

> These are treated as interests in real property even if no direct ownership exists.

---

#### **7. Scope and Application**

- **Division 9 of Part XV of the Bank Act** governs investment limits in real property.
- Sections 8 to 12 define the scope of interests in real property and their valuation.
- **Subsection 937(3)** specifically includes:
  - Real property directly owned,
  - Debt obligations issued to finance real property acquisition or improvement.

> This ensures that even indirect interests (e.g., through secured loans or guarantees) are captured in the regulatory framework.

---

#### **8. Effective Date**

These regulations come into force on the day that **Sections 929 and 941 of the Bank Act**, as amended by **Section 183 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act (S.C. 2001, c. 9)**, come into force.

> The effective date is **October 24, 2001** (as noted in the reference to SI/2001-102).

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Risk Management** | Limits exposure of bank holding companies to real estate risk, which can be volatile and impact financial stability. |
| **Transparency and Valuation** | Establishes a clear, rule-based method for determining what counts as an "interest in real property" and how it should be valued using book value. |

| **Inclusion of Indirect Interests** | Captures not only direct ownership but also loans, guarantees, and agreements related to real property. |
