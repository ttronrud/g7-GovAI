Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1983-431 and Designation of Acting Ministers under the Access to Information Act**

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister), serves two primary purposes:

- **Revokes** an earlier Order in Council (P.C. 1983-431) dated February 17, 1983.
- **Re-designates** specific government officials to act as "Ministers" for different purposes under the *Access to Information Act* (ATIA), as defined in section 3, subsection 4(2), and related provisions (paragraphs 77(1)(f) and (g), and subsection 77(2)).

---

#### **2. Background of the Revoked Order (P.C. 1983-431)**
- The original Order in Council (P.C. 1983-431) designated certain individuals as acting Ministers under the Access to Information Act.
- This regulation effectively **replaces and supersedes** that earlier designation, indicating a change in the administrative structure or policy regarding who is responsible for overseeing the Act’s implementation.

---

#### **3. Key Designations Under the New Regulation**

The regulation establishes two distinct roles for acting Ministers under the Act:

##### **A. Designation of the Minister of Justice**
- **Role**: Acts as the Minister for **specific purposes** under the Act.
- **Legal Basis**: Paragraph (b) of the definition head in **section 3, subsection 4(2)**, and specifically under **paragraphs 77(1)(f) and (g)** and **subsection 77(2)** of the Access to Information Act.
- **Scope of Authority**:
  - This designation applies only to the specific functions or responsibilities outlined in those provisions.
  - These typically relate to **provisions concerning the review of access requests**, **the power to refuse access**, and **the handling of sensitive or protected information** — particularly where the Minister of Justice has jurisdiction over legal or constitutional matters related to information access.
- **Reason for Designation**: The Minister of Justice is entrusted with responsibilities that involve legal interpretation, privacy, and constitutional safeguards, which are central to the Act’s operation in sensitive contexts.

##### **B. Designation of the President of the Treasury Board**
- **Role**: Acts as the Minister for **all other purposes** of the Act.
- **Legal Basis**: All other provisions of the Act not specifically assigned to the Minister of Justice.
- **Scope of Authority**:
  - This includes general administrative oversight, processing of access requests, enforcement of the Act, and management of the Office of the Access to Information.
  - The President of the Treasury Board (a senior government official responsible for financial and administrative policy) is thus empowered to act on behalf of the Minister in all routine and operational matters related to access to information.
- **Reason for Designation**: This reflects a practical administrative decision to assign day-to-day operational responsibilities to a figure with broad authority over federal government operations and administrative policy.

---

#### **4. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- The designation of **acting Ministers** under the Access to Information Act is a procedural mechanism that ensures the Act can be implemented effectively even when the formal Minister (e.g., the Minister of Justice) is not directly involved in a particular function.
- By assigning specific responsibilities to different officials, the government ensures **clear accountability**, **efficient administration**, and **appropriate oversight** based on the nature of the function.
- This regulation reflects a **principle of delegation** within federal governance — allowing for practical implementation while maintaining legal clarity and authority.

---

#### **5. Effective Date and Publication**
- The regulation was published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, on April 8, 1983 (SI/83-48, page 1036)**.
- It is effective from the date of publication, unless otherwise specified.
- As a statutory instrument, it is legally binding and forms part of the official legal framework under the Access to Information Act.

---

#### **6. Implications and Impact**
- **For the Public**: The public can still access information through the established procedures, with the President of the Treasury Board overseeing most access requests, while the Minister of Justice retains a role in legal or constitutional matters.
- **For Government Agencies**: Agencies must direct access requests to the appropriate office based on the nature of the request, with clear lines of responsibility.
- **For Legal Interpretation**: The designation clarifies the division of duties between the Minister of Justice and the President of the Treasury Board, reducing ambiguity in administrative actions.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a **revised administrative directive** that streamlines and clarifies the roles of key government officials in administering the *Access to Information Act*. It revokes outdated designations and assigns current responsibilities more effectively by:
- Designating the **Minister of Justice** to oversee specific, legally sensitive functions (particularly those involving privacy and legal interpretation),
- Assigning the **President of the Treasury Board** to manage all other aspects of the Act’s administration.

This ensures both **legal precision** and **operational efficiency** in the implementation of Canada’s access to information framework.
