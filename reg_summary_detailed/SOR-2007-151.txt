**Detailed Summary of the "MV Sonia" Remission Order, 2007**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The "MV Sonia" Remission Order, 2007 is a statutory instrument issued under the authority of the *Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 1997, c. 36). Specifically, it is made pursuant to **Section 115** of the Customs Tariff Act, which empowers the Governor in Council (the federal government, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to grant remissions of customs duties in certain circumstances.

---

**Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this remission order is to **grant a customs duty remission** to **British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.**, a ferry operator based in Victoria, British Columbia. The remission applies to the **customs duties** that were paid or would have been payable under the *Customs Tariff* in respect of the vessel known as the **MV Sonia**.

The MV Sonia was imported into Canada specifically for use in **coastal ferry services in British Columbia**. The remission recognizes the unique operational and economic role of such vessels in supporting regional transportation, particularly in remote and coastal areas where ferry services are essential for connectivity and economic activity.

---

**Amount of Remission**  
The remission covers the **full amount of customs duties** that were originally paid or would have been payable under the applicable customs tariff provisions for the MV Sonia. This means that the company is entitled to have those duties **offset or refunded**, effectively reducing its financial burden associated with the vessel's importation.

---

**Conditions for Eligibility and Compliance**  
The remission is not automatic and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **Evidence Requirement**  
   The importer (British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.) must **file with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** such evidence as may be reasonably required to verify the eligibility of the remission claim. This evidence may include documentation related to the vessel’s importation, its intended use, operational necessity, and compliance with maritime and regulatory standards.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   The importer must **submit a formal claim for remission** to the **Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the relevant federal minister responsible for customs and border affairs at the time) **within two years** of the date on which this Order comes into force.

> *Note: The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness was the designated minister for customs and border matters during the period when this Order was issued (2007). The current ministerial responsibility may differ, but the procedural requirement remains valid.*

---

**Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate federal registry (e.g., the Canada Gazette). This is a standard practice in Canadian regulatory instruments, ensuring that the legal effect of the order is triggered upon official publication and registration.

---

**Key Implications and Significance**  
- This remission reflects a **targeted policy approach** to support essential regional infrastructure, particularly in coastal British Columbia, where ferry services are critical for public access, economic development, and community resilience.
- It demonstrates the government’s recognition that certain types of vessels used in public transportation or regional mobility may not be subject to standard customs duty assessments due to their public service role.
- The requirement for evidence and a timely claim ensures that the remission is used appropriately and that the integrity of the customs system is maintained.

**Conclusion**  
The "MV Sonia" Remission Order, 2007 is a targeted, legally grounded relief measure that provides a customs duty refund to British Columbia Ferry Services Inc. for the importation of the MV Sonia, a vessel serving coastal ferry operations. It operates under strict conditions—requiring verifiable evidence and timely submission of a claim—to ensure accountability and fairness in the application of customs duties. The Order serves both as a practical support mechanism for regional transportation and as an example of how federal policy can balance economic efficiency with public service needs.
