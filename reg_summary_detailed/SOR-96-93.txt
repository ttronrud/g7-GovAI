### **Detailed Summary of the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve Order**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**

This regulation, known as the **Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve Order**, establishes a national park reserve in the Queen Charlotte Islands (now known as Haida Gwaii), British Columbia, under the authority of the **National Parks Act**.

- **Legal Authority**: The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Communications, exercises powers under **subsection 8.5(2)** of the *National Parks Act*. This provision allows the federal government to designate land as a national park reserve *pending resolution of outstanding Indigenous land claims*.
  
- **Primary Objective**: To protect internationally significant heritage resources within the Gwaii Haanas Archipelago, which holds immense ecological, cultural, and historical value — particularly for the Haida Nation.

- **Context of Dispute**: The Order is issued **while disputes between the Haida Nation and the Government of Canada over land rights, titles, and interests remain unresolved**. Therefore, this designation is not a final settlement of Indigenous rights but a temporary measure to preserve the area for conservation purposes.

#### **2. Designated Area: Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve**

The Order sets aside specific parcels of land in the **Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia**, for the creation of the **Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve**.

- **Geographic Scope**: The reserve lies primarily in the **Queen Charlotte Land District**, within the **Queen Charlotte Islands**.
- **Boundary Description**: The boundary is defined by a detailed, multi-segmented line that begins and ends at specific geographic coordinates and passes through key topographic features such as mountain peaks, watersheds, and shorelines.

#### **3. Detailed Boundary Description (Main Reserve)**

The main reserve boundary follows a complex, precise path described in the Order. Key components include:

1. **Starting Point**:  
   Intersection of **52°50′05″ N latitude** and **131°20′10″ W longitude** — located in **Hecate Strait**, approximately 10 km northeast of Lost Islands.

2. **Path to Tangil Peninsula**:  
   - Westward to the **ordinary high water mark (O.H.W.M.)** at **Porter Head**, near the northern tip of Tangil Peninsula.  
   - This line passes about **2 km north of Lost Islands**.

3. **Southwesterly to Tangil Peak**:  
   - Continues southwesterly to the **most easterly peak on Tangil Peninsula** (approx. 52°48′10″ N, 131°39′39″ W).

4. **Watershed Boundary Movement**:  
   - Travels generally westward along the **watershed boundary** separating creeks flowing into **Dana Inlet** from those into **Logan Inlet**.  
   - Reaches a peak at approx. **52°46′37″ N, 131°49′09″ W**, where it intersects with the northern boundary of the Crescent Inlet watershed.

5. **Southwesterly to Lot 663**:  
   - Proceeds southwesterly to the **northeast corner of Lot 663**.

6. **Along Lot 663’s Boundaries**:  
   - Travels southerly and westerly along the **easterly and southerly boundaries** of Lot 663 to the **intersection with the southerly boundary of the Crescent Inlet watershed**.  
   - This point is marked by a **Pipe Post** and lies on the **northern boundary of South Moresby National Park Reserve** (referenced in Plan 9 Tube 1483 and duplicate Plan 72869).

7. **To the Lockeport Four Mineral Claim**:  
   - Continues generally southwesterly along the **southerly boundary of the Crescent Inlet watershed** and the **Tree Farm Licence 24 Block 2** to the **easterly boundary of the Lockeport Four Mineral Claim (Record No. 5828(2))**.  
   - Marked by another **Pipe Post** on the same boundary.

8. **To the P. Rock Intersection**:  
   - Proceeds southerly and westerly along the mineral claim boundaries to a **P. Rock** at the southerly boundary of the Crescent Inlet watershed.

9. **Along the Watersheds of Crescent Inlet and Tasu Sound**:  
   - Moves generally westward along the **southerly boundaries** of both Crescent Inlet and Tasu Sound.  
   - Crosses the summits of **Apex Mountain, Mount de la Touche, Mount Oliver, and Mount Moody** along the way.

10. **To Tasu Head**:  
    - Reaches the **O.H.W.M. at Tasu Head**, a coastal point on the southern tip of the peninsula.

11. **Final Point**:  
    - Ends at the **intersection of 52°40′36″ N latitude and 132°13′16″ W longitude** — located in the **Pacific Ocean**, approximately 10 km west of Tasu Head.

> This creates a **closed boundary** encompassing a large, ecologically significant area of forested hills, coastal zones, and watersheds.

#### **4. Exclusions (Land Not Included in the Reserve)**

Despite the broad designation, several parcels are **explicitly excluded** from the reserve. These exclusions are due to existing Indigenous reserves, mineral claims, forestry operations, or other land-use designations:

---

##### **(1) Tanoo Indian Reserve No. 9 (Tanu)**  
- The **entire Tanoo Indian Reserve No. 9 (Tanu)** is excluded.  
- This is a **Haida Nation reserve** with recognized Indigenous title and governance.

##### **(2) District Lot 120**  
- **Excluded except for a 66-foot strip** measured from the **ordinary high water mark** (O.H.W.M.).  
- Additionally, **Plan 9837** is excluded from this lot.

##### **(3) Lot 1 of District Lot 120 (Plan 9837)**  
- This specific parcel is fully excluded.

##### **(4) Forest Exclusion Areas 1 to 3**  
These areas are excluded due to existing forestry operations and timber harvesting rights. They include:
- **Blocks 3, 4, and 5** in Schedule "B" of **Tree Farm Licence No. 24 (May 2, 1979)**.
- The **southern and eastern portion of Block 2** of the same licence.
- **Lots 640, 647, 660, and 1940** (corresponding to timber licences TO938, TO943, TO931, and TO950).
- A portion of **Special Timber Licence 1209P (TO924)** lying south of the main boundary.

> These exclusions reflect ongoing **commercial forestry activities** and the need to maintain access for logging operations.

##### **(5) Mineral Exclusion Areas 1 to 5**  
These areas are excluded due to **mineral rights claims** and exploration activities. The exclusions are defined by several distinct paths:

- **Burnaby Island (Poole Point to Francis Bay to Swan Bay)**:  
  - A path from Poole Point (on Burnaby Island’s easterly O.H.W.M.) to the most southerly point of Francis Bay, then to Swan Bay, and back to the starting point via a closed loop.

- **Skincuttle Inlet and Moresby Island**:  
  - Begins at the **northwest corner of Lot 105**, proceeds north to a point west of Deluge Point, then east to Deluge Point, then southeasterly to Ikeda Point, and finally to Marion Rock.

- **Richardson Island and Lyell/Sedgwick Islands**:  
  - Starts at a point on Richardson Island’s westerly shore, proceeds southeasterly to near Lyell and Shuttle Islands, then to Darwin Point, then to Sedgwick Bay, and finally to Dog Island and Tanu Island before returning to the starting point.

- **Heater Harbour and Kunghit Island**:  
  - Begins at the southeast corner of Lot 663, moves along the southern boundary of Lot 663 to the Crescent Inlet watershed, then follows the same path as earlier, and returns via a loop to the southeast corner of Lot 663.

> These exclusions protect **mineral rights**, **existing mining claims**, and **critical infrastructure** related to mineral exploration and extraction.

#### **5. Explanatory Note**

- All topographic features (mountains, inlets, peaks, etc.) referenced in the boundary description are based on:
  - The **Gazetteer of Canada (British Columbia), Third Edition (Ottawa, 1985)**.
  - The **National Topographic Series (N.T.S.) Map 103 B-C Moresby Island (Edition 2)** at a scale of **1:50,000**.

> This ensures accuracy and consistency in mapping and legal interpretation.
