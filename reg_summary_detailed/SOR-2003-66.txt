### **Detailed Summary of the Information Technology Activities (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Context and Authority**

These regulations were made under the authority of **section 977a and section 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (Act)**, by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.

- **Statutory Reference**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 47  

This regulation establishes specific restrictions on **insurance holding companies** (IHCs) regarding their investments in or control of entities involved in **information technology (IT) activities**, particularly those related to data transmission, information platforms, and communication systems.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The following definitions apply throughout the regulation:

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act* (the primary legislation governing insurance companies in Canada).

- **"Balance sheet value"** (in respect of shares and ownership interests):  
  - Means the **value reported on an unconsolidated basis** in the entity’s balance sheet.  
  - *Note*: The term "book value" was previously used but has been **repealed** by **SOR/2008-168, s. 21**, so it is no longer in effect.

> This ensures that valuation is based on actual financial reporting rather than accounting methods like carrying value or fair market value.

---

#### **3. Definition of a "Prescribed Activity"**

A **prescribed activity** under paragraph **971(2)(f)** of the Act includes any of the following:

- Developing  
- Designing  
- Holding  
- Managing  
- Manufacturing  
- Selling  
- Or otherwise dealing with  

any of the following:

- A **data transmission system**  
- An **information site**  
- A **communication device**  
- An **information platform or portal**  

that is used to **provide information services**.

> This broadly defines IT-based services that support digital information delivery—such as websites, cloud platforms, messaging systems, or data networks used for delivering content or services.

#### **4. Prohibited Investments in IT Entities**

An **insurance holding company (IHC)** is **prohibited from**:

- Acquiring control of,  
- Holding, acquiring, or increasing a substantial investment in,  

an entity that engages in a prescribed IT activity **if** the **sum of the following exceeds 5% of the IHC’s regulatory capital**:

1. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of the shares and ownership interests the IHC and its subsidiaries would acquire in the entity under paragraph 971(2)(f) of the Act.

2. **Aggregate balance sheet value** of shares and ownership interests held by the IHC and its subsidiaries in **other entities** engaged in prescribed IT activities that the IHC controls or holds a substantial investment in.

3. **Aggregate value of outstanding loans** made by the IHC and its subsidiaries to entities engaged in prescribed IT activities that the IHC controls or holds a substantial investment in.

> 🔍 **Key Implication**:  
> Even indirect exposure (through subsidiaries or loans) is subject to a **5% regulatory capital threshold**. This creates a **strict cap** on financial exposure to IT service providers.

> ⚠️ The 5% threshold is **not a percentage of total assets**, but rather of **regulatory capital**, which is a key measure of financial stability and risk absorption.

---

#### **5. Additional Prohibitions: Activities That Are Not Permitted**

An IHC may **not** acquire control of or increase a substantial investment in an entity that engages in any of the following:

- **Accepting deposit liabilities** (e.g., acting like a bank or financial institution).  
  > This prevents insurance holding companies from engaging in banking-like activities through IT firms.

- **Engaging in activities prohibited under specific sections of the Act**, including:
  - **Section 466** (prohibitions on certain types of financial activities)
  - **Section 469** (prohibitions on dealing in certain securities)
  - **Section 475** (prohibitions on dealing in certain goods or services)

- **Dealing in securities**, except:
  - As permitted under **paragraph 971(2)(e)** of the Act (limited exceptions), or  
  - As permitted to a company under **paragraph 440(2)(b)** of the Act (e.g., specific investment-related exceptions).

- **Dealing in goods, wares, or merchandise** that a company is not permitted to deal in under **subsection 441(3)** of the Act — **except where permitted**.

- **Engaging in activities prohibited under section 489 regulations** if:
  - The entity is a **finance entity**, or  
  - The entity is any other entity prescribed under **paragraph 971(3)(c)** of the Act.

> These restrictions ensure that IT companies engaged with insurance holding companies do not operate in areas that pose systemic or financial risks.

#### **6. Exceptions to Prohibition on Acquiring Control**

An IHC **may** acquire control or a substantial investment in an entity **only if** one of the following applies:

- In the case of an entity **controlled by the IHC**:
  - A company would be **permitted under Part IX of the Act** to acquire a substantial investment in the other entity.

- In the case of an entity **not controlled by the IHC**:
  - A company would be permitted to acquire a substantial investment in the entity under:
    - Subsection **493(2)**  
    - Paragraphs **493(3)(b)** or **(c)**  
    - Subsection **493(4)** or **495(1)** or **(2)** of the Act.

> This allows for **limited exceptions** where the investment is consistent with broader insurance company governance and regulatory frameworks.

---

#### **7. Exception to Subsection 495(6) to (8)**

- **Subsections 495(6) to (8)** of the Act (which may impose additional restrictions on investment in certain entities) **do not apply** when determining whether a company is permitted to acquire a substantial investment in an entity under the exceptions in subsection 493(2), (3)(b)/(c), or (4), or under 495(1)/(2).

> This is a **critical exception** that simplifies compliance for certain investments in IT entities, by removing specific risk-based limitations.

---

#### **8. Exemption for Limited IT Activities**

- **Subsection 971(5)** of the Act (which typically restricts certain investments) **does not apply** when:
  - An IHC acquires control of or increases a substantial investment in an entity whose business is **limited to** the activities described in **subsection 2(1)** (i.e., prescribed IT activities).

> This means that **if the IT entity’s only business is in providing information services** (like a website or platform), the IHC can invest without triggering broader prohibitions under 971(5).

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:  
> This exemption **does not limit** the operation of **subsections 2(2) and (3)** — meaning the 5% capital threshold and other restrictions still apply.

---

#### **9. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

> This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication.
