**Detailed Summary of the *Prescribed Deposits (Retail Associations Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations***

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Retail Associations Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 378.1(5)a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCA)**.

#### **Purpose:**
To define and regulate specific types of deposits—referred to as *prescribed deposits*—that are made by certain entities into **retail cooperative credit associations** (also known as "retail associations") that are **not covered by deposit insurance** under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act.

This regulation establishes a framework to determine which deposits are considered "prescribed" and therefore subject to specific rules, particularly regarding the **first deposit transaction** and the **eligibility of depositors**.

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations introduce several key definitions that are essential to understanding their scope and application:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCA). |
| **Deposit** | Has the meaning assigned in the *Schedule to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act*, **but excluding subsections 2(2), (5), and (6)** of that schedule. This means deposits are defined in the same way as for CDIC insurance purposes, **except** that certain exclusions (such as deposits by certain public or foreign entities) are not applied. This ensures that the definition remains consistent with standard CDIC criteria, but allows for exceptions in this regulation. |
| **First Deposit Transaction** | The initial deposit made between a person and a retail association (as defined below) in relation to a prescribed deposit. This is a critical concept because it triggers certain regulatory obligations or reporting requirements. |

### **3. What Constitutes a "Prescribed Deposit"?**

A *prescribed deposit* is defined as a deposit of **less than $150,000** made by a retail association (as defined in paragraph 378.1(1)(b) or (c) of the CCA) from one of the following categories of entities:

#### **A. Entities of the Government of Canada or a Province**
- Her Majesty in right of Canada or a province;
- An agent of the Crown (e.g., a municipal or public body with governmental functions);
- An entity **controlled** by the Crown in either of those rights.

> *Example:* A provincial government department or a municipal council making a deposit.

#### **B. Foreign Governments or Their Subdivisions**
- Government of a foreign country;
- Political subdivisions of that country (e.g., state, city);
- Agencies of the foreign government or its subdivisions;
- Entities **controlled** by any of the above.

> *Example:* A foreign government ministry or a foreign central bank.

#### **C. International Agencies (Canada-Member)**
- International financial institutions to which Canada is a member, including:
  - Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
  - Asian Development Bank (ADB)
  - Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
  - European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
  - Any other regional bank to which Canada is a member
- Any international agency to which Canada is a member and that is a member of the **World Bank Group**.

> *Example:* A deposit from the World Bank or the IDB into a Canadian retail cooperative.

#### **D. Financial Institutions**
- Any entity that is a financial institution (e.g., banks, credit unions, insurance companies).

#### **E. Pension Funds**
- A pension fund maintained for a pension plan registered for income tax purposes;
- The fund must have **total assets under administration exceeding $100 million** at the time of the first deposit transaction.

> *Note:* This threshold ensures that only large, well-established pension funds are included.

#### **F. Mutual Funds**
- A mutual fund regulated under:
  - A provincial law, or
  - Laws of a jurisdiction outside Canada
- The fund must have **total assets under management exceeding $10 million** at the time of the first deposit.

> *Note:* This ensures that only significant mutual funds are eligible.

#### **G. Entities with High Revenue**
- An entity that, in the fiscal year immediately before the first deposit transaction, had **gross revenues exceeding $5 million**.

> *Note:* This is a broad category that includes large businesses, corporations, or non-financial institutions.

#### **H. Any Other Entity (Conditional)**
- Any other entity may qualify **if** the deposit facilitates one or more of the following services provided by the retail association:
  - **Lending money**
  - **Dealing in foreign exchange**
  - **Dealing in securities** (excluding debt obligations of the retail association itself)

> *Example:* A foreign company deposits money into a cooperative to enable it to offer foreign exchange services.

> *Important:* This conditional provision allows flexibility but requires that the deposit directly supports specific financial services.

### **4. Regulatory Effect and Implementation**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 160 of *An Act to amend the law governing financial institutions and to provide for related and consequential matters*** (S.C. 2007, c. 6) comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered after that date**, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> *Note:* The regulations were in force as of **March 8, 2008** (as referenced in SI/2008-33).

### **5. Context and Rationale**

This regulation was introduced to:

- **Address gaps in deposit insurance coverage** for certain retail credit associations (which are not covered by CDIC).
- **Identify and monitor high-value, strategic deposits** from public, foreign, or institutional sources that may pose financial or systemic risks.
- **Ensure transparency and accountability** in the operations of retail associations, especially when dealing with large or foreign entities.
- **Provide clarity** on which deposits are considered "prescribed" and thus subject to specific regulatory scrutiny or reporting obligations under the CCA.

By limiting prescribed deposits to those under **$150,000**, the regulation avoids overreach while still capturing significant deposits from public or institutional sources that could impact financial stability.

### **6. Key Implications**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No CDIC Insurance** | These deposits are **not covered** by CDIC insurance, which means depositors bear the full risk of loss if the retail association fails. |
| **Regulatory Scrutiny** | Retail associations must maintain records and possibly report first deposit transactions involving prescribed deposits. |
| **Risk Management** | The definition of prescribed deposits helps regulators identify and monitor potentially risky or strategic financial relationships. |
| **Institutional Access** | Large pension funds, mutual funds, and foreign governments can access retail associations for services like lending or FX, but only under defined conditions. |

### **7. Conclusion**

The *Prescribed Deposits (Retail Associations Without Deposit Insurance) Regulations* serve as a targeted regulatory tool to define which deposits into **retail cooperative credit associations** are considered **prescribed** and thus fall outside the scope of deposit insurance. It provides a clear, structured list of qualifying entities, with specific financial thresholds and service-based conditions.

The regulation enhances financial oversight, promotes transparency, and protects the integrity of the cooperative credit system by ensuring that deposits from high-risk or strategic sources are properly identified and monitored—especially since these deposits are not protected by CDIC.

It reflects a balance between enabling access to financial services for public and institutional entities and safeguarding the stability of the cooperative credit sector.
