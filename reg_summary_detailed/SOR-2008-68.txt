**Detailed Summary of the Shared Premises Regulations (Trust and Loan Companies)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

The *Shared Premises Regulations (Trust and Loan Companies)* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**, under **paragraph 413.3(4)(a)a** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (TCLA).  

This provision grants the Governor General the authority to make regulations that define specific conditions under which trust and loan companies may operate in shared premises with affiliated institutions.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure the separation of banking and deposit-taking activities** between a trust and loan company and its affiliated member institution when both operate from shared physical premises.

Specifically, the regulation aims to **protect depositors** by ensuring that when a customer requests to open a deposit account with a trust and loan company, that account is opened in a **separate and distinct work space** from any area where the affiliated member institution (such as a credit union or financial institution under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation — CDIC) is conducting business.

This separation is intended to prevent **confusion or potential conflicts of interest**, and to maintain **the integrity and trustworthiness** of deposit-taking operations, which are subject to CDIC insurance and strict regulatory oversight.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

- **"Member institution"** is defined in accordance with **Section 2 of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDICA)**.  
  This means it refers to any financial institution that is a member of the CDIC and is eligible for deposit insurance, such as credit unions, cooperatives, or other registered institutions under the CDIC framework.

---

### **4. Scope of the Regulation**

The regulation applies to **companies that are subject to paragraph 413(1)(b) or (c)** of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*. These paragraphs typically define entities that are:

- **Affiliated with a member institution**, or  
- Engaged in financial activities that are closely linked to such institutions.

These companies may operate in **shared premises** with a member institution — for example, a shared office building or a multi-tenant space — **provided** that a strict condition is met.

### **5. Core Requirement: Physical Separation of Workspaces**

The central condition of the regulation is:

> Whenever a request is made **in person** to open a deposit account with the company, the company must open the account **in a work space that is separate and distinct** from every work space where the member institution carries on business.

This means:

- The company must **not** open deposit accounts in the same physical space (e.g., office, lobby, counter) used by the affiliated member institution.
- The space designated for opening deposit accounts must be **physically isolated** — for instance, a dedicated private room, a different floor, or a separate area with distinct signage and access.
- The separation must be **clear and tangible**, not merely administrative or symbolic.

This requirement applies specifically to **in-person requests** for deposit accounts. It does not extend to electronic applications, phone calls, or online services, which are not subject to the same physical presence requirement.

---

### **6. Effective Date and Implementation**

- The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 358 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007 (S.C. 2007, c. 6)** comes into force.
- This section is part of an Act that amends the law governing financial institutions and related matters.
- However, if the regulations are **registered (published) after** the initial effective date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

This allows for a phased implementation and ensures that institutions have sufficient time to comply with the new requirements.

---

### **7. Historical and Current Status**

- The regulation was originally introduced in **1991 (S.C. 1991, c. 45)** and updated in **2007** under the new statutory framework.
- As of **March 8, 2008**, the regulations were in force and are referenced in **SI/2008-33** (Statutory Instrument 2008-33), confirming their current validity and applicability.

---

### **8. Regulatory Intent and Underlying Principles**

The regulation reflects broader financial regulatory principles, including:

- **Consumer protection**: Ensuring that depositors are not exposed to confusion or potential fraud due to shared physical spaces.
- **Separation of duties**: Maintaining clear boundaries between different types of financial institutions, especially those under different regulatory regimes.
- **Transparency and accountability**: Ensuring that the process of opening a deposit account is transparent and clearly distinguishable from other financial services offered by affiliated institutions.

---

### **9. Implications for Financial Institutions**

For trust and loan companies and their affiliated member institutions:

- **Shared office spaces are permitted**, but only under strict conditions.
- Institutions must **designate and maintain physically separate workspaces** for deposit account opening.
- Compliance may require **physical reorganization**, signage, internal policies, and staff training.
- Non-compliance could result in regulatory penalties or loss of deposit insurance eligibility.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Shared Premises Regulations (Trust and Loan Companies)* establish a clear, enforceable standard to ensure that when a trust and loan company operates in shared premises with a CDIC-member institution, **deposit account opening occurs in a physically distinct space**. This protects depositors, upholds regulatory integrity, and reinforces the separation between different types of financial services. The regulation is both legally grounded and operationally practical, with a clear effective date and a well-defined scope.

This rule remains a key component of Canada’s financial sector oversight, particularly in promoting transparency and trust in the deposit-taking process.
