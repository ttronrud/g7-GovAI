**Detailed Summary of the *International Bridges and Tunnels Regulations* (S.C. 2007, c. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *International Bridges and Tunnels Regulations*, made under the authority of the *International Bridges and Tunnels Act*, establish a comprehensive framework for the inspection, evaluation, and maintenance of international bridges and tunnels—structures that connect Canada to foreign jurisdictions. These regulations ensure the safety, structural integrity, and operational efficiency of such critical infrastructure by mandating regular inspections, condition assessments, and transparent reporting to the federal government.

The regulations are administered by the **Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities**, on the recommendation of the Minister, and apply specifically to **international bridges and tunnels** (those connecting Canada to a place outside Canada), excluding railway bridges and tunnels.

## **Key Provisions and Components**

---

### **1. Definitions and Key Terms**

The regulations begin with a detailed list of definitions that clarify key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Bridge Inspection Manual** | The official Canadian Department of Public Works and Government Services manual (March 2001 English, October 2005 French) on bridge inspection. |
| **Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CAN/CSA-S6-06)** | The primary design standard for highway bridges in Canada, published by CSA in 2006. |
| **Detailed Visual Inspection** | A thorough, element-by-element visual and hands-on assessment of materials, defects, performance, and maintenance needs—especially of fracture-critical components. |
| **Engineer** | A licensed professional from the *Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec* or a provincial/state professional engineering association. |
| **Highway and Rail Transit Tunnel Inspection Manual (2005)** | A U.S. Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration manual for tunnel inspections. |
| **Manual for Condition Evaluation of Bridges** | The second edition of the AASHTO manual, including 2001 and 2003 revisions, used for bridge condition assessment. |
| **Manuel d’évaluation de la capacité portante des structures** | A Quebec Ministry of Transport manual (Dec 2005) for evaluating a structure’s load-bearing capacity. |
| **Manuel d’inspection des structures — Évaluation des dommages** | A Quebec manual (Dec 2004, updated Nov 2005) for evaluating structural damage. |
| **New York State Bridge Inspection Manual (1997)** | Includes Addenda from 1999 and 2001; used as a reference for bridge inspection practices. |
| **Ontario Structure Inspection Manual (OSIM)** | A provincial manual (Oct 2000, revised Nov 2003, Apr 2008) used for structural inspection. |
| **Underwater Inspection** | Visual or tactile inspection of submerged parts of a bridge, including scouring (erosion of soil around foundations). |

> **Note**: In case of inconsistency between incorporated documents and the Regulations themselves, the **Regulations prevail**.  
> Also, in interpretation, the word **"should"** in incorporated documents is treated as **"shall"**—meaning it is mandatory.
