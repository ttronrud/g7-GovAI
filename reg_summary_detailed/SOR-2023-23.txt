### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Issuing a Direction to the CRTC on a Renewed Approach to Telecommunications Policy**  
*(S.C. 2023, c. 14 – Registered in the Canada Gazette, Part I, June 2023)*

---

## **1. Background and Context**

This regulation, issued under **section 8 of the *Telecommunications Act* (S.C. 1993, c. 38)**, represents a **comprehensive renewal and modernization** of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission’s (CRTC) policy framework for regulating the telecommunications sector. It replaces two prior directions:

- The **2006 Direction** (SOR/2006-355): A foundational policy direction issued in 2006 to implement Canada’s telecommunications policy objectives.
- The **2019 Direction** (SOR/2019-227): A more focused update aimed at promoting competition, affordability, consumer interests, and innovation.

The current Order is the result of significant market evolution, technological change, and growing concerns about equity, accessibility, and competition in both fixed and mobile wireless markets. The Government of Canada has recognized that the previous frameworks no longer fully reflect the realities of today’s digital economy and must be updated to ensure a fair, resilient, and inclusive telecommunications ecosystem.

## **2. Legal Basis and Process**

The Order was developed through a rigorous, transparent, and constitutionally compliant process under **section 10 of the *Telecommunications Act***:

- The **Minister of Industry** proposed the Order in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **June 4, 2022**, with a public consultation period.
- Interested parties (including service providers, consumers, civil society groups, and provincial governments) were given a **reasonable opportunity to make representations**.
- The proposed Order was **laid before both Houses of Parliament**, and **40 sitting days** have elapsed since its tabling — fulfilling the statutory requirement for parliamentary review.
- The Minister **consulted the CRTC** both before and after publication, ensuring stakeholder input was integrated into the final version.
- The Minister **notified provincial ministers** of intent to recommend the Order and provided them with an opportunity to consult — fulfilling the requirement under **section 13** of the Act.

After this process, the **Governor in Council** formally adopted the Order on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry, making it legally binding.

## **3. Core Policy Objectives**

The CRTC is now required to implement the **Canadian telecommunications policy objectives** as set out in **section 7 of the *Telecommunications Act*** — namely:

> **Competition, Affordability, Consumer Interests, and Innovation**

These objectives are now operationalized through a detailed set of principles and actions.

---

## **4. Key Principles and Responsibilities of the CRTC**

### **A. Promoting Competition, Affordability, and Innovation**

The Commission must ensure that all decisions:
- Encourage **all forms of competition** and investment, especially from new entrants, regional players, and smaller providers.
- Foster **affordability and lower prices**, particularly when large incumbent providers exercise market power.
- Ensure **affordable, high-quality, reliable, and resilient access** to telecommunications services across **all regions**, including:
  - Rural areas
  - Remote areas
  - Indigenous communities
- Reduce **barriers to entry** for new and smaller service providers.
- Enable **innovation** in services (e.g., new technologies, differentiated offerings).
- Stimulate investment in **research and development (R&D)** and other intangible assets that support telecommunications.

> **Note**: The Commission must base decisions on **sound, recent evidence** and have the authority to obtain necessary evidence.

---

### **B. Transparency, Predictability, and Timeliness**

- Decisions and proceedings must be **transparent, predictable, and coherent**.
- The Commission must ensure that **measures imposed are efficient and proportionate** to their purpose.
- It must **conduct proceedings and issue decisions in a timely manner** to provide market clarity.
- Consider adopting **new processes or engaging external experts** to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

---

### **C. Market Monitoring and Strategic Foresight**

- The Commission must **develop strong, timely market monitoring, research, and strategic foresight capabilities**.
- These insights must be used to inform policy decisions, regulatory actions, and long-term planning.

---

## **5. Specific Regulatory Requirements by Market Segment**

---

### **Fixed Internet Market**

#### **1. Wholesale Services Mandate**
- The CRTC **must maintain a regulatory framework** mandating the provision of **wholesale fixed Internet services** at **just and reasonable rates**.
- This framework must be **monitored regularly** and **adjusted as needed**, including through **proactive reforms**.

#### **2. Aggregated Wholesale High-Speed Access Service**
- The Commission **must mandate an aggregated wholesale high-speed access service** — in addition to any other types — **until it determines that broad, sustainable, and meaningful competition will persist without such a mandate**.
- This ensures that even if competition develops, there is a fallback mechanism to protect consumer access.

#### **3. Diverse Speed Options**
- The Commission **must mandate wholesale services with a variety of speeds**, including **low-cost options**, to ensure **affordable access** while enabling network modernization.

#### **4. Tariff Setting**
- The Commission should **set interim and final tariffs expediently**.
- It should **reform the tariff-setting process** and consider:
  - External expert advice
  - International best practices

#### **5. Equitable Application**
- The framework must apply **equitably** to all carriers subject to it — regardless of size or market position.

---

### **Mobile Wireless Market**

#### **1. Wholesale Roaming Access**
- The CRTC **must maintain a framework** mandating **wholesale roaming access** at **just and reasonable rates** to ensure users can access services across networks.

#### **2. Facilities-Based Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Access**
- The Commission must **monitor and assess** the effectiveness of its mandate requiring facilities-based MVNO access.
- This includes evaluating:
  - The impact of **lower-density or remote region characteristics**
  - Deployment timelines and challenges in these areas
- The Commission may **extend the duration of the mandate** if it determines such extension is necessary.

#### **3. Review and Adjustment**
- The Commission must **periodically review** the effectiveness of its mobile wireless regulatory framework.
