**Detailed Summary of the Exchange Rate (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The Exchange Rate (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This action is authorized under specific provisions of the *Bank Act* of Canada:

- **Subsection 545(2)a** and **(6)a** of the *Bank Act* provide the legal basis for establishing rules governing the exchange rates used in transactions involving deposits with authorized foreign banks.

**Purpose of the Regulations:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to define the method by which the exchange rate used in determining the value of a deposit made in a foreign currency (other than Canadian currency) with an authorized foreign bank shall be calculated. Specifically, the regulations establish a clear and transparent rule for determining the exchange rate that will be applied when converting such deposits into Canadian dollars for accounting or reporting purposes.

**Key Provision:**

> *"For the purposes of subsection 545(2) of the Bank Act, the rate of exchange that shall be applied on any day in determining the amount in Canadian dollars of a deposit with an authorized foreign bank in a currency of a country other than Canada is the latest exchange rate at which the authorized foreign bank offers, before the day of the determination, to buy that currency with Canadian dollars."*

**Interpretation and Application:**

- The exchange rate used to convert a foreign currency deposit into Canadian dollars is **not** the market rate or the rate published by a central bank or financial exchange (such as the Bank of Canada or a foreign central bank).
- Instead, it is the **buying rate** offered by the **authorized foreign bank** itself — that is, the rate at which the bank is willing to purchase the foreign currency from a customer using Canadian dollars.
- This rate must be the **most recent rate** available **before the day on which the deposit amount is being determined** (i.e., the valuation date).
- This ensures that the rate reflects the actual transactional rate the bank would use in its operations, rather than a hypothetical or average market rate.

**Scope of Application:**

- Applies specifically to **deposits made with authorized foreign banks**.
- Applies only to **currencies of countries other than Canada**.
- The rule applies to the **determination of the Canadian dollar equivalent** of such deposits, which is essential for financial reporting, capital adequacy, and regulatory compliance under the *Bank Act*.

**Effective Date:**

- These regulations came into force on **June 28, 1999**.

**Regulatory Context and Significance:**

- This regulation enhances transparency and consistency in how foreign currency deposits are valued within the Canadian financial system.
- By anchoring the exchange rate to the bank’s actual buying rate, it aligns with the principle of fair value and ensures that financial institutions are not using inflated or speculative exchange rates in their reporting.
- It supports the regulatory framework designed to maintain financial stability and protect Canadian depositors and financial institutions from currency-related risks.

**Historical Background:**

- The regulations were first introduced in **1991** (S.C. 1991, c. 46) and were later amended or reaffirmed in **1999** (S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 35(1)), indicating ongoing regulatory attention to currency valuation practices in foreign banking operations.

**Conclusion:**

The Exchange Rate (Authorized Foreign Banks) Regulations provide a clear, rule-based mechanism for determining the exchange rate used in valuing foreign currency deposits held at authorized foreign banks. By specifying that the rate must be the latest buying rate offered by the bank before the valuation date, the regulation ensures accuracy, fairness, and consistency in financial reporting under the *Bank Act*. This helps maintain transparency, regulatory compliance, and financial integrity in Canada’s international banking sector.
