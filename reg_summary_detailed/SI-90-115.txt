### **Regulation Summary**

**Title:** Order Regarding the Inclusion of Specific Lands in the Sale of Tuktoyaktuk Harbour Lands  
**Issuing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**On the recommendation of:** The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 13(a) of the *Territorial Lands Act*  
**Jurisdiction:** Northwest Territories, Canada  

---

### **Key Provisions and Details**

1. **Purpose of the Regulation**  
   This regulation establishes that a specific portion of land located within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of **Tuktoyaktuk Harbour** shall be **included in the sale** of the lands described in the schedule attached to the order.

   - The inclusion of this land is not a separate conveyance but rather a **specific directive** to ensure that lands adjacent to the harbour — particularly those in close proximity to the water’s edge — are part of the overall land sale process.
   - The rationale likely relates to land use planning, environmental protection, infrastructure development, or Indigenous land rights considerations, though the exact context is not specified in the text.

2. **Geographic Scope of the Land in Question**  
   The regulation specifically identifies the following parcel:
   - **Lots 1007 to 1024 inclusive**
   - Located in **Quad 107 C/8**
   - Near **Tuktoyaktuk**, Northwest Territories

3. **Legal Description and Recordation**  
   - The lots are defined by reference to a **plan of survey of record number 71375**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** at Ottawa.
   - A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife** under reference number **1941**.
   - This ensures that the legal description of the lots is officially documented and accessible for registration and future reference.

4. **Boundary Reference: Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)**  
   - The regulation explicitly includes **any portion of the described lands** that lies within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark** of Tuktoyaktuk Harbour.
   - This boundary is a critical geographical and legal demarcation, often used in land use, access rights, and environmental management.
   - The inclusion of land within this 100-foot zone implies that the sale may affect or include areas of potential environmental sensitivity, access to water, or Indigenous traditional use areas.

5. **Legal Authority**  
   - The order is issued under **paragraph 13(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which generally empowers the Governor General in Council to make orders regarding the disposition or sale of territorial lands.
   - This provision allows for the **sale of land** or the **transfer of land rights**, including adjustments or inclusions based on geographical or administrative criteria.

### **Implications and Significance**

- **Land Sale Process:** The regulation is a formal step in the process of selling a parcel of land, with a clear directive to include the water-adjacent portion in the transaction.
- **Environmental and Cultural Considerations:** The inclusion of land within 100 feet of the harbour may have implications for:
  - Coastal erosion
  - Access to traditional lands or activities (e.g., fishing, hunting)
  - Indigenous rights and title (especially given the involvement of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development)
- **Legal Clarity:** By referencing a specific survey plan and filing number, the regulation ensures transparency, traceability, and legal enforceability of the land boundaries involved.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a formal, legally binding directive that:
- Specifies that a defined parcel of land (Lots 1007 to 1024 in Quad 107 C/8 near Tuktoyaktuk) is to be included in a land sale;
- Explicitly includes any portion of that parcel lying within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the Ordinary High Water Mark of Tuktoyaktuk Harbour;
- Is grounded in the Territorial Lands Act and supported by official survey records;
- Provides clarity and legal certainty for stakeholders, including landowners, Indigenous communities, and government agencies involved in land administration and sale.

It reflects a practical application of land management policy in a remote Arctic region, where water boundaries and land use are particularly sensitive and significant.
