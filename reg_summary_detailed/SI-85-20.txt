Certainly. Below is a **detailed and structured summary** of the regulation titled:

---

### **Computer Carrier Media Remission Order**  
**(S.C. 1980–81–82–83, c. 170, s. 4)**

---

## **Overview**

This regulation, known as the *Computer Carrier Media Remission Order*, was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**. The purpose of the Order is to **remit (i.e., refund) certain customs duties and sales taxes** on specific types of computer-related goods — specifically, **computer carrier media** — in order to promote the development and accessibility of software in Canada.

The Order is designed to correct a perceived over-taxation of software content by treating the **value of stored instructions or data** as part of the media’s value, rather than as a separate, taxable component. It effectively reduces the tax burden on software by refunding the difference between the taxes paid on the full value of the media and the taxes that would have applied if only the physical carrier (without the software content) were taxed.

---

## **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and precision, the Order provides clear definitions of key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Carrier media** | Goods capable of storing instructions or data to be processed by data processing equipment (e.g., floppy disks, CDs, tapes). |
| **Computer carrier media** | A subset of carrier media that specifically refers to **software**. It **excludes** sound or image recordings, integrated circuits, semiconductors, or devices incorporating such components. |
| **Software** | Carrier media on which instructions or data intended for use by data processing equipment have been stored. |

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The term "computer carrier media" is defined narrowly to **exclude** physical components like chips, semiconductors, or audio/video recordings. This ensures that only software-bearing media (e.g., a CD-ROM with pre-installed programs) are eligible for remission.

---

## **Main Provision: Tax Remission**

Under **Section 3**, the Order grants a **remission (refund)** of customs duties and sales taxes in respect of computer carrier media **if** the following conditions are met:

### **The Remission Amount**
The refund is equal to the **difference between two amounts**:

1. **Total taxes paid or payable** on the computer carrier media (customs duties + sales tax), based on the **full value** of the media (including the software content).

2. **Total taxes that would have been payable** if the media were valued only by its **physical carrier value** — that is:
   - The **value of the carrier media excluding** the value of the instructions or data stored on it.
   - **Plus** the cost of reproducing the instructions or data on the media.

> In simpler terms:  
> *If a CD-ROM is taxed as if it were just a blank disc, then the difference between the tax on the full CD-ROM and the tax on the blank disc (plus reproduction cost) is refunded.*

This mechanism ensures that the **value of the software content itself** is not subject to double taxation — it is treated as part of the media's value, not as a separate, taxable product.

## **Conditions for Eligibility**

Remission is **only granted** if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. **Date of Importation**  
   The computer carrier media must be **imported on or after January 1, 1985**.  
   → This establishes a clear policy start date, ensuring the remission applies only to imports made after a defined threshold.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within two years** of the date of importation.  
   → This creates a strict deadline for claiming the refund, ensuring timely administration and reducing administrative burden.

3. **Compliance with Reporting Requirements**  
   Any individual or entity claiming remission must provide **such reports and information** as the Minister of National Revenue may reasonably require for the administration of the Order.  
   → This ensures transparency, accountability, and proper oversight of the remission process.

---

## **Legal Basis**

The Order is authorized under **Section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Minister of Finance and the Treasury Board) to make regulations for the administration of financial matters in the public interest.

The use of this section reflects the government’s discretion to act in the **public interest**, particularly in fostering technological development and supporting innovation in the software industry.

---

## **Public Interest Rationale**

The regulation was introduced to:

- **Promote the development and availability of software** in Canada by reducing the cost of importing software-bearing media.
- Prevent **double taxation** of software content — where the value of instructions/data is taxed both as part of the media and as a separate product.
- Support the **growth of the Canadian information technology sector** by making software more affordable and accessible.
- Encourage **innovation and investment** in software development and distribution.

---

## **Key Implications**

- **Tax Relief**: Importers of computer carrier media (e.g., software CDs, DVDs, floppy disks) may receive a refund of the difference between the actual tax paid and the tax that would have applied to the physical media alone.
- **Exclusions**: Physical devices like chips, semiconductors, or audio/video recordings are **not eligible** — they are treated as separate goods.
- **Time Limit**: Claims must be filed within **two years** of importation — failure to do so results in ineligibility.
- **Administrative Oversight**: The Minister of National Revenue retains authority to request documentation or reports to verify claims.

## **Conclusion**

The *Computer Carrier Media Remission Order* is a targeted fiscal policy tool designed to support the Canadian software industry by **remitting customs duties and sales taxes** on computer carrier media that contain software content. It achieves this by recognizing the **value of stored software instructions** as part of the media’s value and refunding the over-collected taxes.

By applying a clear definition of "computer carrier media," setting a specific import date threshold, and enforcing a two-year claim window, the Order balances **fiscal responsibility** with **support for technological advancement** in Canada.
