---

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Status of the Regulation**
- The regulation is **no longer in force**.
- It was **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument 2012 No. 7**, which was issued in the United Kingdom (as SI numbers are typically used in UK statutory instruments).
- The repetition of the same entry 100 times suggests that this may have been a copy-paste error or a formatting issue in the original document, possibly from a legislative database or list where multiple references to the same repealed item were listed redundantly.

#### 2. **What Does "Repealed, SI/2012-7" Mean?**
- In UK law, a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** is a type of secondary legislation used to make rules and regulations under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
- **SI 2012/7** is the specific instrument that formally **repealed** the regulation in question.
- The repeal means that the content of the regulation is **no longer legally binding** and has been **superseded** by the provisions of SI 2012/7 or by other current legislation.

#### 3. **Nature of the Regulation (Inferred)**
- Since the original regulation is not provided, we cannot determine its exact subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, employment rules, health and safety, etc.).
- However, the fact that it was repealed by SI 2012/7 suggests it was likely a **specific administrative or procedural rule** that was either outdated, inconsistent with new policy, or redundant after the introduction of more comprehensive or updated legislation.

#### 4. **Legal Consequences of Repeal**
- Any legal obligations, duties, or rights established by the regulation are **no longer enforceable**.
- Any references to the regulation in contracts, court decisions, or other legal documents must be updated to reflect the current law.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative reform aimed at simplifying the legal framework, improving clarity, or aligning with new policy objectives.

#### 5. **Source and Context**
- SI 2012/7 is a **UK Statutory Instrument**. To understand the full context, one would need to consult the actual text of SI 2012/7.
- SI 2012/7 is titled **"The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (Commencement No. 11) Order 2012"**, or possibly another instrument — however, this must be verified from official sources such as:
  - [UK Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)
  - The National Archives (for historical instruments)

> ⚠️ **Note**: Without knowing the exact title or subject of the original regulation, a detailed summary of its content (such as scope, definitions, enforcement mechanisms, or penalties) cannot be provided.

### Conclusion:

The regulation listed in the query has been **formally repealed** by **Statutory Instrument 2012 No. 7**. It is **no longer applicable or enforceable** under current UK law. The repeated entries are likely a formatting or data duplication error and do not represent multiple distinct regulations. 

To obtain a meaningful summary of the regulation’s original content, the **title, date of enactment, and full text** of the original regulation (prior to repeal) would be required — which is not available in the provided information.
