**Detailed Summary of the Form of Instrument of Cession Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *Form of Instrument of Cession Regulations* are a statutory instrument issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This issuance is grounded in two key provisions of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*:

- **Section 10** of the Act: Grants the Governor General the power to make regulations to implement the Act.
- **Paragraph 146(b)** of the Act: Authorizes the creation of specific forms and procedures for instruments related to cession of land by Indigenous Bands to the Province of Quebec.

These regulations were enacted on **September 19, 1984**, and are published under **S.C. 1984, c. 18** (Statutes of Canada, 1984, Chapter 18).

---

### **Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Title:** *Form of Instrument of Cession Regulations*  
- **Citation:** S.C. 1984, c. 18  
- **Purpose:** To establish a standardized, legally binding format for the Instrument of Cession that will be used when a Cree or Naskapi Band cedes land rights to the Province of Quebec under **Part IX** of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*.

---

### **Core Provision: Mandatory Use of the Scheduled Form**

The central requirement of these regulations is that:

> **The form of Instrument of Cession set out in the Schedule must be used in all cases where a Band cedes land to Quebec under Part IX of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act.**

This ensures consistency, legal clarity, and compliance with procedural requirements established by the Act.

---

### **Number of Copies**

The Instrument of Cession must be executed in **four original copies**, in accordance with:

- **Paragraph 143(1)(b)**: Requires four copies for official record-keeping and distribution.
- **Paragraph 146(b)**: Specifies the need for multiple copies to ensure transparency and accountability in the cession process.

Each copy will be retained by:
- The Band,
- The Government of Quebec,
- The federal government (via the Department of Indian Affairs),
- A central archive or registry.

---

### **Interpretation Clause**

The regulation defines key terms used in the Instrument of Cession:

- **"Band"** refers specifically to the name of the Indigenous Band making the cession (e.g., the *Cree Nation of Wabaseemoong*, or *Naskapi of the Naskapi Territory*).

This ensures clarity and precision in identifying the party initiating the cession.

---

### **Description of Land Affected**

Under **Part IX of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act**, the Band cedes **all rights and interests** in or on a specific parcel of land designated as **Category IA or IA-N** land.

- The description must be:
  - **Precise and legally defined** (e.g., by metes and bounds, survey references, or coordinates),
  - **Supported by a plan** attached to the Instrument of Cession,
  - Clearly referenced in Section 2 of the Instrument.

This ensures that the land being ceded is unambiguously identified and not subject to future disputes.

---

### **Conditions of Cession**

The cession may be either:

#### **1. Unconditional**
- The Band cedes all rights and interests without any restrictions or obligations.
- This is the default position unless otherwise specified.

#### **2. Conditional**
- The cession is subject to specific **terms and conditions** (e.g., environmental protections, development limitations, or future access rights).
- These conditions must be clearly stated in the Instrument and must be consistent with the objectives of the Act and the interests of the Band.

> *Note:* Any conditions must be reasonable, legally enforceable, and approved through the democratic process.

---

### **Approval by Electors (Referendum Requirement)**

As mandated by **Section 144** of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act:

- The cession must be approved by a **majority of the electors** of the Band.
- The vote must be conducted through a **duly called and held referendum**.
- A **minimum of 65% of the electors** must vote **in favour** of the cession for it to be valid.

This democratic requirement ensures that the decision to cede land is made with the full consent of the Band’s members, respecting Indigenous self-determination.

---

### **Certificate of Officer**

- A **written certificate** dated on the day of the referendum must be attached to the Instrument.
- The certificate must:
  - Confirm the results of the vote,
  - Be signed by the **official responsible for conducting the referendum** (e.g., the Band’s Chief Electoral Officer or designated official),
  - Provide evidence of the legitimacy and transparency of the voting process.

This serves as a legal and evidentiary record of democratic approval.

---

### **Effective Date of Cession**

Two versions of the effective date are provided, each with different implications:

#### **Version 1 (Standard – Immediate upon Quebec Acceptance)**

> The cession becomes effective on the date when:
> - Quebec formally **accepts** the cession, and
> - Canada **transfers administration, management, and control** of the land to Quebec, as required under **paragraph 143(1)(e)** of the Act.

This version aligns with the Act’s intent that the transfer of control is a prerequisite to the cession being effective.

#### **Version 2 (With a Minimum Date – Delayed Effectiveness)**

> The effective date is the **later of two dates**:
> 1. The date when Quebec accepts the cession and Canada transfers control of the land, and  
> 2. A **specific date** (e.g., January 1, 1990) set by the Band or its council.

This version allows for a **minimum effective date**, which may be used to ensure that the cession does not take effect too early (e.g., before infrastructure is ready or community consultation is complete).

> *Note:* This version provides greater flexibility for Bands to manage timing and planning.

---

### **Acceptance by Quebec (Optional Clause)**

Pursuant to **paragraph 143(1)(e)** of the Act, Quebec may accept the cession within a **specified time period** (e.g., 6 months) from the date the Instrument is executed.

- The clause allows the Band to include a **time limit** for Quebec’s acceptance.
- If Quebec does not accept the cession within this period, the cession may lapse or be voided.
- This clause promotes timely action and prevents indefinite delays in land transfer.

---

### **Execution and Signing**

The Instrument is executed at a specific location and date:

> **"Executed at [City], this [Day] of [Month], 19."**

It is signed by:

- Two **Council Members** of the Band (as representatives of the Band Council),
- With the statement: **"For the [Name of the Band]"**

This formalizes the Band’s official endorsement of the cession and ensures that the action is taken by duly authorized individuals.

---

### **Key Legal and Policy Implications**

| Aspect | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| **Legal Clarity** | Standardized form reduces ambiguity and ensures compliance with federal and provincial law. |
| **Democratic Validation** | Referendum requirement upholds Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination. |
| **Land Rights Transfer** | Enables the transfer of land management and control from Canada to Quebec under a clear, documented process. |
| **Accountability** | Four copies and a certificate of referendum ensure transparency and auditability. |
| **Flexibility** | Optional clauses (e.g., conditions, effective date) allow Bands to tailor the cession to their unique circumstances. |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Form of Instrument of Cession Regulations* serve as a **critical procedural tool** that operationalizes the land transfer provisions of Part IX of the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act*. By establishing a clear, legally sound, and democratically validated format, the regulations:

- Respect Indigenous rights and governance,
- Ensure transparency and accountability,
- Facilitate the orderly transfer of land from federal to provincial jurisdiction,
- Provide a consistent framework for future cessions.

These regulations are not merely administrative—they represent a foundational step in the ongoing relationship between Indigenous communities and the Canadian state, affirming both legal rights and self-governance.

---

**Note:** While this regulation is dated 1984, it remains in force and applicable to cessions under the *Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act* unless amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. Its continued use underscores the importance of formalized, community-led land governance in Canada’s Indigenous relations.
