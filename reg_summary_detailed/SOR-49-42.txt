## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation on School Fees and Transportation Costs for Children of Certain Government Employees**

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**
- **Authority**: The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, based on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.
- **Legal Foundation**: It is enacted under **The Appropriation Act, No. 7, 1949, Vote No. 938**.
- **Purpose**: To **revise and replace** the outdated regulations governing the payment of school fees and transportation costs for children of certain government employees.

> This regulation revokes **Order in Council PC 3455 of 19 July 1950** and introduces a new set of rules to govern financial support for education expenses.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation establishes precise definitions for key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Child** | A person under the age of 18 at the start of the school year. Does **not** include anyone who has reached 18. |
| **Federal Land** | Land owned by Her Majesty in right of Canada (i.e., Crown land). |
| **Minister** (in context) | Refers to the minister responsible for managing the employee, their child, or the federal land in question. |
| **Non-Taxable Employee** | A government employee who, due to residing on federal land, is **not subject to municipal property taxes** on that land. This employee may apply to the Minister for financial assistance to cover school-related costs. |
| **School Authority** | The official body (e.g., school board, corporation) that levies taxes and manages the operation and maintenance of a school. |

> These definitions ensure clarity in determining eligibility and responsibilities under the regulation.

---

### **3. Accommodation of Children on Federal Land Near National Defence Schools**
- **Scope**: If a non-taxable employee resides on federal land that the Minister determines is **within easy access** of a school operated by the **Minister of National Defence**, the Minister shall:
  - Arrange for the child to attend that school.
  - This arrangement must follow the provisions of **Order in Council P.C. 44/2300 of 6 May 1950**.

> This provision prioritizes access to schools run by the Department of National Defence when geographically feasible.

---

### **4. Alternative School Arrangements (When Defence School is Not Available)**
- If a child **cannot be accommodated** at a National Defence school (due to lack of space or other constraints), the Minister may:
  - Arrange for the child to attend a school in the **municipality where the employee resides**.
  - **Alternatively**, if the local school facilities are deemed inadequate, the child may attend a school in a **different municipality with adequate facilities**.

> **Mandatory Reporting Requirement**:
- Whenever a child attends a school **outside the employee’s municipality**, a **formal report must be submitted to the Treasury Board**.
- The report must include:
  - The **reasons** for the arrangement.
  - Any **additional costs** incurred due to the move.

> This ensures transparency and accountability in financial decisions.

---

### **5. Payment of School Fees**
- When a child attends a school under any of the above arrangements:
  - The Minister may pay **school fees** to the **school authority**.
  - The maximum amount payable per school year is **equal to the standard fee charged for a non-resident student** at that school.

> **Offset Mechanism**:
- If the non-taxable employee has already **paid school fees directly to the school**, those amounts are **deducted** from the total payment.
- The amount paid to the school authority is **reduced by the employee’s prior payment**.

> This prevents double payment and ensures cost efficiency.

---

### **6. Transportation Cost Reimbursement**
- If a child attends a school located between **5 and 30 miles** from the employee’s residence:
  - And the transportation used is a **public service approved by the Minister** (excluding urban public transit or the service mentioned in subsection 5(2)):
  - The Minister may reimburse the employee for the **difference between the actual cost and $3 per month**.

> Example:
- If the actual cost of transportation is $10/month, the employee receives a reimbursement of $7 ($10 – $3).

> **Note**: This benefit only applies to transportation **approved by the Minister** and not to urban transit or services already covered elsewhere.

---

### **7. Use of National Defence Transportation Services**
- If the **Minister of National Defence** provides a transportation service suitable for school attendance:
  - The Minister may **arrange for the child to use that service**.
  - The terms and conditions of use are set by the Minister of National Defence.

> This ensures access to reliable, government-supported transportation when needed.

---

### **8. Leasing of Federal Land for Residential Use**
- When federal land is made available for residential occupancy:
  - The Minister must **lease it on terms** that:
    - Do **not deprive the local municipality** of its right to tax tenants.
  - This is only an exception if the Minister determines it is **not feasible** to allow municipal taxation.

> This protects municipal revenue and maintains local government financial interests.

---

### **9. Exclusions from Eligibility**
No financial assistance will be provided in the following cases:

1. **If the employee resides on federal land that is part of property in a municipality receiving a grant under Section 5 of the Municipal Grants Act** (for the purpose of calculating the grant amount).
2. **If the employee resides in a municipality where they are subject to municipal property taxes** on the federal land.

> These exclusions prevent the system from being exploited by individuals who are already taxed locally or benefit from municipal funding.

---

### **10. Reporting Requirements**
- All payments or arrangements made under these regulations must be **reported to the Municipal Grants Division of the Department of Finance**.

> This ensures:
- Oversight of government spending.
- Compliance with municipal funding policies.
- Accountability to the Treasury Board and federal financial authorities.

|--------|-------------|
| **Equitable Access** | Ensures children of non-taxable government employees have access to quality education, especially when living on federal land. |
