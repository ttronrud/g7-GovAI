The regulation referenced — "[Repealed, SI/2011-98]" — indicates that the specific regulatory instrument was formally repealed by a Statutory Instrument (SI) numbered SI/2011-98, issued in the year 2011.

However, without the full text or title of the original regulation being repealed, a detailed summary cannot be provided. Statutory Instruments (SIs) in Canada and other jurisdictions typically serve as secondary legislation that implements or amends primary laws. In the UK, SIs are commonly used to introduce or modify regulations under an enabling act.

In this case:

- **SI/2011-98** is the identifying number of the Statutory Instrument that repealed the earlier regulation.
- The phrase "[Repealed, SI/2011-98]" means that the regulation in question is no longer in force and has been formally replaced or canceled by this instrument.
- The repeal implies that the original regulation was either outdated, redundant, or superseded by newer legislation or policy.

To provide a detailed summary of the original regulation, the following information would be required:
- The full title of the regulation being repealed.
- The enabling act or parent legislation under which it was created.
- The subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, taxation, etc.).
- Key provisions or objectives of the original regulation.
- The reasons for its repeal (e.g., policy change, duplication, inefficiency, or integration into a broader framework).

Since the original regulation is not specified, and only its repeal is noted, the most accurate summary is:

👉 **Summary**:  
The regulation in question has been formally repealed by Statutory Instrument SI/2011-98. As such, it is no longer in force and legally binding. The repeal indicates that the regulation was either obsolete, inconsistent with current policy, or replaced by more current or comprehensive legislation. Without the title or content of the original regulation, a detailed analysis of its provisions, purpose, or impact cannot be offered. To obtain a detailed summary, the original regulation's title and full text would need to be identified.

If you can provide the full title of the regulation being repealed (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations 2005"), I can assist in delivering a detailed summary based on publicly available legal or policy sources.
