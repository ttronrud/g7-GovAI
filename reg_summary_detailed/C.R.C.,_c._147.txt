**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Tree Fruit Pooling Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled the **British Columbia Tree Fruit Pooling Regulations** and may be cited as such. This document establishes the framework for how tree fruit producers in British Columbia (BC) pool and distribute the proceeds from the sale of regulated tree fruits.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout the document:

- **Agency**:  
  Refers to *B.C. Tree Fruits Limited*, a company incorporated under BC law with its principal office in Kelowna. The Agency acts as the official marketing agency responsible for managing the pooling of tree fruit sales proceeds.

- **Appropriate Pooling Committee**:  
  A governing body established to oversee the pooling process based on the type of tree fruit:
  - **Apples and crabapples**: A committee established under subsection 6(1).
  - **Other tree fruits (excluding apples and crabapples)**: A committee established under subsection 6(2).
  - **Both apples/crabapples and other tree fruits**: A combined committee established under subsection 6(3), composed of members from both previous committees.

- **Area**:  
  Defined as the region of British Columbia lying **east of the 121st meridian of west longitude** and **south of the 51st parallel of north latitude**. This geographic boundary identifies the jurisdiction where tree fruits subject to these regulations are grown.

- **British Columbia Fruit Growers’ Association (BCFG)**:  
  A provincial association incorporated under BC law, headquartered in Kelowna. It plays a key role in appointing members to pooling committees.

- **Okanagan Federated Shippers’ Association (OFSA)**:  
  Another incorporated association based in Kelowna, involved in the shipping and distribution of tree fruits. It also appoints members to pooling committees.

- **Commodity Board**:  
  Refers to the *British Columbia Fruit Board*, which oversees the broader marketing and regulation of agricultural products in BC.

- **Order**:  
  The *British Columbia Tree Fruit Order*, made under the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*. This Order provides the legal basis for the pooling system.

- **Person**:  
  Includes any individual or body corporate (e.g., companies, associations), broadening the scope of who can participate in the pooling system.

- **Regulated Product**:  
  Any tree fruit grown within the defined "area" starting from **1964 and in subsequent years**. This includes apples, crabapples, and other tree fruits, provided they were cultivated in the designated region after 1964.

- **Scheme**:  
  The *British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Scheme of 1960*, established under the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act*, including all amendments. This Scheme provides the overarching policy and structure for marketing and distribution of tree fruits.

### **3. Authority and Purpose of the Agency**

The **Agency (B.C. Tree Fruits Limited)** is **authorized** to:
- Conduct one or more **pools** (shared marketing arrangements) for the distribution of **proceeds from the sale of regulated tree fruits**.
- Distribute the net proceeds (after allowable expenses) to producers in a fair and equitable manner based on their **contribution** to the pool.

This authority is granted under the **Scheme** and the **Order**, making the Agency the central entity responsible for managing the financial outcomes of tree fruit sales.

---

### **4. Distribution of Proceeds**

The Agency is **required** to:
- Distribute all **net proceeds** (after deducting reasonable disbursements, expenses, and charges) to participating producers.
- Allocate shares of proceeds **in direct relation to**:
  - The **amount** of fruit delivered,
  - The **variety**,
  - The **size**,
  - The **grade**, and
  - The **class** of the regulated product.
- Make payments continuously until **all net proceeds are distributed**.

This ensures that producers receive compensation proportional to their actual output and quality, promoting fairness and transparency.

---

### **5. Operation of Pools**

The pools must be operated:
- In a manner **similar to previous pools** conducted by the Agency under prior contracts with producers, packers, and storage operators.
- With any modifications approved by the **appropriate pooling committee** as specified in **Section 6**.

This ensures continuity, stability, and consistency in the pooling process while allowing for necessary adjustments through democratic oversight.

---

### **6. Structure and Composition of Pooling Committees**

Three types of pooling committees are established, each with distinct membership rules:

#### **A. Committee for Apples and Crabapples (Section 6(1))**
- Composed of **7 members**:
  - **5 appointed by the British Columbia Fruit Growers’ Association (BCFG)**,
  - **1 appointed by the Okanagan Federated Shippers’ Association (OFSA)**,
  - **1 appointed by the Agency**.

#### **B. Committee for Other Tree Fruits (Section 6(2))**
- Also composed of **7 members**:
  - **5 appointed by BCFG**,
  - **1 appointed by OFSA**,
  - **1 appointed by the Agency**.

#### **C. Combined Committee (Section 6(3))**
- Handles matters related to **both apples/crabapples and other tree fruits**.
- Composed of **all members** from the committees under (1) and (2).
- Thus, it has a larger membership (up to 14 members), but only the members from the two smaller committees are included.

#### **Overlap of Members**
- A member appointed to either the apples/crabapples or other tree fruits committee **may also serve on the combined committee**.
- This allows for shared oversight and coordination between the two categories of fruit.

- **Rules of Procedure**:  
  Each committee may establish its own rules regarding:
  - How meetings are convened,
  - The procedures for conducting meetings,
  - The election of a **chairman**.

- **Decision-Making**:
  - A decision of the **majority of members present** at a meeting is binding, **provided a quorum is present**.

    **10 members** constitute a quorum.
