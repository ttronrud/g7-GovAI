**Regulation Summary: Transfer of Canadian Coast Guard Functions to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans**

**Effective Date:** April 1, 1995  
**Governing Authority:** His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  
**Legal Basis:** Paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*

---

**Overview:**

This regulation outlines a reorganization of the Canadian public service by transferring control and supervision of a specific portion of the Department of Transport — the **Canadian Coast Guard** — to the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)**. The transfer is part of a broader administrative restructuring aimed at aligning government departments with the natural scope of their mandates, particularly in relation to marine and maritime operations.

---

**Scope of the Transfer:**

The transfer applies to the **Canadian Coast Guard** within the Department of Transport, **excluding** the following units:

1. **Harbours and Ports Directorate**  
   - And its **regional Harbours and Ports Branches**  
   → These units remain under the Department of Transport.

2. **Marine Regulatory Directorate**  
   → This unit remains under the Department of Transport.

3. **Ship Inspection Directorate**  
   - And its **regional Ship Inspection Branches**  
   → These units remain under the Department of Transport.

**What is Transferred:**

All other components of the Canadian Coast Guard — that is, those **not specifically excluded** — are transferred to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. This includes:

- Operational responsibilities related to maritime safety, search and rescue, ice management, environmental protection, and marine surveillance.
- Administrative and managerial functions associated with the Coast Guard’s day-to-day operations.
- Supervision and control of personnel and programs under the Canadian Coast Guard structure, excluding the excluded directorates.

---

**Rationale (Implied Context):**

The transfer reflects a strategic realignment based on the following considerations:

- The Canadian Coast Guard’s core functions — such as marine safety, environmental protection, and ice management — are closely aligned with the mandate of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which oversees Canada’s oceans, marine ecosystems, and fisheries.
- DFO has long-standing responsibility for marine safety and environmental stewardship, making it a more natural home for Coast Guard operations.
- The exclusion of key regulatory and port-related functions (such as ship inspections and harbours management) preserves critical transport and port infrastructure oversight within the Department of Transport, ensuring continuity in maritime logistics and commercial operations.

---

**Implications:**

- **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO):** Gains full administrative and operational control over the Canadian Coast Guard’s non-port and non-regulatory functions, enhancing coordination between marine safety and environmental protection.
- **Department of Transport (DOT):** Retains responsibility for port operations, ship inspections, and marine regulatory enforcement, maintaining its role in commercial shipping and port safety.
- **Public Service Efficiency:** The transfer streamlines governance by placing Coast Guard functions in a department with overlapping and complementary responsibilities, reducing duplication and improving interdepartmental coordination.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally transfers the operational and supervisory authority of the Canadian Coast Guard (excluding Harbours and Ports, Marine Regulatory, and Ship Inspection functions) to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, effective April 1, 1995. It represents a significant shift in federal departmental responsibilities, reinforcing the integration of marine safety and environmental protection under DFO, while preserving essential transport-related functions within the Department of Transport.

This reorganization was a key step in modernizing Canada’s maritime governance and aligning public service structures with evolving policy priorities.
