**Detailed Summary of the Prepaid Payment Products Regulations (S.C. 2012, c. 5, s. 44, 47, 51, 68, 70, 72, etc.)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Prepaid Payment Products Regulations* were enacted by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under specific provisions of several key Canadian financial regulation statutes. These regulations establish comprehensive rules governing the issuance, disclosure, and fee structures associated with **prepaid payment products (PPPs)** in Canada.

The regulations came into force on **May 1, 2014**, and apply to all prepaid payment products issued in Canada by designated financial institutions. The goal is to ensure **transparency, fairness, and consumer protection** by requiring clear, simple, and non-misleading disclosures and by limiting certain fees and restrictions that could disadvantage consumers.

## **Core Regulatory Provisions**

### **1. Pre-Issuance Disclosure Requirements (Before Product is Issued)**

Any document prepared by the issuing institution—including product packaging or application forms—must include the following information, clearly and simply presented:

#### **(a) Name of the Issuing Institution**  
Must be clearly stated.

#### **(b) Toll-Free Telephone Number**

Must disclose any restrictions, including:
- The product is **not reloadable**;
- The product **cannot be used for withdrawals**;
- Any other restriction that could reasonably affect a consumer’s decision to purchase.

> *Note: These restrictions must be clearly communicated to ensure informed decision-making.*

#### **(d) All Fees Imposed by the Institution**  
Must list all fees that may apply to the product holder, such as:
- Activation fees;
- Transaction fees;
- Annual fees (if applicable);
- Other charges.

#### **(e) Insurance Status of Funds**  
If the funds on the product are **not insured** by the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)**, a clear statement must be provided.

#### **(f) Expiry of Rights to Use Funds**  
Must state:
- For **promotional products**: Either:
  - That the right to use funds will **not expire**, or

### **2. Presentation of Disclosure Information**

- The information in paragraph (1)(d) (fees and restrictions) must be presented in a **distinct "information box"**.
- The box must appear **prominently** on:
  - Exterior packaging (if applicable);
  - Any application or product documentation.

---

### **3. Oral Disclosure for Telephone Applications**

Despite the general requirement for written disclosure, **if a person applies for a PPP by telephone**, the required information (from paragraphs 4(1)(a) to (f)) must be disclosed **orally** before the product is issued.

> This ensures that individuals who apply via phone are not left without essential information.

---

### **4. Post-Issuance Disclosure Requirements (At Time of Issuance)**

When a product is issued, the following must be disclosed **in writing** to the product holder:

#### **(a) Product Terms and Conditions**  
Including:
- The holder’s rights and responsibilities regarding a **lost or stolen product**.

#### **(b) How to Verify the Balance**  
A clear description of how the product holder can check the current balance of funds.

#### **(c) Use of Funds for Partial Purchases**  
How the product holder may use funds to make **partial payments** on purchases (e.g., in cases where the purchase amount exceeds available funds).

#### **(d) Reiteration of Pre-Issuance Information**  
The information from paragraphs (1)(a) to (f) must be provided **unless**:
- The product was issued **in person**, and  
- The required information was already disclosed **immediately before issuance**.

> This ensures continuity and avoids duplication of disclosure.

---

### **5. Disclosure on the Prepaid Payment Product Itself**

For **all prepaid payment products**, the institution must provide the following information **directly on the product** or **electronically upon request** (if electronic):

- The **name of the issuing institution**;
- The **expiry date** of the product (if any);
- If it is a **promotional product**, the **expiry date** of the right to use the funds;
- A **toll-free telephone number** for inquiries (including balance checks and complaints);
- A **website address** where full product information (including terms, fees, and contact details) can be accessed.

> This ensures that the product itself is a transparent and accessible source of information.

---

### **6. Restrictions on Fee Increases and New Fees**

An institution **cannot increase or impose a new fee** on a prepaid payment product issued to a **natural person (individual)** unless:

1. The product holder has provided their:
   - Full name;
   - Mailing address or email address;
2. The holder has been given the opportunity to **review and modify** the information (e.g., address);
3. The institution discloses the new or increased fee via:
   - A **written notice** sent to the most recent address at least **30 days before** the fee becomes effective;  
   - A **public notice** displayed on the institution’s website for **at least 60 days** before the fee takes effect.

> This protects consumers from surprise or hidden fee increases.

---

### **7. Prohibition on Imposing Expiry Dates (Except for Promotional Products)**

- An institution **cannot impose an expiry date** on a product holder’s right to use funds **unless** the product is a **promotional product**.
- For all other products, the right to use funds is **perpetual** (does not expire).

> This prevents the devaluation of consumer funds due to arbitrary expiration.

---

### **8. Prohibition on Maintenance Fees (First 12 Months)**

An institution **cannot charge a maintenance fee** (a fee charged after purchase, not tied to use) to a product holder for **12 months after activation**, unless:

- The product is a **promotional product**, or  
- The product is **reloadable** and the product holder has **given express consent** to the fee.

> This protects new users from unexpected ongoing costs in the early stages of product use.

---

### **9. Prohibition on Overdraft Fees and Interest**

- An institution **cannot charge overdraft fees or interest** on a prepaid payment product **without the express consent** of the product holder.

> This prevents unauthorized or exploitative financial practices.

---

## **Legal Basis and Regulatory Framework**

The regulations are grounded in multiple statutes:

| Statute | Relevant Sections |
