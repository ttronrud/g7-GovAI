### **Regulation Title:**  
Proclamation Declaring the Termination of Application of the *Government Corporations Operation Act* to *Trans Mountain Corporation*

---

### **Issuing Authority:**  
The Governor in Council of Canada, acting under the authority of the *Government Corporations Operation Act* (the "Act"), with advice from the Privy Council.

---

### **Date of Issuance:**  
April 20, 2022

---

### **Place of Issuance:**  
Government House, Ottawa, Canada

---

### **Key Provisions and Context:**

#### **1. Background and Legal Framework**
- The *Government Corporations Operation Act* (GCOA) governs the operation of government corporations in Canada.
- **Section 6** of the Act stipulates that the Act applies to a corporation **only upon the issuance of a proclamation** by the Governor in Council declaring its applicability.
- **Section 7(1)** allows the Governor in Council to issue a proclamation declaring that the Act **ceases to apply** to a corporation for which a prior proclamation of applicability was issued.

#### **2. Historical Application of the Act**
- On **July 18, 2018**, the Governor in Council issued a proclamation (SOR/2018-168) declaring that the *Government Corporations Operation Act* applies to **Project Deliver II Ltd.**
- On **August 17, 2018**, the corporate name of Project Deliver II Ltd. was officially changed to **Trans Mountain Corporation**.
- As a result, the Act’s application was transferred to the newly named entity: **Trans Mountain Corporation**.

#### **3. Termination of Application**
- On **April 20, 2022**, the Governor in Council issued **Order in Council P.C. 2022-361**, which directed that a proclamation be issued to **terminate** the application of the *Government Corporations Operation Act* to Trans Mountain Corporation.
- This proclamation declares that the Act **ceases to apply** to Trans Mountain Corporation **effective on the day the proclamation is issued** — i.e., **April 20, 2022**.

#### **4. Legal Effect of the Proclamation**
- The Act no longer governs the operations, governance, financial reporting, or administrative functions of Trans Mountain Corporation.
- The corporation is now **no longer subject to the regulatory regime** established under the GCOA.
- This change means that Trans Mountain Corporation will operate under **private corporate laws** and regulations (such as the *Canada Business Corporations Act* or other applicable statutes), rather than under the public-sector governance framework of the GCOA.

---

### **Purpose and Implications**
- The termination of the Act’s application signals a **transition from public to private corporate governance** for Trans Mountain Corporation.
- This move likely reflects a shift in the government’s approach to the company — possibly due to:
  - A desire to enhance operational flexibility.
  - A change in policy regarding the role of government in managing energy infrastructure.
  - The company’s evolving status as a private-sector entity, particularly following its acquisition by the **Trans Mountain Pipeline Company** and subsequent reorganization.
- It may also align with broader policy goals related to **privatization, efficiency, and reduced public oversight** in certain infrastructure sectors.

---

### **Legal Authority and Validity**
- The proclamation is valid because:
  - It is issued under **section 7(1)** of the GCOA.
  - It follows a prior declaration of applicability under section 6.
  - It is made by the Governor in Council, with advice from the Privy Council.
- The proclamation is **binding on all persons** and entities that may be affected by the Act’s application or non-application.

---

### **Official Signatory**
- **Mary May Simon**, Governor General of Canada, affixed the Great Seal of Canada to the proclamation.
- She holds several prominent honors, including:
  - Chancellor of the Order of Canada
  - Commander of the Order of Military Merit
  - Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces
- Her signature confirms the **sovereign authority** and **constitutional legitimacy** of the proclamation.

---

### **Public Notice and Effect**
- The proclamation is published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (as referenced in SOR/2018-168 and P.C. 2022-361).
- All stakeholders — including employees, shareholders, regulators, and the public — are required to **take notice** and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- This includes changes in reporting requirements, accountability mechanisms, and oversight structures.

---

### **Conclusion**
This proclamation marks a significant administrative and legal shift in the governance of Trans Mountain Corporation. It formally ends the application of the *Government Corporations Operation Act*, transitioning the company from a government-regulated entity to one governed by private corporate law. This reflects a strategic policy decision by the federal government to reduce public oversight and allow greater operational autonomy for the corporation.
