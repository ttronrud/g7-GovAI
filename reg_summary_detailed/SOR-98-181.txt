**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Hydro Nuclear Facilities Exclusion from Part III of the Canada Labour Code Regulations (Labour Standards)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
- **Governing Body**: His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**.
- **Legal Authority**: The regulation is made under **Section 266a of the Canada Labour Code** (CLC), which allows for the exclusion of certain types of employment from the application of Part III of the CLC (Labour Standards) where specific conditions are met.
- **Purpose**: To provide a regulatory exemption for employment at nuclear facilities in Ontario, specifically those operated by Ontario Hydro or its successors, while maintaining compliance with broader labour standards where applicable.

---

### **2. Effective Date**
- These regulations **came into force on April 1, 1998**.
- The exclusion applies to employment on or in connection with nuclear facilities **from the date of coming into force** and thereafter.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Employment Standards Act, 2000* (S.O. 2000, c. 41), **except** subsection 3(2) and Part XIII of that Act. This means that certain provisions (particularly those related to minimum wage, working hours, or termination) are excluded from applying to nuclear facility workers. |
| **Employment** | Means employment with **Ontario Hydro** or with a person referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of "nuclear facility." This defines the scope of workers who are covered by the exclusion. |
| **Nuclear Facility** | A nuclear facility in Ontario that: <br> - Is subject to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act* or its regulations; <br> - Is either: <br>   (a) Owned and operated by Ontario Hydro; **or** <br>   (b) Owned or operated by another entity, **but only if** on the date these regulations come into force (April 1, 1998) or any day after that, it becomes owned and operated by Ontario Hydro. |

> This definition ensures that the exclusion applies to nuclear facilities that are either directly operated by Ontario Hydro or transition into Ontario Hydro’s ownership at any point after April 1, 1998.

### **4. Scope of Exclusion**

- **Exclusion from Part III of the Canada Labour Code**:  
  Employment on or in connection with a nuclear facility is **excluded** from the application of **Part III** of the Canada Labour Code (which governs labour standards such as minimum wage, working hours, overtime, leave, and termination protections), **except for Sections 265 to 267**.

- **What is excluded**:  
  The general labour standards in Part III (e.g., minimum wage, maximum working hours, rest periods, vacation pay, termination pay, etc.) do **not apply** to employees working at nuclear facilities under this regulation.

- **What remains applicable**:  
  Sections **265 to 267** of the Canada Labour Code (which relate to **protection against unfair dismissal**, **procedural fairness**, and **notice requirements**) **remain in force** and continue to apply. This ensures that workers at nuclear facilities still have some protection against arbitrary dismissal, even though other labour standards are waived.

---

### **5. Application of the Employment Standards Act (ESA)**

- While the Canada Labour Code provisions in Part III are excluded, the **Employment Standards Act (ESA)** and any **regulations or rules made under it** (as amended from time to time) **apply to the extent that they are relevant** to employment at nuclear facilities.
- This means that any provisions of the ESA that are directly related to employment at nuclear facilities (e.g., health and safety, training, or specific workplace conditions) may still be enforceable, depending on their relevance.

> This provision ensures that the exclusion does not eliminate all labour protections — only the standard labour standards found in Part III of the CLC.

---

### **6. Repeal Status**
- The regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2002-113, section 10**.
- This means the regulation is **no longer in effect** as of the date of repeal.
- The repeal indicates that the exclusion from Part III of the Canada Labour Code for Ontario Hydro nuclear facilities has been **superseded or replaced** by updated legislation or policy.

---

### **7. Historical and Contextual Background**

- **Original Intent**: The regulation was introduced to address the unique risks and operational demands of nuclear facilities, where specialized safety protocols, long working hours, and high levels of technical expertise are required. It allowed for flexibility in scheduling and working conditions without violating standard labour protections.
- **Ontario Hydro Context**: Ontario Hydro (now part of **Ontario Power Generation – OPGen**) was a major nuclear energy operator in Canada. The exclusion was designed to support the safe and efficient operation of nuclear power plants while recognizing the distinct nature of such work.
- **Public Safety and Industry Needs**: The exclusion was justified on the grounds that nuclear operations require strict regulatory oversight and operational continuity, which may not be fully compatible with standard labour standards.

---

### **8. Key Implications and Limitations**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No minimum wage or overtime protections** | Workers at nuclear facilities were not subject to standard minimum wage or overtime rules under Part III of the CLC. |
| **Working hours flexibility** | Employers could schedule shifts more flexibly, including night or rotating shifts, without being constrained by standard working hour limits. |
| **Retained dismissal protections** | Workers still had rights to fair process and notice in cases of termination (via Sections 265–267). |
| **No automatic application to all nuclear sites** | The exclusion only applied to facilities that met the specific definition of a "nuclear facility" under the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*. |
| **No protection from harassment or discrimination** | The exclusion does not cover protections under human rights legislation or anti-discrimination laws. These remain applicable. |

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation established a **temporary and targeted exclusion** from standard labour standards for employees working at nuclear facilities in Ontario, specifically those operated by Ontario Hydro or that transitioned into its ownership. It was designed to accommodate the unique operational and safety needs of nuclear power generation.

However, the regulation was **repealed in 2002**, indicating that the government no longer considers this exemption necessary or appropriate. As such, **the exclusion is no longer in force**, and employment at nuclear facilities in Ontario is now subject to the full application of Part III of the Canada Labour Code — unless further exemptions are introduced through current or future legislation.

> **Note**: The repeal of this regulation suggests a shift toward greater alignment of nuclear facility employment with general labour standards, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and worker protections in all sectors.
