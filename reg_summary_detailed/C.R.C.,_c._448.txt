### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Cultural Property Export Control List**

The **Canadian Cultural Property Export Control List** is a regulatory instrument established under Canadian law to protect culturally significant heritage items from unauthorized export. This Order outlines specific categories of cultural property that are subject to export controls, including restrictions on their removal from Canada, based on age, origin, value, and cultural significance.

## **1. Scope and Applicability**

- **Applicable Objects**:  
  The regulation applies only to objects that meet **two key criteria**:
  1. **Age**: The object must be **50 years or older**.
  2. **Maker**: It must have been **made by a natural person who is no longer living**.

> This ensures that only culturally significant, historically rooted works by deceased artisans or creators are protected from export.
