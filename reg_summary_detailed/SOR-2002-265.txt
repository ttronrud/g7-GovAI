**Detailed Summary of the *Support Orders and Support Provisions (Retail Associations) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The *Support Orders and Support Provisions (Retail Associations) Regulations* are made under the authority of **subsection 385.32(5)a of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act (CCA)**.  
- **Issuing Body**: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**.  
- **Regulatory Source**:  
  - S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 313  
  - S.C. 1991, c. 48  
- In these regulations, **"Act"** refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to ensure that **retail cooperative credit associations** (retail associations) clearly designate and publicly communicate their **designated office** in each province where they operate. This enables the effective service of **enforcement notices** under subsection 385.32(3) of the CCA, which governs how enforcement actions are delivered to individuals who owe money to a retail association.

---

### **3. Designation of a Provincial Office**

#### **Requirement**:
Every retail association that carries on business in a province must designate **one office** within that province for the **service of enforcement notices**.

#### **Eligibility of Designated Office**:
- If a retail association has **one or more branches** in a province, the designated office **must be one of those branches**.
- The office cannot be a separate, non-operational location or a headquarters outside the province.

#### **Timeline for Designation**:
The designation must be made **on or before the later of two dates**:
1. The **last day of a three-month period** beginning on the day these regulations come into force.  
2. The **last day of a three-month period** beginning on the day the retail association **starts carrying on business** in the province.

> *Example*: If a retail association begins operations in Ontario on January 1, 2024, it must designate its office by April 1, 2024 (3 months later). If the regulations come into force on March 1, 2024, then the deadline is June 30, 2024 — the later of the two dates.

### **4. Public Disclosure of Designated Office**

Once a retail association designates an office, it must **publicly announce** the name and address of that office in the following ways:

#### **Mandatory Publications**:
- **In the Canada Gazette, Part I** (official government publication).  
- **In at least one or more newspapers of general circulation** in the province where the office is designated.  
  - This must occur **at least once per week for four consecutive weeks**.

> *Note*: The publication serves to inform the public, including individuals who may be subject to enforcement actions, where enforcement notices will be served.

#### **Change in Designation or Details**:
If a retail association:
- Changes the designated office in a province, or  
- Changes the name or address of a designated office,

It must **publish a description of the change** in the **same manner** as required for initial designation.

#### **Timeline for Changes**:
- The public announcement of any change must be completed **within three months** of the change occurring.

### **5. Online Accessibility Requirement**

Every retail association must:
- **Post and maintain** on its **primary Internet site** an **up-to-date list** of all offices designated under these regulations.
- The list must include the **name and address** of each designated office for every province in which the association operates.

> *Purpose*: Ensures transparency and accessibility for consumers and creditors who may need to locate the correct office for enforcement purposes.

### **6. Content Requirements for Enforcement Notices**

For enforcement notices issued under subsection 385.32(3) of the CCA, the accompanying **written statement** must include the following information:

1. **Full name** of the individual required to make a payment (under a support order or support provision).  
2. **Latest known address** of that individual.  
3. **One of the following**:
   - The individual’s **social insurance number (SIN)**, or  
   - The individual’s **date of birth**.

> *Note*: This ensures that enforcement notices can be accurately directed to the correct person, reducing the risk of misdelivery or errors.

---

### **7. Coming Into Force**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.  
This ensures immediate applicability and compliance upon formal publication.

---

### **Key Objectives and Impacts**

| Objective | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Transparency** | Retail associations must clearly identify where enforcement notices are served. |
| **Accessibility** | Public disclosure through media and online platforms ensures consumers and debtors can locate the correct office. |
| **Accountability** | Requires timely designation and updates, ensuring compliance with legal obligations. |
| **Accuracy in Enforcement** | Mandates clear personal identification (SIN or DOB) in enforcement notices to prevent errors and fraud. |

---

### **Summary in One Paragraph**

These regulations require every retail cooperative credit association operating in a province to designate a branch office (or one of its branches) as the official point for serving enforcement notices under the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. The designation must be made within three months of either the regulation’s coming into force or the start of business in the province, whichever is later. The association must then publicly publish the name and address of the designated office in the *Canada Gazette* and in at least one weekly newspaper for four consecutive weeks. Any changes to the designation or details must be announced similarly within three months. Additionally, the association must maintain a current, publicly accessible list of all designated offices on its primary website. Enforcement notices must include the full name, latest address, and either the social insurance number or date of birth of the individual being served. These rules enhance transparency, ensure accountability, and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of enforcement actions.

### **Conclusion**

The *Support Orders and Support Provisions (Retail Associations) Regulations* strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act by establishing clear, enforceable procedures for identifying, publicizing, and serving enforcement notices. They promote fairness, transparency, and consumer protection by ensuring that individuals are properly informed and that enforcement actions are both accurate and accessible.
