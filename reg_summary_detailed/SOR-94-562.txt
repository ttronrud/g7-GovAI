### **Core Provisions and Legal Effect**

#### **1. Legal Capacity of the Commission**
- The Commission is granted **the legal capacity of a body corporate** in Canada.  
  → This means it can own property, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and conduct business in Canada as if it were a legal entity (e.g., a corporation).  
  → This is essential for the Commission to operate independently and manage its affairs, including administrative and financial functions, within Canadian jurisdiction.

    - Immunity from taxation on income, property, and profits.
    - Immunity from search or seizure of its property or premises.
    - Freedom from interference in its internal affairs.
  → These privileges are **not automatic** — they are limited and defined by the specific provisions of the Agreement.

#### **3. Privileges and Immunities for Foreign Member State Representatives**
- Representatives of foreign states that are members of the Commission shall have in Canada privileges and immunities **comparable to those granted to diplomatic representatives under the Vienna Convention** — **to the extent specified in Article 6 of the Agreement**.  
  → This means:
    - Diplomatic immunity (e.g., protection from arrest or prosecution).

  → These privileges are **not full diplomatic immunity**, but are **proportional and limited** to the functions of the Commission and as defined in the Agreement.

#### **4. Privileges and Immunities for the President and Vice-President of the Commission**
- The **President** of the Commission and the **Vice-President acting as President** shall have privileges and immunities **comparable to those of diplomatic representatives under the Vienna Convention** — **to the extent specified in Article 7 of the Agreement**.  
  → This includes:
    - Immunity from arrest and prosecution.
    - Protection of official communications.

- Officers of the Commission (e.g., secretaries, technical staff) shall have the privileges and immunities set out in **Section 18 of Article V of the Convention** — **to the extent specified in paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article 8 and Article 10 of the Agreement**.  
  → Section 18 of Article V of the Convention includes:
    - Immunity from legal proceedings for acts performed in the course of their official duties.

### **Key Legal Principles and Implications**

- **Limited Immunity**: The privileges and immunities are **not absolute**. They are **explicitly limited** by the Agreement and the Convention, and only apply to actions carried out in the performance of official duties.
- **No Full Diplomatic Status**: The Commission is **not a diplomatic mission** in the traditional sense. It is an **international organization** focused on environmental cooperation. Therefore, its privileges are **proportional and tailored** to its mandate, not equivalent to full diplomatic immunity.
- **Canadian Sovereignty**: The Order respects Canadian sovereignty by ensuring that immunities are **granted only where necessary** and **subject to the terms of the Agreement**.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: While immunities are granted, they do not remove accountability. The Commission remains subject to Canadian laws and oversight, particularly in financial and administrative matters.

### **Purpose and Context**

The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission was established to:
- Promote the sustainable management of migratory fish (such as salmon) across the North Pacific.
- Facilitate cooperation among Pacific Rim nations (e.g., Canada, USA, Japan, Russia, etc.).
- Address shared ecological challenges related to fish stocks, habitat protection, and fisheries regulations.

This Order ensures that the Commission can:
- Operate effectively in Canada.
- Conduct scientific research, data sharing, and policy development without undue interference.

It provides a balanced framework of **legal capacity, limited immunities, and operational independence**, all while respecting Canadian legal and constitutional principles. The privileges granted are **proportional, conditional, and strictly tied to the Commission’s mandate and the terms of its Agreement with Canada** — ensuring both international cooperation and national oversight.

By aligning with the Vienna and UN Conventions, the Order ensures consistency with international norms while recognizing the unique nature of the Commission as a scientific and environmental intergovernmental organization.
