### 📅 **7. Creditable Periods and Totalization Rules**

#### For **Canada (Old Age Security Act - OASA)**:
- **Periods of residence in Albania** are considered **creditable periods in Canada** if:
  - The person was subject to the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a **provincial pension plan** due to employment or self-employment.
- This applies to:
  - The person
  - Their spouse or common-law partner
  - Dependents residing with them

> ⚠️ **Exclusion**: Only applies if the person was not subject to Albanian legislation due to employment or self-employment.

#### For **Canada (Canada Pension Plan - CPP)**:
- A **calendar year** that includes **at least 90 days** of creditable periods under Albanian legislation is considered a **creditable year** under CPP.

#### For **Albania (Old Age, Invalidity, Survivor Benefits)**:
- A **calendar year** with a CPP creditable period is counted as **12 months** of creditable service.
- A **disability benefit period** under CPP is counted as a **creditable period**, **provided it does not overlap** with another creditable period under CPP.

> ❗ **No Overlap**: Creditable periods under different systems must not overlap.

---

### 📊 **8. Determining Eligibility and Benefit Amounts**

#### If a person lacks sufficient creditable periods:
- The Parties will **totalize** all relevant periods (from both countries) and any periods under **third-party social security agreements**.
- If totalized periods are less than 12 months, the Party may **refuse to pay** based solely on those periods.
- However, the **other Party must consider** these periods when assessing eligibility under its own legislation (Articles 12 & 13).

#### For **Old Age Security (OASA)**:
- If eligibility is based **only on totalization** (Chapter 1), the amount is calculated as follows:
  - **Earnings-related portion**: Based on pensionable earnings under CPP.
  - **Flat-rate portion**: Pro-rated using the formula:
    >  
    > (Flat-rate amount under CPP) ×  
    > (Ratio of actual CPP contribution periods / Minimum qualifying period required for CPP eligibility)  
    >  
    > ✅ The ratio **cannot exceed 1.0**.

#### For **Albania**:
- The competent institution:
  1. Calculates the **theoretical benefit** as if **all creditable periods were under Albanian law**.
  2. Then **proportions** the benefit based on:
     > (Duration of creditable periods under Albania) / (Total duration of all creditable periods)
- If totalized creditable periods **exceed** the required period for a full benefit:
  - The benefit is **limited to the maximum amount** for a full old age, invalidity, or survivor benefit.

> ✅ This prevents overpayment and ensures benefits are capped at full entitlement levels.
