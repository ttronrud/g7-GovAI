### **Detailed Summary of the *Reduction in the Release of Volatile Organic Compounds (Storage and Loading of Volatile Petroleum Liquids) Regulations***  
**Effective Date:** February 24, 2024 (Published in *Canada Gazette*, Part I)  
**Enacted Under:** *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), specifically subsections 93(1)d, 330(3.2)f, and section 286.1e  

---

## **1. Background and Regulatory Process**

The proposed regulations were introduced under **subsection 332(1)a of CEPA 1999**, which requires the Minister of the Environment to publish proposed regulations and provide a public comment period. This process allows stakeholders—including industry, environmental groups, and the public—to submit:
- Written comments, or  
- Notices of objection requesting a **board of review** to assess whether the proposed rules adequately protect human health and the environment.

Additionally, the **National Advisory Committee** was given an opportunity (under subsection 93(3)) to provide expert advice in accordance with section 6c of CEPA 1999. This ensures scientific and technical input is considered before finalization.

The Governor in Council concluded (under subsection 93(4)) that the proposed regulations:
- Do **not overlap** with existing environmental or health regulations under other federal or provincial laws,  
- Provide **sufficient protection** to human health and the environment,  
- Are consistent with the intent of CEPA 1999 to reduce the release of **volatile organic compounds (VOCs)**.

As a result, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, formally adopted the regulations under CEPA 1999.

## **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective is to **reduce the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)** during the **storage and loading of volatile petroleum liquids**. VOCs contribute to smog formation, respiratory health issues, and long-term environmental damage. These regulations specifically target:
- **Vapour emissions** from tanks and loading racks,
- **Leakage events** (both liquid and vapour),
- **Inadequate control systems** in facilities handling petroleum products.

By setting performance standards, monitoring requirements, and operational controls, the regulations aim to minimize fugitive emissions and improve environmental and public health outcomes—particularly in **population centres**.

## **3. Key Definitions (Core Terminology)**

The regulations define key terms to ensure clarity and consistency across enforcement and compliance:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)** | Any compound that participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions and is not excluded under item 60 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 to CEPA 1999. |
| **Volatile Petroleum Liquid (VPL)** | A liquid that: <br> • Exists as a liquid at 20°C and 101.325 kPa; <br> • Contains ≥10% VOCs by weight; <br> • Has vapour pressure >10 kPa (or >3.5 kPa if benzene >2%); <br> • Is not a low-petroleum ethanol blend (<10% petroleum). |
| **Facility** | Buildings, structures, and equipment used for storing or loading VPLs on a single property or connected properties within **2 km of each other**, sharing at least one operator. |
| **Existing Tank/Rack/Control System** | Equipment in service **on or before the date of regulation implementation**. |
| **Loading** | Transfer of liquid into or out of a vehicle tank or between a vehicle and a fixed roof tank. |
| **Loading Rack** | Includes loading arms, pumps, piping, instrumentation, and structures. |
| **Floating Roof** | A roof that floats on liquid to reduce vapour emissions. <br> - *Internal floating roof*: protected from atmosphere. <br> - *External floating roof*: exposed to atmosphere. |
| **Inerted Tank** | A tank with a non-hydrocarbon inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) so that oxygen levels are insufficient to support combustion. |
| **Vapour Leak** | Any release of vapour where VOC concentration exceeds: <br> • 10,000 ppmv (by volume) if detected **on or before Dec 31, 2026**; <br> • 1000 ppmv **after Dec 31, 2026**. |
| **Liquid Leak** | A leak where ≥3 drops per minute are observed visually over 3 minutes. |
| **Occupied Building** | A structure outside the facility boundary used for residence, work, education, healthcare, childcare, or community purposes (excluding tents, trailers, mobile homes built after regulation application). |
| **Operator** | The individual or entity managing the facility; if multiple parties, the one designated in writing; otherwise, the owner. |
| **Emissions Control Equipment** | Includes vapour control systems, temporary systems, internal/external floating roofs, pressure-vacuum vents, and vapour recovery/destruction systems. |
| **Fenceline Monitoring Program** | Must meet one of the following: <br> • Standards from the *Reduction in VOC Emissions Regulations (Petroleum Sector)*; <br> • Ontario Regulation 419/05 (Air Pollution – Local Air Quality); <br> • U.S. EPA Method 325A (sampling) and 325B (analysis), with modifications: <br>   - Sampling period: 13–15 days; <br>   - All samples must be analyzed for benzene. |
| **Loading Factor** | A numerical value indicating VOC emissions from a loading rack. |
| **Switch Loading** | Loading a non-VPL into a vehicle previously holding a VPL without purging vapours or washing the tank. |
| **Vehicle-to-Vehicle Loading** | Direct transfer from one vehicle to another without using a loading rack. |
| **Pressure-Vacuum Vent** | Allows gas to enter or exit a fixed roof tank during pressure/vacuum changes. |
| **Primary/Secondary Seal** | Seals on floating roofs to prevent vapour escape. Primary seal is closest to liquid surface; secondary seals are above it. |
| **Scheduled Maintenance** | Maintenance planned in advance to ensure compliance with design specs, schedules, or regulatory requirements. |
| **Standard m³** | Volume measured at 15°C and 101.325 kPa (normal conditions). |

## **4. Scope and Application**

These regulations apply to any **facility** that meets **at least one** of the following conditions:

1. **Total internal volume** of tanks storing volatile petroleum liquids ≥ **500 m³**  
2. **Total volume of VPL loaded** at the facility exceeds **4,000 standard m³ per calendar year**  
3. **At least one tank** at the facility is designated as a **high benzene tank** (benzene concentration >20% by weight)  
4. **At least one loading rack** is designated as a **high benzene loading rack** (used to load VPL with benzene >20% by weight)

> *Note:* The regulations apply to all **existing** tanks, racks, and systems in service on or before the effective date, and also to new facilities that meet these thresholds.

## **5. Key Provisions and Requirements**

### **A. Emissions Control Equipment Requirements**
- All **new or existing facilities** must install and maintain **effective emissions control equipment** to prevent VOC releases.
- Required equipment includes:
  - **Vapour control systems** (capture and prevent release of vapours),
  - **Vapour recovery systems** (capture vapours for reuse, not just for heat/energy),
  - **Vapour destruction systems** (combustion/thermal oxidation to destroy vapours),
  - **Vapour balancing systems** (recirculate vapours from receiving tank to source tank during loading to avoid release),
  - **Internal floating roofs** (preferred over external ones due to better vapour containment),
  - **Inerted tanks** (for high-risk storage of benzene-rich liquids).

> *Exception:* Facilities with only fixed roofs may be allowed under certain conditions, but must demonstrate equivalent emission control.

---

### **B. Monitoring and Reporting**
- Facilities must implement a **fenceline monitoring program** to detect VOC emissions near occupied buildings.
- Monitoring must:
  - Be conducted at least annually or more frequently if required by risk level,
  - Include sampling for **benzene** (mandatory),
  - Use approved methods (EPA 325A/B or equivalent),
  - Be performed by **qualified professionals** (engineers, chemists, scientists).

- **Records** of all monitoring, maintenance, and leak investigations must be retained for **at least 5 years**.

---

### **C. Leak Detection and Response**
- **Liquid leaks** must be detected and reported immediately if ≥3 drops per minute are observed.
- **Vapour leaks** must be reported if VOC concentration exceeds:
  - **10,000 ppmv** (before Dec 31, 2026),
  - **1,000 ppmv** (after Dec 31, 2026).

> *Note:* This creates a phased approach to reduce emissions over time, allowing facilities to transition to
