**Detailed Summary of the Antarctic Environmental Protection Regulations**

---

### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**

The **Antarctic Environmental Protection Regulations** are made under the **Antarctic Environmental Protection Act (Act)**, S.C. 2003, c. 20, by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment. These regulations establish a comprehensive framework for managing human activities in Antarctica to ensure environmental protection, consistent with international obligations under the **Antarctic Treaty System**, particularly the **Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty**.

The regulations are designed to prevent significant environmental harm, promote scientific research, and ensure sustainable and responsible operations in one of the most ecologically sensitive regions on Earth.
