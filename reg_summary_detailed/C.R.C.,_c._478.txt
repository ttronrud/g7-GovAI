  → *Role*: Has authority over financial security requirements for special services.

- **Special Services**:  
  This term defines a broad category of customs and excise services that may be provided **outside authorized hours** or under specific conditions, subject to approval by the Deputy Minister.  
  These include:

  - Services provided **on request** by any individual and approved by the Deputy Minister.

  - Services provided by an officer at a **distillery, brewery, tobacco manufactory, cigar manufactory, or tobacco packer** during a regular 8-hour workday (excluding Saturday and Sunday and public holidays).
  - Examinations or documentation of **military aircraft, vessels, or motor vehicles** at any time.
  - Examinations of the **effects of a settler or returning resident of Canada** during authorized hours at a destination within a port area.

#### **2. Charges for Special Services**

Every person who receives a special service must pay a **fee** based on the duration of the service:

- **First 2 hours (or part thereof)**: $54  
- **Each additional hour (or part thereof) beyond 2 hours**: $27

→ *Example*:  
If a service lasts 3 hours:  
- First 2 hours: $54  
- Remaining 1 hour: $27  
- Total charge: **$81**

→ *Note*: The fee applies per service, regardless of the number of officers involved.

#### **3. Transportation, Living Expenses, and Accommodation**

The person receiving the service must also:

- **Provide or pay for**:

#### **4. Time Calculation for Multiple Officers**

If **more than one officer** is engaged in performing a special service:

- The total time spent is the **sum (aggregate)** of all individual times spent by each officer.

→ *Example*:  
If Officer A spends 1.5 hours and Officer B spends 2.5 hours, the total time for billing purposes is **4 hours**.

→ *Purpose*: Prevents undercharging and ensures accurate billing based on actual service duration.

---

#### **5. Security Requirement (if applicable)**

If the **Chief Officer of Customs** for the relevant area determines that **security is needed** to ensure payment of charges incurred during a special service, then:

- The person requesting the service must provide **security**.
- The security must comply with the **Financial Security (Electronic Means) Regulations**.

### **Status: Repealed**

This regulation has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2024-41, section 2**.
