#### ✅ Summary in One Paragraph:
The Human Rights Tribunal Appeal Regulations, made under subsection 42.1(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, established the form and service requirements for filing appeals from Human Rights Tribunal decisions. These included a standardized notice of appeal that must be served personally or by registered mail and must contain specific details such as the date of the original decision, proposed hearing location, appellant’s address, and grounds for appeal. However, the regulation was **revoked in 1990 by SOR/90-286, sections 1 and 2**, and is no longer in force. As a result, current appeal procedures are governed by updated provincial or federal rules that reflect modern standards of access to justice, procedural fairness, and administrative efficiency.

### 📚 For Current Practice:
To understand today’s appeal process, refer to:
- The **Canadian Human Rights Act (as amended)**
- The **provincial Human Rights Codes** (e.g., Ontario Human Rights Code, BC Human Rights Code)
- The **official rules of the relevant Human Rights Tribunal** (e.g., Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Human Rights Commission of British Columbia)

These provide current, enforceable procedures for filing and conducting appeals.
