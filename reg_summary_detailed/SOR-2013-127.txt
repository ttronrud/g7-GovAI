Under **subsection 99.2(2)** of the *Customs Act*, customs officers may conduct searches of individuals who fall under the category defined in **Section 4** of these regulations.

##### **Frisk Search (Manual or Technical Search of Clothed Body)**

- **Scope**: Limited to the person’s clothed body; no physical contact with clothing or personal belongings beyond what is necessary for detection.

##### **Strip Search (Visual Inspection of Naked Body)**

- **When permitted**:  
  A strip search may be conducted if the officer **believes on reasonable grounds** that:
  - The person has hidden items on or about their body.
  - The items relate to a contravention of the Act or regulations.
  - The items could provide evidence of a violation.
  - The items are prohibited, controlled, or regulated.

### **Conclusion**

The *Customs Controlled Areas Regulations* provide a clear, lawful, and proportionate framework for managing security and compliance at Canada’s borders. They balance the need for effective enforcement and public safety with respect for individual rights and privacy. By defining who can access customs controlled areas, specifying required forms of communication, and strictly limiting the circumstances under which searches can occur, the regulations ensure that border operations remain lawful, transparent, and accountable.

These rules are essential for protecting national security, preventing illegal goods from entering or leaving the country, and maintaining the integrity of Canada’s customs system — all while respecting constitutional and human rights protections.
