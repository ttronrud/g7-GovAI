**1. Legal Authority and Source**  
This regulation is enacted under the authority granted by **paragraph 19(1)(b)a of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Treasury Board) to authorize the Minister of Foreign Affairs to issue orders that establish fees for specific government services or programs. In this case, the authority is specifically directed toward setting fees for participation in international youth exchange programs.

The regulation is found in **Statutes of Canada, 1991, Chapter 24, Section 6** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6), which is part of the *Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act* or related legislation (though the exact parent act may vary slightly in interpretation; the FAA provides the procedural framework).

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **authorize the Minister of Foreign Affairs to establish and prescribe a fee** that foreign nationals must pay to participate in an international youth exchange program hosted or administered by the Government of Canada.

These programs typically involve structured exchanges where young people from Canada and other countries engage in cultural, educational, or community-based activities, often through organizations such as the Canadian International Council, the Canadian Youth Exchange Program (CYEP), or other designated partners.

**3. Scope of the Authorization**  
- The Minister of Foreign Affairs is empowered to **prescribe a fee** that foreign nationals must pay to participate in such youth exchange programs.
- The fee is not a general administrative charge but is specifically tied to the **participation of foreign nationals** in these programs.
- The Minister has the discretion to set the amount, structure, and conditions of the fee, including whether it is a one-time payment, a recurring charge, or tied to specific program components (e.g., travel, orientation, or program duration).

---

**4. Key Features of the Authorization**  
- **Flexibility**: The regulation does not fix the fee amount; instead, it allows the Minister to issue an order (by regulation) to set the fee, enabling adjustments based on program costs, inflation, funding needs, or policy changes.
- **Procedural Legitimacy**: The authorization is not unilateral. It requires the **recommendation of both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Treasury Board**, ensuring that the fee is both policy-relevant and financially prudent.
- **Accountability**: The Treasury Board’s involvement ensures that the fee is justified and transparent, aligning with public financial accountability standards.
- **Applicability**: The fee applies specifically to **foreign nationals** participating in youth exchange programs in Canada, not to Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

---

**5. Implications and Considerations**  
- **Equity and Access**: The fee may impact access for participants from low-income or developing countries, potentially creating disparities. Therefore, the Minister may consider exemptions, waivers, or financial assistance mechanisms in future orders.
- **Transparency**: The fee must be clearly communicated to applicants, and the rationale for the fee (e.g., administrative costs, program delivery, risk management) should be disclosed.
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: The regulation enables the Minister to enforce payment as a condition of participation in the exchange program, with non-payment potentially resulting in disqualification.

---

**6. Limitations and Boundaries**  
- The regulation does not authorize the Minister to impose fees on Canadian citizens or residents.
- It does not extend to other types of international programs (e.g., student exchanges, volunteer programs, or diplomatic missions) unless specifically included in a subsequent order.
- The fee is limited to the **cost of participation** in youth exchange programs, not broader government services.

**7. Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a clear and legally sound mechanism for the Government of Canada to manage the financial aspects of international youth exchange programs. By authorizing the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prescribe a participation fee, it ensures that these programs can be sustainably funded while maintaining alignment with financial administration principles and international cooperation goals.

It reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and the promotion of youth diplomacy and cross-cultural understanding, a key component of Canada’s foreign policy and international engagement strategy.

**Note**: This regulation is not a fee schedule itself but a **general enabling provision** that allows the government to issue specific fee orders in the future, depending on the needs of the programs and the financial context. The actual fee amount would be determined in a subsequent regulatory order (e.g., a notice in the Canada Gazette).
