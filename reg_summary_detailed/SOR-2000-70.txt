The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2007-126, section 19**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**:  
  The regulation in question is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force or applicable. It has been formally removed from the legal framework.

- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2007-126**, specifically **section 19** of that instrument. Statutory Instruments (SIs) are secondary legislation tools used by the government to implement or amend laws without requiring a full act of Parliament.

- **Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal took effect on or around **June 1, 2007**, as SOR/2007-126 was published in the Canada Gazette that year.

- **Implication of Repeal**:  
  Any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation are **no longer enforceable**. Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals who relied on it must now comply with current, active legislation that replaces or supersedes it.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  While the specific rationale is not detailed in the provided text, common reasons for repealing a regulation include:
  - Obsolescence (the regulation no longer serves a current purpose),
  - Inconsistency with newer laws,
  - Duplication with other regulations,
  - Inefficiency or administrative burden,
  - Alignment with broader policy changes.

- **Contextual Note**:  
  The repeated appearance of the same line (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2007-126, s. 19]") suggests that this may have been a formatting or data entry error—possibly indicating that multiple sections or provisions were affected by the same repeal. However, without additional context (such as the original regulation's title or subject matter), it is not possible to identify the specific regulation that was repealed.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text has been **formally repealed** by **section 19 of Statutory Instrument 2007-126**, which was issued in June 2007. As such, it is **no longer in effect** and should not be relied upon for legal or regulatory purposes. To determine the exact content or scope of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the original text of the regulation prior to repeal, which is likely archived in official government legal databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations.gov* website.
