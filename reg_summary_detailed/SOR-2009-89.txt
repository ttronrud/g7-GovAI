The provided text consists solely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed**:

> "[Repealed, 2010, c. 12, s. 2171]"

This notation is standard in legal and regulatory documentation and means:

- The regulation was officially **repealed (cancelled or removed)** on **January 1, 2010** (as is typical for such legislative acts in Canadian jurisdictions, where "c. 12" refers to a specific chapter of an Act and "s. 2171" refers to section 2171 of that Act).
- The repeal was enacted through **Chapter 12 of the Statutes of 2010** (likely the *Statutes of Canada, 2010*), under **Section 2171**.
- The regulation no longer exists in force and is **not applicable** in current law.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: Repealed (no longer in effect).
- **Date of Repeal**: 2010 (specifically, the repeal took effect as part of the legislative amendments in that year).
- **Legal Citation**: 2010, c. 12, s. 2171 — this refers to the specific section in the 2010 Statutes of Canada that formally repealed the regulation.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: The original regulation (which is not described in the provided text) was likely a rule, order, or directive issued under a prior statute. Since the text does not include the original content or purpose of the regulation, its specific subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.) cannot be determined from this summary alone.
- **Implication**: Any legal or administrative action based on this regulation is now invalid. Authorities or individuals relying on it would need to refer to current, active legislation or regulations that replaced it (if any).

### Conclusion:

The provided information does not contain the content or purpose of the repealed regulation. It only confirms that the regulation was **officially removed from the legal framework in 2010** through a specific legislative amendment. To understand what the regulation originally governed, one would need to consult the original text of the statute or related legislative history prior to 2010.

Therefore, the summary is limited to the **status and legal citation** of the repeal, with no further detail about the regulation's content, scope, or function.
