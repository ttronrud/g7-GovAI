### **Detailed Summary of the Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Tunisia and Egypt) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Background**

The **Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Tunisia and Egypt) Regulations**, made under the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*, were introduced to address concerns regarding corruption and the misappropriation of state assets in Tunisia and Egypt.  

- **Key Grounds for Action**:
  - Tunisia and Egypt have formally notified the Government of Canada in writing that specific individuals listed in the regulations have:
    - Misappropriated property belonging to Tunisia or Egypt, respectively.
    - Acquired property improperly through their official positions or personal/business relationships.
  - These individuals are identified as **politically exposed persons (PEPs)**—individuals who hold or have held prominent public office or positions of influence in the respective countries.
  - There exists an **internal political instability or uncertain political situation** in both Tunisia and Egypt, raising concerns about the integrity of governance and the risk of further misuse of public funds or assets.
  - The Government of Canada concludes that freezing the assets of these individuals is **in the interest of international relations**, particularly in safeguarding Canada’s diplomatic and economic interests and upholding global anti-corruption standards.

#### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulations are enacted by **His Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, pursuant to **subsections 4(1) to (3)** of the *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*. This legislative framework allows Canada to take action against foreign officials suspected of corruption, even without direct evidence of wrongdoing in Canada, provided there is sufficient international notification and justification.

---

#### **3. Scope and Application**

- **Definition of "Tunisia"**:  
  In these regulations, "Tunisia" refers to the **Tunisian Republic**.

- **Applicability of Section 3**:  
  Section 3 applies to the **property of the politically exposed foreign persons** listed in **Schedule 1** of the regulations.

- **Prohibited Actions by Canadian Persons**:
  Any person in Canada is prohibited from:
  1. **Dealing directly or indirectly** in any property (whether located in Canada or abroad) belonging to a listed politically exposed foreign person.
  2. **Entering into or facilitating** any financial transaction related to such dealing.
  3. **Providing financial services or related services** (e.g., banking, investment, advisory) for the property of any such individual.

> This effectively restricts Canadian financial institutions, individuals, and businesses from engaging in any financial activity involving the listed persons, including transfers, purchases, sales, or investments.

#### **4. List of Individuals Affected**

The regulations name the following individuals as politically exposed foreign persons (PEPs) in relation to Tunisia:

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Fahd Mohamed Sakher Ben Moncef Ben Mohamed Hafiz EL MATRI** (also known as Fahd Mohamed Sakher Ben Moncef Ben Mohamed Hfaiez MATERI) | Born December 2, 1981, in Tunis; son of Naïma BOUTIBA; spouse of Nesrine BEN ALI |
| **Belhassen Ben Mohamed Ben Rhouma TRABELSI** (also known as Belhassen Ben Mohamed Ben Rehouma TRABELSI) | Born November 5, 1962, in Tunis; son of Saïda DHRIF |
| **Moez Ben Moncef Ben Mohamed TRABELSI** (also known as Moez Ben Moncef Ben Mohamed TRABELSI) | Born July 3, 1973, in Tunis; son of Yamina SOUIAÏ |
| **Zohra Bent Hedi Ben Ali JILANI** | Spouse of Belhassen TRABELSI |

#### **5. Legal Effect and Timing**

- **Application Before Publication**:  
  For the purpose of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, these regulations **come into force before they are published in the Canada Gazette**. This means that the restrictions apply immediately upon adoption by the Governor in Council, ensuring prompt enforcement in response to urgent international concerns.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The regulations **come into force on the day of registration** with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) or the relevant government body.

---

#### **6. Status and Repeal**

- These regulations were **repealed on April 1, 2016**, under **SOR/2016-41, section 4**.  
  This indicates that the Government of Canada has since determined that the need for these specific freezing measures no longer exists—either due to:
  - The resolution of the political instability in Tunisia or Egypt,
  - The conclusion of allegations of corruption,
  - The expiration of the temporary emergency provisions,
  - Or the implementation of alternative measures.

> Therefore, **the regulations are no longer in force** as of April 1, 2016. Any current financial restrictions would now be governed by other, more current anti-corruption or PEP-related frameworks.

---

#### **7. Key Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Precautionary Approach** | Canada acts proactively based on international reports and diplomatic notifications, even without conclusive evidence of wrongdoing in Canada. |
| **Focus on Political Exposure** | The regulations target individuals with high-level public office or family ties to such individuals, recognizing that their positions expose them to greater risks of corruption. |
| **Financial Sovereignty and International Cooperation** | The measures reflect Canada’s commitment to international anti-corruption efforts and help maintain trust in global financial systems. |
| **Temporary and Targeted** | The regulations are not permanent; they are reactive, time-bound, and based on specific national conditions (e.g., political instability). |

---

#### **8. Limitations and Considerations**

- **No Direct Evidence Required in Canada**:  
  The regulation does not require proof of wrongdoing *within Canada*. It relies on official notifications from Tunisia and Egypt.

- **No Automatic Criminal Charges**:  
  Freezing assets is a **financial restriction**, not a criminal prosecution. It does not equate to a conviction or legal penalty in Canada.

- **Family Members Included**:  
  The inclusion of family members reflects a common practice in anti-corruption regimes to prevent indirect financial benefits from PEPs.

- **Geographic Scope**:  
  The restrictions apply to **all property located anywhere in the world**, not just in Canada.

### **Conclusion**

The *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials (Tunisia and Egypt) Regulations* were a targeted, temporary measure introduced to address concerns about corruption and political instability in Tunisia and Egypt. They enabled Canadian financial institutions and individuals to refrain from engaging in financial dealings with specific politically exposed persons and their families. However, due to the **repeal in 2016**, the regulations are **no longer active**. Their historical significance lies in demonstrating Canada’s role in international anti-corruption cooperation and its willingness to act swiftly in response to diplomatic alerts.

> **Current Status**: **Repealed (as of April 1, 2016)**  
> **Relevant Legislation**: *Freezing Assets of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act*  
> **Enacted**: S.C. 2011, c. 10  
> **Repealed by**: SOR/2016-41, s. 4
