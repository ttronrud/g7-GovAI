**Detailed Summary of the Toys Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Toys Regulations*, made under **section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**, establish comprehensive safety standards for toys intended for children under 14 years of age. These regulations are designed to protect children from physical, chemical, and fire-related hazards by setting strict requirements for materials, design, labeling, and performance.

The regulations apply to all toys sold or distributed in Canada and are enforced by the **Minister of Health**, on the recommendation of the Governor in Council. All required warnings and labeling must be presented in **both English and French**, reflecting Canada’s official languages.

## **Key Definitions**

1. **Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)**  
   - Refers to scientific standards outlined in the OECD document *ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17* (1998), ensuring data integrity, transparency, and reproducibility in testing.

2. **Good Scientific Practices (GSP)**  
   - For **test data and procedures**: Must follow or be equivalent to OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals (as amended).  
   - For **laboratory practices**: Must comply with GLP principles.

3. **Human Experience Data**  
   - Peer-reviewed data demonstrating whether human exposure to a substance or stuffing material has resulted in injury.

4. **Plush Toy**  
   - A toy with a raised fiber surface; excludes toys intended to be entered by a child.

5. **Soft Toy**  
   - Includes stuffed or pliable rubber/plastic toys; excludes toys intended to be entered by a child.

6. **Toy**  
   - Any product intended for use by a child under 14 years of age in learning or play.

7. **Toy Intended to Be Entered by a Child**  
   - A toy constructed from fabric or pliable material that fully or almost fully encloses a child (e.g., a dollhouse with a small opening).

> *Note: A repealed provision (SOR/2016-195, s.1) previously addressed certain safety aspects and is no longer in force.*

## **Core Safety Requirements**

### **1. Packaging of Toys (Flexible Film Bags)**  
A flexible plastic film bag packaging a toy must meet **one** of the following:
- Have an opening **less than 356 mm (14 inches)** in circumference; or  
- Be made from film **at least 0.019 mm (0.75 mil)** thick and carry a **clear, bilingual warning**:

> “PLASTIC BAGS CAN BE DANGEROUS. TO AVOID DANGER OF SUFFOCATION, KEEP THIS BAG AWAY FROM BABIES AND CHILDREN.”  
> “LES SACS DE PLASTIQUE PEUVENT ÊTRE DANGEREUX. POUR ÉVITER LE DANGER DE SUFFOCATION, NE LAISSEZ PAS CE SAC À LA PORTÉE DES BÉBÉS NI DES ENFANTS.”

> *Purpose:* Prevents suffocation risk from children swallowing or breathing in plastic bags.

---

### **2. Electrical Toys**  
Must comply with **CSA Standard C22.2 No. 149-1972** (*Electrically Operated Toys*), published in English (1972) and French (1976).  
- Covers electrical safety, overheat protection, grounding, and insulation.

**Electrically Operated Wood-Burning Tools** must meet **CSA Standard C22.2 No. 122-M1989** (*Hand-Held Electrically Heated Tools*), including heat resistance and ignition prevention.

---

### **3. Small Parts & Separable Components**  
Toys **likely to be used by children under 3 years old** must:
- Not contain any part that can be **separated** or **become separated** during normal use and can be **fully enclosed** in the **"small parts cylinder"** (Schedule 1) using a force of **≤ 4.45 N** (about 1 pound).

> *Exception:* Applies only to parts made entirely of **soft textile fiber material** (e.g., cotton stuffing).

> *Purpose:* Prevents ingestion of small, dangerous parts.

---

### **4. Sharp Edges and Metal Surfaces**  
- All **exposed metal edges** must be:
  - Folded back, or
  - Painted, dipped, or otherwise treated to eliminate sharpness and burrs.

- **Wire frames or structures** must have wire ends **covered, turned in, or turned back** to prevent exposure.

- **Plastic parts** that could break and expose sharp edges must:
  - Be **sufficiently thick** to resist breakage; or  
  - Be made from **inherently tough materials** if thin due to function.

> *Purpose:* Prevents cuts and lacerations from sharp edges.

---

### **5. Wood and Glass Safety**  
- **Wood surfaces, edges, and corners** must be **smoothly finished**.  
- **Glass edges and corners** must also be **smoothly finished** to prevent cuts.

---

### **6. Fasteners**  
All fasteners must not cause injury during foreseeable use. Specific requirements:
- **Nails and staples**: Must be properly attached.
- **Countersunk wood screws**: Must be fully countersunk.
- **Wood screws**: Must have no exposed burrs.
- **Upholstery fasteners**: Must be securely attached and non-hazardous if exposed.
- **Threaded bolts**: Must have **acorn caps or protective nuts** unless they are placed in a **protected area** where contact is unlikely.

> *Purpose:* Prevents pinching, puncturing, or embedded fasteners.

---

### **7. Folding Mechanisms and Stability**  
- Folding mechanisms, brackets, or bracing must include a **safety stop or locking device** to prevent **unintentional collapse**.

> *Purpose:* Prevents sudden collapse that could injure a child.

---

### **8. Spring-Wound Mechanisms (Non-Construction Sets)**  
Mechanisms that could injure a child’s finger must:
- Have **moving parts enclosed** so they cannot be touched;
- Have an **outer case** that can withstand reasonable abuse without exposing the mechanism;
- For **non-detachable winding keys**: Must be shaped and sized so a child’s finger cannot get caught;
- For **detachable keys or handles**: Clearance between key and toy must be:
  - **Less than 2 mm** (1/16 inch), or  
  - **More than 10 mm** (3/8 inch) — *this is a safety buffer to prevent accidental contact*.

> *Purpose:* Prevents entrapment or pinching of fingers.

---

### **9. Projectile Components (Non-Rocketry)**  
- Must have a **rubber tip or durable fitting** on the leading end capable of withstanding a **pulling force of 44.5 N (10 lbs)**.

> *Purpose:* Prevents puncture wounds from sharp ends.

---

### **10. Suffocation Prevention (Enclosed Toys)**  
Toys that:
- Are large enough for a child to enter or place inside; and  
- Have a lid or door that can close  

**Must have sufficient holes** in **two or more adjacent sides** to prevent suffocation.

> *Purpose:* Prevents children from being trapped or suffocated inside the toy.

---

### **11. Stability of Stationary Toys**  
- A stationary toy intended to bear a child’s weight must **stand level and firm** when used.

> *Purpose:* Prevents tipping or falling, which could cause injury.

---

### **12. Noise Levels**  
- A toy must **not emit noise exceeding 100 dB** when measured at the distance a child would normally be from the toy.

> *Purpose:* Prevents hearing damage from loud noises.

---

### **13. Thermal Safety and Labeling**  
- Toys with surfaces or substances that may become heated must meet **thermal safety requirements** in **CSA Standard C22.2 No. 149-1972**.

> *Purpose:* Prevents burns from overheating.

---

### **14. Prohibited Materials (Toxic Substances)**  
Toys **must not contain** any of the following substances if accessible to children or if used as stuffing:

- Contain **≤10 mg/kg total mercury**

> *Testing must follow good laboratory practices (GLP)*
