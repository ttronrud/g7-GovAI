**Detailed Summary of the *Student Employment Programs Participants Regulations***  
*(S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12 and 13)*

---

### **Overview**

The *Student Employment Programs Participants Regulations* were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Public Service Commission, pursuant to **Section 21 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**. These regulations establish specific rules governing the hiring, employment, and eligibility of students participating in federal student employment programs within the Canadian public service.

These regulations are designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and merit-based selection while recognizing the unique status of student participants—particularly their educational status and transitional nature of employment.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**: Refers to the *Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)*, which sets out the rules for public service appointments, employment, and internal processes.

2. **Student Employment Program**:  
   Includes the following programs:
   - The **Federal Student Work Experience Program**
   - The **Research Affiliate Program**
   - The **Post-Secondary Co-op/Internship Program**
   - Any other student employment program established by the **Treasury Board**, after consultation with the **Public Service Commission**

   This definition ensures flexibility to adapt to evolving needs and new initiatives, while maintaining oversight and consistency.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations apply to individuals participating in a student employment program **except** that they are **excluded from the full application of the Public Service Employment Act**, except for the following provisions:

- **Section 2** (General principles of public service employment)
- **Subsections 15(1) and (2)** (Provisions related to the right to work and employment conditions)
- **Sections 16 to 21, 24, 25, 29, 34, 54, 55, 66 to 72, 111 to 122, 134, and 135**

> This means that most of the standard employment rules (e.g., internal appointment processes, disciplinary procedures, tenure, etc.) do **not apply** to student participants. However, certain core rights and obligations (such as the right to work and basic employment conditions) remain in force.

---

### **Eligibility for Appointment**

A participant may be appointed to the public service under a student employment program **if**:
- They meet the **qualifications required** for the specific work to be performed, and  
- The appointment is **free from personal favouritism or political influence**

This ensures that appointments are based on merit and competence, consistent with public service values.

---

### **Precedence for Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents**

A participant who is:
- A **Canadian citizen** (as defined in the *Citizenship Act*), or  
- A **permanent resident** (as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*)

...must be **prioritized** over non-Canadian citizens or non-permanent residents who are not already employed in a student employment program, **if** they meet the qualifications for the position.

> This rule promotes national interest and supports the retention of Canadian talent in public service roles during training and early career development.

---

### **Eligibility for Internal Appointment Processes**

A student participant **may only participate in an internal appointment process** if all of the following conditions are met:

1. **Specific inclusion**: The participant must be **explicitly included** in the area of selection defined in the advertised internal appointment process.

2. **Meeting selection criteria**: The participant must satisfy **all other eligibility criteria** established for that area of selection (e.g., qualifications, experience, etc.).

3. **Demonstrated capacity to complete education/training**: The participant must be able to **demonstrate** that they can complete their **post-secondary education program or vocational training program** within the time frame specified in the advertisement.

> This condition ensures that students are not placed in permanent or long-term positions before completing their formal education, preserving the integrity of the training and employment relationship.

---

### **Prohibition on Early Appointment via Internal Process**

A participant who is selected through an **advertised internal appointment process** **cannot be appointed** before they have **successfully completed** their post-secondary education or vocational training program.

> This provision prevents students from being "promoted" into permanent public service roles prematurely, protecting both the student’s academic commitments and the public service’s need for qualified, trained personnel.

---

### **Treatment of Appointments Outside the Student Program**

If a participant **accepts an appointment to the public service that is outside a student employment program** during the period they are serving under a student program, they are treated, for the purposes of **Section 61 of the Public Service Employment Act**, **as though they were appointed from outside the public service**.

> This means that:
- Their appointment is not considered a continuation of the student program.
- They are subject to the full rules of Section 61 (which governs the rights and obligations of individuals appointed from outside the public service), including potential eligibility for benefits, status, and career progression.

> This rule ensures that individuals transitioning from student employment to regular public service roles are not treated as having a special or transitional status that could create inconsistencies or unfair advantages.

---

### **Repeal and Continuity**

- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.

- However, **Section 4** of the previous version of the regulations (as it existed immediately before the new regulations came into force) **continues to apply** to any appointment processes that **began before the effective date** of these new regulations.

> This provides **continuity and stability** for ongoing hiring processes, ensuring that existing appointments and processes are not disrupted by the introduction of new rules.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fairness and Merit** | Appointments are based on qualifications and free from favouritism or politics. |
| **National Interest** | Preference is given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents, supporting domestic talent. |
| **Educational Integrity** | Students must complete their programs before transitioning into permanent roles. |
| **Transparency** | Internal appointment processes must clearly include student participants and specify timeframes. |
| **Clarity in Status** | When students move beyond student employment, their status is treated as if they joined from outside the public service. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Student Employment Programs Participants Regulations* provide a clear, structured, and fair framework for managing the employment of students in federal public service programs. By balancing the need for early exposure to public service work with the requirement for academic completion and professional readiness, the regulations support both the development of future public servants and the integrity of the public service hiring system.

They also reinforce the principle that student employment is a **transitional, educational experience**, not a permanent career path—ensuring that individuals enter public service with appropriate qualifications and full accountability.
