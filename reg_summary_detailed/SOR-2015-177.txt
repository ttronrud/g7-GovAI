**Detailed Summary of the Aquaculture Activities Regulations (SOR/2014-91)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Aquaculture Activities Regulations* (SOR/2014-91), made under **section 36(5.2)b of the Fisheries Act** (c. F-14), are a set of detailed federal rules governing the **deposit of deleterious substances** in aquaculture operations. These regulations were issued by the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** on **June 26, 2015**, following a formal process under the *Fisheries Act* and its enabling provisions.

These regulations apply to **all aquaculture facilities in Canada** that cultivate fish, and they establish **strict conditions** for the use of drugs, pest control products, and biochemical oxygen-demanding (BOD) matter — substances that can harm fish and their habitats — particularly in **tidal waters**.

---

## **Key Objectives**

1. **Protect fish and fish habitat** from adverse impacts caused by the deposition of potentially harmful substances.
2. **Ensure transparency and accountability** through monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements.
3. **Promote environmentally responsible aquaculture practices**, especially in ecologically sensitive areas like tidal zones.
4. **Balance aquaculture development with environmental protection**, by requiring risk mitigation and alternatives assessments.

## **Core Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Fisheries Act* (c. F-14). |
| **Aquaculture** | The cultivation of fish. |
| **Aquaculture Licence** | Includes federal or provincial licenses/leases for aquaculture operations. |
| **Barren Substrate** | Benthic substrate (seabed) with no visible organisms. |
| **Biochemical Oxygen Demanding Matter (BOD)** | Organic material that consumes dissolved oxygen in water or sediment. |
| **Monitoring Standard** | A technical standard developed and maintained by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), used to guide environmental assessments and monitoring. |

## **Deleterious Substances and Their Use**

The following substances are classified as **deleterious** and must be deposited only under strict conditions:

### 1. **Drugs**
- Drugs permitted or authorized under the *Food and Drugs Act*.
- **Requirements**:
  - Must be prescribed by a **veterinarian authorized under provincial law**.
  - If not located in a province, the prescription must be from a veterinarian in any province.
  - The owner/operator must **minimize accidental release**.
  - Before depositing, they must **consider alternatives** and **record this consideration**.

### 2. **Pest Control Products**
- Must be **registered** under the *Pest Control Products Act* (PCPA), or:
  - Authorized under **subsection 21(5)** or **41(1)** of the PCPA, or
  - Exempted under **paragraph 67(1)(z.4)** of the PCPA.
- **Requirements**:
  - Must be used **in compliance with all conditions** (e.g., usage location, quantity, concentration).
  - Must **consider alternatives** and **record the assessment**.
  - Must **notify the Minister at least 72 hours before** any deposit, including:
    - Product name
    - Date, time, and geographic coordinates of deposit

### 3. **Biochemical Oxygen Demanding Matter (BOD)**
- Includes fish feces and unconsumed feed.
- Must be deposited **only under conditions that minimize harm** to fish and habitats.

---

## **Environmental Protection Measures**

### **General Requirement (Section 4–14)**
- Owners/operators must take **reasonable measures** to minimize harm to fish and fish habitat **outside the facility**, considering:
  - Cost and effectiveness of available mitigation measures
  - Degree and nature of potential harm
  - Physical characteristics of the facility and aquaculture type

### **For Facilities with High Biomass (>2.5 t standing or >5 t annual production)**
- Must take **additional measures** to minimize deposition of:
  - Fish feces
  - Unconsumed feed

---

## **Pre-Deposit Environmental Assessment (Tidal Finfish Facilities)**

**Applies to finfish aquaculture facilities in tidal waters** that begin operations **after June 26, 2015**.

### **Mandatory Pre-Deposit Information Submission (within 300 days of operation start)**

Must submit to the Minister:
1. **Predicted footprint of BOD** (calculated using the *Monitoring Standard*)
2. **Seabed survey** identifying fish and fish habitat (in water column and on seabed)
3. **Bathymetry** (seabed depth) of leased area
4. **Additional soft-bottom data** (if applicable)

> **Exception**: Facilities with a maximum standing biomass ≤2.5 t or annual production ≤5 t are **exempt**.

### **If Operations Begin Within 300 Days of Regulation Coming Into Force**
- Must submit the required information **within 30 days** of commencement.

### **If a Permit Application is Approved That Would Increase BOD Footprint**
- Must conduct required studies and submit the information within **30 days** of application approval.

> **Note**: The studies must be conducted **in accordance with the Monitoring Standard**.

---

## **Free Sulfide Monitoring (Soft Bottom Tidal Facilities)**

Applies to finfish facilities in **tidal waters** in or adjacent to:

- Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador
- British Columbia

### **Mandatory Sulfide Sampling**
- Must take benthic substrate samples at specified times and locations per the Monitoring Standard.
- Must determine **free sulfide concentration**.

### **Exemption Thresholds**
- **Quebec, NS, NB, PEI, NL**: If mean free sulfide > **3000 µM** → **no restocking allowed**
- **BC**: 
  - >1300 µM at 30 m from structure → no restocking
  - >700 µM at 125 m from structure → no restocking

> **"Restocking"** refers to adding new fish to the facility.

### **Visual Monitoring as Alternative**
If samples cannot be obtained (e.g., sediment depth <5 cm or volume <15 ml, disturbed interface), the owner may conduct **visual monitoring** instead.

#### **Visual Monitoring Rules**
- **Quebec, NS, NB, PEI, NL**:
  - If **>70%** of monitored locations show:
    - *Beggiatoa* species or similar bacteria
    - Marine worms
    - Barren substrate → **no restocking**
- **British Columbia**:
  - If **≥10% coverage** of:
    - Any four segments (100–124 m from structure), OR
    - Two contiguous segments (116–124 m) and two or more (124–140 m) → **no restocking**

---

## **Notification Requirements**

### **To the Minister**
- **Sulfide or biological thresholds exceeded** (as per above)
- **Presence of Beggiatoa, marine worms, or barren substrate** beyond thresholds
- **Within 14 days** of:
  - Sample collection
  - Visual monitoring completion

### **To a Fishery Officer (Emergency Notification)**
- If **fish morbidity or mortality** is observed **within 96 hours** of a drug or pest control product deposit:
  - Must immediately notify the officer with:
    - Facility name and operator
    - Geographic coordinates of affected fish
    - Estimated number and species of fish
    - Product name and date of deposit

---

## **Ministerial Directions and Compliance**

- If the Minister directs the owner/operator to take **measures under section 36(6)** of the *Fisheries Act* (e.g., to reduce harm to wild fish), and the direction relates to a prior notification (e.g., about sulfide or biological issues), the owner must:
  - **Cease depositing** the drug or pest control product
  - Comply with the Minister’s directions before resuming deposits

---

## **Annual Reporting Requirements**

### **What Must Be Included**
Each annual report must contain:
- For every drug or pest control product deposit:
