The provided text consists of three identical statements:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2018-278, s. 2]"

This indicates that a specific regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by **SOR/2018-278, section 2**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** — meaning it is no longer in force or applicable.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2018-278** (SOR/2018-278), which is a formal amendment or correction to legislation in Canada.
- **Section Cited**: Section 2 of SOR/2018-278 specifically contains the provision that repeals the referenced regulation.
- **Effective Date**: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, such repeals typically take effect upon the publication of the statutory instrument in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* (the official publication of federal regulations), which occurred in 2018.
- **Implication**: Any legal or operational requirement derived from the repealed regulation is no longer valid. Legal entities, government agencies, or individuals relying on that regulation must now refer to updated or replacement provisions, if any.

### Context:
SOR stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Regulations*, and SOR/2018-278 is a federal regulation or amendment to a regulatory framework. The specific regulation being repealed is not named in the provided text — only that it was repealed by section 2 of that instrument.

### Conclusion:
The statement "[Repealed, SOR/2018-278, s. 2]" serves as a legal notice that a prior regulation has been formally canceled. The regulation is no longer enforceable or applicable, and its content has been removed from the legal framework. To understand what the original regulation was, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation prior to its repeal, which may be archived in official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders* database.

⚠️ **Note**: Without the original regulation’s title or subject matter, this summary only confirms the status (repealed) and the legal mechanism (SOR/2018-278, s. 2), not the substance or purpose of the repealed rule.
