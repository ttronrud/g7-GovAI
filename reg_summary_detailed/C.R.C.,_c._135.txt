**Detailed Summary of the Alberta Turkey Marketing Levies Order**

---

### **Overview**
The *Alberta Turkey Marketing Levies Order* is a regulatory instrument under the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* (the "Act") of Alberta. Its primary purpose is to establish a system of **market levies** that producers must pay when they sell turkeys in excess of their allocated market entitlements. These levies are designed to ensure fair market distribution, support sustainable turkey production, and manage supply in alignment with provincial and national marketing quotas.

This Order may be cited as the **Alberta Turkey Marketing Levies Order**.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* of Alberta. This Act provides the legal framework for regulating agricultural product marketing, including the establishment of marketing boards and the imposition of levies.

2. **Commodity Board**  
   The *Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Board* (referred to as "Commodity Board"), established under the Act. It is responsible for administering the marketing plan, managing quotas, and collecting levies on turkey sales.

3. **Market Allotment**  
   The total quantity of turkey meat a producer is legally permitted to market—whether domestically (intraprovincial), across provinces (interprovincial), or internationally (export)—based on the Canadian Turkey Marketing Quota Regulations and the Commodity Board’s approved marketing plan. This allotment is set annually or periodically and serves as a cap on production and sales.

4. **Plan**  
   The *Alberta Turkey Growers’ Marketing Plan*, which is established and amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the rules, quotas, and allocation mechanisms for turkey production and marketing. It guides the Commodity Board in determining market allotments and managing supply.

5. **Producer**  
   Any individual or entity engaged in the **production of turkeys** within the Province of Alberta. This includes farmers, poultry operations, or other entities involved in raising turkeys for slaughter.

6. **Turkey**  
   Any turkey—regardless of breed, grade, or class—that is **raised or kept for slaughter within Alberta** and subsequently sold for slaughter. This includes both broilers and heavy breed turkeys (hens and toms).

### **Levy Structure (Section 3)**

Producers are required to pay levies **in addition to licence fees** specified in the Plan. The levies apply only when a producer sells turkeys **in excess of their annual or periodic market allotment**.

| Type of Turkey | Levy Rate |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Broiler turkey** (sold in excess of allotment) | **$0.50 per bird** |
| **Heavy breed hen turkey** (sold in excess of allotment) | **$0.77 per bird** |
| **Heavy breed tom turkey** (sold in excess of allotment) | **$1.27 per bird** |
| **Heavy breed turkey from an unsexed flock** (sold in excess of allotment) | **$1.02 per bird** |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These levies are only triggered when the number of turkeys sold exceeds the producer’s approved market allotment. Sales within the allotment are not subject to levies.

### **Payment Obligations**

#### 1. **When a Buyer Purchases Turkeys**
- Every person (e.g., processor, distributor, retailer) who **buys turkeys from a producer** must:
  - **Deduct the applicable levy** from the total amount payable to the producer.
  - **Forward the full levy amount** to the Commodity Board.
- The payment must be made **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.
- The payment address is:  
  **11826-100th Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta**

> Example: If turkeys are sold in March, the levy must be paid by April 15.

#### 2. **When a Producer Pays Unpaid Levies**
- If a producer **fails to have the levies deducted** by a buyer (e.g., the buyer does not deduct the levy), the producer is responsible for paying them directly.
- The producer must pay all such levies to the Commodity Board **not later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which the turkeys were sold**.

> This ensures that levies are collected regardless of whether a buyer deducts them.

### **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

- **Supply Management**: The market allotment system prevents overproduction and market saturation, helping maintain stable prices and avoiding waste.
- **Equity and Fairness**: Levies are tiered based on turkey type, reflecting differences in production costs, market value, and demand (e.g., heavy breed turkeys are generally more valuable and costly to raise).
- **Revenue for the Commodity Board**: The levies generate funds that can be used to support the marketing plan, including research, promotion, quality assurance, and market development.
- **Compliance and Accountability**: The clear payment timelines and responsibilities ensure transparency and accountability in the marketing process.

---

### **Key Compliance Requirements**

- Producers must **track and report** their sales volume against their market allotment.
- Buyers must **deduct levies accurately** and **make timely payments** to the Commodity Board.
- Both parties are required to **maintain records** of transactions and levy deductions for audit and compliance purposes.

---

### **Enforcement and Penalties**

While not explicitly detailed in this Order, enforcement is typically carried out by the Commodity Board through:
- Audits of sales records
- Verification of market allotment compliance
- Fines or penalties for non-compliance with levy payment deadlines or underreporting

These enforcement mechanisms are generally governed under the broader *Marketing of Agricultural Products Act* and associated regulations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Alberta Turkey Marketing Levies Order* establishes a structured, fair, and transparent system to manage turkey production and marketing in Alberta. By imposing tiered levies on excess sales, it:
- Controls supply,
- Protects market stability,
- Supports producer sustainability,
- Generates revenue for marketing initiatives,
- Ensures accountability among producers and buyers.

This regulation is a critical component of Alberta’s agricultural policy framework, ensuring that turkey markets operate efficiently and equitably within the broader Canadian agricultural system.
