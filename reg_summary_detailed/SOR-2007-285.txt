**Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Burma) Regulations (S.C. 1992, c. 17)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

The *Special Economic Measures (Burma) Regulations*, made under the *Special Economic Measures Act* (SEMA), were introduced by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The primary justification for these measures is the **grave breach of international peace and security** in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), which has led to or is likely to lead to a **serious international crisis**.

These regulations are part of Canada’s foreign policy response to human rights abuses, political instability, and systemic violations of international law in Myanmar. The goal is to **apply targeted economic sanctions** to individuals and entities that have contributed to or supported authoritarian rule, human rights violations, and the suppression of democratic processes.
