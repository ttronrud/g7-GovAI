### **4. Calculation of Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**

#### **General Formula (for loans not via credit card/line of credit):**
> **APR = (Total Cost of Borrowing / Average Outstanding Principal) × (100 / Term in Years)**  
Where:
- Total cost of borrowing = sum of all interest and fees over the loan term
- Average outstanding principal = average of the principal balance at the end of each payment period (before any payment is deducted)
- Term = loan duration in years (to at least two decimal places)

#### **Key Rules for APR Calculation:**
| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Rounding** | APR may be rounded to the **nearest eighth of a percent** (e.g., 5.125%) |
| **Payment Application Order** | Each payment must first cover **accumulated cost of borrowing**, then reduce the **outstanding principal** |
| **Time Periods** | - 1 month = 1/12 year<br>- 1 week = 1/52 year<br>- 1 day = 1/365 year |
| **Variable Interest Rates** | Must use the **rate in effect on the day of calculation** |
| **No Installments** | If no payments exist, APR is calculated assuming repayment in **one lump sum at maturity** |
| **New Credit Agreements** | A loan with a balance from a prior agreement is treated as a **new credit agreement** for APR purposes |

#### **APR for Credit Cards & Lines of Credit**
- **Fixed interest rate** → APR = that fixed rate  
- **Variable interest rate** → APR = rate **in effect on the disclosure date**

> ⚠️ If there is **no cost of borrowing beyond interest**, the APR equals the interest rate.
