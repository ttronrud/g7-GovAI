**Detailed Summary of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission Privileges and Immunities Order**

---

**1. Purpose and Authority of the Order**

The *Great Lakes Fishery Commission Privileges and Immunities Order* is a regulatory instrument issued under the authority of the *Privileges and Immunities (International Organizations) Act*. Specifically, it was made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for External Affairs. This action is grounded in **Section 3** of the aforementioned Act, which empowers the federal government to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations operating within Canada.

The primary objective of this Order is to formally recognize and confer upon the **Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC)** the legal status and immunities necessary for it to carry out its international functions effectively and without undue interference from Canadian authorities.

**2. Citation and Legal Identity**

The Order is officially cited as the *Great Lakes Fishery Commission Privileges and Immunities Order*. This citation ensures clarity and legal reference in future judicial, administrative, or legislative contexts.

---

**3. Key Definitions**

The Order establishes two core definitions:

- **"Convention"** refers to the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* (1946). This international treaty serves as the legal framework for granting immunities and privileges to international organizations, particularly those that are part of the United Nations system or operate under similar principles of neutrality and operational independence.

- **"Organization"** refers to the **Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC)**, an intergovernmental body established to manage and protect fishery resources in the Great Lakes region. The GLFC consists of member countries including Canada, the United States, and several other nations sharing the Great Lakes.

**4. Legal Status and Immunities Granted**

The most significant provision of the Order is that the Great Lakes Fishery Commission shall be granted the following **legal capacities and immunities**:

- **Corporate Status**: The Organization shall have the **legal capacity of a body corporate**. This means that the GLFC can enter into contracts, own property, sue and be sued, and conduct other legal transactions in its own name — all of which are essential for an international body to operate independently and effectively.

- **Immunities and Privileges**: To the extent required for the performance of its functions, the GLFC shall enjoy the immunities and privileges specified in **Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Article II of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations**.

These specific sections confer the following rights and protections:

- **Section 2**: Immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction in Canada for acts carried out in the course of its official duties. This means that GLFC officials and staff may not be subject to Canadian criminal or civil prosecution for actions related to their work, provided such actions are within the scope of their official functions.

- **Section 5**: Immunity from service of process (i.e., legal summonses or court orders) in Canada. This protects the Commission and its personnel from being compelled to appear in Canadian courts or to respond to legal notices.

- **Section 6**: Immunity from taxation in Canada. This includes protection from Canadian income, property, or other taxes on income derived from activities carried out by the Commission or its members.

- **Section 7**: Immunity from search and seizure of property or documents. This ensures that the Commission’s offices, equipment, and records cannot be searched or seized without proper authorization, unless in cases involving criminal offenses unrelated to official duties.

- **Section 8**: Immunity from interference with the freedom of movement of its personnel. This allows GLFC staff to travel freely and carry out their duties without undue restriction or interference from Canadian authorities.

---

**5. Scope and Limitations**

- The immunities and privileges are **not absolute**. They are granted **"to such extent as may be required for the performance of its functions"**, meaning they are limited to activities directly related to the Commission’s mandate — namely, the management, conservation, and sustainable use of fishery resources in the Great Lakes.

- The Order does **not extend** to acts that are illegal, unrelated to official duties, or involve violations of Canadian law or public order. For example, if a GLFC official engages in fraud or corruption, they would still be subject to Canadian legal action.

- The privileges are **not conferred on individuals** but on the Organization as a whole. This means that while the Commission benefits from these immunities, individual members or employees may still be held accountable under Canadian law for personal misconduct.

**6. Significance and Implications**

This Order is critical for the effective functioning of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission because:

- It enables the Commission to operate with **operational independence**, allowing it to make binding decisions on fishery management, conduct scientific research, and negotiate agreements with member countries without fear of legal or administrative interference.

- It supports **international cooperation** in a shared natural resource zone, where cross-border coordination is essential for sustainable fisheries.

- It aligns Canada’s domestic legal framework with international norms and standards, reinforcing Canada’s commitment to multilateral environmental governance.

**7. Conclusion**

The *Great Lakes Fishery Commission Privileges and Immunities Order* formally recognizes the GLFC as a legally distinct body with corporate status and the key immunities and privileges outlined in the United Nations Convention. These protections are essential for enabling the Commission to fulfill its mandate of managing and protecting fishery resources in the Great Lakes region. The Order reflects Canada’s respect for international law and its support for collaborative environmental governance among nations sharing a common ecosystem.

This provision ensures that the Great Lakes Fishery Commission can function efficiently and impartially, promoting sustainable fisheries and regional cooperation in one of the world’s most ecologically and economically significant freshwater systems.
