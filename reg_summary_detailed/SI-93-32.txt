**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Communications and the Treasury Board**. This authority is derived from **paragraph 19(1)(b) of the Financial Administration Act (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 6)**. This provision empowers the federal government to authorize the setting of fees or charges for services provided by a federal department, specifically when those services involve public administration and financial accountability.

**Scope of the Authorized Authority:**

The Minister of Communications is authorized to **prescribe fees or charges** that users must pay for the following two specific services provided by the **Department of Communications**:

1. **Technical Assessment, Reassessment, Testing, or Certification of Telecommunications Apparatus**  
   This includes any formal evaluation or examination of telecommunications equipment (such as phones, routers, modems, satellite devices, or other communication devices) to determine whether it meets established technical standards. The services may include:
   - Initial assessment to verify compliance with technical specifications.
   - Periodic reassessment to ensure continued compliance.
   - Laboratory testing to validate performance, safety, or interoperability.
   - Certification processes that formally recognize the equipment as compliant with national or regulatory requirements.

2. **Labelling or Marking of Telecommunications Apparatus**  
   This refers to the process of affixing official labels or marks on telecommunications equipment to indicate that it has been tested and verified as compliant with the technical requirements, specifications, standards, or procedures set by the Department of Communications. These labels serve as public assurance that the equipment meets national regulatory standards and can safely operate within the telecommunications network.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of this authorization is to:
- Ensure that the Department of Communications can sustain the costs associated with technical evaluations and compliance verification.
- Provide a transparent, consistent, and accountable mechanism for charging users for services that are essential to the integrity and safety of the telecommunications infrastructure.
- Encourage compliance with technical standards by making the process of certification and labeling financially viable and accessible.

**Key Features of the Authorization:**

- **Prescriptive Power**: The Minister of Communications has the power to issue **a regulatory order** (a formal directive) to establish specific fees or charges. This order will define:
  - The types of equipment covered.
  - The nature of the service (e.g., initial certification, annual reassessment).
  - The fee structure (e.g., per unit, per service, tiered pricing).
  - Any exemptions or special provisions (e.g., for small businesses, research, or public sector use).

- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The regulation allows the Minister to adjust fees or charges over time in response to changing costs, technological developments, or regulatory needs.

- **Public Accountability**: The fees are established under the Financial Administration Act, which ensures that the process is transparent, subject to oversight, and aligned with public financial governance principles.

**Implications for Users and Industry:**

- Telecommunications manufacturers, importers, distributors, and service providers must now be prepared to pay fees for certification and labeling of their products.
- Users (including businesses and consumers) who purchase or deploy equipment that requires certification will be subject to these fees, which may be passed on to end users or included in product costs.
- The regulation supports the Department’s role in protecting public safety, ensuring interoperability, and maintaining the reliability and security of Canada’s telecommunications networks.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation establishes a formal, legally grounded framework under which the Department of Communications can charge users for technical assessments, testing, certification, and labeling of telecommunications equipment. It ensures that the financial sustainability of regulatory compliance activities is maintained while preserving the integrity of Canada’s telecommunications standards. The Minister of Communications will issue specific fee orders in accordance with this authorization, which will be subject to Treasury Board review and public notice to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Note**: This regulation reflects a key element of regulatory financial management in Canada, where government departments are empowered to charge for essential services while remaining accountable to Parliament and the public.
