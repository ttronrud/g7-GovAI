**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Canaryseed Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Origin**
The Saskatchewan Canaryseed Order is issued under the authority of **section 2a of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 34, s. 2; R.S., c. A-6). It is promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**. This means that the government, through the Minister, proposes the regulation, which is then formally adopted by the Governor General on behalf of the Crown.

This Order is a **regulatory instrument** designed to govern the marketing of canaryseed in Saskatchewan, specifically in **interprovincial trade and export markets**.

---

### **2. Scope and Applicability**
The Order applies exclusively to:
- **Canaryseed** defined as *any seed from the canaryseed plant Phalaris canariensis* that is **produced in Saskatchewan**.
- Activities related to the **marketing, sale, and distribution** of canaryseed in **interprovincial and export trade**.

It does not apply to local (intra-provincial) marketing unless specifically extended by the Commodity Board or Supervisory Board under the powers granted.

---

### **3. Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Agri-Food Act, 2004*, S.S. 2004, c. A-15.21 (known in French as *Loi*). This is the overarching legislation that provides the legal framework for the operation of the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board.
- **Canaryseed**: Seed derived from the plant *Phalaris canariensis*, produced exclusively in Saskatchewan.
- **Commodity Board**: The *Canaryseed Development Commission of Saskatchewan*, established under the Agri-Food Act, 2004. It is responsible for managing the marketing and development of canaryseed.
- **Supervisory Board**: The *Agri-Food Council*, which continues in its role under the Act. It provides oversight and supervision of agricultural marketing activities.

---

### **4. Regulatory Powers Granted**
The Commodity Board and the Supervisory Board are granted **expanded regulatory authority** over canaryseed marketing in **interprovincial and export trade**, with powers equivalent to those they hold for **local marketing within Saskatchewan** under the Act.

This includes the following key powers:

#### **(a) Levies and Charges**
- The Boards are authorized to:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities within Saskatchewan who are involved in:
    - The **production** of canaryseed
    - The **marketing** of canaryseed
- These levies or charges may be **grouped** based on the nature of the activity or the type of producer (e.g., farmers, processors, exporters).
- Different **amounts of levies or charges** can be set for different groups of producers.

> Example: A small-scale farmer may pay a lower levy than a large commercial processor, based on production volume or market participation.

#### **(b) Use of Levies and Charges**
The funds collected from levies and charges may be used for the following purposes:
- **Creation of reserves** (e.g., to stabilize prices or ensure supply during market downturns)
- **Payment of operational expenses** related to marketing activities
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to:
  - Poor market conditions
  - Unfavorable pricing
  - Disposal of canaryseed at a loss
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among producers:
  - To ensure that producers who may have had poor sales or low returns during a period receive compensation
  - To promote equity in the market, especially when market conditions are volatile

> This mechanism helps to **mitigate risk** for producers and supports **market stability** in a commodity that may be subject to price fluctuations.

---

### **5. Purpose and Objectives**
The primary objectives of this Order are:
- To **ensure fair and stable marketing conditions** for canaryseed in both domestic and international markets.
- To **protect producers** from market volatility by providing financial safeguards.
- To **promote the long-term development** of the canaryseed industry in Saskatchewan.
- To **enhance competitiveness** in interprovincial and export markets through organized marketing and pricing mechanisms.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published in the Saskatchewan Gazette). This is standard practice for provincial regulations and ensures immediate legal effect upon formal adoption.
