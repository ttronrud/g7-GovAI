**Detailed Summary of the Meetings and Proposals (Trust and Loan Companies) Regulations**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act* (the "Act"), provide specific procedural and substantive guidelines for the handling of shareholder proposals and meetings in trust and loan companies. They were issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to several sections of the Act, including:

- Sections 140(5)a, (7)a, 141(1)b  
- Section 146c  
- Subsections 147(1)d, 154(5)e, and 531(1)f  

The regulations come into force on the day of registration and are designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in shareholder engagement and voting processes. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key provisions:

---

### **1. Record Date Periods (Section 140 of the Act)**

- **General Rule (excluding paragraphs 140(5)(c) and (d))**:  
  The period between the record date and the date on which a particular action (e.g., a meeting or vote) is to be taken must **not exceed 60 days**. This ensures that shareholders have sufficient time to be included in voting records while maintaining operational feasibility.

- **For Paragraphs 140(5)(c) and (d)**:  
  The record date must fall **between 21 and 60 days before** the meeting date. This provides a minimum of 21 days to ensure shareholders have adequate time to participate, while still limiting the window to prevent undue delays.

- **Notice of Record Date (Section 140(7))**:  
  The company must provide **at least seven days’ notice** before the record date is fixed. This ensures shareholders are informed in a timely manner and can verify their eligibility to vote.

---

### **2. Meeting Notice Period (Section 141(1) of the Act)**

- The company must send **notice of a meeting at least 21 days and no more than 60 days before** the meeting date.  
  This establishes a reasonable timeframe for shareholders to prepare and attend meetings, balancing the need for timeliness with the need for participation.

---

### **3. Eligibility for Shareholder Proposals (Section 146(1.1))**

A shareholder may submit a proposal if they meet **one of the following two criteria**:

- The number of **voting shares** they own is equal to **1% of the total outstanding voting shares** of the company as of the date the proposal is submitted; **OR**
- The **fair market value** of their shares (as determined at the close of business on the day before the proposal is submitted) is **at least $2,000**.

> This ensures that only significant shareholders—those with meaningful financial interest—can make proposals, preventing minor investors from flooding meetings with low-impact requests.

---

### **4. Timeframe for Holding Shares (Section 146(1.1))**

- The person proposing must have been the **registered holder or beneficial owner** of the shares during the **six-month period immediately before** the date the proposal is submitted.  
  This requirement ensures that the proposer has a legitimate, ongoing interest in the company and not a speculative or temporary holding.

---

### **5. Proof of Eligibility (Section 146(1.4))**

- If the company requests proof that the proposer meets the eligibility requirements under Section 146(1.1), the request must be made **within 14 days** of receiving the proposal.
- The proposer must then provide the required proof **within 21 days** of receiving the company’s request.  
  This establishes a clear and enforceable timeline to verify eligibility and prevent frivolous or fraudulent proposals.

---

### **6. Proposal Content Limit (Section 146(3))**

- The **proposal and its supporting statement together must not exceed 500 words**.  
  This limits the length and complexity of proposals, ensuring clarity and focus, and preventing excessive or vague submissions that could overwhelm board members or shareholders.

---

### **7. Timeframe for Proposal Consideration (Section 146(5))**

- **Paragraph 146(5)(a)**: A proposal must be considered within **90 days** of being submitted.  
  This provides a reasonable window for review and response by the company.

- **Paragraph 146(5)(c)**: A proposal may be submitted **only once every two years**.  
  This prevents frequent or repetitive submissions and encourages long-term strategic engagement.

- **Paragraph 146(5)(d)**: The **minimum level of shareholder support** required for a proposal to be considered is:

  - **3% of shares voted** if introduced at an annual meeting (first submission);
  - **6% of shares voted** at its last submission if introduced at a second annual meeting;
  - **10% of shares voted** at its last submission if introduced at **three or more** annual meetings.

  > This creates a tiered support threshold that increases with the number of prior submissions, reflecting a growing level of shareholder interest and legitimacy over time. It discourages frivolous or repeated proposals.

- **Paragraph 146(5)(d) – Duration of Support Requirement**:  
  The support for a proposal must be maintained for a period of **five years** from the date of the last submission. This ensures that proposals remain relevant and supported by ongoing shareholder interest.

---

### **8. Management Proxy Circulars (Section 146(5.1))**

- A company is **not required to include a proposal in its management proxy circular or attach it to the circular** if the proposal was submitted **within the two-year period** prior to the meeting.  
  This provides flexibility for companies to manage proxy materials efficiently, avoiding the inclusion of outdated or low-priority proposals.

---

### **9. Notification of Proposal (Section 147(1))**

- The company must **notify the proposer within 21 days** of receiving the proposal or, if proof is requested, upon receipt of the proof under Section 146(1.4).  
  This ensures transparency and timely communication between the company and the shareholder.

---

### **10. Voting by Electronic or Telephonic Means (Section 154(5))**

- At a meeting, **voting may be conducted via telephonic, electronic, or other communication facilities**, provided that:
  1. The system enables **verification of votes** after collection; and  
  2. The **tallied votes** are presented to the company in a way that **does not allow identification** of individual shareholders or groups.

> This provision supports modernization and accessibility, allowing remote participation while preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the voting process.

---

### **Overall Purpose and Impact**

These regulations aim to:

- **Strengthen shareholder rights** by establishing clear, fair, and transparent procedures for submitting and evaluating proposals.
- **Prevent abuse** by setting eligibility thresholds, content limits, and support requirements.
- **Ensure efficiency** by defining timeframes for notice, response, and voting.
- **Promote accountability** through verification of ownership, proof of interest, and record-keeping.
- **Modernize governance** by allowing electronic voting while protecting shareholder privacy.
