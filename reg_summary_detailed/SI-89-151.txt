**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**1. Purpose and Context:**

This regulation is issued under the *Canada Wildlife Act* and serves to formally assign administrative, managerial, and controlling authority over specific public lands in the province of New Brunswick. The primary objective is to ensure that these lands are effectively used for **wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation**—key components of environmental protection and public education.

The decision is based on a determination by the **Governor in Council** (the federal government's executive body) that the designated lands are essential for the protection and study of wildlife and ecosystems. This determination reflects a recognition of the ecological value of the area and the need for dedicated management to support long-term conservation goals.

**2. Legal Authority:**

The regulation is enacted under **subsection 4(1) of the Canada Wildlife Act**. This provision empowers the Governor in Council, upon recommendation from the **Minister of the Environment**, to designate public lands for specific wildlife-related purposes and to assign administrative control of those lands to the Minister.

This legislative authority allows the federal government to intervene in land management when public interest in wildlife conservation is at stake, particularly when provincial or local authorities may lack sufficient capacity or mandate to manage such lands effectively.

  - Conduct wildlife research
  - Promote public education and interpretation programs
  - Enforce relevant environmental and wildlife regulations
  - Make decisions regarding land use, access, and development that do not compromise conservation objectives

- **Geographic Scope:**  
  The lands in question are located in:
  - The **Province of New Brunswick**
  - The **County of Sunbury**

The lands are specifically designated for the following purposes:
- **Wildlife Research:** Facilitating scientific studies on species populations, behaviors, migration patterns, and ecosystem dynamics.
- **Conservation:** Protecting natural habitats, endangered species, and ecological processes from degradation or development.
- **Interpretation:** Providing opportunities for public education through visitor centers, guided tours, signage, and outreach programs to increase environmental awareness.

These uses are aligned with broader federal and provincial environmental policies aimed at preserving biodiversity and promoting sustainable land use.
