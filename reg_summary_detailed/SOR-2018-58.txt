**Detailed Summary of the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Issuance Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Issuance Regulations* are a set of regulatory provisions issued under the *Bank Act* (Canada) to ensure that certain financial instruments—specifically **prescribed shares and liabilities**—issued by **domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs)** meet specific legal and structural requirements related to **deposit insurance, conversion into common shares, and jurisdictional attornment**.

These regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to specific statutory authority under:

- **Section 485(2)a**  
- **Section 485.01b**  
- **Subsection 978(1)c** of the *Bank Act*

They were first introduced in **S.C. 2016, c. 7, s. 160(1)** and **s. 161**, and are supported by earlier legislative provisions (S.C. 2010, c. 12, s. 2092; S.C. 1991, c. 46).

These regulations came into force on **September 23, 2018**, after being registered with the government, and are effective **180 days after registration** (i.e., on **March 23, 2019**).

### **Key Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. To **protect depositors and the financial system** by ensuring that certain liabilities issued by large banks are subject to the protections of the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act*.
2. To **enhance the resilience of systemically important banks** by enabling a "bail-in" mechanism—where liabilities (such as subordinated debt or preferred shares) can be converted into equity during a financial crisis.
3. To **prevent misleading promotion** of certain instruments as deposits, which could mislead investors and undermine deposit insurance schemes.
4. To **ensure legal enforceability and jurisdictional clarity** for holders of these instruments.

### **Core Provisions**

#### **1. Definition of "Prescribed Shares and Liabilities"**

Under **subsection 485(1.21)** and **section 485.01** of the *Bank Act*, the term *"prescribed shares and liabilities"* refers to those shares and liabilities that are explicitly designated as such under the *Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Conversion Regulations*. These are instruments that are subject to specific bail-in provisions and are treated as having special regulatory status.

> This means that only certain instruments (e.g., specific types of preferred shares or subordinated debt) qualify as "prescribed" and are subject to the detailed requirements below.

---

#### **2. Requirements for Prescribed Liabilities**

A domestic systemically important bank must ensure that **each prescribed liability** includes terms that:

##### **(a) Subject the Holder to CDIC Act Provisions**
- The holder of the liability is bound by the **Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act**, including:
  - The **conversion of the liability into common shares** under **subsection 39.2(2.3)** of the CDIC Act.
  - The **variation or extinguishment** of the liability as a result of such conversion or enforcement.
- The holder is also subject to the **application of Canadian or provincial laws** governing the operation of the CDIC Act in relation to that liability.

> This ensures that in the event of a bank failure or crisis, the CDIC has the legal authority to convert these liabilities into equity, thereby stabilizing the bank without requiring taxpayer bailouts.

##### **(b) Attorns to the Jurisdiction of Canadian Courts**
- The holder of the liability **attorns to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada** in matters related to:
  - The CDIC Act
  - The laws applying to the operation of the CDIC Act in respect of the liability

> This strengthens legal enforceability and ensures that disputes involving these instruments are resolved within Canada’s judicial system.

##### **(c) Binding Nature of the Terms**
- The terms specified in (a) and (b) are **binding on the holder of the liability**, **even if**:
  - The liability contains other terms (e.g., interest rates, maturity dates, redemption clauses)
  - Other laws govern the liability
  - There are agreements or understandings between the bank and the holder

> This is a critical safeguard to prevent banks or investors from circumventing the CDIC’s bail-in powers through contractual arrangements.

---

#### **3. Requirements for Prescribed Shares**

A domestic systemically important bank must ensure that **prescribed shares** issued by the bank:

- Are **subject to conversion into common shares** under **subsection 39.2(2.3)** of the CDIC Act.

> This means that in a crisis, these shares can be converted into common shares, thereby reducing the bank’s debt burden and increasing equity capital.

---

#### **4. Disclosure Requirements**

A domestic systemically important bank must **disclose in any offering document** (such as a prospectus, information circular, or other related document) that:

- The prescribed share or liability is **subject to conversion into common shares** under subsection 39.2(2.3) of the CDIC Act.

> This ensures transparency for investors, allowing them to understand the risks and potential conversion outcomes.

---

#### **5. Prohibition on Misleading Promotion**

A domestic systemically important bank **must not advertise or promote** a prescribed liability—**including in its name**—to a purchaser in Canada as:

- A **deposit**
- Or any variation of that term (e.g., "savings," "time deposit," "bank account")

> This provision is designed to **prevent confusion** between bank debt instruments and insured deposits. It protects the integrity of the CDIC deposit insurance scheme by ensuring that only genuine deposits are covered under the CDIC.

> For example, a bank cannot market a subordinated bond as a "deposit" or "safe investment like a savings account," even if it offers similar returns.

---

### **Effective Date and Enforcement**

- The regulations **come into force on the 180th day after registration**.
- Registration occurred on **September 23, 2018**, so the regulations became effective on **March 23, 2019**.
- They are **currently in force** and apply to all domestic systemically important banks operating in Canada.

---

### **Regulatory Context and Purpose**

These regulations are part of a broader framework established under the *Bank Act* to strengthen the **resilience of Canada’s financial system**, particularly in the face of systemic risks.

Key background:

- The concept of **"bail-in"** allows financial institutions to absorb losses through conversion of liabilities into equity, rather than relying on public bailouts.
- The CDIC Act provides a legal basis for converting certain liabilities into common shares during a bank failure.
- By mandating that prescribed instruments be subject to these conversion provisions, the government ensures that:
  - Systemically important banks have **stronger capital buffers**.
  - Depositors and investors are **protected from misleading claims**.
  - The **legal framework for crisis resolution** is clear and enforceable.

### **Conclusion**

The *Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Issuance Regulations* serve as a critical tool in Canada’s financial safety net. They ensure that certain instruments issued by the largest banks are **legally structured to support bail-in mechanisms**, protect depositors, and maintain transparency. By binding holders to CDIC rules, preventing misleading marketing, and requiring clear disclosure, the regulations promote **financial stability, investor confidence, and equitable risk-sharing** during times of crisis.

These rules reflect Canada’s commitment to a **resilient, transparent, and market-driven financial system** where systemic risks are managed through private-sector mechanisms rather than public bailouts.
