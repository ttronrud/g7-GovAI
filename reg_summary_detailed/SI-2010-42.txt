The regulation you provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Below is a detailed summary of its content, context, and implications:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order Acknowledging Receipt of COSEWIC Assessments  
**Statutory Basis:**  
Species at Risk Act (SARA), specifically subsection 23(1)  
**Governing Authority:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  
**Date of Publication:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Code of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)  
**Effective Date:**  
Upon the making of the Order (i.e., when it is formally issued and comes into force)

---

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Recognition of COSEWIC Assessments:**  
   The Order formally acknowledges that the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has completed and submitted scientific assessments for specific species listed in the annexed schedule. These assessments evaluate the current status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern) of wildlife species based on scientific data and expert review.

2. **Legal Basis – Subsection 23(1) of SARA:**  
   Under SARA, the Minister of the Environment is required to consider COSEWIC assessments when determining whether a species is at risk and when making decisions about its protection. Subsection 23(1) mandates that the Minister must acknowledge receipt of COSEWIC assessments when they are submitted. This Order serves as the official government recognition of those assessments, triggering the next steps in the legal and regulatory process.

3. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   - To officially recognize the scientific evaluations conducted by COSEWIC.  
   - To initiate the process of designating species as "at risk" under SARA.  
   - To provide a formal record that the government has received and reviewed the assessments, which is a prerequisite for any further regulatory action, such as listing a species under the Act.

4. **Species Involved:**  
   The Order refers to a list of species (set out in the annexed schedule) that have been assessed by COSEWIC. While the specific species are not detailed in your excerpt, such schedules typically include animals and plants that are considered threatened or endangered due to factors like habitat loss, climate change, or overexploitation.

5. **Administrative and Procedural Significance:**  
   This Order is not a listing decision itself, but a procedural step. It signals that the government has accepted the scientific findings and is now prepared to proceed with formal listing decisions under SARA. It may lead to the species being added to the *List of Extinct, Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern Species* in the Act.

6. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent scientific body that assesses the status of wildlife species at risk in Canada. Its assessments are critical because they provide the scientific foundation upon which government decisions are based.

7. **Next Steps:**  
   Following the receipt of these assessments, the Minister may:  
   - List the species as endangered, threatened, or special concern.  
   - Develop recovery strategies and action plans.  
   - Implement conservation measures under SARA.  
   - Consult with Indigenous communities and stakeholders.

**Context and Importance:**

- This regulation is part of Canada’s broader commitment to biodiversity conservation and the protection of species at risk.  
- It reflects the integration of science and policy in environmental governance.  
- The 2002 Order is a key milestone in the implementation of SARA, which was enacted in 2002 to provide a legal framework for protecting species at risk in Canada.

**Conclusion:**

This Order is a procedural and administrative instrument that formally recognizes the scientific assessments of species at risk conducted by COSEWIC. By acknowledging receipt of these assessments under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*, the Government of Canada initiates the official process of evaluating and potentially listing species as at risk, thereby enabling the development of targeted conservation measures. It underscores the importance of scientific evaluation in environmental policy and the government’s commitment to protecting Canada’s biodiversity.

**Note:**  
To fully understand the scope of the species involved, one would need to refer to the *annexed schedule* of the Order (which is not included in your excerpt). The schedule would list the specific species, their current status (e.g., endangered, threatened), and the basis for the COSEWIC assessment.
