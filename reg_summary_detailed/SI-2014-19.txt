**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. It is grounded in subsection 10(2)a of the *Statutory Instruments Act* (S.C. 2000, c. 5, s. 58; R.S., c. S-22). This provision empowers the government to make orders that amend or modify the publication practices of statutory instruments, including the *Canada Gazette*, when recommended by the Minister of Justice.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to establish and confirm the continued electronic publication of the *Canada Gazette* in Portable Document Format (PDF). This ensures that the official government publication remains accessible, consistent, and interoperable across digital platforms.

**3. Key Provisions**  
- The *Canada Gazette* will continue to be published electronically in **Portable Document Format (PDF)**.  
  - This format preserves the layout, fonts, and formatting of the document, ensuring that the content appears consistently across different devices and software platforms.  
  - The use of PDF supports accessibility, archiving, and ease of distribution, particularly for legal and administrative purposes.  
- The Order does **not** introduce new content or substantive changes to the Gazette’s content or structure. Instead, it reaffirms and formalizes the existing method of electronic dissemination.

**4. Repeal Clause**  
The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that this Order is not intended to create a new or permanent legal framework.

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on **April 1, 2014**.  
- This date marks the official start of the new publication standard.  
- All future issues of the *Canada Gazette* issued after this date will be published electronically in PDF format.  
- Prior issues may continue to be available in previous formats (e.g., print or older digital formats), but new publications will conform to the PDF standard.

**6. Legal and Administrative Significance**  
- This Order reflects a broader government initiative to modernize public administration and improve transparency and accessibility.  
- By adopting PDF, the Government of Canada ensures that the *Canada Gazette*—a key source of legal and regulatory notices—is accessible to all stakeholders, including the public, legal professionals, businesses, and government departments.  
- The move supports digital governance, reduces printing and distribution costs, and enhances the efficiency of information dissemination.

**7. Context and Background**  
- The *Canada Gazette* has long served as the official publication for federal laws, regulations, and government notices.  
- Prior to this Order, the Gazette was published in both print and digital formats.
