### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Regulations for the Redemption of One Cent Coins"**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is grounded in **subsection 9.01(1)a of the Currency Act** (as amended and currently found in *R.S., c. C-52*, and referenced in *S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 389*).
- This provision grants the Minister of Finance the authority to establish rules regarding the redemption of certain coins, specifically one-cent coins, in Canada.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
- The primary objective of these Regulations is to **establish a formal framework for the redemption of one-cent coins** that are either:
  - Currently in circulation in Canada, or
  - Have at any time been in circulation (i.e., were previously used or accepted as legal tender).

#### **3. Scope of the Redemption Authority**
- The **Minister of Finance is authorized** to:
  - Accept and redeem one-cent coins from the public.
  - This includes coins that were issued in the past and are no longer in active use, as long as they were once current (i.e., legally valid and accepted as tender).
- The regulation does not restrict redemption to coins issued within a specific time period; it covers **all one-cent coins that have ever been current** in Canada.

#### **4. Effective Date**
- The Regulations **come into force on the day of their registration** in the Canada Gazette.
- This means that the rules are immediately applicable upon official publication, without a specified delay.

#### **5. Key Implications and Context**
- **Historical Background**: One-cent coins were historically used in Canada, but due to their minimal value and low circulation, the Government has gradually phased them out in practice.
- **Economic and Practical Rationale**: 
  - The regulation allows the Government to manage the circulation of low-value coins efficiently.
  - It provides a mechanism for individuals or institutions to exchange worn, damaged, or obsolete one-cent coins for cash, thereby reducing the burden on the mint and currency system.
- **Public Access**: The regulation ensures that the public has a clear and official pathway to redeem coins they no longer need, promoting transparency and trust in monetary policy.

#### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**
- The regulation **does not apply to other denominations** of coins.
- It does not specify the conditions under which redemption will be processed (e.g., number of coins, fees, or processing times), which may be addressed in accompanying administrative guidelines or procedures.

#### **7. Regulatory Oversight**
- The **Minister of Finance** is responsible for administering and implementing the redemption process.
- While the Governor General in Council formally enacts the regulation, the operational and policy decisions are delegated to the Minister.

These Regulations provide a legal and administrative basis for the **redemption of one-cent coins in Canada**, ensuring that coins that have ever been current can be returned to the Government in exchange for cash.
