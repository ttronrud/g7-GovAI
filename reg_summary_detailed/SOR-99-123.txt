## 📜 **Detailed Summary of the Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport Zoning Regulations**

### 🔹 **Regulatory Background & Legal Authority**

- **Legal Basis**: These regulations were enacted under **Section 5.5a** of the *Aeronautics Act*, which authorizes the publication of proposed zoning regulations for airports.
- The proposed regulations were **published twice** in:
  - *Canada Gazette, Part I* (September 13 and 20, 1997)
  - *The Toronto Star* (September 30 and October 1, 1997)
  - *l’Express* (September 30 and October 7, 1997)
- This publication provided **a reasonable opportunity for public comment** and stakeholder input.
- Based on that input, the **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, formally enacted the regulations under **Section 5.4b of the Aeronautics Act**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To ensure the safe operation of Toronto Pearson International Airport by controlling the physical environment around the airport, particularly in relation to aircraft approach paths, communication signals, and bird hazards.

## 🔍 **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, located in the City of Etobicoke (Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto) and the City of Mississauga (Regional Municipality of Peel), Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial measurements. Its coordinates are: <br> **E 609,444.45, N 4,837,864.69** (UTM) |
| **Strip** | A rectangular area of the runway designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction (e.g., Runway 06R-24L). Includes runways and associated approach paths. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of a strip, with a **1:50 slope** (1 meter vertical rise per 50 meters horizontal). These surfaces extend up to **15,000 meters** from the end of the strip, with outer edges 2,400 meters from the centerline. The top of each surface is **300 meters above the elevation at the strip end**. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from the **lateral edges of the strip** and the **approach surfaces**, also with a **1:50 slope**, rising to a horizontal line 15,000 meters from the strip end. Designed to prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during approach and landing. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located **45 meters above the ARP elevation**, except where it would be less than **9 meters above ground level**—in such cases, the surface is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Outer Limit** | The boundary encompassing all of the above surfaces (approach, transitional, outer), and the **bird hazard zone**. Defined in Part VI of the schedule. |
| **Bird Hazard Zone** | A designated area where waste disposal must be restricted to prevent attracting birds, which could pose a danger to aircraft. |

> ⚠️ **Elevation of ARP**: 174.46 meters above sea level.

## 🚧 **Applicability**

- These regulations apply to **all land**, including **public road allowances**, that is:
  - Adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport
  - Described in **Part VI of the schedule**

> This includes both private and public lands, and covers areas extending beyond the immediate airport perimeter.

---

## 🚫 **Prohibited Actions (Restrictions)**

### 1. **Building Height Restrictions**
No person may:
- Construct or erect a building, structure, or object
- Add an addition to an existing structure  
**whose highest point exceeds**:
- The **approach surfaces**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surfaces**

> This ensures that no obstruction (e.g., towers, trees, buildings) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

### 2. **Interference with Aeronautics Communications**
No owner or lessee may:
- Use or develop land in a way that **interferes with signals or communications** to or from:
  - Aircraft
  - Aeronautical service facilities (e.g., radar, radio towers, navigation systems)

> This includes blocking radio frequencies or signal paths used by air traffic control.

---

### 3. **Natural Growth Restrictions**
No owner or lessee may allow **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) to grow to a height that:
- Exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces:
  - Approach surfaces
  - Outer surface
  - Transitional surfaces

> This prevents tall trees or overhanging branches from creating hazards during flight operations.

---

### 4. **Bird Hazard Zone Restrictions**
Within the **bird hazard zone** (defined in Part VII of the schedule):
- **No waste disposal** may occur that is **attractive to birds**  
(e.g., food scraps, open garbage, water sources)

> This helps reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can cause catastrophic damage to aircraft.

## 🗺️ **Geographic Descriptions (Key Reference Points)**

### 1. **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at:
  - Start: Threshold of **Runway 23R** (easterly end of Runway 05L–23R)
  - UTM Coordinates: **E 609,992.92, N 4,838,594.40**
  - Move **904.21 meters west** along the runway centerline
  - Then **137.15 meters south**, perpendicular to the runway
  - Final point: **E 609,444.45, N 4,837,864.69**

> This point serves as the **origin for all elevation and distance measurements**.

---

### 2. **Approach Surfaces**
- There are **10 approach surfaces**, one for each end of the following runways:
  - 06R, 24L, 06L, 24R, 15L, 33R, 15R, 33L, 05L, 23R, 05R
- Each surface:
  - Has a **1:50 slope** (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)
  - Extends **15,000 meters** from the end of the strip
  - Outer edges are **2,400 meters** from the strip’s centerline
  - Top edge is **300 meters above the elevation at the strip end**

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach phases by ensuring no obstructions exist in the critical approach path.

---

### 3. **Outer Surface**
- A flat plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation**
- However, if this would place the surface **below 9 meters above ground**, it is instead set at **9 meters above ground**
- Applies across a large area, especially in the southern and western fringes of the airport

> This surface defines the maximum height for any structure or vegetation in the outer perimeter.

---

### 4. **Transitional Surfaces**
- Extend from the **sides of the strips** and the **approach surfaces**
- Also have a **1:50 slope**
- Reach out to **15,000 meters** from the strip end
- Designed to prevent obstructions from interfering with aircraft during approach and landing

> These surfaces provide a buffer zone between the runway and surrounding land.

---

### 5. **Outer Limit**
- The **total boundary** of the regulated area
- Encompasses:
  - All approach surfaces
  - All transitional surfaces
  - The outer surface
  - The bird hazard zone
- Defined in **Part VI of the schedule** (not fully provided in the excerpt)

> This is the **maximum area** under the zoning restrictions.

---

### 6. **Bird Hazard Zone**
- A specific area (defined in Part VII of the schedule) where:
  - Waste disposal is **prohibited** if it attracts birds
- Purpose: Reduce risk of bird strikes, which can damage aircraft and endanger lives

> This zone is typically located in areas with open land, water bodies, or food sources near the airport.
