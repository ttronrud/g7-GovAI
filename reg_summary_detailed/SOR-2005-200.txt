### **Overview**

The *Veterans Burial Regulations, 2005* are a set of rules established under the **Department of Veterans Affairs Act**, specifically pursuant to **section 5a**, and issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Veterans Affairs**.

## **Determination of Insufficiency of Funds**

A determination of whether funds are insufficient is made by the **Corporation (Last Post Fund)** using a formula based on the **net assets of the survivor and succession**.

### **Deductible Amounts from Net Assets**

If the deceased has a **survivor or dependent child**, the following are deducted from the sum of net assets:

- **$35,279** for the survivor (or dependent child if no survivor)
- **$700 per additional dependent child**
- Any amount already paid for burial or funeral costs (not previously considered in net asset calculation)
- The **value of a gravemarker** (if not provided under section 5):
  - Lesser of actual cost or value of marker that would have been provided
  - Minus any prior payments
- A **reasonable amount for perpetual care** of the gravemarker (if not already accounted for)
- The deceased’s **monthly income before death**
- Market value of:
  - A motor vehicle used by the family
  - The family’s residence
  - Household effects

> ❌ If there is **no survivor or dependent child**, the above deductions do **not apply**. Instead, the **net assets of the succession as a whole** are considered.

### **Insufficiency Determination**

- If the calculated amount after deductions is **nil or negative**, then there is an **insufficiency of funds**—and financial assistance is payable.

> 💡 The $35,279 deduction is adjusted **annually on January 1** based on the **percentage increase in Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)** for the year ending September 30 of the prior year.

> 📊 The CPI used is the **average all-items CPI for Canada (not seasonally adjusted)**, published by Statistics Canada.
