**Detailed Summary of the *Nova Scotia Offshore Revenue Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Regulations* (S.C. 1988, c. 28)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Nova Scotia Offshore Revenue Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Regulations* are a set of administrative rules established under **Section 232 of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act (the "Act")**. These regulations prescribe the **timing, method, and conditions** for the payment of **fiscal equalization offset payments** from the federal government to the Province of Nova Scotia in respect of offshore petroleum revenues.

These payments are designed to ensure that Nova Scotia receives a fair share of the financial benefits derived from offshore oil and gas resources, while accounting for the fact that the federal government collects a portion of the revenue and then offsets this against Nova Scotia’s equalization payments.

The regulations came into force on **April 30, 1996**, and apply specifically to fiscal years referenced in **Sections 223 and 224 of the Act**.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act*.
- **Working Day**: A day that is not a Saturday or a statutory holiday.

---

### **Scope of Application**

These regulations govern **fiscal equalization offset payments** made under **Part V of the Act** for each fiscal year. These payments are made in response to offshore revenue generated by Nova Scotia’s offshore petroleum resources.

---

### **Timeline and Estimation Process**

#### 1. **Initial Estimate (Within 30 Days of Interim Estimate)**

- The **Minister of Finance** must prepare and issue an **estimate** of the amount (if any) of the fiscal equalization offset payment payable to Nova Scotia for a fiscal year.
- This estimate must be submitted **not later than 30 days after the interim estimate** of the total fiscal equalization payment (under Parts I and VIII of the *Fiscal Arrangements Act* and related regulations).

> This ensures early forecasting and allows for timely payment decisions.

---

### **Payment Schedule and Adjustments**

#### A. **Initial Payments (One-Third of Estimated Amount)**

If the initial estimate shows a **positive offset payment** is due, the **Federal Minister of Finance** shall pay **one-third of the estimated amount** on the **first working day following the 15th day of May, November, and March** of that fiscal year.

> These three dates are strategically chosen to spread out payments throughout the year and provide a structured, predictable schedule.

#### B. **Adjustments Based on Revised Estimates**

- If a **new estimate** is issued during the fiscal year indicating that the original payment amount should be **adjusted**, the Federal Minister must:
  - Make **adjustments to the payments already made** under the prior estimate.
  - Begin adjustments **from the first payment date after the new estimate is issued**.

#### C. **Overpayment Recovery**

- If an **overpayment** is made to Nova Scotia:
  - The overpayment must be **recovered before the end of the fiscal year**.
  - Recovery may occur from:
    1. Any future amount payable to Nova Scotia under the Act, or  
    2. The Province as a **debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

> This ensures that no undue financial burden is placed on Nova Scotia due to estimation errors.

#### D. **Post-Fiscal-Year Recovery (If Adjustment Not Finalized)**

- If, during the period **after the fiscal year ends but before final determination**, it is found that payments need adjustment:
  - Any **remaining payable amount** must be paid to the Province.
  - Any **overpayment** must be recovered:
    - In the **month when the estimate was made**, or
    - In the **following month**.
  - Recovery again comes from either:
    1. Future payments under the Act, or  
    2. The Province as a debt to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

---

### **Final Computation and Final Payments**

#### 1. **Final Computation of Offset Payment**

- At the time of the **final computation** of the fiscal equalization payment (under Parts I and VIII of the *Fiscal Arrangements Act*), the Minister of Finance shall also compute the **final amount of the fiscal equalization offset payment** due to Nova Scotia.

> The final offset payment is based directly on the information contained in the final equalization payment computation.

#### 2. **Outstanding Payments**

- If a **positive balance remains** after the final computation:
  - The Federal Minister shall pay the outstanding amount:
    - In the **month when the final computation is made**, or  
    - Within **45 days after the last day of that month**.

#### 3. **Overpayment Recovery (Final Determination)**

- If the final computation reveals an **overpayment**:
  - The overpayment must be recovered:
    - From any future payment to Nova Scotia under the Act, or  
    - From the Province as a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

> This provides a clear, final resolution of any discrepancies.

---

### **Adjustments for Changes in Equalization Payments**

> **For greater certainty**, the regulations state that **any fiscal equalization offset payment is subject to subsequent adjustments** if the Minister of Finance determines that changes to equalization payments (under the *Fiscal Arrangements Act*) during the fiscal year require correction.

> This provision ensures flexibility and responsiveness to broader fiscal policy changes affecting equalization.

- These regulations **do not create new rights or obligations** beyond those established in the parent Act.
- Payments are made **in the name of Her Majesty in right of Nova Scotia**, emphasizing the constitutional framework of provincial fiscal relations.
- The federal government acts as a **financial counterparty** to Nova Scotia in the offshore revenue stream, ensuring equitable distribution based on shared resource development.

### **Conclusion**

The *Nova Scotia Offshore Revenue Fiscal Equalization Offset Payments Regulations* establish a **transparent, structured, and accountable system** for managing the fiscal equalization offset payments between the federal government and Nova Scotia. By setting clear timelines, defining payment triggers, and including mechanisms for adjustments and recovery, the regulations balance:

- **Timely revenue sharing** to Nova Scotia,
- **Accuracy in financial forecasting**, and
- **Fiscal responsibility and accountability** on both sides.

This regulatory framework supports the **Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord**, ensuring that Nova Scotia benefits fairly from offshore oil and gas development while maintaining fiscal integrity and stability in intergovernmental financial relations.
