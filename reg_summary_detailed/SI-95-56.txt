#### **4. Legal Description of the Land Parcel**

The parcel is defined by a detailed legal description that begins and ends at a common point, forming a closed boundary. The description follows a precise sequence of directions and coordinates:

1. **Commence at**:  
   Intersection of the **southerly bank of the Wolf River** with **longitude 132°30′30″**, at **approximate latitude 60°17′00″**.

2. **Thence south** along longitude 132°30′30″ to latitude 60°15′11″.

3. **Thence east** along latitude 60°15′11″ to longitude 132°29′02″.

4. **Thence south** along longitude 132°29′02″ to the **northerly bank of an unnamed stream** at approximate latitude 60°11′00″.

5. **Thence generally westerly** along the sinuosities (curved path) of the **northerly bank of the unnamed stream** to the **easterly bank of Eagle Bay** at approx. 60°10′50″ and 132°30′30″.

6. **Thence northwesterly in a straight line** across **Eagle Bay and Nisutlin Bay** to a point at latitude 60°12′30″ and longitude 132°36′50″.

#### **5. Exemptions from the Parcel**

A specific exclusion is made from the above-described parcel:

- **Parcels designated S-37B, S-203B, S-204B, S-205B, and S-207B**, as described on **pages 376, 395, and 396** of the *Teslin Tlingit Council Final Agreement* (dated May 29, 1993), and as shown on **Appendix B Maps, Sheets 18 and 22** of that Agreement.

- These parcels are recorded in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa under number 75204**.

- **Total area of excluded parcels**: Approximately **10 hectares**.

- **Remaining area**: Approximately **5,470 hectares** (or **54.7 square kilometers**).

> ⚠️ **Note**: The exclusion indicates that these 10 hectares are not included in the wildlife area and are likely subject to different land-use or Indigenous rights considerations, possibly under the terms of the Final Agreement.

---

#### **6. Significance and Context**

- **Indigenous Agreement Context**:  
  The land is part of the **Teslin Tlingit Council Final Agreement (1993)**, which recognizes Indigenous rights and land-use agreements. The inclusion of the Nisutlin River Delta NWA in this agreement reflects a collaborative framework between the Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon, and the Teslin Tlingit Council.

- **Ecological Importance**:  
  The Nisutlin River Delta is a vital wetland and estuarine ecosystem supporting diverse bird species, fish populations, and migratory wildlife. It plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services.

- **Conservation and Public Access**:  
  By transferring administration to the Minister of the Environment, the federal government ensures that the area will be protected from development and managed for:
  - Scientific research
  - Habitat conservation
  - Public education and interpretation (e.g., interpretive signage, guided tours)

---

#### **7. Administrative and Legal Implications**

- **Transfer of Responsibility**:  
  The **Minister of the Environment** now has the authority to:
  - Develop and implement management plans
  - Regulate access and use of the land
  - Coordinate with Indigenous communities and other stakeholders
  - Enforce conservation measures

- **Ongoing Legal Framework**:  
  The designation remains subject to the provisions of the *Canada Wildlife Act*, and may be reviewed or amended if new scientific or environmental data emerges.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**:  
  Given the Indigenous land rights embedded in the Final Agreement, the Minister of the Environment is expected to engage with the **Teslin Tlingit Council** in all management decisions to ensure respect for traditional knowledge and rights.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally assigns the **administration of the Nisutlin River Delta National Wildlife Area** to the **Minister of the Environment** to support wildlife conservation, research, and public interpretation. The area, covering approximately **5,470 hectares**, is located in the Yukon Territory and is defined by precise geographic coordinates and topographic references. A small exclusion of about 10 hectares is noted, reflecting Indigenous land rights and agreements. This transfer underscores the federal government’s commitment to protecting ecologically significant areas while respecting Indigenous agreements and promoting sustainable wildlife management.
