### **Detailed Summary of the Grande Prairie Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- The regulations are officially titled: **"Grande Prairie Airport Zoning Regulations"**.
- They may be cited as such and are designed to govern land use and development in the vicinity of Grande Prairie Airport, Alberta.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Grande Prairie Airport**, located in the vicinity of Grande Prairie, Alberta. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographical point used as a benchmark for elevation and spatial measurement. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 2,188 feet above sea level** for regulatory purposes. |
| **Approach Surface** | An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (i.e., the landing area). It is designed to ensure safe aircraft approach and landing by providing a clear zone free of obstructions. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**; has a **1:50 vertical-to-horizontal slope** (1 foot rise per 50 feet run), rising to a horizontal line **200 feet above the strip end** and **10,000 feet horizontally from the end**, with the outer ends **2,000 feet from the runway centerline**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An **imaginary horizontal plane** located above the airport. It is **150 feet above the ARP elevation** (2,188 ft), or **30 feet above ground level** if the ground is lower than 150 feet above ARP. This surface defines the upper boundary of permissible development in the broader airport area. Shown on **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1191 (1975)**. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including runways and their sides. Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its associated approach surfaces, rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal), until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. Ensures safe clearance for aircraft during approach and departure phases. |

---

#### **3. Scope of Application**
- These regulations apply to **all lands and submerged areas** (including public road allowances) **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which includes a detailed **legal description** of boundaries via survey lines and roadways.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are formally incorporated into the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated operational zones) are **exempt** from these zoning restrictions.

---

#### **4. Development Restrictions**
- **No person may construct or erect** any building, structure, or object (including additions to existing structures) on regulated land **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces:
  - Approach surfaces
  - Outer surfaces
  - Transitional surfaces
- The restriction applies **at the location of the highest point** of the structure, meaning even a small rise above the defined surface is prohibited.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To prevent visual and physical obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach phases — ensuring **flight safety** and **air traffic visibility**.

---

#### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**
- If **natural features** (e.g., trees, shrubs, hills) on regulated land **exceed** any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a **direction** requiring the **owner or occupier** to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.
- This provision allows for flexibility in natural landscapes while maintaining safety standards.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This clause was previously repealed under **SOR/81-172, section 1**, but appears to be **reinstated or referenced here** — clarification may be needed in official records. If active, it gives the Minister regulatory authority over vegetation.

---

#### **6. Boundary Description (Legal Survey Details)**
The regulations define the **exact geographic boundaries** of the regulated area using a detailed legal description starting from a defined point and following a series of directions:

- **Starting Point**: Intersection of runways **06–24** and **11–29**.
- The boundary proceeds via a sequence of directional lines:
  - East along runway 06–24 (2,000 ft)
  - South 500 ft to reach the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
  - Then a long, winding path tracing:
    - Section boundaries (Township 72, Range 6W)
    - Road allowances
    - Right-of-way plans (e.g., 2457 J.Y., 5273 K.S., 3399 C.L., 2783 C.L., 2358 N.Y.)
    - Lot boundaries in the **Flyingshot Lake Settlement** (referencing a 1908 survey plan)
- The path continues southward and eastward, following roads and property lines, ultimately returning to the **point of commencement**.

> 🔍 This detailed legal description ensures **precise spatial control** and helps avoid ambiguity in land use enforcement.

#### **7. Strip Descriptions (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **06–24** | 1,000 ft wide (500 ft on each side of centerline) | 6,600 ft long |
| **11–29** | 1,000 ft wide (500 ft on each side) | 6,900 ft long |

- These strips are critical for aircraft operations and are protected under the regulations.
- All strip dimensions and positions are shown on **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1191 (October 14, 1975)**.

---

#### **8. Key Regulatory Plan Reference**
- All defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are **illustrated and referenced** on:
  - **Department of Public Works Plan No. E.1191 (dated October 14, 1975)**  
    → This is the **primary reference document** for all spatial definitions.

#### **9. Regulatory Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Flight Safety** | Prevents obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach. |
| **Consistent Zoning** | Applies uniform restrictions across all adjacent land and water areas. |
| **Clear Legal Boundaries** | Uses precise survey-based descriptions to prevent disputes and ensure compliance. |
| **Flexibility for Natural Features** | Allows for natural growth to exist within limits, with ministerial oversight for excessive growth. |
| **Long-Term Planning** | Provides a stable, legally enforceable framework for future development, infrastructure, and environmental planning near the airport. |

---

#### **10. Enforcement and Authority**
- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with the elevation limits.
- Compliance is mandatory; violations may result in penalties or legal action.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Grande Prairie Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive, technically precise, and legally enforceable framework to **protect aviation safety** by controlling development and natural features near the airport. By defining key surfaces (approach, outer, transitional), specifying exact land boundaries, and setting strict elevation limits, the regulations ensure that aircraft can operate safely without interference from structures or vegetation.

The integration of **survey-based legal descriptions** and **historical planning documents** (like Plan E.1191) provides a durable and transparent basis for land use decisions, making it a model for airport zoning in rural or remote areas.

> 📌 **Note for Practitioners**: This regulation is **not a general zoning code** but a **special-use regulation** specific to aviation safety. It applies only to lands adjacent to the airport and is enforced under the authority of the **Minister of Transport**. Developers, landowners, and municipal authorities must consult the official plan (E.1191) and the full schedule for compliance.
