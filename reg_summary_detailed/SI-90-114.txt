Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary**

**Title:**  
Order Regarding the Inclusion of Certain Lands in the Sale of Territorial Lands – Mackenzie River and Aklavik Lots

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which authorizes the inclusion of certain lands in a land sale when they lie within a specified distance of a water body’s ordinary high water mark.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Inclusion of Riverfront Lands in the Sale**
- Any portion of the lands described in the **Schedule attached to this regulation** that lies within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM)** of the **Mackenzie River** in the **Northwest Territories** shall be **included in the sale** of those lands.
- This provision applies specifically to lands situated along the Mackenzie River, where the river's OHWM defines a boundary for inclusion in the land transaction.
- The inclusion is based on the principle that riparian or riverfront lands within a defined buffer zone (100 feet) are subject to specific land use or disposal rules under the Territorial Lands Act.

> *Note:* The "Ordinary High Water Mark" is a legal benchmark used to define the boundary between land and water, often used in land surveys and property rights to determine whether land is subject to flood risk, river access, or land sale provisions.

#### 2. **Specific Lands Included in the Sale**
- The **entire area** of **Lots 371 to 378 inclusive** in the **Hamlet of Aklavik**, Northwest Territories, is included in the sale.
- These lots are defined and referenced by:
  - Their **lot numbers** (371–378)
  - Their location in the **Hamlet of Aklavik**
  - Their presence on a **plan of survey of record number 67952**, which is part of the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** held at Ottawa.
- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District in **Yellowknife**, under **file number 1733**.

> This ensures that the boundaries and legal description of the lots are officially documented and accessible for land title and registration purposes.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- This regulation serves to **clarify and formalize** which portions of certain lands are subject to sale, particularly those adjacent to the Mackenzie River.
- By specifying the inclusion of lands within 100 feet of the river’s OHWM, the government ensures that **riverfront areas**—which may have environmental, cultural, or economic significance—are properly accounted for in land transactions.
- The inclusion of the Aklavik lots (371–378) ensures that these specific parcels are treated as part of the sale, which may be part of a larger land disposition, such as for infrastructure development, resource exploration, or Indigenous land use agreements.

---

### **Legal and Administrative Context**

- The **Territorial Lands Act** provides the framework for land administration in the Northwest Territories.
- Paragraph 13(b) empowers the government to include lands within a certain distance of a water body (such as rivers) in a land sale, especially when such lands are subject to natural or legal boundaries defined by water levels.
- This order is a **formal, legally binding directive** issued by the federal government through the Governor General in Council, reflecting a decision based on ministerial recommendation and statutory authority.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation clearly identifies two key actions:
1. **All land parcels within 100 feet of the Mackenzie River’s Ordinary High Water Mark** (as described in the schedule) are included in the sale.
2. **The entire block of Lots 371 to 378 in Aklavik** is included in the sale, with precise legal documentation available in the land records.

These provisions ensure clarity, legal consistency, and proper record-keeping in the process of land disposition in the Northwest Territories, particularly in areas adjacent to major waterways.

**Note:**  
For full legal effect, the regulation must be accompanied by the **Schedule** (not provided here) that lists the specific land descriptions. Without the schedule, the exact boundaries of the riverfront lands cannot be fully determined. The regulation is binding on all parties involved in land transactions and title registration in the Northwest Territories.
