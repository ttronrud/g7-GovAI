**Detailed Summary of the Redemption of Subsidiary Coin Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Redemption of Subsidiary Coin Regulations*

**Citation:**  
These Regulations may be cited as the *Redemption of Subsidiary Coin Regulations*.

---

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The Regulations establish the conditions under which subsidiary coin of Canada—specifically, coin that has been called in or is deemed unfit for circulation—can be redeemed by individuals or holders. The primary objective is to define the circumstances in which such coin can be exchanged for its face value, while also providing the governing authority with discretion to deny redemption in certain cases.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Eligibility for Redemption:**  
   Subsidiary coin of Canada that has been:
   - *Called in* (i.e., formally withdrawn from circulation by the government), or  
   - *Declared unfit for circulation* (due to damage, wear, or other factors rendering it unsuitable for use),  
   is **redeemable at face value** if it can be **identified as coin authorized for circulation in Canada** as described in subsection 6(1) of the *Currency Act*.

   This means that the coin must:
   - Be a legitimate type of subsidiary coin (e.g., smaller denominations such as 1-cent, 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, or 50-cent pieces),
   - Be officially recognized and authorized under the legal framework of the *Currency Act*,
   - Be clearly identifiable as such (e.g., through design, denomination, and minting standards).

2. **Authority to Refuse Redemption:**  
   Despite the general right to redemption, the **Minister of Supply and Services** (or any other person designated by the Minister) **may refuse to redeem** a coin if it appears to have been:
   - *Wilfully mutilated*, or  
   - *Maliciously defaced*.

   This discretionary power allows the government to protect the integrity of the currency system and prevent the circulation of coins that may be used for fraudulent or unauthorized purposes.

   - *Wilful mutilation* refers to intentional physical damage (e.g., cutting, drilling, or altering the coin in a way that renders it non-functional or misleading).
   - *Malicious defacement* includes deliberate alterations that could deceive the public (e.g., engraving false information, covering the face value, or altering the design to mimic another currency).

3. **Interpretation of "Identifiable as Authorized Coin":**  
   The requirement that the coin be "identifiable" implies that the coin must be recognizable as genuine and legitimate under the official standards set by the *Currency Act*. This includes having intact features such as the denomination, mint mark, and design elements. If the coin is significantly damaged or altered in a way that obscures these features, it may not meet this threshold.

4. **No Redemption for Non-Compliant or Fraudulent Coins:**  
   The Regulations explicitly exclude coins that have been tampered with for improper or deceptive purposes. This provision helps safeguard public trust in the currency and prevents the use of altered coins to evade taxes, falsify transactions, or engage in fraud.

**Implications and Practical Application:**

- **For the Public:**  
  Individuals who hold called-in or unfit subsidiary coins can generally redeem them at face value, provided the coin is authentic and not tampered with. This supports public confidence in the monetary system and provides a clear path for returning old or damaged coins.

- **For Government Authorities:**  
  The Minister (or designated officer) has the authority to assess each coin's condition and determine whether it meets the criteria for redemption. This discretion is critical in preventing misuse and ensuring the integrity of Canada’s currency.

- **Enforcement and Accountability:**  
  The regulations are enforced through the oversight of the Minister of Supply and Services, who may act based on reasonable assessment. There is no requirement for formal evidence or proof of tampering in most cases—only that the appearance of wilful or malicious damage is apparent.

---

**Legal Basis:**  
These Regulations are derived from and operate under the authority of the *Currency Act*, specifically subsection 6(1), which authorizes the issuance and circulation of subsidiary coin in Canada.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The *Redemption of Subsidiary Coin Regulations* provide a balanced framework for the redemption of damaged or withdrawn Canadian subsidiary coin. They ensure that legitimate, authentic coins can be returned to their holders at face value, while protecting the currency system from fraud by allowing the government to deny redemption in cases of intentional tampering. This regulation supports both public access to currency redemption and the integrity of Canada’s monetary system.
