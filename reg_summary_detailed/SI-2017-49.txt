### 7. **Creditable Periods and Periods of Residence (Key to Benefit Entitlement)**

#### What Are Creditable Periods?
- A period of **contributions** or **residence** used to qualify for a pension or allowance.
- In Italy: includes periods deemed as contributions under Italian law.
- In Canada: includes periods during which a disability pension is payable under the CPP.

> 🔗 **Totalization Rules** (crucial for pension eligibility):

| Benefit | Totalization Rule |
|-------|-------------------|
| **OAS Act (Old Age Security)** | A period of residence in Italy during which a person was covered by CPP or provincial pension plans counts as **residence in Canada**. |
| | Conversely, a period of residence in Canada while covered by Italian legislation **does not** count as residence in Canada for OAS purposes (unless covered by CPP). |
| **CPP (Canada Pension Plan)** | A calendar year with **at least 13 weeks** of creditable periods under Italian law counts as **one year of CPP contributions**. |
| **Italian Legislation** | A calendar year of CPP contributions counts as **52 weeks** of Italian contributions. A week of OAS creditable periods (not in CPP) counts as **one week** of Italian contributions. |

> 📌 **Totalization Principle**: If a person has not completed the required minimum periods under one country’s system, the **total periods** from both countries are combined to determine eligibility.

---

### 8. **Eligibility and Benefit Calculation**

#### A. When Totalization Applies
- If a person is **not entitled** to a benefit due to insufficient periods under one country, entitlement is determined by **totalizing**:
  - Creditable periods under Canada and Italy
  - Creditable periods under a **third country** (if both Canada and Italy have a social security agreement with that country)

> ✅ Totalization applies **only** if no right exists under one country’s legislation alone.

#### B. Minimum Period Requirement
- If the total creditable periods (from both countries) are **less than one year (52 weeks)**, and no right exists under either country’s law:
  - The competent institution **does not have to pay benefits** for those periods.
  - However, those periods **are still considered** when determining entitlement to benefits under the **other country’s legislation**.

> ⚠️ This prevents "partial credit" from being used to justify full benefits.

#### C. Voluntary Continuation of Italian Insurance
- Periods of creditable contributions under the **Canada Pension Plan** can
