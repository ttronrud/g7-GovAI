**Detailed Summary of National Energy Board Order No. MO-62-69**

**Order Citation:**  
This regulation is officially cited as *National Energy Board Order No. MO-62-69*.

**Governing Authority:**  
The Order is issued by the **National Energy Board (NEB)**, a federal regulatory body responsible for overseeing the safety, environmental protection, and economic regulation of Canada’s pipeline system. The NEB derives its authority under **subsection 97(1)1 of the National Energy Board Act**.

**Key Provision:**  
The NEB orders that **Part IV of the National Energy Board Act** applies to **every person who was operating a pipeline on November 2, 1959**.

**Explanation of the Provision:**  
- **Part IV of the National Energy Board Act** typically governs the regulatory responsibilities, compliance requirements, safety standards, and operational rules applicable to pipeline operators. It establishes the legal framework for pipeline regulation, including licensing, reporting, safety measures, and environmental protections.
- The critical aspect of this Order is its **retroactive application**. By specifying that Part IV applies to persons operating pipelines on **November 2, 1959**, the Order extends regulatory oversight to those pipeline operations that existed prior to the formal enactment or implementation of Part IV.
- This retroactive application ensures that even pipelines that were in operation before the modern regulatory regime was fully established are now subject to the current standards and requirements of Part IV.

**Legal Basis and Jurisdictional Note:**  
- The NEB cites **subsection 97(1)1** of the National Energy Board Act as the legal authority for issuing this Order.
- It is noted that this subsection is **not reproduced in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970 (R.S.C., 1970)**. Instead, it appears in the **Statutes of Canada, 1959 (S.C., 1959, c. 46)**, which reflects the original legislative text at the time of enactment.
- This omission in the 1970 Revised Statutes may be due to editorial or structural changes during the codification process, but it does not affect the validity or enforceability of the subsection under the original statute.

**Significance and Implications:**  
1. **Regulatory Consistency:** This Order ensures that all pipeline operators, regardless of when their operations began, are subject to a uniform and comprehensive regulatory regime under Part IV.
2. **Legal Clarity:** It provides legal certainty by defining a clear cutoff date (November 2, 1959) for when regulatory obligations under Part IV begin to apply.
3. **Enforcement and Compliance:** Operators of pipelines that were active on that date must now comply with all current requirements under Part IV, including safety, environmental, and operational standards.
4. **Historical Context:** The date—November 2, 1959—likely marks a significant point in Canadian energy infrastructure development, possibly coinciding with the formalization of pipeline regulation or the establishment of the NEB’s jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**  
National Energy Board Order No. MO-62-69 establishes that **all pipeline operators who were actively running pipelines on November 2, 1959, are now subject to the full scope of Part IV of the National Energy Board Act**. This retroactive application ensures equitable and consistent regulatory oversight across the entire pipeline sector, regardless of the date of operation. The Order is grounded in statutory authority and reflects a key step in the modernization and standardization of pipeline regulation in Canada.

**Note:**  
This Order is a foundational regulatory instrument that may have been part of a broader effort to bring all existing pipeline operations into compliance with updated safety and environmental standards, especially in the context of growing public and governmental concern over pipeline safety and environmental impact in the mid-20th century.
