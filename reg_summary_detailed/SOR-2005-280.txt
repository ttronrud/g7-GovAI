The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2010-83, section 38**. However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text — only repeated citations of its repeal.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Citation**: The repeal is specified in **Statutory Instrument 2010-83, section 38**.
- **Source**: SOR stands for *Statutory Instrument of the Ontario Government* (S.O. 2010-83).
- **Implication**: The regulation previously in force has been removed from the legal framework. It is no longer valid or enforceable under Ontario law.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: The repeal likely occurred because:
  - The regulation was outdated or redundant.
  - It was superseded by a newer, more comprehensive, or more effective regulation.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with current laws or policy goals.
  - It was deemed unnecessary or overly burdensome.
- **Legal Effect**: Any actions or obligations previously governed by this regulation are now subject to current applicable laws, and enforcement or compliance is no longer required under this specific provision.

### Important Notes:
- Since the actual text of the regulation is **missing**, a detailed summary of its **provisions, scope, or application** cannot be provided.
- The repeated entries (28 times) are likely a formatting or data-entry error — they do not indicate multiple regulations or different versions, but rather emphasize the repeal status.

### Conclusion:
This entry confirms that a particular regulation was **officially repealed on or around April 2010** (as SOR/2010-83 was published in April 2010) under section 38 of that instrument. However, **no substantive content of the regulation exists in the provided text**, so a detailed summary of its content, purpose, or application is not possible. To understand the original regulation, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2010-83, section 38, which is no longer in effect.

👉 **Recommendation**: To obtain the original regulation’s content, refer to the official Ontario government legislation database (e.g., *Legislation.gov.on.ca*) and search for **SOR/2010-83, s. 38**.
