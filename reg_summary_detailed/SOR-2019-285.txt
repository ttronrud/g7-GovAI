Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured, and comprehensive summary** of the *Physical Activities Regulations* (S.C. 2019, c. 28), made under the *Impact Assessment Act* by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Physical Activities Regulations (S.C. 2019, c. 28)**

### 🔹 **Overview**

The *Physical Activities Regulations* are a set of regulatory provisions under the *Impact Assessment Act* (IAA) that **designate specific physical activities as "designated projects"** requiring environmental assessment and public review under the IAA. These regulations define which types of development, infrastructure, and industrial activities trigger mandatory environmental assessments — particularly those located in sensitive ecological or protected areas.

These regulations were enacted to **implement the IAA**, which replaced the previous *Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012)*, and establish a more robust, transparent, and science-based process for assessing the environmental effects of major projects.

## 🔍 Key Provisions and Structure

### 1. **Legal Authority and Basis**
- Made under **sections 109 and 188 of the Impact Assessment Act**.
- Based on recommendations from the **Minister of the Environment**.
- The regulations come into force on the day the **Impact Assessment Act** comes into force (as specified in the note: August 28, 2019).

> This means that the regulations are not standalone; they are part of a broader legislative framework designed to ensure that significant physical activities are assessed for their environmental impact before proceeding.

### 2. **Definitions (Key Terms Used Throughout the Regulations)**

The regulations provide precise definitions for key terms used in the context of physical activities and environmental assessments:

| **Nuclear substance** | As defined in the Nuclear Safety and Control Act. |
| **Offshore** | Areas where oil/gas exploration or production requires authorization under relevant petroleum accords (e.g., Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia). |
| **Offshore area** | As defined in CERA — waters beyond the coastal zone. |
| **Oil and gas pipeline** | Pipelines used exclusively for oil or gas. |
| **Park community** | As defined in the Canada National Parks Act — communities within national parks. |

### 3. **Designated Projects Under the Impact Assessment Act**

Under **section 2 of the IAA**, a “designated project” is one that triggers mandatory environmental assessment. The regulations specify which **physical activities** fall into this category.

#### ✅ Activities That Trigger Environmental Assessment (Designated Projects)

The following **categories of physical activities** are designated as requiring environmental assessment under the IAA:

---

#### 🏞️ **1. Construction, Operation, Decommissioning & Abandonment in Sensitive Areas**

| Activity | Location | Conditions |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **New electrical generating facility or transmission line** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new facility |
| **New water diversion structures** (e.g., dams, dykes, reservoirs) | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | New structures for water diversion |
| **New oil/gas facilities or pipelines** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new facility or pipeline |
| **New mine or mill** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new mine or mill |
| **New industrial facility** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new industrial site |
| **New canal or lock** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new canal or lock |
| **New marine terminal** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new terminal |
| **New railway line** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new line |
| **New public road or parkway** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | For motor vehicle passage |
| **New aerodrome or runway** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new airport runway |
| **New waste management facility** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new facility |
| **New aquaculture facility** | Wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, protected marine areas | Any new aquaculture site |

> These activities are subject to environmental assessment **if they occur in wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, or protected marine areas**.

#### 🌊 **2. Construction in National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCA)**

| Activity | Condition |
|--------|----------|
| **New physical work** | If it contradicts the **management plan** for the NMCA, which must be tabled in Parliament under the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act or Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park Act. |
| **Disposal at sea** | Of waste or other matter (as per CEPA 1999) at a **new disposal site** or **new part of an existing site**. |
| **New pipeline** | For carrying substances **other than water** (e.g., oil, gas, chemicals). |
