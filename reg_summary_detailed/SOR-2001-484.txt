**Detailed Summary of the Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations**

### **Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The *Supervisory Information (Insurance Holding Companies) Regulations* were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under the authority of **sections 999a and 1021a of the Insurance Companies Act (ICA)**. These regulations are part of Canada’s regulatory framework governing the oversight of insurance holding companies and their affiliated entities.

The regulations are formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 465** (amending the Insurance Companies Act)
- **S.C. 1991, c. 47** (original enactment)

They are designed to establish specific types of **supervisory information** that must be retained and, under certain conditions, may be disclosed — primarily to ensure effective financial oversight by the Superintendent of Financial Services (Superintendent) and to protect the integrity of the financial system.

### **Core Purpose**

The primary objective of these regulations is to **define what constitutes "prescribed supervisory information"** relating to:
1. **Insurance holding companies (IHCs)** themselves
2. **Their affiliates**, where applicable

This information is considered critical for regulatory oversight, risk management, and transparency, and its handling is strictly governed to balance **prudential supervision** with **confidentiality and disclosure obligations**.
