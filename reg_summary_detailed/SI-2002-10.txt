**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

This regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the government to modify or expand land grants by including specific parcels of land adjacent to water bodies—particularly those within a defined distance of the shoreline.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of this order is to **include certain land areas adjacent to La Martre Lake**—specifically, those lying within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark**—into the official land grant. This expansion ensures that lands in proximity to the lake that may have been previously excluded due to their proximity to water are now formally included in the legal description of the granted property.

**Geographic Scope and Legal Description:**

- **Location:** The lands in question are situated within **La Martre Lake**, in the **Northwest Territories**.
- **Community:** The affected lots are located within the **Community of Wha Ti**, a recognized Indigenous community in the region.
- **Specific Lots:** The regulation explicitly refers to **Lots 45 and 57** at La Martre Lake.
- **Legal Reference:** These lots are defined and referenced on **Plan of Survey of Record Number 82605**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa**. This survey serves as the official legal documentation for the land boundaries and descriptions.

**Key Provision:**

- Any portion of the land described in the schedule (attached to the regulation) that lies **within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of La Martre Lake is **included in the grant** of the said lots.
- The term “ordinary high water mark” refers to the natural boundary of the lake's shoreline under normal, non-storm conditions, which is a standard geographical reference point used in land surveying and legal land descriptions.

**Legal and Practical Implications:**

1. **Land Title Expansion:** This regulation effectively expands the legal boundaries of Lots 45 and 57 to include adjacent shoreline areas, which may have been previously excluded due to their proximity to water. This adjustment is critical for ensuring that land rights are accurately reflected in official land records.

2. **Indigenous Land Rights Context:** Since the Community of Wha Ti is an Indigenous community, this adjustment may have implications for traditional use, stewardship, or land rights. The inclusion of shoreline areas may support Indigenous claims to access, cultural practices, or environmental protection related to the lake.

3. **Environmental and Access Considerations:** The 100-foot buffer zone (30.48 metres) is a common standard in land administration for protecting natural features and ensuring public or community access. This provision may also support environmental sustainability by recognizing the ecological significance of the shoreline.

4. **Legal Clarity and Record Accuracy:** By formally including these areas in the land grant, the regulation enhances the accuracy and legal enforceability of land titles, which is essential for property transactions, land management, and dispute resolution.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a formal legal instrument that modifies the boundary of Lots 45 and 57 at La Martre Lake by including all land parcels within 100 feet (30.48 metres) of the ordinary high water mark along the lake’s shoreline. It is issued under established statutory authority (Territorial Lands Act, paragraph 13(b)) and is tied to a specific survey record (No. 82605). The order strengthens land title clarity, supports Indigenous community land rights, and ensures alignment with standard land administration practices involving water boundaries.
