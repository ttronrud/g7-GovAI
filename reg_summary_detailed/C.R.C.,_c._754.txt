**Detailed Summary of the Customs Accounting Document Error Remission Order**

**Title:**  
Customs Accounting Document Error Remission Order

**Purpose:**  
This regulation establishes a framework for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of customs duties and excise taxes that were underpaid in error, specifically when the amount of the underpayment is small and attributable to a mistake in the customs accounting process.

---

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Scope of Remission:**  
   The Order permits the remission of the amount by which customs duties and excise taxes were underpaid due to an error — meaning the amount of tax that was incorrectly assessed or paid less than required.

2. **Applicable Taxes:**  
   The remission applies to:
   - Customs duties imposed under the *Customs Tariff*.
   - Taxes imposed under **Division III of Part IX** of the *Excise Tax Act* (which typically covers taxes on certain goods such as fuel, alcohol, and tobacco).
   - Any other taxes under other parts of the *Excise Tax Act* that are applicable to imported goods.

3. **Eligibility Condition – Threshold Limit:**  
   Remission is only granted **if the underpayment, in respect of any one customs accounting document, does not exceed $7.50**.

   - A "customs accounting document" refers to a formal record used by customs authorities to track the importation, valuation, classification, and taxation of goods (e.g., entry forms, invoices, declarations, or other documentation used in the customs accounting process).
   - The $7.50 limit is a **per-document threshold** — meaning that even if the total underpayment across multiple documents is significant, remission is only available for individual documents where the error is less than or equal to $7.50.

4. **Exclusion of Interim Documents:**  
   The remission provision **does not apply** to *interim documents*.  
   - Interim documents are temporary records used during the processing of a customs transaction (e.g., preliminary declarations or draft entries) that are not final or official.  
   - These documents are excluded because they are not considered final accounting records and may be subject to different review or correction procedures.

5. **Nature of the Error:**  
   The underpayment must be due to an **error**, not due to fraud, willful misrepresentation, or non-compliance with customs regulations. The error must be unintentional and attributable to a clerical, administrative, or procedural mistake in the customs accounting process.

6. **Remission Process:**  
   While the Order grants the authority for remission, it does not prescribe a detailed administrative process (such as application forms or review timelines). In practice, the remission would likely be initiated through a formal request to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which would assess the error, verify the amount, and determine eligibility under this threshold.

---

**Policy Rationale:**  
- The Order aims to reduce administrative burdens and promote compliance by recognizing minor, unintentional errors that do not significantly impact the overall tax system.
- By setting a clear, low threshold ($7.50 per document), it provides a practical and accessible remedy for small inaccuracies that may arise in routine import operations.
- It supports the principle of fairness and proportionality — taxpayers should not be penalized for minor, non-intentional mistakes that do not represent systemic non-compliance.

---

**Limitations and Important Notes:**  
- The remission applies **only to underpayments** — overpayments are not covered.
- The remission is **not automatic** — it requires proper documentation and likely a formal request or review process.
- The $7.50 cap ensures that larger errors or intentional non-compliance are not subject to this leniency.
- The Order does not extend to errors involving fraud, evasion, or deliberate misstatements.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Customs Accounting Document Error Remission Order* provides a targeted and proportionate mechanism for correcting minor, unintentional underpayments of customs duties and excise taxes on imported goods. By allowing remission of errors where the underpayment per customs accounting document is $7.50 or less (excluding interim documents), it promotes accuracy, reduces administrative friction, and supports fair treatment of small-scale import errors. This regulation is designed to balance compliance with practicality and fairness in the customs administration system.
