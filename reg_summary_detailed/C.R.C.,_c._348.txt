**Detailed Summary of the *Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

The *Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations* (often referred to as the **Shipbuilding Industry Assistance Regulations**) establish a framework for providing financial assistance—specifically **grants (subsidies)** and **contributions**—to Canadian shipbuilders for the construction of eligible ships. The regulations aim to support the development and sustainability of Canada’s shipbuilding industry by encouraging investment in domestic ship construction, promoting the use of Canadian materials and services, and ensuring long-term competitiveness and productivity.

These regulations were originally enacted to support the Canadian shipbuilding sector during a period of decline, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, and are structured around key principles: **eligibility**, **application requirements**, **cost calculation**, **subsidy and contribution limits**, and **performance improvement**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These regulations were **revoked** by *SOR/85-126, section 2*, indicating they are no longer in force. However, this summary provides a detailed interpretation of their content as they existed prior to revocation.

## **Eligibility Criteria for an Eligible Ship**

A ship is deemed eligible if it meets **all** of the following conditions:

1. **Size Requirements**:
   - Self-propelled: ≥ 100 gross tons (GT)
   - Non-self-propelled: ≥ 200 GT
   - Tug: ≥ 50 GT
   - Fishing vessel: ≥ 23 meters in overall length

2. **Non-Recreational Use**:
   - The ship must not be primarily intended for personal recreation.

3. **Construction Timeline**:
   - Construction must have **begun or a contract must have been signed before July 1, 1985**.

> This ensures that only ships constructed during a defined period of national economic and industrial policy are eligible.

---

## **Application Process**

### **What Must Be Submitted?**
An application must include:
- Completed application form
- Evidence that the shipbuilder has **sufficient financial resources** to complete the ship
- Evidence that construction will **not over-expand facilities** beyond long-term demand
- Evidence that construction will **not harm the long-term competitiveness** of the shipbuilder or the Canadian shipbuilding industry
- For foreign-owned ships: Evidence that construction will not **disrupt domestic shipbuilding capacity**
- A copy of the **contract** (if not built for the shipbuilder)
- A copy of the **plans and specifications** (if built for the shipbuilder)
- All information required by the application form

### **Deadline for Submission**
- If built for **a person other than the shipbuilder**: within **60 days** of:
  - Execution of the contract, or
  - Commencement of construction — whichever occurs earlier
- If built **by the shipbuilder for itself**: within 60 days of commencement of construction

> The Minister may **extend** the deadline if circumstances warrant it.

## **Subsidy Payment Rules (Section 8)**

The subsidy is a **percentage of the approved cost**, and the rate varies depending on the **application date**:

| Application Date | Subsidy Rate |
|------------------|-------------|
| Before January 1, 1976 | 14% |
| After Dec 31, 1975 – Jan 1, 1977 | 13% |
| After Dec 31, 1976 – Jan 1, 1978 | 12% |
| After Dec 31, 1977 – Jan 1, 1979 | 11% |
| After Dec 31, 1978 – Jan 1, 1980 | 10% |
| March 1, 1977 – June 30, 1980 | 20% (special window) |
| After June 30, 1980 | 9% (under specific conditions) |

### **Conditions for 9% Subsidy**:
- Application after June 30, 1980:
  - Contract made **before January 7, 1983**, OR
  - Ship built by shipbuilder **and construction began before January 7, 1983**
- For ships completed **before July 1, 1985**:
  - Contract made **after January 6, 1983** (for foreign owners), OR
  - Construction began **after January 6, 1983** (for shipbuilder-owned ships)

> The 20% rate during 1977–1980 was a temporary incentive to stimulate shipbuilding activity.

### **Adjustments to Approved Cost**:
- If the shipbuilder or owner receives **financial support** from the **Industrial and Regional Development Program** or **Defence Industry Productivity Program**, that amount is **deducted** from the approved cost before subsidy calculation.

---

## **Construction Schedule and Late Completion Adjustments**

- If the construction schedule is unreasonable (e.g., too slow or delayed), the **application date may be adjusted** by the Minister, but **not earlier than the original application date**.
- If the ship is completed **later than scheduled** due to causes **beyond the shipbuilder’s or shipowner’s control**, the Minister may **adjust the application date** to reflect the actual completion timeline for subsidy calculation purposes.

> This protects shipbuilders from being penalized for delays due to external factors (e.g., supply chain issues, weather, war).

---

## **Improvement Plan and Contribution (Section 12)**

### **Purpose**
To promote long-term **shipyard productivity**, **safety**, and **technological advancement**.

### **What Must Be Included in the Improvement Plan?**
- Market and product assumptions and strategies
- Specific improvement projects (e.g., automation, safety upgrades)
- Expected improvements in capacity, productivity, or safety
- Financial statements (last 3 fiscal years)
- Projected balance sheet reflecting implementation of the plan

### **Who Can Undertake Projects?**

- **Repayment obligation** for any contribution used for equipment that:
  - Is diverted from the approved plan, or
  - Is disposed of within **five years** of acquisition (or shorter period as determined by the Minister)
- **Audit requirements**:

  - The Minister may independently verify costs at their discretion
