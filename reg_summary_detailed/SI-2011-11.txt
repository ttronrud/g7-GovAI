The regulation you provided is a formal government instrument issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) in Canada. Here is a detailed summary of its content and implications:

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessment under Section 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*

**Citation:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutes of Canada, 2002, Chapter 29)

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment.

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   This order serves to officially acknowledge that the Government of Canada has received and accepted the scientific assessment of certain wildlife species prepared by the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)**. This assessment was conducted in accordance with **subsection 23(1) of the Species at Risk Act (SARA)**.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   - Section 23(1) of SARA mandates that the Minister of the Environment, on the recommendation of COSEWIC, must assess the status of species that are at risk of extinction.  
   - COSEWIC is the independent scientific body responsible for assessing the conservation status of wildlife species in Canada. It evaluates species based on scientific data and determines whether they are at risk of becoming extinct.

3. **Content of the Assessment:**  
   The assessment covers a specific list of species listed in an **annexed schedule** (attached to the regulation). These species are evaluated for their risk status (e.g., endangered, threatened, special concern, etc.) based on criteria such as population size, distribution, threats, and trends.

4. **Governor General in Council Action:**  
   The Governor General in Council (a formal title for the federal government acting on ministerial advice) is issuing this order to formally recognize the completion and receipt of the COSEWIC assessment. This step is procedural and marks the beginning of the government’s formal process to determine whether these species should be listed as "endangered" or "threatened" under SARA.

5. **Implications for Species at Risk Act (SARA):**  
   - Once the government receives and acknowledges the COSEWIC assessment, it may proceed to designate the species as at risk under SARA.  
   - This designation triggers legal obligations under the Act, including the development of recovery strategies, the implementation of conservation measures, and the potential for federal protection of the species and its habitat.

6. **Timeline and Process:**  
   This order is typically issued shortly after COSEWIC completes its evaluation and submits the report to the Minister of the Environment. It signals the start of the next phase in the SARA process—formal listing and potential regulatory action.

7. **Transparency and Accountability:**  
   The inclusion of an annexed schedule ensures transparency by publicly naming the species involved. This allows stakeholders, Indigenous communities, scientists, and the public to understand which species are under review and what the government’s next steps will be.

**Significance and Context:**

- This regulation is a key part of Canada’s biodiversity protection framework.  
- It reflects the government’s commitment to science-based conservation decisions.  
- It underscores the role of COSEWIC as a central scientific authority in identifying species in need of protection.  
- The process ensures that species at risk are evaluated objectively and that conservation actions are guided by the best available scientific evidence.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation formally recognizes the completion of a scientific evaluation of certain wildlife species by COSEWIC under the *Species at Risk Act*. It marks a critical step in the official process of assessing species for potential listing as endangered or threatened, setting the stage for future conservation efforts, policy development, and legal protections under SARA. The order is both procedural and foundational, ensuring that conservation decisions are grounded in rigorous scientific assessment.
