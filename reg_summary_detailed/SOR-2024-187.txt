**Detailed Summary of the China Surtax Order (2024)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The *China Surtax Order (2024)* is made under specific provisions of the *Customs Tariff Act* (S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 191(1); S.C. 2012, c. 26, s. 63(4); S.C. 1997, c. 36) by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs**. This authority allows the government to impose additional duties (surtaxes) on certain goods imported into Canada from China under specific conditions.

The Order is grounded in **subsection 53(2)a** and **paragraph 79(a)b** of the *Customs Tariff Act*, which empower the government to apply surtaxes on goods originating in certain countries, particularly where there are concerns about trade imbalances, unfair practices, or national security, as part of broader trade policy objectives.

### **2. Definition of "Goods that Originate in China"**
For the purposes of this Order:
- "**Goods that originate in China**" means goods that are eligible to be marked as *goods of China* in accordance with the **Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (Non-CUSMA Countries) Regulations**.
- This definition ensures that only goods that meet the formal criteria for origin under Canadian rules (such as being wholly obtained or substantially transformed in China) are subject to the surtax.

---

### **3. Exclusions from the Surtax**
The Order **does not apply** to the following goods:

- **Goods classified under tariff items listed in Schedule 1** that were **in transit to Canada on October 1, 2024**.
- **Goods classified under tariff items listed in Schedule 2** that were **in transit to Canada on the day the Order comes into force** (i.e., October 1, 2024, or the registration date if later).

> **Key Implication**: This exclusion protects goods that were already in motion or in transit on the effective date, ensuring that the surtax does not retroactively affect shipments already underway. It provides legal certainty for importers who are managing cargo in transit.

### **4. Surtax Rates by Tariff Classification**

The Order imposes **different surtax rates** depending on the classification of the goods under the Harmonized System (HS) codes:

| **Tariff Classification** | **Surtax Rate** | **Applicable to Goods** |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Schedule 1**            | **100%**         | Goods classified under tariff items in Schedule 1 |
| **Schedule 2**            | **25%**          | Goods classified under tariff items in Schedule 2 |

> The surtax is applied **on the "value for duty"**, which is determined in accordance with **sections 47 to 55 of the Customs Act**. These sections outline the valuation methods used to calculate the duty payable on imported goods, including the transaction value method, the deductibility of certain costs, and the use of the "value for duty" in assessing customs liabilities.

> **Note**: The surtax is **in addition to any existing duties or taxes** and is not a substitute for them. It is a separate, additional charge imposed on the value of the goods at the time of importation.

---

### **5. Effective Date and Registration Clause**

- The Order **comes into force on October 1, 2024**.
- However, **if the Order is registered (officially published) after October 1, 2024**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provision ensures that the Order can be introduced with administrative flexibility—allowing for delays in formal publication due to legislative or procedural processes—while still maintaining a clear and predictable start date for its application.

---

### **6. Policy and Strategic Implications**

- **Purpose**: The surtax appears to be a targeted trade measure aimed at addressing specific economic or strategic concerns related to Chinese-origin goods, potentially including:
  - Protection against unfair trade practices.
  - Pressure on certain sectors (e.g., high-tech, manufacturing, or critical minerals).
  - Alignment with broader trade policy goals or geopolitical considerations.

- **Impact on Importers**:
  - Importers of goods classified in **Schedule 1** will face a **doubling of the duty cost** (100% surtax), which could significantly increase prices or reduce competitiveness.
  - Importers of goods in **Schedule 2** will face a **25% additional cost**, which may serve as a deterrent without completely blocking trade.

- **Transparency and Predictability**:
  - The Order is structured to be transparent, with clear definitions, exclusions, and tariff-based application.
  - The use of existing customs valuation rules ensures consistency with established customs procedures.

### **7. Key Schedules (Not Included in Text, but Implied)**

Although not fully detailed in the provided text, **Schedules 1 and 2** are critical components of the Order and would list specific tariff headings (HS codes) under which the surtax applies. These schedules are typically published in full with the Order and would include:
- Product categories such as electronics, machinery, textiles, or industrial components.
- Specific product codes (e.g., 8542 for electronic components, 9016 for certain machinery).

> Without access to the full schedules, the exact product categories affected cannot be specified, but the structure suggests a focus on high-value or strategically sensitive goods.

### **Conclusion**

The **China Surtax Order (2024)** is a targeted, rule-based measure that imposes additional duties (surtaxes) on goods originating in China, depending on their classification under specific tariff headings. It reflects a strategic trade policy response, likely aimed at influencing Chinese-origin supply chains, protecting domestic industries, or responding to international trade dynamics.

Key features:
- **100% surtax** on goods in Schedule 1 (likely high-value or sensitive items).
- **25% surtax** on goods in Schedule 2 (possibly less sensitive or broader categories).
- **Exclusions** for goods in transit on October 1, 2024, to avoid retroactive application.
- **Effective date** of October 1, 2024, or the registration date if delayed.

This Order strengthens Canada’s ability to implement trade measures in response to evolving economic and geopolitical conditions, while operating within the legal framework of the *Customs Tariff Act*.

> **Note**: For full compliance, importers should consult the official version of the Order, including the complete Schedules, and ensure proper classification of goods to determine whether surtax applies. Legal and customs counsel should be engaged to assess the implications for specific products and supply chains.
