**Regulatory Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order in Council SI/2025-46  
**Issued by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
**On the recommendation of:** The Prime Minister  
**Under Section 2 of the Physical Activity and Sport Act (S.C. 2003, c. 2)**  

---

### **1. Repeal of Prior Order in Council**  
The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2025-427**, issued on March 14, 2025.  
- This means that the previous administrative directive (P.C. 2025-427) — which may have previously designated or assigned responsibilities related to physical activity and sport under the *Physical Activity and Sport Act* — is formally **cancelled and no longer in force**.  
- The repeal ensures regulatory clarity and consistency by removing outdated or superseded provisions, allowing the new designations to take effect without conflict.

---

### **2. Designation of the Minister of Health**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of Health** (a member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada) as the **Minister responsible for physical activity** under the *Physical Activity and Sport Act*.  
- This assignment establishes the **Minister of Health** as the primary federal minister accountable for policy, programming, and funding related to physical activity initiatives.  
- The designation is made **specifically in respect of physical activity**, meaning the Minister of Health will lead and coordinate federal efforts related to promoting physical activity, public health outcomes, and access to active lifestyles.  
- This reflects a strategic alignment with public health priorities, as physical activity is a key component of disease prevention and overall well-being.

### **3. Designation of the Minister of State (Sport)**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of State (Sport)** (also a member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada) as the **Minister responsible for sport** under the *Physical Activity and Sport Act*.  
- This assigns the **Minister of State (Sport)** the lead responsibility for all matters related to sport in Canada, including youth development, competitive sport, sport infrastructure, athlete support, and the governance of national sport organizations.  
- The designation is **specific to sport**, ensuring that sport-related policies, funding, and programs are managed under the appropriate ministerial oversight.  
- As a Minister of State, this individual operates under the authority of the Minister of Sport (or the relevant senior minister), but holds formal responsibility for sport policy within the federal framework.

---

### **4. Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under **Section 2 of the Physical Activity and Sport Act (S.C. 2003, c. 2)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to:  
- Repeal or amend orders related to the Act;  
- Designate specific ministers to act in respect of particular areas (physical activity or sport) within the scope of the Act.  

This provision allows for **flexible ministerial assignment** to ensure effective governance based on policy priorities and expertise.

---

### **5. Purpose and Significance**  
- **Clarity in Governance:** The regulation clarifies accountability by assigning distinct ministerial responsibilities for physical activity and sport, avoiding overlap or ambiguity.  
- **Policy Alignment:** It aligns federal leadership with public health and youth development goals, recognizing the interdependence of physical activity and sport in promoting healthy, active communities.  
- **Interdepartmental Coordination:** While the Minister of Health leads physical activity (a public health issue), the Minister of State (Sport) leads sport (a cultural and competitive domain), enabling targeted and effective policy implementation.  
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The designation ensures that stakeholders, including health professionals, sports organizations, and the public, know who is responsible for decisions affecting physical activity and sport at the federal level.

### **6. Effective Date**  
Although not explicitly stated in the text, such orders typically come into force upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and upon receipt by the relevant departments. The effective date is generally **the date of publication** (which would be shortly after the Order in Council is issued and published).

---

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation streamlines and strengthens the federal framework for promoting physical activity and sport by:  
- Repealing an outdated order;  
- Clearly assigning ministerial responsibilities under the *Physical Activity and Sport Act*;  
- Ensuring that physical activity is led by the Minister of Health (aligned with public health outcomes), and sport is led by the Minister of State (Sport) (aligned with competitive and community-based sport development).  

This reflects a deliberate effort to enhance coordination, accountability, and effectiveness in advancing healthy, active lifestyles across Canada.
