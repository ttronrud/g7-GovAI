2. **If centre of vital interests cannot be determined**:
   - Resident of the State with **habitual abode**.
3. **If habitual abode is in both or neither**:
   - Resident of the **State of which they are a national**.
4. **If national of both or neither**:
   - The competent authorities must resolve the issue by **mutual agreement**.

#### For Companies:
1. Resident of the **State of which it is a national**.
2. If no nationality: resolved by **mutual agreement**.
