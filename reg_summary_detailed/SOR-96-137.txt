### **Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations (Repealed and Substituted, Effective April 1, 1996)**

This regulation, issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans under sections 8, 43*, and 79.7** of the *Fisheries Act*, formally **repeals the old British Columbia Sport Fishing Regulations (Order in Council P.C. 1982-1920)** and replaces them with a new, comprehensive set of rules governing **sport fishing in Canadian fisheries waters of the Pacific Ocean and within the Province of British Columbia**. These regulations became effective on **April 1, 1996**, and were later **fully repealed in 2017** (SOR/2017-58, s. 35), meaning they are no longer in force.

Despite their repeal, this document provides a detailed historical and structural overview of the regulatory framework that governed sport fishing in BC from 1996 to 2017.
