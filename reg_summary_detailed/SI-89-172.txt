**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**1. Background and Purpose**  
The regulation is issued by the Governor in Council (acting on behalf of the federal government) to establish a framework for the financial responsibility of non-governmental individuals and non-departmental employees for certain training and residential services provided by the **Canadian Centre for Management Development (CCMD)**.

The key rationale is that **a portion of the cost** of CCMD’s courses, seminars, and residential programs should be borne by the individuals or organizations receiving these services — not solely by the government. This reflects a principle of cost-sharing, ensuring that participants contribute to the financial burden of the programs they benefit from.

---

**2. Legal Authority**  
The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 19(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision allows the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada and the Treasury Board, to authorize the Secretary of State of Canada to prescribe fees and charges for services provided by government agencies or entities — provided such actions are consistent with fiscal responsibility and cost recovery principles.

---

**3. Scope of the Authorization**  
The Secretary of State of Canada is empowered to issue **specific orders** that:

- **Prescribe fees** for courses and seminars offered by CCMD;  
- **Prescribe charges** for residential services offered by CCMD.

These fees and charges are to be based on a **fair and transparent apportionment of direct costs** associated with the design, delivery, and operation of these programs.

---

**4. Who is Exempt from Fees and Charges?**  
The following individuals and groups are **exempt** from paying the prescribed fees or charges:

- **Members of the Senate and the House of Commons** (i.e., federal parliamentary members);  
- **Persons employed in a department as defined in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act** (i.e., federal civil servants working in a government department).

This exemption ensures that key public officials and federal employees, who are already part of the government’s core workforce, do not bear the cost of training or development programs that are intended to support public service capacity.

---

**5. Basis for Fee Setting**  
Fees and charges must be determined based on a **cost apportionment model** that reflects the **direct costs** involved in delivering each program. These direct costs may include:

- Program design and development (e.g., curriculum development, materials, planning);  
- Delivery costs (e.g., instructors, facilitators, technology, venue);  
- Administrative and operational support (e.g., logistics, coordination, support staff);  
- Residential service costs (e.g., accommodation, meals, facilities, staffing during residential stays).

The cost apportionment must be **objective, verifiable, and transparent**, ensuring that fees are not arbitrary or punitive but are instead directly tied to the actual expenses incurred.

---

**6. Implications and Objectives**  
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Encourages cost accountability by requiring participants to contribute financially to programs they use.  
- **Equity and Fairness**: Prevents government-funded training from being a free service to all, ensuring that those who benefit financially from the program contribute to its cost.  
- **Sustainability**: Helps ensure the long-term financial sustainability of CCMD by creating a stable revenue stream from participants.  
- **Clarity and Transparency**: Provides a clear, rule-based mechanism for determining fees, which improves predictability for participants and stakeholders.

---

**7. Enforcement and Implementation**  
- The Secretary of State of Canada will issue a formal **order** setting the specific fees and charges.  
- The order will be published in the **Canada Gazette** and will become enforceable upon publication.  
- CCMD will be responsible for collecting fees and charges from eligible participants, in accordance with the prescribed terms.  
- The Treasury Board and the President of the Queen’s Privy Council may monitor compliance and review the cost apportionment methodology periodically.

---

**8. Key Principles Underlying the Regulation**  
- **Cost recovery** is a legitimate and reasonable expectation for non-governmental participants.  
- **Exemptions** are reserved for those already integrated into the government structure (parliamentarians and civil servants).  
- **Transparency** and **accountability** are central to the fee-setting process.  
- The regulation respects the public service’s role in developing leadership and management capacity while maintaining fiscal discipline.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation establishes a clear, legally grounded mechanism for the Canadian Centre for Management Development to charge fees for its training and residential services. It ensures that the financial burden of these programs is shared fairly among participants, while protecting government employees and members of Parliament from cost-sharing obligations. By anchoring fees in actual direct costs, the regulation promotes fairness, sustainability, and accountability in public sector training initiatives.
