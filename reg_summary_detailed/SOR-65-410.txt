### **Detailed Summary of the Transitional Assistance Benefit Regulations (Canada, 1965)**

---

#### **Overview and Purpose**

The *Transitional Assistance Benefit Regulations* were enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Labour**, under authority granted by Parliament to defray public service costs effective from **April 1, 1965**. These regulations establish a **special benefit program** designed to provide financial support to workers in the **automotive manufacturing and parts industries** who became unemployed due to the implementation of the **Canada–United States Agreement on Automotive Products**, signed on **January 16, 1965**.

This program aims to **mitigate the adverse economic impact** of the agreement—particularly the shift in production and trade between Canada and the U.S.—by offering transitional financial assistance to displaced workers during a period of significant industrial restructuring.

The regulations are formally known as the **Transitional Assistance Benefit Regulations** and are administered by the **Unemployment Insurance Commission (Commission)** on behalf of the Minister of Labour.

### **Eligibility Criteria for Transitional Assistance Benefits**

An employee is eligible for transitional assistance benefits **only if** the following conditions are met:

1. **Qualifying Weeks Requirement**  
   - During the **52 weeks immediately preceding the Sunday before the effective date of lay-off**, the employee must have had **at least 16 qualifying weeks**.

2. **Effective Date of Lay-off**  
   - The lay-off must occur **after November 17, 1968**, and **before June 30, 1973**.

3. **Established or Terminated Unemployment Insurance Benefit Period**  
   - The employee must either:
     - Have an **established benefit period** under the Unemployment Insurance Act, or  
     - Have had a benefit period that **ended after the lay-off date**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: No benefits are payable for any week in which the employee receives **supplemental unemployment benefits**.

---

### **Duration of the Benefit Period**

- The transitional assistance benefit period **starts with the week of the effective date of lay-off** and ends on the **earlier of**:
  - When the employee exhausts all benefits under the program, or  
  - **156 weeks (3 years)** from the effective date of lay-off.

> ⚠️ **Exception**: For employees whose lay-off occurred **on or after April 2, 1966**, the benefit period is subject to a **minimum duration**:
> - A benefit period established between **April 2, 1966, and December 31, 1966**, shall **not be terminated before December 27, 1969**.

---

### **Calculation of Weekly Benefit Amount**

The weekly benefit is calculated as the **difference between**:
- The employee’s **maximum benefit entitlement**, and  
- The **highest of three amounts**:
  1. The weekly unemployment insurance benefit (including supplementary benefits),
  2. The weekly training allowance under the *Adult Occupational Training Act*, or  
  3. The **sum** of unemployment insurance, supplementary unemployment, and training allowances for the week.

> This ensures that the transitional benefit **does not exceed** the employee’s existing entitlements.

---

### **Maximum Benefit Entitlement (Section 10)**

The maximum weekly benefit is the **lesser of two amounts**:

1. **62% of previous earnings** + **2.5% per dependant** (up to a maximum of **75% of previous earnings**).  
   → Formula:  
   $$
   \text{Benefit} = 0.62 \times \text{Previous Earnings} + (0.025 \times \text{Number of Dependents})
   $$
   (Cap: 75% of previous earnings)

2. **65% of average weekly wages and salaries in the industries**  
   → Based on industry-wide averages (weighted by employment size).

> The maximum benefit entitlement is **fixed for the duration** of the benefit period and is **rounded to the nearest dollar** (with half-dollars rounded up).

---

### **Adjustments Based on Lay-off Proportion and Qualifying Weeks**

- If a certificate indicates that **only a portion** of the lay-off was due to the Automotive Agreement, the number of benefit weeks is **reduced in that proportion**.
- However, the **final number of weeks cannot fall below 4 weeks**.
- For **fractions of a week**, they are **treated as full weeks**.

> Example: If an employee has 20 qualifying weeks and the lay-off was 60% due to the agreement, the benefit weeks are reduced by 60%, resulting in 8 weeks (after rounding up to nearest full week).

  - Paragraph (b) of Section 54(2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act (if "suitable employment" is not comparable),

#### **Disqualification for False Statements**

---

### **Treatment of Disqualifications from Unemployment Insurance**

- If an employee is **disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits** during a transitional period:
  - The transitional assistance benefit **shall not exceed** what would have been paid had the disqualification not occurred.
- If the employee is **unemployed and not entitled to retirement pension** (e.g., under CPP or QPP), they are entitled to transitional assistance **starting from the week they apply** and make a claim for unemployment insurance benefits, **provided a benefit period is established**.

---
