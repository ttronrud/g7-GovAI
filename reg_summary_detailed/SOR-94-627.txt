### **Regulation Summary: Repeal of the New Brunswick Milk Order and Establishment of New Marketing Authority**

#### **1. Background and Purpose**
This regulation, issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, serves to:
- **Repeal** the outdated *New Brunswick Milk Order* (Order in Council P.C. 1984-3848, dated November 29, 1984).
- **Replace** it with a modern, comprehensive regulatory framework that grants authority to two key bodies—**the Farm Products Marketing Commission of New Brunswick** and the **New Brunswick Milk Marketing Board**—to regulate the **marketing of milk in interprovincial trade and in export markets**.

The goal is to ensure a consistent, efficient, and equitable system for managing milk marketing beyond provincial borders, while aligning with broader provincial and federal agricultural policies.

> ⚠️ *Note: This regulation was repealed in full by SOR/2001-16, section 24, meaning it is no longer in force as of 2001.*

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation establishes clear definitions of key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Acts** | Refers to the *Dairy Products Act* and the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of New Brunswick. These are the enabling legislation under which the Commission and Commodity Board operate. |
| **Commission** | The *Farm Products Marketing Commission*, established under the Farm Products Marketing Act. It has broad powers to oversee and regulate the marketing of farm products, including milk. |
| **Commodity Board** | The *New Brunswick Milk Marketing Board*, established under the Acts, specifically focused on milk marketing. It has specialized authority related to pricing, levies, and financial management. |
| **Milk** | Defined as milk or cream from cows produced in New Brunswick for **consumer use in liquid form in Canada**. This excludes non-consumer or non-liquid forms (e.g., butter, cheese, or powdered milk). |
| **Plan** | Any marketing plan established and amended over time under the Acts. These plans govern pricing, quotas, distribution, and other aspects of milk marketing. |

#### **3. Authority to Regulate Interprovincial and Export Marketing**

##### **Core Provision (Section 1):**
Subject to certain limitations, **both the Commission and the Commodity Board** are authorized to:
- Regulate the **marketing of milk in interprovincial trade** (i.e., trade between provinces) and **export trade** (i.e., sales outside Canada).
- With respect to persons and property located within New Brunswick, they may **exercise all or any powers** that are currently available to them under the Acts and a Plan **in relation to local marketing within the province**.

> 🔍 This means that the powers granted to these bodies for managing milk marketing *within New Brunswick* (such as setting prices, managing supply, and regulating sales) can be **extended to interprovincial and export markets**, provided the actions are consistent with the existing Plan and applicable legislation.

##### **Limitation (Section 2):**
The authority granted to the Commission and the Commodity Board **does NOT include** any power exercised by the **Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC)** under the *Canadian Dairy Commission Act* in relation to interprovincial milk marketing.

> 🚫 This ensures that **federal-level regulatory functions** (e.g., national pricing, quality standards, or trade agreements managed by the CDC) remain outside the scope of this provincial regulation. The provincial bodies are not empowered to override or duplicate federal responsibilities.

#### **4. Powers of the Commodity Board (Section 3)**

The Commodity Board is granted specific powers to manage financial aspects of milk marketing, including:

##### **(a) Levies and Charges:**
- Can **fix and impose levies or charges** on milk or its components (e.g., fat, protein).
- Can **classify producers or marketers** into different groups (e.g., small farms vs. large dairies).
- Can **set different levies or charges** for different groups based on size, volume, or type of operation.

> 💡 Example: A small farm might pay a lower levy than a large dairy farm, reflecting differences in scale and capacity.

##### **(b) Collection and Use of Levies:**
- May **collect** these levies directly from persons engaged in milk production or marketing (as defined in subsection 3(1)).
- Can **use the collected funds** for:
  - Creation of **reserves** (financial buffers for future market downturns),
  - Payment of **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred from milk sales or disposal,
  - **Equalization or adjustment** of income among milk producers to ensure fairness during periods of market volatility.

> ✅ This promotes **economic stability** and **fairness** among producers by smoothing out price fluctuations and compensating those who suffer losses due to market conditions.

---

#### **5. Legal Basis and Process**
- The regulation is issued under **subsections 2(1) and (2)** of the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*.
- The authority is derived from the **Farm Products Marketing Act** and the **Dairy Products Act**.
- All actions taken by the Commission or Commodity Board must be carried out **in accordance with a Plan** established and amended over time under these Acts.

> 🔁 The Plan acts as a dynamic framework that can be updated to reflect changing market conditions, supply dynamics, and producer needs.

#### **6. Key Implications and Outcomes**

| Implication | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Modernization of Milk Marketing** | Replaces an outdated 1984 order with a more flexible, transparent, and market-responsive system. |
| **Provincial Autonomy** | Grants New Brunswick control over its milk marketing policies in interprovincial and export markets, without duplicating federal functions. |
| **Equity Among Producers** | Through group-based levies and equalization mechanisms, the system aims to reduce disparities in income among producers. |
| **Financial Resilience** | Reserves and loss-sharing mechanisms protect producers during market downturns. |
| **Clear Boundaries with Federal Role** | Explicitly excludes the Canadian Dairy Commission’s powers, preventing overlap or conflict in national milk policy. |

---

#### **7. Status and Current Relevance**
- **Repealed**: This regulation was officially **repealed by SOR/2001-16, section 24**, on or after January 1, 2001.
- **No longer in force**: As of 2001, the authority described in this Order is no longer active.
- **Historical significance**: It represents a key moment in New Brunswick’s agricultural policy development, reflecting efforts to modernize and centralize milk marketing governance.

> ⚠️ While the regulation itself is now obsolete, its principles—such as producer equalization, levy structures, and interprovincial marketing authority—may have influenced later provincial or federal frameworks in dairy policy.

### ✅ Conclusion

It empowered the **Farm Products Marketing Commission** and the **New Brunswick Milk Marketing Board** to manage interprovincial and export trade with financial safeguards and equitable practices.
