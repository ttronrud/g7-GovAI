**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1982-15 and Designation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as Minister for the Standards Council of Canada

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to the provisions of the *Standards Council of Canada Act*.

**Legal Basis:**  
Section 2 of the *Standards Council of Canada Act* defines the role of the "Minister" for the purposes of the Act. This section empowers the Governor General in Council to designate a specific Minister as the Minister responsible for the Standards Council of Canada, thereby establishing the individual's authority to oversee the Council’s operations and governance.

**Key Actions in the Regulation:**

1. **Revocation of Previous Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally revokes Order in Council P.C. 1982-15, dated January 12, 1982. This earlier order had previously designated a different individual or mechanism as the Minister responsible for the Standards Council of Canada. By revoking it, the current regulation removes any prior designation or authority that may have been in place, ensuring that the designation is now updated to reflect the current governmental structure and responsibilities.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology:**  
   The Governor General in Council designates the **Minister of Industry, Science and Technology** as the "Minister" for the purposes of the *Standards Council of Canada Act*. This means that the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology is now officially responsible for:
   - Overseeing the operations and governance of the Standards Council of Canada;
   - Providing policy direction and administrative support;
   - Representing the Council in intergovernmental and public forums;
   - Ensuring alignment of the Council’s work with national standards and industrial policy objectives.

3. **Legal Effect:**  
   This designation is legally binding under the *Standards Council of Canada Act*. It establishes the Minister’s authority to:
   - Appoint and remove members of the Council’s executive and advisory bodies;
   - Approve the Council’s annual budget and financial plans;
   - Make decisions on matters related to the development, implementation, and enforcement of Canadian standards;
   - Exercise oversight and accountability in accordance with the Act.

4. **Purpose and Context:**  
   The change reflects a realignment of ministerial responsibilities in the Canadian government during the 1980s, particularly as the role of science, technology, and industrial standards became more integrated into national policy. By assigning responsibility to the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology, the government ensures that standards development is aligned with broader economic and technological priorities.

5. **Publication and Legal Notice:**  
   The regulation was published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on April 1, 1982 (Issue SI/82-28, page 424), which makes it officially available to the public and legally enforceable. This publication is a required step under Canadian statutory procedures to ensure transparency and legal validity.

**Significance of the Regulation:**

- It provides a clear, current, and legally recognized structure for the leadership of the Standards Council of Canada.
- It strengthens the connection between standards policy and the broader goals of industrial development, innovation, and scientific advancement.
- It ensures continuity and accountability in the governance of the Council by designating a specific minister responsible for its day-to-day operations and strategic direction.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation effectively modernizes and clarifies the ministerial responsibility for the Standards Council of Canada by revoking an outdated designation and formally appointing the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology as the designated Minister under the Act. It reflects a strategic government decision to align standards policy with the priorities of industry, science, and technological development in Canada.
