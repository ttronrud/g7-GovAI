**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Transfer of Control and Supervision of the Women’s Program within the Department of Employment and Immigration

**Authority:**  
The regulation is issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This authority is derived specifically from **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**. This legislative provision empowers the federal government to reorganize public service structures by transferring control, supervision, or responsibilities between departments or offices within the federal public service.

**Key Action:**  
The control and supervision of the **Women’s Program**—a specific component within the **Department of Employment and Immigration**—are being formally transferred to the **Office of the Coordinator, Status of Women**.

**Scope of Transfer:**  
- The transfer applies exclusively to the **Women’s Program**, which historically operated under the Department of Employment and Immigration.  
- The program’s administrative, operational, and policy-related functions are now placed under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Coordinator, Status of Women.  
- This includes all aspects of planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting, and resource allocation related to the Women’s Program.

**Rationale and Implication:**  
- The move reflects a strategic realignment to strengthen the federal government’s commitment to advancing gender equality and women’s rights.  
- By placing the Women’s Program under the Office of the Coordinator, Status of Women, it ensures that women’s issues are centrally coordinated, integrated into broader policy frameworks, and subject to consistent oversight.  
- This transfer enhances accountability, improves interdepartmental coordination, and aligns the program with the government’s broader gender-based policy priorities.

**Effective Date:**  
While not explicitly stated in the text, such transfers are typically effective immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon formal notification, unless otherwise specified.

**Significance:**  
This regulation represents a key step in the institutionalization of gender equality within the Canadian public service. It reflects a shift from a siloed, departmental approach to a more unified, cross-cutting strategy for advancing women’s status in employment, social policy, and public life.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation reorganizes a key component of the public service by transferring the Women’s Program from the Department of Employment and Immigration to the Office of the Coordinator, Status of Women. It is a formal, legally authorized action designed to improve the effectiveness, coherence, and strategic focus of federal efforts to promote gender equity.
