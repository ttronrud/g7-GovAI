**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Royal Canadian Mounted Police Case Examination Fees (Bermuda) Regulations**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

This regulation was issued by the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Solicitor General of Canada and the Treasury Board) under **section 19 of the Financial Administration Act**, specifically **paragraph 19(a)**, which empowers the government to make regulations regarding fees for services provided by federal institutions.

The regulation **revokes** an earlier Order in Council (P.C. 1980-14/2323 dated August 27, 1980), which had previously established fees for similar services. The current regulation establishes a new, updated framework for the **fees to be paid by the Commissioner of the Bermuda Police Force** for specific services provided by the **Forensic Laboratory Services** and **Identification Services** of the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**.

The core principle underlying this regulation is that **the cost of services provided by the RCMP should be borne directly by the users of those services**—in this case, the Bermuda Police Force.

### **Fees and Charges**

The regulation sets out **specific fees** that the Commissioner of the Bermuda Police Force must pay to the RCMP for different types of services:

#### 1. **Forensic Laboratory Services**
- **Fee:** CAD $1,000 per case examination  
- Applies when the RCMP conducts scientific analysis (e.g., toxicology, DNA, trace evidence, firearms, ballistics, etc.) on exhibits from a single investigation.

#### 2. **Identification Services**
- **Fee:** CAD $250 per case examination  
- Applies when the RCMP provides identification services (e.g., fingerprint analysis, facial recognition, or other identification processes) on exhibits from a single investigation.

> Note: Both services are charged **per case examination**, meaning each distinct investigative matter involving a set of exhibits constitutes one case.

#### 3. **Presence of an RCMP Member in Bermuda for Court Testimony**
- **Daily Fee:** CAD $175 per day  
  - Includes **travelling time** (e.g., time spent traveling to and from Bermuda).
- **Additional Costs Covered:**  
  - All **transportation, lodging, and meal expenses** incurred by the member during court appearances.  
  - These costs are reimbursed at **Government of Canada rates**, as specified in:
    - *Treasury Board Personnel Management Manual*,  
    - Chapter 370 (Personnel and Travel),  
    - Appendix C (dated April 1989), which outlines standard rates for travel and accommodation.

> This provision ensures that the Bermuda Police Force bears the full cost of RCMP personnel attending court to testify about services rendered.

### **Legal Basis**

- The regulation is made under **section 19 of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to:
  - Revise or repeal previous orders in council.
  - Make regulations concerning the fees for services provided by federal departments or agencies.
- Specifically, **paragraph 19(a)** authorizes the establishment of fees for services provided by federal institutions when those services are used by other entities.

---

### **Scope and Application**

- Applies **only to services rendered by the RCMP’s Forensic Laboratory Services and Identification Services**.
- Applies **only to investigations authorized and conducted by the Commissioner of the Bermuda Police Force**.
- Applies to **case examinations presented as part of a single investigation**—not to multiple or fragmented investigations.

### **Key Implications**

1. **Cost Accountability**:  
   - Reinforces the principle that users of public services (here, the Bermuda Police Force) are responsible for the cost of those services.

2. **Clarity and Transparency**:  
   - Provides clear, itemized fees for different types of services, reducing ambiguity and potential disputes.

3. **Travel and Expense Reimbursement**:  
   - Ensures that RCMP members are compensated fairly for time and expenses when testifying in court, while still keeping costs within a defined, government-approved framework.

4. **International Cooperation**:  
   - Facilitates cooperation between Canadian law enforcement and Bermuda’s police force through a transparent and predictable fee structure.

5. **Administrative Efficiency**:  
   - Simplifies billing and record-keeping for both the Bermuda Police Force and the RCMP.

### **Non-Publication in Canada Gazette Part II**

- The regulation is **not published in Part II of the Canada Gazette**, which typically contains official notices of federal legislation and orders.  
- This may indicate that the regulation is **internal in nature**, intended for administrative use rather than public announcement, or that it is a **non-noticeable amendment** to existing arrangements.  
- However, despite not being published, it remains **legally enforceable** due to being made under statutory authority.

### **Conclusion**

The *Royal Canadian Mounted Police Case Examination Fees (Bermuda) Regulations* establish a clear, fair, and transparent fee structure for services provided by the RCMP to the Bermuda Police Force. It ensures that:

- The cost of forensic and identification services is directly borne by the user (Bermuda Police),
- Fees are standardized and predictable,
- Travel and court-related expenses are properly reimbursed at government rates,
- And the relationship between Canadian and Bermudian law enforcement remains professional and cost-effective.

This regulation reflects a broader trend in Canadian public administration toward **user-pay models** for specialized services, promoting fiscal responsibility and accountability in intergovernmental cooperation.
