### 6. **Periods of Insurance and Creditability (Key Benefit Calculation Rules)**

These provisions govern how periods of insurance in one country are **credited** toward benefits in the other.

#### A. **Credit for Residency in the Other Country**
- **Under OASA**:
  - If a person is subject to **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** or a provincial comprehensive pension plan during a period of residence in **Luxembourg**, that period counts as **residence in Canada** — **for the person and their spouse/dependants** (if not subject to Luxembourg’s legislation due to employment).
  - Conversely, if a person is subject to **Luxembourg’s legislation due to employment** during residence in **Canada**, that period **does not count** as residence in Canada for the person or their dependants (unless they are covered under CPP or provincial plan).

#### B. **Creditability After Age of Eligibility**
- For **OASA benefits**, periods of residence in **Luxembourg after the age at which Canadian residence is creditable** are **counted as residence in Canada**.

#### C. **Years of Contributions (CPP)**
- A calendar year in which a person has **at least 67.5 days (three months)** of insurance under **Luxembourg’s legislation** is considered a **year of contribution** under the **Canada Pension Plan**.

#### D. **Creditability for Luxembourg Pensions**
- For **Luxembourg pensions** (old age, disability, survivorship):
  - Periods credited under **OASA** (completed before January 1, 1966) and **CPP** (completed after December 31, 1965) are considered **validly covered** under Luxembourg’s legislation.
  - This applies even if the person did not contribute directly to Luxembourg’s system.

> ✅ This allows **"totalizing"** of periods across both systems — a key mechanism in international social security.

#### E. **Proportional Credit for Childcare**
- Paragraph 3(b) applies analogously:
  - A period of insurance following the birth of a child is credited **only if** the insured person last completed insurance periods under **Luxembourg’s legislation**.

#### F. **Totalizing Periods from Third Countries**
- If a person has **insured periods in a third country** where both Canada and Luxembourg have an international social security agreement, those periods may be **added** to total insurance periods.
- **Only if** the Party has not objected within **three months** of the change.
