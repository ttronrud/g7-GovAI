**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Repeal and Designation of Minister under the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act and the Financial Administration Act

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to two key statutory provisions:

1. **Section 2 of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act (N-21)** – which defines the term “Minister” in relation to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).
2. **Paragraph (c.1)(b) of the definition “appropriate Minister” in Section 2 of the Financial Administration Act (F-11)** – which specifies the minister responsible for overseeing NSERC under financial administration rules.

**Regulatory Actions Taken:**

1. **Repeal of Prior Order in Council:**  
   The regulation formally repeals **Order in Council P.C. 2018-1011**, issued on July 18, 2018. This prior order had previously designated a different minister or arrangement for NSERC’s governance or financial oversight. By repealing it, the current regulation removes any previous designations or provisions that may have conflicted with or been superseded by this new appointment.

2. **Designation of the Minister of Industry as the Minister for NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act):**  
   The Minister of Industry is officially designated as the **"Minister"** for the purposes of the *Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Act*. This means that the Minister of Industry now has the statutory authority and responsibility under the NSERC Act to:
   - Oversee the governance, administration, and strategic direction of NSERC;
   - Approve funding decisions, program initiatives, and policy directions;
   - Exercise ministerial powers related to the council’s operations and funding allocations.

3. **Designation of the Minister of Industry as the "Appropriate Minister" under the Financial Administration Act:**  
   The Minister of Industry is also designated as the **"appropriate Minister"** with respect to NSERC under the *Financial Administration Act*. This designation grants the Minister of Industry specific financial and administrative responsibilities, including:
   - Oversight of NSERC’s financial operations;
   - Approval of expenditures and financial reporting;
   - Ensuring compliance with federal financial administration rules and accountability standards;
   - Acting as the point of contact for financial governance and budgetary matters involving NSERC.

**Purpose and Significance:**

- This regulation consolidates and clarifies the ministerial responsibility for NSERC by aligning it with the current federal government structure.
- It reflects a strategic realignment of responsibilities, likely in response to evolving priorities in science and innovation policy, where the Ministry of Industry plays a central role in supporting technological advancement and research commercialization.
- By designating the Minister of Industry, the government ensures that NSERC’s operations are integrated within a broader national strategy for industrial innovation, economic growth, and scientific advancement.
