### 6. **Dual Coverage and Period Totalization**

> **Core Mechanism**: Insurance periods completed under one country’s system can be **totalized** with those under the other to meet eligibility requirements.

#### a. **Totalization Rules**
- When disability or retirement occurs:
  - Insurance or assimilated periods from both countries are **combined** (totalized) to meet minimum requirements.
  - Totalization applies to:
    - **Eligibility for disability benefits**

> ⚖️ **No overlap** is allowed in the calculation of periods.

#### b. **Disability Benefits**

  - Benefit is determined and paid under the **law of the state where the person was subject** at the time.
  - The Canadian authority considers totalized periods when calculating the benefit.

- If disability occurs in **France**:
  - Benefit is determined under **both national laws**.
  - However, if eligibility is **only established under Canadian law**, Canada is **not required** to pay the benefit in France.

> 📢 **Notification Requirement**: The paying institution must **notify** the other country’s authority if a pension is suspended or cancelled.

> 🔄 **Reinstatement**: If the insured person regains eligibility, benefits resume with the original authority.

> 🏥 **New Disability Case**: If health status permits, a new disability pension is granted under **Article X** rules.

### 7. **Old Age and Survivor Benefits – Rules of Determination**

#### a. **When Eligibility is Met in Both Countries**
- Each country determines its **own benefit amount** based on its own legislation.
- Each considers only the insurance periods completed under its own law.

#### b. **When Eligibility is Not Met in Either Country**
- **Totalization of periods** is applied to determine eligibility.
- The benefit is calculated based on:
  - The **total insurance periods** (real and assimilated) from both countries.
  - The **ratio** of periods completed under each country’s legislation.

> ✅ **Formula for Benefit Payment**:
>  
> Benefit payable =  
> (Amount of benefit if all periods were under one country) ×  
> (Ratio of periods completed under that country / Total of both countries)

> Example: If 60% of total periods were completed in Canada, 40% in France → 60% of the Canadian benefit amount is paid.

#### c. **Minimum Period Requirement**
- If **less than one year** of insurance periods are completed under one country’s legislation:
  - The country **does not have to pay** benefits based on those periods.
  - However, those periods **can still be used** to meet eligibility requirements under the other country’s law (via totalization).

> ⚠️ **Exception**: If those periods alone meet eligibility, the benefit is **definitively determined** based on that country’s law.

> This is a **critical provision** affecting eligibility for Old Age Security (OAS).

#### a. **Residence in France (by Canadian nationals)**
- If a Canadian is subject to French legislation during a period of residence in France:

  - **Exception**: If the spouse or dependent is employed in France, that period **does not count** as residence in Canada.
