### **Powers Granted to the Commodity Board and Supervisory Board**

The Order grants both the **Commodity Board** and the **Supervisory Board** broad powers to regulate the marketing of blueberries in **interprovincial and export trade**, with full authority over persons and property located within New Brunswick. These powers are **aligned with their existing powers** to regulate local blueberry marketing under the *Agricultural Products Marketing Act*.

#### **1. Authority to Fix, Impose, and Collect Levies or Charges**

- The boards may:
  - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities engaged in:
    - The **production** of blueberries in New Brunswick
    - The **marketing** of blueberries (including sale, distribution, or export)
- They may **classify producers or marketers into different groups** (e.g., small farmers, large cooperatives, exporters, etc.).
- Each group may be assigned **different levies or charges**, based on factors such as:
  - Volume of production
  - Market channel (local, interprovincial, export)
  - Type of operation
- This allows for **proportionate and equitable** financial contributions from different stakeholders.

#### **2. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies or charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to manage market volatility or future price instability)
- **Payment of operational expenses** related to blueberry marketing (e.g., marketing campaigns, transportation, quality control)
- **Reimbursement of losses** arising from:
  - The sale or disposal of blueberries
  - Market downturns or unexpected price drops
- **Equalization or adjustment of income** among blueberry producers:
  - If certain producers receive less revenue due to market fluctuations, the system can distribute funds to ensure a more equitable return across the sector
  - This helps protect small producers who may be disadvantaged in competitive or volatile markets
