**Detailed Summary of the CHFTA Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order**

---

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 49.6(9)a of the Customs Tariff** (commonly referred to as the *Customs Tariff* or *Tariff Act*). This provision enables the government to establish quantity limits on certain imported goods that are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under a free trade agreement.

The regulation is specifically tied to the **Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (CHFTA)**, which was enacted as **S.C. 2014, c. 14**, and is further referenced in **Section 43** of that Act. The regulation is also supported by prior legislation, including **S.C. 1997, c. 36**, which provides the foundational framework for tariff preferences and related administrative measures.

**2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this **Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order** is to **set and enforce aggregate quantity limits** on specific sugar-related goods that are entitled to the **preferential tariff treatment from Honduras** under the CHFTA. These limits are designed to:

- Prevent over-reliance on Honduran sugar imports,
- Ensure fair market access for Canadian producers,
- Maintain the integrity of the trade agreement by managing the volume of subsidized or preferential goods,
- Comply with international trade obligations and Canada’s trade policy objectives.

**3. Scope of the Tariff Items Covered**

The Order applies to goods falling under the following **Harmonized System (HS) tariff item numbers**:

- **1701.91.10** – Sugar, refined, in granular form, not elsewhere specified or included  
- **1701.99.10** – Sugar, refined, in other forms (e.g., powdered, crystallized), not elsewhere specified or included  
- **1702.90.21** – Sugar, refined, in granular form, used in food or feed, not elsewhere specified or included  
- **1702.90.61** – Sugar, refined, in granular form, used in food or feed, not elsewhere specified or included  
- **1702.90.70** – Sugar, refined, in granular form, used in food or feed, not elsewhere specified or included  
- **1702.90.81** – Sugar, refined, in granular form, used in food or feed, not elsewhere specified or included  

These items are all classified as refined sugar and are subject to preferential tariff treatment under the CHFTA when imported from Honduras.

> **Note**: The items are grouped under the broader category of refined sugar, and the Order applies to all goods that fall within these HS codes and are eligible for the Honduras tariff.

**4. Aggregate Quantity Limit Mechanism**

- The **aggregate quantity limit** refers to the **total volume (in metric tonnes or equivalent units)** of these sugar goods that may be imported into Canada from Honduras during a specified period.
- For each specified period (as listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**), the **applicable aggregate quantity limit** (as listed in **Column 2 of the Schedule**) is set.
- The "aggregate" nature of the limit means that **all the listed tariff items are combined**, and the total value or quantity of these goods from Honduras cannot exceed the specified limit during the period.

> This prevents any single supplier or group of suppliers from exceeding a threshold, which helps to maintain balance in the Canadian market and protect domestic producers.

---

**5. Effective Date and Registration Timeline**

- The Order comes into force on the **day that Section 43 of the Canada–Honduras Economic Growth and Prosperity Act (S.C. 2014, c. 14) comes into force**.
- However, if the regulation is **registered (published in the Canada Gazette) after that date**, it will instead come into force on the **day of registration**.

> This provision ensures that the Order is implemented in a timely manner, with a clear transition from the enabling legislation to the actual regulatory measure.

**6. Official Publication and Enforcement**

- The regulation is published in the **Supplement to the Canada Gazette (SI/2014-74)**.
- It was **first published on October 1, 2014**, and came into force on that date.
- The Order is enforceable by Canadian customs authorities and must be respected by importers, traders, and customs brokers when declaring sugar goods from Honduras.

---

**7. Key Implications**

- **Importers** must ensure that their total volume of sugar imports from Honduras under these tariff items does not exceed the aggregate limit for the relevant period.
- **Exceeding the limit** may result in:
  - Non-compliance with customs regulations,
  - Penalties or fines,
  - Rejection of shipments,
  - Loss of preferential tariff treatment (i.e., the goods may be subject to higher duties).
- The limits are **periodic** and are typically reviewed and updated annually or as needed to reflect market conditions and trade agreements.

---

**8. Legal and Policy Context**

This Order is part of a broader framework under the CHFTA, which aims to:

- Promote economic growth in both Canada and Honduras,
- Strengthen bilateral trade ties,
- Encourage investment and sustainable development,
- Ensure that preferential access to Canadian markets is used responsibly and fairly.

By imposing quantity limits, Canada ensures that the benefits of the trade agreement are not exploited to the detriment of domestic industries, particularly in the sugar sector.

**Conclusion**

The **CHFTA Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Order** is a targeted, legally binding regulation that establishes specific volume restrictions on refined sugar imports from Honduras under the CHFTA. It ensures fair competition, protects domestic producers, and maintains the integrity of Canada’s trade policy. The regulation is effective from October 1, 2014, and applies to all refined sugar goods under the specified tariff headings, with limits defined by time periods and aggregate quantities.

This measure exemplifies how trade agreements are implemented with both economic benefits and regulatory safeguards to ensure balanced and sustainable trade flows.
