**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Instrument**
**Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Dehcho Region) Order*  
**Legal Citation:** R.S., c. T-7 (Territorial Lands Act)  
**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development  

**Legal Basis:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which empowers the government to withdraw certain tracts of territorial land from disposal for specific purposes, including the implementation of Aboriginal land and resource agreements.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of land in the Dehcho Region of the Northwest Territories from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of disposition) for a period of **two years**. This action is intended to **facilitate the negotiation, settlement, and implementation of Aboriginal land and resource agreements** between the Government of Canada and the Dehcho First Nations.

These agreements typically involve the recognition of traditional territories, the establishment of land rights, and the sharing of natural resource benefits—particularly in areas of significant cultural, historical, and economic importance.

---

### **Scope of Withdrawal**
The Order withdraws the following tracts from disposal:

1. **Schedule 1 Tracts**  
   - Includes **both surface and subsurface rights** to the land.  
   - These are the core tracts being protected from disposal to support land claims and agreements.

2. **Schedule 2 Tracts**  
   - Includes **only subsurface rights** (i.e., mineral rights, not surface rights).  
   - These are withdrawn specifically for subsurface rights to allow for negotiations related to mineral resources.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:** The withdrawal applies **only to disposal** (such as leasing or selling), not to other forms of land use or administrative actions.

---

### **Duration of Withdrawal**
- The withdrawal is effective for a period of **two years**, beginning on the day the Order is made.
- After this period, the tracts will revert to being available for disposal unless extended by further legislative or administrative action.

---

### **Exclusions from the Withdrawal (Section 2 Exemptions)**  
The Order explicitly **does not apply** to the following activities, meaning these actions are **not blocked or affected** by the withdrawal:

1. **Disposal of substances or materials under the Territorial Quarrying Regulations**  
   - Quarrying activities and related disposals remain unaffected.

2. **Interests in land listed in the Acquisition Agreement dated May 5, 1988**  
   - This agreement involves the Government of Canada and the Northwest Territories, Northern Canada Power Commission, and Northwest Territories Power Corporation.  
   - Any land interests under this agreement remain outside the scope of this withdrawal.

3. **Mineral claims and related activities** (with specific exclusions):
   - **Locating a mineral claim** by a holder of a prospecting permit issued **before** the Order came into force.
   - **Recording a mineral claim** that was already located or referred to in paragraph (a) and was made before the Order came into force.
   - **Granting a lease** to a person with a recorded mineral claim (under the Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations), **if the lease covers an area within the recorded claim**.
   - **Issuance of a significant discovery licence** under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before** the Order, **if the licence covers the same area** as the exploration licence.
   - **Issuance of a production licence** to a holder of a significant discovery licence (as above), **if the production licence covers the same area**.
   - **Issuance of a production licence** to a holder of an exploration or significant discovery licence issued **before** the Order, **if the production licence covers the same area**.
   - **Issuance of a surface lease** to a claim holder (under mining regulations or petroleum interests) **to enable exercise of rights** under the claim or interest.
   - **Renewal of an interest** (e.g., mineral rights or exploration interests) already in place prior to the Order.

> These exclusions ensure that **existing rights and ongoing exploration or development activities are not disrupted** by the withdrawal, preserving continuity in the mineral sector.

### **Repeal Clause (Land Map References)**  
This section is a **repeal provision** that formally removes or invalidates certain previously recorded land parcels from the official land records in the Northwest Territories.

Specifically, it repeals (i.e., removes from legal effect) all parcels of land shown as:

- **Surface-Subsurface Lands** or  
- **Subsurface Only Lands**

on the following **1:250,000 reference maps**, which were:

1. Produced by the Department of Natural Resources  
2. Signed by representatives of the **Dehcho First Nations** and the **Government of Canada** (specifically the Chief Lands Negotiator or Assistant Negotiator)  
3. Filed at the **Federal Claims Office** (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) in Yellowknife  
4. Deposited with the **Regional Manager, Land Administration**, Yellowknife

The maps are referenced by the **negotiator pair** and the **date of signing**, indicating that these land parcels were part of formal land negotiation processes. The repeal ensures that these specific parcels are no longer recognized in official land administration records as being subject to disposal, reinforcing the protection of land rights under the Aboriginal agreements.

#### List of Maps Repealed:
| Type of Land | Signatories |
|-------------|-------------|
| Surface-Subsurface Lands | Herb Norwegian (Dehcho) & Eddie Kolausok (Canada) |
| Surface-Subsurface Lands | Ria Letcher (Dehcho) & Michael Walsh (Canada) |
| Surface-Subsurface Lands | Georges Erasmas (Dehcho) & Janet Pound (Canada) |
| Subsurface Only Lands | Herb Norwegian & Eddie Kolausok |
| Subsurface Only Lands | Ria Letcher & Michael Walsh |
| Subsurface Only Lands | Georges Erasmas & Janet Pound |

> The repeal is significant because it **formally removes these tracts from the land registry**, thereby protecting them from future disposal and reinforcing their status as part of settled Aboriginal land agreements.

### **Key Implications and Significance**

1. **Aboriginal Rights Protection**  
   The Order strengthens the legal framework for **Aboriginal land rights** in the Dehcho Region by ensuring that key tracts are not subject to sale, lease, or development without prior agreement with the Dehcho First Nations.

2. **Support for Land and Resource Agreements**  
   This withdrawal provides a **stable and predictable environment** for negotiations and implementation of land-use and resource-sharing agreements, which are essential for reconciliation and self-determination.

3. **Mineral Sector Continuity**  
   The exemptions protect **existing exploration and development activities**, ensuring that companies and Indigenous claim holders can continue operations without legal interruption.

4. **Formal Recognition of Negotiated Outcomes**  
   The repeal of specific land parcels in official records **legally formalizes the outcome of negotiations**, affirming that these lands are not open for disposal and are instead governed by the terms of the agreements.

5. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The inclusion of signed maps and negotiators enhances transparency, showing that these land protections are the result of **formal, documented, and mutually agreed processes** involving Indigenous leadership and federal officials.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **strategic and legally grounded measure** to protect and advance the rights of the Dehcho First Nations in the Northwest Territories. By withdrawing specific tracts of land (surface and subsurface) from disposal for two years, it creates a **temporary but meaningful pause** in land dispossession, enabling the resolution of land and resource agreements. The exclusions ensure that ongoing exploration and development activities are not disrupted, while the formal repeal of land parcels in official records provides **legal certainty and recognition** of Indigenous land rights.

This Order reflects Canada’s commitment to **Indigenous self-determination, land rights, and reconciliation**, particularly in the context of resource development and land governance in northern Canada.
