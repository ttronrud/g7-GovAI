**Detailed Summary of the Extra-billing and User Charges Information Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Purpose**

These regulations, formally titled the *Extra-billing and User Charges Information Regulations* (S.C. 1984, c. 6), were enacted under the authority of **paragraph 22(1)(c) of the Canada Health Act** and based on consultations between the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** and the **provincial health ministers**.

The primary objective of these regulations is to ensure **transparency, accountability, and compliance** with the principles of the Canada Health Act—particularly those related to **access to health services without user charges**—by establishing a clear framework for how provinces must report information about **extra-billing** and **user charges**.

This reporting mechanism enables the federal government to monitor whether provinces are adhering to the Act’s requirement that health services be provided **without financial barriers** to patients, except in very limited, explicitly authorized cases.

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canada Health Act*, which sets out the federal framework for health care delivery in Canada.
- **Minister**: The Minister of National Health and Welfare, responsible for overseeing federal compliance with the Canada Health Act.
- **Fiscal Year**: Defined as the period from **April 1 to March 31** of the following year. This is the standard accounting period used in the regulations.

### **Types of Information Required Under Paragraph 13(a) of the Canada Health Act**

#### **1. Extra-billing Information**
*Extra-billing* refers to charges made by a health care provider beyond the standard cost of services, such as fees for services not covered under the public health insurance plan.

The Minister may require provinces to provide two types of information regarding extra-billing:

- **Estimate of Aggregate Extra-billing**  
  - A projection of the total amount expected to be charged through extra-billing during the fiscal year.  
  - Must include a **clear explanation** of how this estimate was calculated (e.g., methodology, assumptions, data sources).

- **Financial Statement of Actual Extra-billing**  
  - A record of the **actual total amount** charged through extra-billing during the fiscal year.  
  - Must include a **detailed explanation** of how the actual amount was determined (e.g., billing records, audits, reconciliation processes).

> These reports apply to all extra-billing in the province, regardless of whether it is directly tied to specific services or administrative costs.

---

#### **2. User Charges Information**
*User charges* are fees charged to patients for specific health services, which are allowed under the Act only when they fall under **section 19** of the Canada Health Act.

Section 19 permits user charges **only for services that are not covered by public health insurance**, such as certain dental, vision, or prescription drug services, and only if they are **non-discriminatory, clearly defined, and justified**.

The Minister may require provinces to provide:

- **Estimate of Aggregate User Charges (under Section 19)**  
  - A projected total amount expected to be charged for user charges applicable under section 19.  
  - Must include an explanation of the method used to determine the estimate.

- **Financial Statement of Actual User Charges (under Section 19)**  
  - A statement of the actual total amount collected for user charges under section 19.  
  - Must include a detailed explanation of how the actual amount was calculated.

> This ensures that provinces are not charging user fees in violation of the Act, and that any such charges are properly justified and limited to services explicitly permitted by law.

### **Timing and Submission Requirements**

The province is required to submit the required information at specific times:

| Type of Information | Submission Deadline |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Estimates** (for both extra-billing and user charges) | **Before April 1** of the fiscal year to which they relate |
| **Financial Statements** (actual charges) | **Before the 16th day of the 21st month** after the end of the fiscal year |

> Example:  
> - For a fiscal year ending March 31, 1986:  
>   - Estimate must be submitted **before April 1, 1986**  
>   - Financial statement must be submitted **before the 16th day of May 1987** (the 21st month after March 31, 1986)

> This timing ensures that the federal government receives timely data to assess compliance with the Canada Health Act and to conduct oversight throughout the year.

---

### **Adjustments to Estimates**

- Provinces may, **at their discretion**, submit **adjustments** to their initial estimates of extra-billing or user charges **before February 16** of the fiscal year.
- These adjustments allow provinces to refine their projections based on early data, changes in policy, or operational developments.
- Adjustments must be clearly explained and submitted in a timely manner.

---

### **Method of Transmission**

- The information must be transmitted to the Minister by the **most practical means of communication** available (e.g., email, secure portal, postal mail, etc.).
- The term “most practical” implies a balance between efficiency, security, and accessibility, ensuring that the federal government receives the data in a timely and reliable manner.

---

### **Legal Basis and Enforcement**

- These regulations are issued under **paragraph 22(1)(c) of the Canada Health Act**, which grants the Minister of National Health and Welfare the authority to make regulations to implement the Act.
- The requirement to provide information is **mandatory** and forms part of the federal government’s oversight mechanism to ensure that provinces uphold the core principles of the Canada Health Act—particularly **universal access, comprehensiveness, and public funding**.
- Failure to comply with these reporting requirements may be subject to investigation or enforcement action by the federal government.

### **Significance and Impact**

1. **Enforcement of Health Equity**  
   By requiring detailed reporting on extra-billing and user charges, the regulations help prevent the creation of financial barriers to health care access, ensuring that services remain accessible to all Canadians regardless of income.

2. **Transparency and Accountability**  
   The requirement for both estimates and actual financial statements promotes transparency in how provinces manage health service funding and billing practices.

3. **Provincial Compliance Monitoring**  
   The federal government can use this data to identify provinces where user charges or extra-billing may be inconsistent with the Canada Health Act, allowing for targeted interventions or policy adjustments.

4. **Legal and Policy Clarity**  
   The regulations clarify what constitutes allowable user charges under section 19 and establish a consistent, standardized reporting process across all provinces.

### **Effective Date**

The regulations came into force on **April 1, 1986**, marking the beginning of a formalized federal monitoring system for billing practices in provincial health care.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Extra-billing and User Charges Information Regulations* serve as a critical enforcement tool under the Canada Health Act. They establish a clear, structured, and time-bound reporting framework for provinces to disclose information on extra-billing and user charges. By requiring detailed estimates and financial statements, the regulations promote transparency, ensure compliance with health care access principles, and support the federal government’s role in safeguarding the integrity of Canada’s universal health care system.

These regulations remain a foundational element in Canada’s ongoing efforts to maintain equitable, accessible, and publicly funded health care for all Canadians.
