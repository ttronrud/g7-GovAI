### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Status of the Regulation**
- The regulation in question has been **fully repealed**.
- It was **repealed by SOR/2011-87, section 11**, which is a statutory instrument (SOR = Statutory Instrument) published in 2011.
- The repeal is repeated 114 times in the list, which is likely due to a formatting or data duplication error — such repetition does not indicate multiple distinct regulations but rather confirms the same repeal event.
- Additionally, one entry notes **revocation under SOR/88-201, section 6**, which may indicate that a prior version or related provision was also revoked earlier (in 1988), but this appears to be a separate or overlapping action.

#### 2. **Legal Effect**

#### 3. **Context and Implications**
- The regulation was likely part of a broader legislative framework related to **public safety, licensing, environmental standards, or administrative procedures** — though the specific subject matter is not provided.
- The fact that it was repealed in 2011 suggests it may have been outdated, inconsistent with new legislation, or superseded by a more modern or comprehensive regulation.
- The earlier revocation under SOR/88-201 (1988) may indicate that the regulation or its predecessor was already obsolete or withdrawn prior to 2011.
