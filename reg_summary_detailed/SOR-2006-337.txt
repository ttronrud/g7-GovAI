### **Overview**

These regulations implement **Section 10 of the Library and Archives of Canada Act (LACA)**, which establishes a legal deposit system. Under this system, certain publishers in Canada are required to provide copies of their publications to the **Library and Archives of Canada (LAC)** to ensure national preservation and access to Canada’s cultural and informational heritage.

The regulations provide detailed rules on:
- Who qualifies as a publisher,
- What types of publications are subject to legal deposit,
- How many copies must be provided,
- What content and technical information must accompany the deposit,
- And specific obligations related to digital and non-traditional media.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to the *Library and Archives of Canada Act*, the enabling legislation that provides the legal basis for legal deposit.

2. **Publisher**  
   Defined as a person who:
   - Makes a publication available in Canada,  
   - Is authorized to reproduce the publication, or  
   - Controls the content of the publication.  
   
   **Important Note**: A person who only *distributes* a publication (without creating or controlling its content) is *not* considered a publisher under these regulations.

### **Obligations for Publishers When Providing a Copy to LAC**

To ensure that digital and non-paper publications can be accessed and preserved by the Library and Archives of Canada, publishers must comply with the following requirements **before** and **when** providing a copy:

#### **Before Providing a Copy (Pre-Deposit Requirements)**

- **Decrypt encrypted data**: Any data in the publication that is encrypted must be decrypted so that the LAC can access it.
- **Remove or disable access restrictions**: Any security systems, software, or devices (e.g., DRM, passwords, firewalls) designed to restrict or limit access to the publication must be removed or disabled.

> *Purpose*: Ensures that the content is accessible and usable for preservation and research purposes.

#### **When Providing a Copy (Deposit Requirements)**

Publishers must provide the following materials along with the publication:

1. **Software necessary to access the publication**  
   - A copy of any software specifically created by the publisher that is required to open or interact with the publication (e.g., proprietary software for digital media).

2. **Technical or other information necessary to access the publication**  
   - Includes:
     - Technical specifications (e.g., file format, resolution, compatibility)
     - User manuals or guides
     - Any documentation accompanying the publication

3. **Descriptive data about the publication**  
   - Must include at least the following elements:
     - Title  
     - Creator(s) (author, artist, etc.)  
     - Language  
     - Date of publication  
     - Format (e.g., digital, print, audio)  
     - Subject matter  
     - Copyright information  

> *Purpose*: Enables LAC to catalog, preserve, and provide access to the publication in a structured and searchable way.

### **Classes of Publications Requiring Only One Copy**

Under these regulations, **only one copy** is required to be deposited for the following categories — *unless the publication also falls into a category requiring two copies* (e.g., under section 4):

1. **Musical sound recordings**  
2. **Multi-media publications** consisting of two or more physical parts in different formats (e.g., a book with a CD and a DVD)  
3. **Publications with fewer than 100 copies produced**  
4. **Publications produced on demand** from a master copy where fewer than 100 copies were made  
5. **Online publications** (digital content delivered via the internet)

> *Note*: Even though only one copy is required, the publisher still must comply with the full access and descriptive data requirements.

---

### **Classes of Publications Requiring Two Copies (On Written Request)**

For the following categories, **two copies are required only upon a written request from the Librarian and Archivist** — meaning that the publisher is not automatically required to provide two copies.

   - Have **no Canadian content** or major Canadian contributor (e.g., composer, artist, lyricist, performer, writer, producer)

   - Prevents redundant deposits of minor updates or reprints.

### **Repeal Clause**

This section indicates that the regulations are being issued in place of previous versions or provisions and that any prior conflicting rules are repealed. It reflects a modernization and clarification of the legal deposit framework.

### **Purpose and Significance**

These regulations serve several key functions:

- **Preservation of Canada’s cultural heritage** by ensuring that diverse forms of publications — especially digital and ephemeral ones — are preserved.
- **Accessibility** by requiring that technical and descriptive data be provided, enabling researchers and the public to find and use the materials.
- **Clarity and practicality** by distinguishing between different types of publications and setting appropriate deposit obligations based on their nature and scope.
- **Balance between rights and access** — while ensuring that the public and institutions have access to Canadian publications, it also respects the intellectual property and commercial interests of publishers, especially in cases involving rare, limited, or non-commercial works.

### **Key Takeaways for Publishers**

- **You are a publisher** if you control the content or are authorized to reproduce the work — not just if you distribute it.
- **Digital content must be decrypted and made accessible** to LAC.
- **Technical documentation and descriptive metadata are mandatory**.
- **Fewer than 100 copies?** One copy is sufficient.
- **Fewer than four copies?** Two copies are only required if requested.
- **Limited or non-commercial publications** (e.g., student theses, local newsletters) are exempt from automatic two-copy obligations.
- **Online content and digital media** are fully covered and require full technical access.
