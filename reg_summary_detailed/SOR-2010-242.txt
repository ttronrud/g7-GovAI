#### **4. When Electronic Documents Do Not Need to Be Sent to a Designated System**

2. The **addressee is given written notice** (in paper or electronic form) of the document’s availability and its location.

> *Example:* A cooperative posts a financial statement on its official website. It sends a notice to members stating where and when the document is available. No direct transmission to a private system is required.
