**Detailed Summary of the GM Loan Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Authority**

The *GM Loan Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** and the **Treasury Board**, under **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote L35 of the Appropriation Act No. 2, 1983–84**. This legislative authority enabled the government to authorize a specific loan to General Motors of Canada Limited (GM) as part of a broader industrial development strategy.

These regulations are formally cited as the **GM Loan Regulations** and are part of the legislative framework governing public financial support for key industrial projects.

### **Key Definitions**

- **GM**: Refers to *General Motors of Canada Limited*, a Canadian corporation incorporated under Canadian law.
- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion**, responsible for overseeing the allocation and conditions of the loan.
- **Renaissance Project**: A major industrial initiative focused on the **modernization and expansion of the GM manufacturing facility in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec**. This project was central to the rationale for the loan.

---

### **Loan Authorization and Limit**

- The Minister is authorized to provide a **loan to GM** under these regulations.
- The **maximum loan amount** is **$110,000,000 CAD**.
- This limit is subject to the conditions outlined in **Sections 4 and 5** of the regulations, which may impose additional restrictions or requirements on the disbursement of funds.

### **Terms and Conditions of the Loan**

#### 1. **Loan Structure and Maturity**
- The loan is a **term loan**, meaning it is provided for a fixed period with scheduled repayment.
- The loan is **due and payable on April 1, 2017**. This establishes a clear maturity date, ensuring the government receives repayment at a defined point in time.

#### 2. **Interest Rate**
- The loan is **interest-free** under normal circumstances.
- In the event of **default** (i.e., failure to meet contractual or reporting obligations), the loan will bear interest at the **lowest rate of interest charged by the Federal Business Development Bank (FBDB)** on its term loans.
- This mechanism provides a safeguard for the government, ensuring that interest is only incurred if the borrower fails to meet its obligations.

#### 3. **Early Partial Repayment Condition**
- A **partial early repayment of $37,500,000** is required to be made by **April 1, 1991**, **if** General Motors does **not provide assurances** to the Minister by **December 31, 1990** that the Sainte-Thérèse facility will continue to operate.
- This condition is designed to ensure that the government’s investment is tied to the **long-term viability and operational continuity** of the GM plant in Sainte-Thérèse.
- If GM fails to give such assurances, the government is entitled to a prepayment, which reduces the outstanding loan balance and mitigates risk.

---

### **Reporting Obligations**

- GM is required to submit **quarterly progress reports** to the Minister detailing:
  - Expenditures made by GM in relation to the **Renaissance Project**.
- These reports serve as a mechanism for **transparency, accountability, and oversight**, allowing the government to monitor how the loan funds are being used and whether the project is progressing as planned.

---

### **Purpose and Strategic Rationale**

The primary objective of the GM Loan Regulations is to support the **economic development of Quebec**, particularly through the revitalization of a key automotive manufacturing site in Sainte-Thérèse. By providing a substantial, interest-free loan tied to performance and operational commitments, the government aims to:

- Prevent plant closures or job losses in a critical industrial region.
- Encourage investment in modernization and expansion to improve competitiveness.
- Ensure that public funds are used only when there is a credible commitment to long-term operations.

### **Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **$110M cap** | Limits exposure and ensures fiscal responsibility. |
| **Interest-free loan** | Encourages investment without immediate financial burden on GM. |
| **Default interest clause** | Protects public funds in case of non-compliance. |
| **Early repayment trigger** | Links funding to operational sustainability, reducing risk. |
| **Quarterly reporting** | Ensures accountability and transparency. |

### **Conclusion**

The *GM Loan Regulations* represent a targeted form of **public-private partnership** in industrial policy. They provide a structured, conditional financial instrument to support the modernization of a major Canadian manufacturing facility. The regulations balance the need to stimulate industrial growth with strong safeguards to protect public funds and ensure that the investment leads to sustainable operations.

The loan is not a general grant or subsidy but a **performance-based, time-bound financial commitment**, reflecting the government’s strategic focus on regional economic development and industrial resilience in the 1980s.

> **Note**: The maturity date of **April 1, 2017**, is historically significant — it was over 25 years after the regulations were enacted, indicating that the loan was likely structured with a long-term horizon, possibly reflecting the long lead times of industrial modernization projects. The early repayment condition (1991) suggests that the government was concerned about potential plant closures during the 1990s, a period of significant industrial restructuring in Canada.

This regulation is a historical example of how governments used targeted lending to support key industrial projects, with built-in conditions to ensure accountability and long-term economic benefits.
