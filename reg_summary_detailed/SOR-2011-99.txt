### **Overview**

The *Registered Products Regulations*, made under the authority of several key Canadian financial regulations—including sections of the *Bank Act*, *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, and *Trust and Loan Companies Act*—establish clear, standardized requirements for how financial institutions must communicate information about **registered products** to individuals in Canada. These regulations aim to ensure that consumers receive **clear, simple, and non-misleading information** when opening or entering into agreements related to registered retirement, education, disability, and other eligible savings plans.

The regulations came into force on **November 1, 2011**, and are designed to improve consumer understanding, transparency, and access to key financial product details—particularly in the context of registered plans governed by the Income Tax Act.

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Institution**  
   - Refers to either:
     - A *retail association* as defined in Section 2 of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*, or  
     - A *company* as defined in Section 2 of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*.  
   - *Note:* This definition was previously subject to repeal (SOR/2021-181, s. 112), but as of the current version of the regulations, it remains in force in its original form.

2. **Point of Service**  
   - A physical location where the public can access an institution and where it provides registered products through a natural person (individual) in Canada.  
   - Includes branches, offices, or other accessible physical sites where products are offered.

---

### **Definition of "Registered Product"**

A **registered product** is any financial plan, arrangement, or fund that:
- Is governed by **Division G of Part I of the Income Tax Act**, and  
- Is provided by an institution to a natural person (individual).

Examples include:
- Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)
- Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
- Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)
- Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)

*Note:* The term "registered product" is broadly defined to include any such plan or fund that falls under the Income Tax Act’s framework for registered savings instruments.

---

### **Information Disclosure Requirements**

#### **1. Clarity, Simplicity, and Non-Misleading Nature**
- All information required under:
  - Subsection 385.131(1) of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*  
  - Subsection 434.1(1) of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*  
  - These Regulations  
  must be:
  - **Clear**
  - **Simple**
  - **Not misleading**

This ensures that consumers can understand the terms, fees, and conditions of the registered product without confusion or deception.

---

#### **2. Mode of Disclosure (Oral vs. Written)**

There are **specific exceptions** based on how the account or agreement is initiated:

| Method of Opening/Agreement | Disclosure Requirement |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **By telephone** | Information must be provided **orally** before the account is opened or agreement is made. |
| **By mail, electronic means (e.g., online), or email** | Information must be provided **in writing** before the account is opened or agreement is made. |

**Additional Requirements:**

- **Oral-only provision (telephone):**  
  After the account is opened or agreement is made, the institution **must provide the same information in writing**.

- **Written-only provision (mail/electronic):**  
  Before opening the account or entering into the agreement, the institution **must provide the telephone number of a knowledgeable person** who can explain the terms and conditions of the registered product.

> This ensures that even if initial communication is electronic or written, individuals have access to a human point of contact for clarification.

---

#### **3. Delivery Timing (Mail-Based Disclosure)**

- If information is provided **by mail**, it is considered delivered on the **fifth business day after the postmark date**.  
- This gives consumers a reasonable timeframe to receive and review the materials, even if postal delivery takes time.

---

#### **4. Exemptions from Disclosure**

An institution is **not required** to provide the required information under the regulations in the following situations:

**Exemption 1: Existing Customer with Prior Written Notice**  
- If the new account or product will be part of a customer’s **existing registered product**, and  
- The customer has already been **previously advised in writing** of all applicable charges,  
then no further disclosure is required.

> This prevents redundant information for customers who are already familiar with their current plan.

**Exemption 2: Trustee-Only Accounts**  
- A company (as defined in the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*) is not required to provide the information if:
  - The account is being opened **solely for the purpose of acting as a trustee** in respect of a registered product, or  
  - The agreement is entered into **solely for trustee purposes**.

> This recognizes that trustee functions are administrative and do not involve direct consumer interaction.

---

### **Amendment Disclosure Requirements**

Before any **change to the terms and conditions** of a registered product:
- The institution must **disclose the proposed amendment in writing** to the individual to whom the product was provided.

> This ensures transparency during changes to fees, interest rates, eligibility, or other key features.

---

### **Public Access to Charges List**

#### **Mandatory Maintenance of Charges List**
- Every institution must maintain a **list of all charges** applicable to its registered products:
  - At **each branch** and **point of service** where registered products are offered in Canada, and  
  - On **each website** through which registered products are offered in Canada.

#### **Public Inspection Rights**
- The list must be made **available for inspection during business hours**:
  - To customers
  - To the public  
at all branches and points of service.

> This promotes transparency and allows individuals to compare fees across institutions.

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

These regulations were enacted under the authority of the following statutes:
- **Bank Act** – Sections 448.3a, 459.4b, 566.1c, 576.2d, 978e  
- **Cooperative Credit Associations Act** – Sections 385.131g, 385.28h, 463i
