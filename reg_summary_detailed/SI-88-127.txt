### 🔹 VI. **Creditable Periods of Coverage**

When a person has completed **creditable periods under both countries’ legislation**, the **competent institution** in each country may **recognize** periods from the other country — **provided they do not overlap**.

#### A. **Germany’s Creditable Periods (Under Article 12)**

| Coverage Type | Creditable Period |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Months ending on or before **December 31, 1965** | Recognized as months of residence under Canadian OAS law → counted as **contributions under German law**. |
| Years starting on or after **January 1, 1966** | A year with **any CPP contribution** = **12 months of German contributions**. |
| Months starting on or after **January 1, 1966** with **no CPP contribution** | Recognized as **one month of German contributions**. |

> ✅ This allows Canadians living in Germany to build creditable periods under German law, even without direct contributions.

#### B. **Pension Calculation and Benefit Amounts**

- **Pension Computation Base (Rentenbemessungsgrundlage)**:
  - Determined **solely on periods recognized under German legislation**.

- **If entitlement is met only via Article 12**:
  - **Half of the benefit** attributable to the **additional creditable period** is payable.
  - For **orphans’ pensions (Waisenrente)**: Half of the supplement is paid.

> 📌 This creates a **partial benefit** system — not full entitlement, but partial recognition.

#### A. **Residence Credit for OAS Benefits**
- A period of residence in **Germany after the age when Canadian residence is creditable** (e.g., age 65) counts as **residence in Canada**.
