**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Excluding Certain Vaping Products Regulated Under the Food and Drugs Act from the Application of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act"**

---

### **Overview**

This regulation, made under **subsection 42.2(1)a of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVP Act)**, establishes a **specific exclusion** of certain vaping products from the scope of the TVP Act. The purpose is to **avoid regulatory overlap** and **ensure appropriate regulatory oversight** for products that are already regulated under other existing legislation — primarily the **Food and Drugs Act (FDA)** and its associated regulations (e.g., Medical Devices Regulations, Natural Health Products Regulations, and Drug Regulations).

The regulation **excludes specific types of vaping products** from the strict controls imposed by the TVP Act — such as restrictions on marketing, age limits, product design, and advertising — **if those products are already governed by the FDA framework**.

## **Key Provisions and Explanations**

---

### **1. Definitions and Scope**

The regulation applies to the following key terms:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Tobacco and Vaping Products Act*.
- **Medical device**: Defined in accordance with the *Medical Devices Regulations*.
- **Natural health product (NHP)**: Defined in accordance with the *Natural Health Products Regulations*.
- **Non-prescription drug**: A drug that:
  - Is not listed in the prescription drug list (as amended);
  - Does not contain a controlled substance;

> For clarity, the terms *drug*, *label*, *package*, and *sell* have the same meaning as in the Food and Drugs Act.

### **2. Exclusions from the TVP Act (Main Exclusion Clause)**

The TVP Act **does not apply** to the following vaping products:

#### ✅ **Vaping products that do not contain nicotine** and meet one of the following criteria:

| Product Type | Condition |
|------------|---------|
| **Non-prescription drugs** or **NHPs with a product licence** | Administered via a **facial steamer or mask** |
| **Non-prescription drugs** | Authorized for treating **respiratory illness or symptoms** |
| **NHPs with a product licence** | Authorized for treating **respiratory illness or symptoms** |

> These products are excluded because they are used in a **non-inhalation, non-vaping context** (e.g., facial steamers) and are **already regulated under the FDA**.

#### ✅ **Natural Health Products authorized under Part 4 of the Natural Health Products Regulations**

- These are products that have been **pre-approved for sale** under the NHP framework.
- They are excluded from the TVP Act due to existing regulatory oversight.

#### ✅ **Drugs authorized under Division 5 or 7 of Part C of the Food and Drug Regulations**

- These are drugs approved for specific medical uses.
- Excluded because they fall under **existing drug regulation**.

#### ✅ **Drugs authorized for importation or exempt from regulation**

- Products authorized under **subsection C.10.001(2)** (importation) or **C.10.002(1)** (exemption).
- Excluded due to **importation or exemption status**.

#### ✅ **Drugs sold under C.08.011(1)**

- These are drugs sold under specific provisions allowing limited sales.
- Excluded due to **specific regulatory status**.

#### ✅ **Medical devices sold under section 43.5 of the Medical Devices Regulations**

- Devices sold under this provision are excluded from the TVP Act.

#### ✅ **Medical devices with authorizations under subsections 72(1) or 83(1) of the Medical Devices Regulations**

### **3. Exclusions for Non-Nicotine Vaping Products (with Specific Conditions)**

The TVP Act **does not apply** to a vaping product that is:

- A **non-prescription drug** or **NHP with a product licence**;
- Administered via a **medical device that is NOT an active device** (i.e., does not generate energy like heat, pressure, or chemical reactions);
- Does **not rely on external energy sources** (only body-generated energy like gravity or body heat);
- Has **no reasonable grounds to believe it is appealing to young persons** (in appearance, shape, function, or sensory attributes);
- Has **no appealing labels or brand elements** (e.g., logos, colors, images) that could attract youth.

> This ensures that **safe, non-appealing, low-risk devices** used for medical purposes (e.g., a heated facial mask) are not subject to youth appeal restrictions under the TVP Act.

---

### **4. Exclusion for Licensed Medical Devices**

- The TVP Act **does not apply** to a **licensed medical device** (defined as a device with a licence under subsection 36(1) of the Medical Devices Regulations), **provided**:
  - It is used in conjunction with a **drug or NHP** that has a DIN or product licence.
  - The device is not appealing to youth (as per the appearance/labeling criteria in subsection 3).

> This allows medical devices used in therapy (e.g., a device that delivers a medication via inhalation) to remain under medical device regulation, not the stricter TVP Act rules.

---

### **5. Exception for Prescription Vaping Products**

- **Prescription vaping products** that have a **DIN** are **exempt** from most provisions of the TVP Act — **except those in subsection 13(1)**.
- This means prescription vaping products (e.g., nicotine delivery systems prescribed for medical conditions) are **not subject to youth appeal or marketing restrictions**, but **still fall under the scope of the TVP Act** for specific provisions (e.g., age restrictions, labelling).

---

### **6. Exclusions for Specific Marketing and Promotion Rules**

The following provisions of the TVP Act **do not apply** to the **promotion, use, or display of a manufacturer’s name** for a vaping product if:

- The manufacturer only sells or advertises the product **for medical use** (diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of disease or symptoms in humans);
- The product is associated with one of the following:
  - A **Drug Identification Number (DIN)**;
  - A **medical device licence** (under section 36(1) of the Medical Devices Regulations); or
  - A **product licence** for a natural health product (under section 7 of the NHP Regulations).

> This allows **medical marketing** (e.g., promoting a device for asthma treatment) without violating youth-targeted advertising rules.

---

### **7. Important Exclusions and Exceptions**

- **Subsection (1) does not apply** to:
  - Non-prescription drugs or NHPs referred to in **paragraph 2(a)** or **section 3** of the regulation (i.e., those used for respiratory illness or in facial steamers).
- **Sections 30.3(1), (2), and 30.4** of the TVP Act (which govern advertising and promotion) **do not apply** when the manufacturer only promotes the product for medical use and has a DIN, medical device licence, or NHP licence.

---

### **8. Definition of "Manufacturer"**

The term *manufacturer* is defined differently depending on the product type:
- **Drugs**: Under section A.01.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations;
- **Medical devices**: Under section 1 of the Medical Devices Regulations;
- **Natural health products**: Under subsection 1(1) of the Natural Health Products Regulations.

This ensures clarity in determining who is responsible for compliance.

---

### **9. Effective Date**

These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** (i.e., published in the *Canada Gazette*).

## **Summary of Key Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avoid regulatory duplication** | Prevents the TVP Act from overlapping with existing regulatory frameworks (e.g., drugs, NHPs, medical devices). |
| **Protect public health** | Ensures only **nicotine-containing, youth-targeted vaping products** are subject to strict regulation. |
| **Support medical use** | Allows safe, medically approved devices (e.g., for respiratory treatment) to operate under appropriate regulatory regimes. |
| **Prevent youth appeal** | Applies youth appeal restrictions only where there is a reasonable risk of attracting minors. |
| **Promote transparency and clarity** | Clearly defines which products are excluded and under what conditions. |

## **Practical Implications**

1. **Facial steamers** (e.g., for acne or sinus relief) that deliver non-nicotine drugs or NHPs are **not subject to TVP Act restrictions**.
2. **Medical devices** used to deliver drugs (e.g., inhalers with heating elements) are **exempt from youth appeal rules** if they are licensed and used medically.
3. **Drugs and NHPs** approved for respiratory conditions (e.g., for asthma or bronchitis) can be sold via vaping devices without youth appeal restrictions.
4. **Marketing** of such products (
