      - A specific risk.
      - A proposal for life insurance, insurance policy, or service.
      - A particular insurance company, agent, or broker.

## **5. Restrictions on Promotion and Marketing**

### ❌ **What Associations May NOT Do**

#### **(a) Promote Insurance Companies, Agents, or Brokers**
An association **cannot promote** an insurer, agent, or broker **in Canada** unless:
- The company/dealer **only offers authorized types of insurance**, or
- The promotion occurs **outside** the office of a local cooperative credit society or branch of a retail association and is directed to:
  - All holders of credit or charge cards issued by the association or any body in the cooperative credit system.
  - All customers and members of local cooperative credit societies who regularly receive statements.
  - The **general public**.

> This prevents targeted or misleading marketing to specific customers.

#### **(b) Promote Specific Insurance Policies**
An association may **only promote** a policy if:
- It is of an **authorized type of insurance**, or
- It is **restricted to insuring risks of the association, its members, or affiliates**, and **does not cover customer risks** arising from transactions with customers.
- It is a **personal accident policy** promoted outside local offices or branches.
- It is a **travel insurance policy** provided by a **corporation without share capital** (e.g., mutual or fraternal society), offering coverage for natural persons.
- The promotion occurs outside local offices and targets a **specific group** (e.g., employees of the association or its members).

> This ensures that insurance marketing does not extend to customers’ personal financial risks.

#### **(c) Prohibited Promotion on Web Pages**
An association **shall not**:
- Provide direct or indirect access to a web page that promotes:
  - An insurer, agent, or broker that does **not** deal only in authorized insurance.
  - A policy or service that is **not** of an authorized type.

> This applies even if the link is through another page. Web pages are strictly monitored for compliance.

## **6. Restrictions on Sharing Customer Information**

### ❌ **No Sharing of Sensitive Customer Data**

No association may:
- Provide to an insurer, agent, or broker:
  - Information about a **customer in Canada** of a member body corporate.
  - Information about a **customer of the association** (if it is a retail association).
  - Information about an **employee** of a customer (if the customer is a natural person or entity with members/partners in Canada).
  - If the customer is an entity with members in Canada: information about any such member.
  - If the customer is a partnership with partners in Canada: information about any such partner.

> This protects customer privacy and prevents insurers from using personal financial data for targeted marketing.

### ❌ **Subsidiaries Are Also Bound**
- Subsidiaries of the association (including trust or loan corporations incorporated under provincial law) **cannot** share such information with insurers or agents.

> Exception: If the association or subsidiary has:
  - Established **procedures** to ensure the information will **not be used** to promote insurance in Canada, **and**
  - The insurer/agent has given a **written undertaking** (acceptable to the Superintendent) that it will **not use** the information for promotion in Canada.

> This allows limited data sharing under strict safeguards.

---

## **7. Prohibitions on Telecommunications Devices**

### ❌ **No Direct Links to Insurers**
- Associations **shall not** provide telecommunications devices (e.g., phone lines, apps, chat systems) that:
  - Are primarily for customer use.
  - Link a customer or member directly to an **insurance company, agent, or broker**.

> This prevents embedded insurance sales or referral mechanisms that could compromise customer autonomy.

---

## **8. Physical Premises Restrictions (Retail Associations)**

### ❌ **No Adjacent Premises with Insurers**
- A **retail association** may **not operate on premises adjacent** to those of an insurance company, agent, or broker **unless**:
  - It clearly and visibly **distinguishes** its business from that of the insurer or agent.

> This prevents confusion or perceived collusion between the association and insurer.

---

## **9. Exceptions and Flexibility**

Despite the strict rules, several **exceptions** are provided:

- Associations may **exclude individuals** from promotions if:
  - The promotion would violate a provincial or federal law.
  - The individual has **written notice** stating they do not wish to receive promotional material.
  - The individual
