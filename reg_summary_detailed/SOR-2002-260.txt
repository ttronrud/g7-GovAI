**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Chloroprene Sheets Remission Order"**

**Regulatory Source:**  
S.C. 1997, c. 36  
Issued by: Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance  
Under authority: Section 115 of the *Customs Tariff*

---

### **Purpose of the Regulation**  
This regulation establishes a **customs duty remission** (i.e., exemption from paying or recovering customs duties) for specific types of chloroprene sheets imported into Canada. The remission applies only to certain chloroprene sheets that meet defined technical and timing criteria.

---

### **Scope of the Remission**  
The remission applies to **chloroprene sheets** that:  

1. **Have a knitted nylon fabric laminated to both sides**  
   – This means the sheet is composed of chloroprene (a synthetic rubber) with a layer of knitted nylon fabric attached to each side.  

2. **Weigh more than 1,500 grams per square meter (g/m²)**  
   – This is a minimum weight threshold. Sheets below this weight are excluded from the remission.  

3. **Contain less than 50% by weight of textile material**  
   – The textile component (in this case, nylon) must be less than half of the total weight of the sheet. This ensures the product is predominantly a synthetic rubber-based material, not a textile product.

### **Conditions for Eligibility**  

The remission is **not automatic** and is granted only if the following conditions are met:

1. **Import Period**  
   The chloroprene sheets must have been imported into Canada during the period:  
   → **January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2005**  
   – This sets a clear time window for eligibility. Products imported before or after this period are not covered.

2. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **four years** of the date of importation.  
   – For example, if a sheet was imported on January 1, 2003, the claim must be filed by January 1, 2007.  
   – Failure to meet this deadline results in the loss of the remission benefit.

### **Legal Authority**  
The regulation is authorized under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff**, which allows the government to make remissions of duties in specific cases, particularly when the product serves a public interest, is used in a particular industry, or when there is a justification for relief from duty (such as technological or economic reasons).

---

### **Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the appropriate government office (typically the Registrar of the Canada Gazette). This means it becomes enforceable immediately upon official publication.

---

### **Key Implications**  
- **Benefit to Importers**: Importers of chloroprene sheets meeting the specified criteria can avoid paying customs duties on these goods during the specified period.  
- **Administrative Burden**: Importers must maintain records of the product’s weight, textile content, and import date to verify eligibility.  
- **Time Sensitivity**: The four-year deadline for filing claims is strict and requires careful record-keeping.  
- **Exclusion of Other Products**: The remission does not extend to other types of chloroprene sheets or those with higher textile content.

### **Conclusion**  
This regulation provides a targeted relief mechanism for a specific class of industrial materials—chloroprene sheets with nylon laminations—designed to support manufacturing or industrial applications where such materials are used. It reflects a balance between fiscal policy and industrial needs, ensuring that duty exemptions are granted only to products meeting precise technical and temporal criteria.

The regulation is a practical tool for promoting the use of specialized materials in Canada’s industrial sector while maintaining compliance with customs and tariff laws.
