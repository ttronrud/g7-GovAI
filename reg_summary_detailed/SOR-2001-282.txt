## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the Enhanced Survivor Annuity Regulations**

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
The *Enhanced Survivor Annuity Regulations* were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, pursuant to **subsection 44.01(5)aa of the Judges Act**.  
This regulation establishes a framework allowing judges in Canada to **elect to increase the survivor’s annuity** received by their spouse or common-law partner upon their death—specifically, to either **60% or 75%** of the judge’s own annuity.

This provision aims to:
- Provide greater financial security for spouses and common-law partners of judges.
- Improve the survivor benefits under the judicial pension system.
- Ensure that the survivor receives a more substantial and sustainable income after the judge’s death.

### **3. How to Make an Election**

#### ✅ Required Notice
A judge must send a **written notice** to the Annuity Administrator via **registered mail**, which must:
- Be **dated and signed by the judge** and **a witness other than the judge’s spouse or common-law partner**.
- Clearly state:
  - Whether the judge elects to have the survivor’s annuity increased to **60% or 75%** of their annuity.
  - The **date of birth** of the spouse or common-law partner.
  - The **date of marriage** (if married) or the **date the conjugal cohabitation began** (if common-law).

#### ⏳ Deadline for Making an Election
- **If the judge is already receiving an annuity on the day the regulations come into force**: Must make the election within **180 days**.
- **If the judge is retiring or ceases to hold office**: Must make the election within **180 days** after that date.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The 180-day period begins on the day the regulations come into force (August 1, 2001), or the day the judge ceases to hold office, whichever is earlier.

### **4. Correction of Erroneous Information**

If the Annuity Administrator becomes aware that:
- The judge was misled about the **deadline**,
- The **amount of monthly annuity payments**,
- Or the **amount of the enhanced survivor annuity**,

Then the Administrator **must notify the judge by registered mail** of the correct information.

#### 🔄 What Happens If the Judge Was Misled?
- If the judge **had decided not to make an election** due to the error, they may now make an election within **90 days** of receiving the correction notice.

---

### **5. Submission of Supporting Documents**

Within **90 days** of making the election, the judge must send to the Annuity Administrator:
1. **Proof of the spouse/common-law partner’s date of birth** (e.g., birth certificate).
2. **Proof of marriage** (marriage certificate) or **proof of cohabitation** (statutory declaration).
3. **If the names differ** between documents:  
   → Provide **additional documentation** confirming the relationship, or  
   → A **statutory declaration** from the spouse/common-law partner confirming the documents refer to them.

> 🔍 *Failure to submit any required document within 90 days means the election is deemed not to have been made.*

---

### **6. Repayment of Reduced Annuity**

If an election is **not properly made or submitted**, the **reduction** in the judge’s own annuity (as per section 44.01(2) of the Judges Act) will be **repaid to the judge**, along with **interest** as specified in subsection 44.01(4) of the Act.

---

### **7. Proof of Age and Relationship**

#### ✅ Proof of Age of Spouse/Partner
- **Primary proof**: A **birth certificate** issued by a civil authority.
- **If unavailable**:
  - A **statutory declaration** by the spouse/common-law partner stating their date of birth and **why the certificate cannot be obtained**.
  - Plus, **one of the following**:
    - A document made **within 5 years** of birth indicating name and date of birth/age.
    - A document made **at least 20 years before** the election date indicating date of birth, **accompanied by a statutory declaration** from a third party (not the judge or partner) confirming the date is correct.

> ⚠️ If the document/statutory declaration cannot be obtained, the **statutory declaration alone** (with explanation) is sufficient.

#### ✅ Proof of Marriage
- **Primary proof**: A **marriage certificate** from a civil authority.
- **If unavailable**:
  - A **statutory declaration** by the judge or spouse stating the date of marriage and reason for lack of certificate.
  - Plus, a **document comparable to a marriage certificate** (e.g., wedding invitation, church record), or
  - A **statutory declaration** by a person who attended the ceremony (not the judge or spouse) attesting to their knowledge of the marriage.

#### ✅ Proof of Cohabitation (Common-Law Relationship)
- Must be established by a **statutory declaration** in which **both the judge and the common-law partner** attest to the **date the cohabitation began**.

### **8. How the Enhanced Survivor Annuity is Calculated**

When a judge makes an election, the **monthly payments** to the survivor are calculated by converting the following benefits into new annuities:

#### ⚙️ Conversion from Original Benefits (before election) to New Enhanced Benefits:
| Original Benefit | Converted to |
|------------------|-------------|
| Judge’s annuity (Part I of Judges Act) | → Annuity payable to the judge during marriage/cohabitation (beginning on the later of: election date or when original annuity starts) |
| Judge’s annuity (Part I) | → Annuity payable to judge after marriage/cohabitation ends (beginning on that date) |
| Survivor’s annuity (under Part I) | → Annuity payable to **survivor** after judge’s death: |
| - If judge dies **within first year** after election: <br> → Monthly amount = **reduction amount** (from original annuity) + interest |
| - If judge dies **after first year**: <br> → Monthly amount = **60% or 75%** of the monthly amount from (i) (the annuity payable to the judge during marriage/cohabitation) |
| Death benefit under subsection 51(3) of Judges Act | → Death benefit remains unchanged |
| Supplementary Retirement Benefits (SRB) | → Benefits remain unchanged |

> ✅ The enhanced survivor annuity is **not** a simple percentage of the judge’s annuity—it is a complex, actuarially based conversion of multiple benefit streams.

### **9. Actuarial Demographic Assumptions**

The present value of the annuities is calculated using the following assumptions (based on the most recent *Public Pensions Reporting Act* valuation report):

| Assumption | Details |
|----------|--------|
| **Mortality rates for judges** | Average of mortality rates for: <br> - Judges receiving disability benefits <br> - Judges receiving non-disability benefits <br> → Weighted by the proportion of benefits paid to each group. <br> → For judges under 65: Use **same weights as for 65-year-olds**. |
| **Mortality rates for survivors** | Use rates for spouses as published in the latest actuarial report (with mortality projection factors). |
| **Divorce rates** | Based on Statistics Canada’s divorce statistics, as established by the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. |

> These assumptions ensure the annuity is actuarially sound and consistent with national demographic trends.

### **10. Interest Rate Assumptions**

The interest rate used to calculate present values is:
- **First 15 years after election**:
  - Based on the **real rate of interest** on long-term Government of Canada real return bonds (Series B114018).
  - The value is taken from the **second calendar month before the election month**.
  - Rounded to the nearest **quarter percent**
