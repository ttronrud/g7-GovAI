### **Detailed Summary of the Contraventions Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 7, s. 4)**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The Contraventions Regulations were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Justice**, under **section 8a of the Contraventions Act**. These regulations came into force on **August 1, 1996**.

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define specific offences** (known as *contraventions*) and to establish:
- The **short-form description** of each offence,
- The **maximum fine amount** applicable to each contravention,
- Special provisions for **young persons** and **quotas/limits**.

These rules streamline enforcement by allowing administrative or ticket-based penalties for violations, particularly in areas such as port operations, environmental protection, land use, and wildlife management.

---

#### **2. Structure of the Regulations**

The regulations are organized into **schedules**, each listing a column of offences. The structure follows a standardized format:

| Column I | Column II | Column III |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Provision in an enactment** | **Short-form description of the offence** | **Fine amount (or range)** |

Each row represents a distinct contravention. The key elements are:

---

#### **3. Key Provisions Explained**

##### **A. Designation of Offences as Contraventions**
Any violation of a provision listed in **Column I** of the Schedules is treated as a **contravention** under the *Contraventions Act*.

> This allows the government to apply a simplified legal process (e.g., through tickets) rather than full criminal proceedings.

---

##### **B. Short-Form Description (Column II)**
For administrative and procedural purposes, each offence is given a **clear, concise description** (e.g., "Enter, leave or proceed within a port or traffic control zone without having obtained a traffic clearance").

> This description is used in:
> - Ticketing notices,
> - Notices of violation,
> - Public awareness campaigns,
> - Enforcement records.

---

##### **C. Fine Amounts (Column III)**
The **amount of the fine** that may be imposed in proceedings initiated via a **ticket** is set in Column III.

- The fine is **not automatic** — it depends on the specific offence.
- Where multiple amounts are listed (e.g., base amount + additional amount), the **additional amount applies only if the quota or limit is exceeded**.

> Example:  
> If a fine has a base amount of $50 and an additional $100 if a limit is exceeded, then:
> - Only the base fine applies if the violation does not exceed the limit.
> - The additional fine applies **only when the first item that exceeds the quota/limit** is involved.

> This prevents punitive fines for minor or unintentional breaches.

---

##### **D. Special Rule for Young Persons**
If a contravention is committed by a **young person** (typically defined as someone under 18 or under 19, depending on jurisdictional interpretation), the fine is **deemed to be the lesser of**:
- **$100**, or  
- The amount specified in Column III.

> This reflects a policy of **proportionality and rehabilitation** for youth offenders.
