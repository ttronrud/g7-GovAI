**Detailed Summary of the *Imported Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order***

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
This regulation is officially titled the *Imported Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order* and may be cited as such. It establishes a specific tax remission (exemption) for certain imported aircraft used for demonstration purposes in Canada.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **"Act"**: Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*, which governs the taxation of goods, including aircraft, upon importation into Canada.  
- **"Aircraft"**: Includes helicopters and other aircraft types used for demonstration. This broad definition ensures that all forms of rotary or fixed-wing aircraft used in demonstration are covered.  
- **"Demonstration"**: Defined as the act of showing, displaying, or exhibiting an aircraft in Canada with the purpose of explaining or proving its qualities, features, or capabilities to prospective customers. This includes promotional, sales, or educational activities involving the aircraft.  
- **"Deputy Minister"**: Refers to the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise, who is responsible for administering and enforcing the provisions of this Order, including reviewing applications and determining compliance.  
- **"Resident"**:  
  - For an **individual**: A person who resides in Canada during the year of importation, meaning their total stay in Canada is 183 days or more.  
  - For a **corporation**: A company incorporated in Canada.  
  This residency requirement ensures that only Canadian-based importers (individuals or entities) are eligible for the remission.  
- **"Remission"**: A tax exemption from the excise tax that would otherwise apply under Division III of Part IX of the *Excise Tax Act* for aircraft imported into Canada after December 31, 1990, **specifically for demonstration purposes**.

**3. Eligibility and Conditions for Tax Remission**  

The remission of excise tax is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Residency Requirement**:  
   The importer must be a *resident* of Canada (as defined above). This ensures that the benefit is available only to entities with a clear connection to Canada.

2. **Certification at Time of Import**:  
   At the time the aircraft is imported, the importer must **formally certify** that the aircraft will be used **solely and exclusively** for demonstration purposes. This certification is a binding declaration and must be submitted with the import application.

3. **Record-Keeping Obligations**:  
   The importer is required to maintain **complete and accurate records** of the aircraft’s use. These records must clearly document all activities related to the aircraft, including:
   - Dates and times of use,
   - Purpose of each use (e.g., public exhibition, sales meeting, media event),
   - Attendance or audience details,
   - Any deviations from demonstration use.  
   These records must be **available for inspection** by officers of the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise (DNRC&E) upon request.

4. **Ceasing Use and Export Requirement**:  
   If the Deputy Minister determines that the importer has **ceased using the aircraft solely for demonstration**, the aircraft must be **exported from Canada**. This provision ensures that the remission is not abused or extended beyond its intended purpose. The Department may initiate an audit or review to verify compliance with the demonstration use condition.

---

**4. Timeframe of Application**  
The remission applies to **aircraft imported into Canada after December 31, 1990**. This means the regulation does not cover earlier imports, and its provisions are retroactive only to that date.

---

**5. Revocation Status**  
This Order was **revoked** by *Statutory Instrument No. 91-12, Section 2*. This indicates that the regulation is **no longer in force** as of the date of revocation.  

> **Important Note**: While the summary above reflects the content of the original Order, its **current legal status is null** due to revocation. Therefore, **this regulation does not currently apply** in Canadian tax law.

---

**6. Purpose and Policy Rationale**  
The original intent of the Order was to:
- Encourage the importation of demonstration aircraft into Canada by reducing the financial burden of excise tax for Canadian residents.
- Support the Canadian aviation industry by enabling companies to showcase new or advanced aircraft to potential customers.
- Ensure that the tax remission is used **only for legitimate demonstration purposes**, not for commercial operations or personal use.
- Provide a clear and enforceable framework through certification, record-keeping, and export requirements to prevent abuse.

---

**7. Implications of Revocation**  
Since the Order has been revoked, **no current tax remission is available** for imported demonstration aircraft under this regulation. Importers of aircraft into Canada after December 31, 1990 for demonstration purposes must now pay the full excise tax unless a new, current regulation has been enacted to replace it.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Imported Demonstration Aircraft Remission Order* was a temporary, targeted measure to support the demonstration of aircraft in Canada. However, it has been **formally revoked**, rendering it **inoperative**. As such, it does not currently provide any tax relief for imported demonstration aircraft. Any future exemptions would require a new legislative or regulatory instrument to be introduced and approved by the government.

> **Recommendation for Users**: If a business is planning to import an aircraft for demonstration purposes, it should consult the current *Excise Tax Act* and seek guidance from the Department of National Revenue to determine whether any applicable exemptions or relief measures exist under current law.
