**Detailed Summary of the World Trade Organization Pension Plan Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Origin**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act (F.A.A.)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make orders for the remission of taxes or other financial obligations in the public interest.  

The Order was enacted under **S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)** and is referenced in **R.S., c. F-11** (the Financial Administration Act). This legislative basis allows the government to provide tax relief to specific entities—here, the World Trade Organization (WTO)—for investments made in connection with its employee pension plan.

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **grant a remission (i.e., a full or partial cancellation or forgiveness) of certain taxes** that the World Trade Organization (WTO) paid to Canada under the *Income Tax Act* during a specific period.  

Specifically, the remission applies to:
- Taxes paid by the WTO between **January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011**,  
- In respect of **investments made in connection with the WTO’s pension plan for its employees**.

This means that the government is recognizing that the WTO made certain tax payments in relation to pension-related investments and is now waiving those payments as a form of public policy relief.

---

**3. Scope of Remission**  
The remission includes:
- The **principal tax amounts** paid by the WTO during the specified period (2000–2011) related to pension plan investments.  
- **Interest and penalties** associated with any of those tax amounts, **provided** that the principal amount is remitted under this Order.

Thus, the relief is not limited to the tax itself but extends to any interest or penalties that were incurred as a result of the tax liability.

**4. Conditions for Remission**  
Remission is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

#### a) **No Double Benefit**  
Remission under this Order is granted **only to the extent** that the amount has **not already been**:
- Rebated,  
- Remitted,  
- Credited, or  
- Refunded  
to any person under:
- The *Financial Administration Act*, or  
- Any other Act of Parliament.

This ensures that the government does not provide redundant or overlapping relief to the same taxpayer or entity.

#### b) **Timely Claim Submission**  
A claim for remission must be:
- Filed in **writing** with the **Minister of National Revenue**,  
- **No later than two years after the day the Order is made**.

This establishes a clear deadline for applicants to act, ensuring administrative efficiency and accountability.

#### c) **Proof of Tax Payment**  
If the claim is for tax that has already been paid by the WTO, the WTO must provide the Minister of National Revenue with:
- **Evidence or information** demonstrating that the tax was actually paid.

This requirement ensures transparency and prevents fraudulent claims by verifying the factual basis of the tax liability.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order **comes into force on the day it is made**. This means that the provisions are immediately applicable upon issuance and can be used by eligible parties from that date onward.

---

**6. Key Implications and Context**  
- This Order reflects a **public interest decision** to support international organizations operating in Canada by recognizing legitimate pension investment activities.  
- It provides **financial relief** to the WTO, which may have faced administrative or fiscal burdens due to tax obligations arising from employee pension fund investments.  
- The requirement for evidence and timely filing ensures that the government maintains fiscal accountability and prevents misuse of the remission mechanism.  
- The restriction on double remission aligns with broader principles of fiscal responsibility and prevents over-compensation.

**Conclusion**  
The *World Trade Organization Pension Plan Remission Order* is a targeted, legally grounded measure that grants tax relief to the WTO for specific tax liabilities incurred between 2000 and 2011 related to employee pension investments. It includes interest and penalties, is subject to strict eligibility and procedural requirements, and is designed to balance public interest with fiscal responsibility. The Order ensures transparency, accountability, and fairness in the administration of tax remissions for international organizations.
