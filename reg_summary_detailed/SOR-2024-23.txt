### **Detailed Summary of the Special Economic Measures (Guatemala) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Purpose and Context of the Regulation**

The **Special Economic Measures (Guatemala) Regulations** are a set of targeted sanctions imposed by the Government of Canada under the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**. These measures are designed to respond to serious human rights violations and systemic corruption in the Republic of Guatemala.

The regulation is grounded in two key findings:
- **Gross and systematic human rights violations** have occurred in Guatemala.
- A **national of Guatemala**, either as a foreign public official or an associate of such an official, has been found responsible for or complicit in **significant acts of corruption**.

These findings form the basis for the Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) to impose economic restrictions on individuals and entities linked to those violations.

#### **2. Legal Authority**

The regulations are enacted under specific provisions of the **Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA)**:
- **Paragraph 4(1)(a)a**: Powers to impose measures against individuals involved in gross human rights violations.
- **Subsection 4(1.1)b**: Authority to designate individuals or entities for economic sanctions.
- **Subsection 4(2)c**: Powers to restrict financial dealings with designated persons.
- **Subsection 4(3)**: Authority to apply sanctions in relation to corruption and public officials.

These provisions are supported by:
- **S.C. 2022, c. 10, s. 438(1)** – The legislative basis for the current regulations.
- **S.C. 2017, c. 21, s. 17(2)** – Framework for human rights-based sanctions.

- **S.C. 1992, c. 17** – Historical foundation of SEMA.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines key terms to ensure clarity and scope:

- **Guatemala**:  
  Includes the entire Republic of Guatemala, its political subdivisions (e.g., provinces, municipalities), its government departments, agencies, and those of its political subdivisions.

- **Minister**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of Foreign Affairs**, who makes recommendations to the Governor in Council for the listing of individuals or entities.

#### **4. Who Is Considered a "Listed Person"?**

A person is designated as a **listed person** if the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, is satisfied that there are **reasonable grounds to believe** the individual or entity meets **any of the following criteria**:

| Criteria | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **(a)** | Participated in **gross and systematic human rights violations** in Guatemala. |

| **(f)** | An entity **owned, held, or controlled** by Guatemala (the state). |
