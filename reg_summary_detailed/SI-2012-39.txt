The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2017-76, section 36**. Specifically, each line states:

> [Repealed, SI/2017-76, s. 36]

This indicates that the regulation in question was **officially removed or cancelled** by the legislation enacted in SI 2017-76, under section 36 of that instrument.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **repealed** (i.e., no longer in force).
- **Repealing Instrument**: Statutory Instrument 2017-76 (SI 2017-76).
- **Section Responsible for Repeal**: Section 36 of SI 2017-76.
- **Implication**: The specific regulation previously listed (which is not provided in your query) was formally abolished or replaced by this statutory instrument. This means that any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously set out in that regulation are no longer applicable.
- **Purpose of Repeal**: Repeals are typically introduced to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Simplify legislation.
  - Align with new policy or legal frameworks.
  - Avoid legal inconsistencies or overlaps.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect upon the coming into force of SI 2017-76, which is generally published in the official government gazette and comes into force on a specified date (often within a few days of publication). The exact date would need to be confirmed in the full text of SI 2017-76.

### Important Notes:
- Since the original regulation itself is not included in your input, this summary only reflects the **status and mechanism of repeal**, not the content or purpose of the original rule.
- The repetition of the same line 12 times is likely a formatting or data input error and does not add new information — it merely emphasizes the repealing status.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced has been **fully repealed** by **SI 2017-76, section 36**. It is no longer legally valid or enforceable. Any reference to it in current legal or regulatory contexts is outdated and should be replaced with the current applicable legislation, if any.

To understand the original scope or purpose of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the original regulation or the explanatory notes accompanying SI 2017-76.
