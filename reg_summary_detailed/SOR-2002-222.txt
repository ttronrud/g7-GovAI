### **Detailed Summary of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations**

These regulations, made under the **Fisheries Act** by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, establish comprehensive environmental standards for the management and discharge of mine effluents from **metal and diamond mines** in Canada. The primary objective is to **protect aquatic ecosystems** by limiting the release of harmful substances into water bodies, particularly those that could threaten fish populations or water quality.

---

## **I. Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

- **Enactment Basis**:  
  The regulations are issued under **subsections 34(2), 36(5), and 38(9)** of the *Fisheries Act*, which empower the government to regulate the discharge of effluents from mines to prevent harm to fish and aquatic life.

- **Scope**:  
  Applies specifically to **metal mines** and **diamond mines** meeting certain thresholds of effluent volume and pollutant discharge.

## **II. Key Definitions**

### **1. Core Definitions**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Effluent** | Any water or runoff from a mine that contains deleterious substances, including: <br> - Hydrometallurgical facility effluent <br> - Milling facility effluent <br> - Mine water effluent <br> - Tailings impoundment area effluent <br> - Treatment pond or facility effluent <br> - Surface runoff or seepage containing harmful substances |
| **Final Discharge Point** | The point beyond which the mine operator no longer controls the effluent quality. This is critical for monitoring and regulatory compliance. |
| **Deleterious Substances** | Substances that are harmful to aquatic life. These are **prescribed** as: <br> - Arsenic <br> - Copper <br> - Cyanide <br> - Lead <br> - Nickel <br> - Zinc <br> - Suspended solids <br> - Radium-226 <br> - Un-ionized ammonia |
| **Acutely Lethal Effluent** | An effluent that kills **more than 50%** of test organisms within 96 hours (for rainbow trout, threespine stickleback) or 48 hours (for *Daphnia magna* or *Acartia tonsa*) when tested using standardized biological methods. |
| **Composite Sample** | A mixture of at least three equal volumes (or proportionate to flow) collected over a period of **7 to 24 hours**, either at equal intervals or at a constant rate. Ensures representative sampling. |
| **Grab Sample** | A single sample collected at a specific time; **repealed** in this regulation. |
| **Monthly Mean Concentration** | Average concentration of a deleterious substance measured across all composite or grab samples collected at each final discharge point during a given month. |

### **2. Mine Types and Activities**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Metal Mine** | Any operation involving mining, milling, or hydrometallurgical processing to extract a metal or metal concentrate. Includes associated facilities like smelters or acid plants if effluents are combined with mining effluents. |
| **Diamond Mine** | Any operation related to diamond extraction (including kimberlite processing), or adjacent disturbed areas. |
| **Milling** | Activities such as crushing, grinding, or processing uranium ore or tailings. |
| **Hydrometallurgy** | Extraction of metals via aqueous chemical processes (e.g., acid leaching), excluding thermally pre-treated minerals. |

> Note: **Several terms are repealed** (e.g., "authorization officer," "commercial operation," "transitional authorization") due to changes in policy or regulatory framework (e.g., SOR/2018-99).

## **III. Applicability of the Regulations**

### **Eligible Mines**
The regulations apply to:

#### ✅ **Metal Mines**  
- That **exceed 50 m³/day** of effluent flow (from all final discharge points), **and**  
- Deposit a deleterious substance in any water or place referenced in **subsection 36(3)** of the Fisheries Act  
- **Effective date**: Any time **on or after June 6, 2002**

#### ✅ **Diamond Mines**  
- That **exceed 50 m³/day** of effluent flow, **and**  
- Deposit a deleterious substance in any water or place referenced in subsection 36(3)  
- **Effective date**: Any time **on or after June 1, 2018**

---

### **Exclusions**
The regulations **do not apply** to:
- **Placer mining** (gravity or magnetic extraction from stream sediments)
- **Metal mines** that stopped commercial operations **before June 6, 2002**, unless they resume operations **on or after that date**
- **Diamond mines** that stopped commercial operations **before June 1, 2018**, unless they resume operations **on or after that date**

> Additionally, **recognized closed mines** (under subsection 32(2)) are exempt from these regulations **unless** they return to commercial operation, in which case they lose their "closed mine" status.

---

## **IV. Permitted Discharge Conditions**

An operator may discharge effluent containing deleterious substances **only if**:

1. **Concentration Limits** are not exceeded:
   - For **first-time application (or reopened recognized closed mines)**: Must comply with **Table 1 of Schedule 4**
   - For **all other cases**: Must comply with **Table 2 of Schedule 4**
   - These tables specify **maximum allowable concentrations** of each deleterious substance per effluent type and discharge point.

2. **pH Requirements**:
   - Effluent pH must be **between 6.0 and 9.5 inclusive**.

3. **Non-Acute Lethality**:
   - The effluent must **not be acutely lethal** to aquatic organisms.

> ⚠️ **Exception**:  
> If the effluent is determined to be **acutely lethal** based on the **Reference Method EPS 1/RM/14** (Daphnia magna test) at the required testing frequency (subsection 14(1)), it is **not permitted** to discharge — **unless** it fails the test under *any other* acute lethality test.

---

## **V. Special Provisions for Acutely Lethal Effluents**

- **Acutely lethal effluent is treated as a deleterious substance** and is subject to the same restrictions as other pollutants.
- Despite the general restrictions, operators may **deposit or permit the discharge** of:
  - **Waste rock**
  - **Acutely lethal effluent**
  - Effluent with **any pH or concentration of deleterious substances**  
  — **into a tailings impoundment area** that is:
    - A water body listed in **Schedule 2**, or
    - A **confined disposal area** (by natural or anthropogenic structures),  
    — **except** where the area is a **natural water body frequented by fish**.

> This allows for safe containment of highly toxic effluents in engineered facilities, reducing risks to aquatic ecosystems.

---

## **VI. Prohibited Practices**

- **Effluent Dilution**:  
  Operators **may not combine effluent with water or other effluents** to dilute it before discharge. This prevents under-reporting of pollutant concentrations.

---

## **VII. Environmental Monitoring and Reporting Requirements**

### **1. Monitoring Studies**
- Operators must conduct **environmental effects monitoring studies** in accordance with:
  - Requirements and timelines in **Schedule 5**
  - Use **documented, validated methods** and interpret results using **good scientific practice standards**
- Results must be **recorded and submitted** to the Minister of the Environment.

### **2. Mandatory Reporting (Within 60 Days of Events)**
When any of the following occur, operators must submit written information to the Minister:

| Event | Required Information |
|------|------------------------|
| Mine becomes subject to regulations | Name and address of owner/operator; parent company (if any); design-rated capacity (in tonnes/year) and rationale for its determination |
| Ownership changes | Same as above |
| Mine returns to commercial operation after being a recognized closed mine | Same as above |

> Operators must also report **any changes** to this information within **60 days** of the change.

### **3. Final Discharge Point Reporting**
Within **60 days** of the mine becoming subject to the regulations, operators must submit:

- **Plans, specifications, and general descriptions** of each final discharge point  
- **Location** (latitude and longitude)  
- **Design and maintenance practices** for preventing deleterious substance release  
- **Name of receiving body of water** (if applicable)

> Additional reporting required:
- For **new discharge points**: At least **60 days before** effluent is deposited
- For **changes to existing discharge points**: At least **60 days before** the change is implemented
- For **discharge points identified by an inspector** that were previously unreported: Within **30 days** of identification

---

## **VIII. Effluent Sampling and Testing Requirements**

### **Sampling Frequency**
- **At least once per week**, with **at least 24 hours between samples**
- Must collect:
  - **Grab or composite samples** from each final discharge point
  - **p
