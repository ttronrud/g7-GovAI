The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2010-148, section 8**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed from legal force).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2010-148**, which is a *Statutory Instrument of 2010* (a type of regulatory amendment or legislative instrument in Canada).
- **Repeal Section**: Section 8 of SOR/2010-148 specifically identifies the regulation being repealed.
- **Legal Implication**: Once a regulation is repealed, it no longer applies. Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in that regulation are nullified and replaced—either by a new regulation or by the absence of any rule in that area.
- **Context**: SOR/2010-148 is part of the **Regulations Amending the Canada Labour Code** (or a similar statutory framework), and section 8 likely dealt with a specific provision related to employment standards, workplace safety, or labor rights. However, without the full text of the original regulation or the specific section of SOR/2010-148, the exact subject matter cannot be determined from the given information.

### Key Takeaway:
The repeated references to "[Repealed, SOR/2010-148, s. 8]" indicate that **a particular regulation was formally removed from effect by the government on or around April 15, 2010** (the date SOR/2010-148 came into force), and **no longer holds legal authority**. This means that any prior enforcement, interpretation, or application of that regulation is invalid.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The original regulation has not been provided, so the precise subject (e.g., working hours, leave entitlements, health and safety standards) cannot be confirmed. To understand the full scope of what was repealed, one would need to consult the original regulation or the full text of SOR/2010-148.

### Recommendation:
To obtain the full context, refer to:
- The official **Canada Gazette**, Part I, for the publication of SOR/2010-148.
- The **Government of Canada’s legislative database** (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)) to search for "SOR/2010-148" and section 8.

In summary:  
**This is a notice of repeal — the regulation was officially canceled and is no longer in force.**
