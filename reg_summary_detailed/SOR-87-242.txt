### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations, 1987**

---

#### **Background and Legal Authority**

The regulation is rooted in the **Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act (FPMAA)** and the **Canadian Egg Marketing Agency Proclamation (C.R.C., c. 646)**. The Canadian Egg Marketing Agency (CEMA) was established under subsection 17(1) of the FPMAA to manage the marketing of eggs in Canada. It has been authorized to implement a marketing plan, as specified in the Proclamation.

On **March 26, 1987**, the CEMA, pursuant to **paragraph 23(1)(f)** of the FPMAA and **Section 9 of Part II of the Schedule** to the Proclamation, **revoked the outdated Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations (C.R.C., c. 655)** and introduced a new set of regulations — the **Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations, 1987**.

This change was approved by the **National Farm Products Marketing Council (NFPMC)** on **April 21, 1987**, based on its determination that the new regulations are necessary for the effective administration of the CEMA’s marketing plan.

---

#### **Key Regulatory Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

- To ensure **transparency and accountability** in interprovincial and export egg trade;
- To **prevent fraud, misrepresentation, and market manipulation**;
- To **enforce compliance with federal quotas** (limiting egg production and distribution);
- To **facilitate fair competition** among marketing participants;
- To **support the overall marketing plan** developed by the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency under federal-provincial cooperation.

---

#### **Historical and Legal Context**

- The original licensing regime (C.R.C., c. 655) was replaced due to evolving market conditions and the need for more precise oversight.
- The new regulations reflect a shift toward **targeted licensing**, **facility-based accountability**, and **stronger compliance mechanisms**.
- The reliance on **federal quota systems** underscores the government’s role in managing supply and preventing overproduction.

---

#### **Important Note on Supersession**

- These regulations were **revoked by SOR/88-488, Section 3**, effective in **1988**.  
- This indicates that the 1987 licensing framework was eventually **replaced** by updated regulations, likely due to changes in the marketing plan, market dynamics, or policy shifts.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Canadian Egg Licensing Regulations, 1987** represent a comprehensive, enforceable framework designed to regulate the interprovincial and export marketing of eggs in Canada. By requiring licences, mandating detailed recordkeeping, enforcing quota compliance, and providing clear enforcement procedures, the regulations aimed to ensure fairness, transparency, and stability in the egg marketing system.

While the regulations were a significant step in modernizing egg marketing oversight, their **revocation in 1988** highlights the dynamic nature of agricultural policy and the need for periodic review and adaptation in response to market and regulatory developments.
