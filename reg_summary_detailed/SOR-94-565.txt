### **Privileges and Immunities Granted**

#### **1. Privileges and Immunities for the CITEL Meetings Themselves**  
- **Period:** From **August 20, 1994, to September 2, 1994**  
- **Scope:** The CITEL Meetings (as an international organization) shall have in Canada the privileges and immunities specified in **Article II of the Convention**.  
- **Article II of the Convention** typically includes:
  - **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., immunity from being sued or subject to arrest in Canada)
  - **Exemption from taxation** (e.g., no Canadian income tax on funds or activities related to the meetings)
  - **Exemption from search and seizure** of property or documents
  - **Freedom to conduct official business** without interference from Canadian authorities  
- These immunities are granted **only to the extent required for the exercise of the organization’s functions in Canada**.

> *Note:* The immunity is limited and conditional—only as necessary to allow CITEL to carry out its official duties during the specified period.

#### **2. Privileges and Immunities for Delegates and Spouses**  
- **Period:** Same as above — **August 20, 1994, to September 2, 1994**  
- **Who is covered:**  
  - Delegates accredited to attend the sessions of the CITEL Meetings  
  - Their spouses (i.e., spouses of delegates)  
- **Scope:** These individuals shall have in Canada the privileges and immunities set out in **Article IV of the Convention**, to the extent required for the exercise of their functions related to the CITEL Meetings.  
- **Article IV of the Convention** typically includes:
  - **Immunity from legal process** (e.g., protection from arrest or prosecution for acts performed in the course of official duties)
  - **Exemption from taxation** (e.g., personal income tax on income earned from official duties)
  - **Freedom of movement and residence** in Canada
  - **Exemption from certain administrative or customs restrictions**  
- Again, these privileges are **limited and conditional**, applying only as needed to fulfill their official roles.

---

### **Legal Basis and Rationale**

- The Order is authorized under **Section 5 of the Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act**, which allows the Governor in Council to grant privileges and immunities to international organizations and their representatives when they are conducting activities in Canada.
- The use of the **UN Convention** as a model reflects Canada’s recognition of international norms and the principle of non-interference in the operations of legitimate international bodies.
- Although CITEL is not a United Nations body, it is considered a **regional international organization** with similar functions and purposes, and thus qualifies for similar treatment under Canadian law.

---

### **Temporal Limitation**

The privileges and immunities are **time-bound** and only apply during the specific period from **August 20, 1994, to September 2, 1994**.  
This indicates that the Order was enacted for a **specific event or meeting** of CITEL, likely to facilitate the organization’s session in Canada during that time.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Facilitates International Cooperation:** Enables CITEL to operate effectively in Canada without legal or administrative barriers.
- **Respects International Law:** Aligns Canada’s domestic law with international norms governing diplomatic and intergovernmental activities.
- **Protects Officials:** Ensures delegates can perform their duties without fear of legal action or interference.
- **Temporary in Nature:** The Order is not a permanent grant; it is limited to a specific event, reflecting the principle that such immunities are granted only when needed.

### **Conclusion**

The *CITEL Meetings Privileges and Immunities Order* is a **temporary, targeted legislative measure** that grants the Meetings of the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) and its delegates specific legal privileges and immunities during a defined period in 1994. These are derived from the *Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations* and are limited to what is necessary for the organization’s functioning in Canada. The Order underscores Canada’s commitment to supporting international cooperation in telecommunications and respecting international legal frameworks.
