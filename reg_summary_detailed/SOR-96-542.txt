**Detailed Summary of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Deposit Insurance Information By-law (1996)**

---

### **Overview**

The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) adopted this **Deposit Insurance Information By-law** on **December 4, 1996**, under **paragraph 11(2)(f)a of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (CDIC Act)**. This by-law establishes detailed rules governing how member financial institutions (such as banks and credit unions) must communicate information about their status as CDIC members, the nature of insured deposits, and the limits of deposit insurance coverage.

The primary objective of the by-law is to **ensure transparency, accuracy, and consistency** in how member institutions present information to the public — particularly regarding:
- What constitutes a deposit,
- Whether a deposit is insured by CDIC,
- The institution’s membership status,
- And the maximum insurance coverage available.

It also includes provisions for **prohibiting misleading statements**, **standardizing disclosures**, and **ensuring public access to key information**, especially during transitional periods for new members.
