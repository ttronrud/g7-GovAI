### **4. Legal Status and Effect of the Proclamation**

By this proclamation, the Governor General declares that:

- The land described above **shall henceforth be a penitentiary**.
- It is to be known officially as the **Saskatchewan Penitentiary**.
- The designation applies **to both the Province of Saskatchewan and the Province of Alberta**, despite the land being located solely in Saskatchewan.
- This reflects a **cross-provincial administrative function**, possibly due to historical or jurisdictional reasons, such as shared responsibility for correctional services or regional oversight.

### **5. Legal and Administrative Implications**

- **Ownership and Use:** The land is no longer privately owned or used for general purposes. It is now **held in trust** for the operation of a correctional institution.
- **Regulatory Authority:** The Penitentiary Act governs all aspects of the land’s use, including access, development, and management.
- **Public Notice:** All individuals, institutions, and authorities are required to **take notice** of this proclamation and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- **Legal Binding Force:** As a proclamation made under the authority of the Crown and sealed with the Great Seal of Canada, it is a **binding legal instrument** under Canadian law.

### **6. Historical and Geographic Context**

- The site is located near **Prince Albert, Saskatchewan**, a central city in the province.
- The land lies adjacent to the **North Saskatchewan River**, the **Canadian National Railway**, and major roads (especially Twentieth Avenue West).
- The inclusion of a **cemetery** (Anglican Synod of Saskatchewan) in Parcel C suggests that the land was historically part of a broader settlement or urban development.
- The use of **survey plan references** (e.g., Prince Albert Settlement Registered Plan No. A.W. 1216, signed by William Christie in 1937) indicates that the land has a long-standing legal and administrative history.

---

### **7. Significance of the Proclamation**

- This proclamation marks the **formal establishment of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary** as a government-owned correctional facility.
- It reflects the **centralized role of the federal government** in managing penitentiary infrastructure, even in provincial jurisdictions.
- It establishes a **legal precedent** for the use of proclamations to designate land for correctional purposes under the Penitentiary Act.
- The inclusion of both Alberta and Saskatchewan in the designation, despite the land being in Saskatchewan, may reflect a **regional correctional policy** or shared administrative responsibility.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This 1956 Proclamation is a foundational legal document that:

- **Designates a specific tract of land in Saskatchewan** as the **Saskatchewan Penitentiary**.
- **Establishes the legal status** of the land under the Penitentiary Act.
- **Provides detailed boundary descriptions** using survey references and geographic markers.
