**Detailed Summary of the *Mutual Property and Casualty Insurance Company with Non-mutual Policyholders Conversion Regulations***

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Insurance Companies Act* (Act), govern the **conversion of a mutual property and casualty insurance company into a company with common shares** — commonly referred to as a "conversion" — while ensuring **fairness, transparency, and stakeholder participation**, particularly for policyholders who hold both **mutual and non-mutual policies**.

The key objective is to allow mutual insurance companies to transition to a **share-based structure** (i.e., a publicly or privately held company with common shares), thereby enabling access to broader capital markets and operational flexibility, while protecting the interests of policyholders — especially those who have historically had voting rights under mutual arrangements.

This process is designed to be **democratic, transparent, and legally robust**, involving extensive consultation, independent expert review, judicial oversight, and structured negotiations between policyholder groups.

## **Step-by-Step Process of Conversion**

### **1. Initiation of Conversion (Resolution & Proposal Development)**

- Directors must pass a **resolution recommending conversion**, which must:
  - Specify a **date before the eligibility date** by which any mutual policy issued **after the eligibility date** must be applied for to qualify as an eligible mutual policyholder.
  - Identify **any group of non-mutual policyholders** (other than those holding policies for 12 months) who will qualify as eligible non-mutual policyholders.

> This ensures that only those with clear, verifiable ties to the company can participate in the conversion process.

---

### **2. Extension of Voting Rights to Eligible Non-mutual Policyholders**

- Before seeking the Superintendent’s authorization to send a notice, the converting company must:
  - Ensure that the **conversion proposal** complies with sections 5 to 13.
  - **Extend the right to vote** on the conversion and its authorization to **all eligible non-mutual policyholders** at a **special meeting** (as required by section 14).

> This is a critical democratic step — non-mutual policyholders, who previously had no voting rights, now gain a voice in the conversion decision.

---

### **3. Special Resolution by Eligible Mutual Policyholders**

- **Not less than 30 days and not more than 45 days after the eligibility date**, eligible mutual policyholders must vote by **special resolution** on whether to **negotiate with eligible non-mutual policyholders** regarding:
