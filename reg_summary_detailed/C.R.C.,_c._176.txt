**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Bean Order**

---

**1. Citation and Purpose**  
The regulation is officially titled the *Ontario Bean Order* and serves as a legal instrument under the *Farm Products Marketing Act* of Ontario (Act). Its primary purpose is to establish the framework for the regulation of the marketing of specific types of beans—white pea beans and yellow-eye beans—produced within the Province of Ontario. This Order provides detailed provisions governing how these beans are marketed, particularly in interprovincial and export trade, and outlines the powers and responsibilities of key regulatory bodies.

**2. Key Definitions**  
The Order defines several critical terms used throughout the regulation:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Farm Products Marketing Act of Ontario* (Loi), which provides the statutory foundation for the regulation of agricultural commodities, including beans. This Act authorizes the Board and the Commodity Board to regulate marketing activities.

- **Beans**: Specifically defined as *white pea beans* and *yellow-eye beans* produced in Ontario. This definition limits the scope of the Order to these two bean varieties, ensuring clarity and consistency in application.

- **Board**: Refers to *The Farm Products Marketing Board of Ontario* (Régie), a provincial body established under the Act to oversee the marketing of farm products, including beans, across the province and beyond.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to *The Ontario Bean Producers’ Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation), a specialized body created under the Act to manage the marketing of beans specifically. It operates under the broader framework of the Farm Products Marketing Act.

- **Plan**: Denotes any marketing plan for beans established and amended over time under the Act. Any regulations made to implement or adapt this Plan are also considered part of the "Plan." This ensures flexibility and responsiveness to market conditions.

**3. Regulatory Authority and Scope**  
Both the **Board** and the **Commodity Board** are granted broad powers to regulate the marketing of beans in:

- **Interprovincial trade** (trade between Ontario and other provinces),
- **Export trade** (trade outside of Canada).

For these purposes, they may exercise all or any powers that they would otherwise have in relation to the *local marketing* of beans within Ontario. This means that the same rules and enforcement mechanisms used for domestic sales can be applied to out-of-province and international transactions, ensuring consistency in pricing, quality, and market access.

This provision enhances the regulatory coherence of bean marketing, enabling the Boards to apply uniform standards across different markets.

**4. Specific Authority of the Commodity Board**  
The Commodity Board is granted specific powers related to **levies and charges** in the context of interprovincial and export trade. These powers are derived from Section 3 of the *Farm Products Marketing Act* and are critical to the financial sustainability and equity of the bean marketing system.

Key elements of this authority include:

- **Power to Make Orders**: The Commodity Board can issue orders to:
  - Fix levies or charges,
  - Impose them on individuals or entities,
  - Collect them from producers or marketers of beans.

- **Classification of Producers**: The Board may classify producers into different groups (e.g., based on farm size, production volume, region, or type of operation). Each group may be subject to different levy or charge amounts, allowing for equitable and targeted financial obligations.

- **Purpose of Levies and Charges**:
  - To fund the **creation of reserves** (financial buffers for future market downturns),
  - To cover **operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of beans,
  - To facilitate **equalization or adjustment** among producers. This means that if some producers benefit from higher prices during a period, the Commodity Board can redistribute those gains to others who may have faced lower returns, promoting fairness and stability in the industry.

- **Time Periods**: The Commodity Board may determine the duration of these levies or adjustments. For example, adjustments may apply over a single year or across multiple years depending on market performance and economic conditions.

> **Note**: A section of this regulation, specifically the part concerning the Commodity Board’s levy powers, was **revoked by SOR/80-90** (Statutory Order 80-90). This indicates that the original levy authority may no longer be in force as of that date. However, the rest of the Order remains valid and in effect, suggesting that the structure and definitions remain relevant even if the specific levy provisions have been removed.

**5. Implications and Significance**  
Although the levy provisions have been revoked, the Order remains a foundational document in Ontario’s bean marketing system. Its significance lies in:

- Establishing clear governance structures (Board and Commodity Board) for bean marketing,
- Defining the scope of beans subject to regulation,
- Ensuring that both domestic and international trade are subject to consistent regulatory oversight,
- Providing a mechanism (via the Plan) for market stability through pricing, reserves, and equitable distribution of income.

The revocation of the levy power suggests a shift in policy—possibly due to economic changes, administrative review, or the introduction of alternative mechanisms (e.g., cooperative pricing, insurance, or market-based adjustments). However, the underlying framework for regulation, classification, and financial management continues to support the industry.

**Conclusion**  
The *Ontario Bean Order* is a key regulatory instrument that governs the marketing of white pea and yellow-eye beans produced in Ontario. It empowers the Ontario Bean Producers’ Marketing Board and the Farm Products Marketing Board to regulate both domestic and international trade with a high degree of flexibility. While the specific authority to impose levies has been revoked, the Order remains vital for defining the structure, responsibilities, and objectives of bean marketing in Ontario. It supports market stability, producer equity, and long-term financial planning through the use of reserves, expense coverage, and income equalization—principles that remain central to agricultural marketing policy.
