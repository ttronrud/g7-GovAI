**Detailed Summary of the Mackenzie Valley Land Use Regulations (S.C. 1998, c. 25)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Mackenzie Valley Land Use Regulations* (S.C. 1998, c. 25) are a set of administrative rules established under the **Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act (MVRMA)**. These regulations govern the use of land in the Mackenzie Valley region of the Northwest Territories (NWT), particularly in relation to activities requiring permits. The regulations were developed through consultation with First Nations and are designed to balance economic development, environmental protection, cultural preservation, and Indigenous rights.

The regulations define key terms, establish permit requirements based on activity type and location, and include provisions for environmental protection, land restoration, and emergency exceptions.

---

## **I. Legal Basis and Authority**

- The regulations were made by **His Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**, under specific provisions of the MVRMA:
  - **Section 59, subsection 72(3)** – Authority to issue land use regulations.
  - **Sections 86 and 90** – Provide for permit systems and regulatory oversight.

This legislative process ensures that the regulations are informed by Indigenous input and align with broader land management goals.

| **Type C Permit** | Required under Tlicho or Déline laws for specific uses on Tlicho or Déline lands where Type A/B are not needed. |
| **Watercourse** | Natural flowing or standing water (streams, springs, swamps), but excludes groundwater. |

> *Note:* Some provisions (e.g., waste disposal, monument protection) have been **repealed** (SOR/2013-166, s. 6, 8), indicating ongoing legal refinement.

## **III. Scope and Applicability**

### **Applicability**
- Applies to **all land uses** in the Mackenzie Valley **except**:
  1. Activities authorized under **grazing or agricultural leases** after initial clearing.
  2. Certain traditional or Indigenous activities:
     - Harvesting and cabin construction for harvesting (as per land claim agreements)
     - Hunting, trapping, fishing
     - Prospecting, staking, or locating mineral claims

> This reflects recognition of Indigenous rights and traditional practices under land claim agreements.

### **Exclusions**
- Activities that do not involve equipment/materials listed in **Sections 4 or 5** (the core permit thresholds) are exempt from permit requirements.
- These exclusions ensure flexibility for Indigenous communities and subsistence activities.

## **IV. Permit Requirements (Type A and Type B)**

### **Type A Permit (High-Impact Activities)**

Required when any of the following occur **outside local government boundaries**:

| Activity | Threshold |
|--------|----------|
| Use of explosives ≥ 150 kg in 30 days | ❌ Prohibited without permit |
| Use of vehicle or machine ≥ 10 tonnes (except on roads, landfills, quarries, airports) | ❌ Prohibited |
| Use of single fuel container ≥ 4,000 L | ❌ Prohibited |
| Use of self-propelled earth-moving machine (e.g., bulldozers) | ❌ Prohibited unless for grooming trails |
| Levelling/grading/clearing of line/trail/right-of-way > 1.5 m wide and > 4 ha in area | ❌ Prohibited (except for recreational trail grooming) |

**On land within or outside local government boundaries:**

| Activity | Threshold |
|--------|----------|
| Use of motorized earth-drilling machinery ≥ 2.5 tonnes (excluding drill rods, bits, etc.) | ❌ Prohibited unless for pile/drill holes or setting explosives |
| Use of campsite outside territorial park for ≥ 400 person-days | ❌ Prohibited |
| Establishment of fuel storage facility ≥ 80,000 L | ❌ Prohibited |

> These thresholds protect sensitive ecosystems and reduce risk of environmental damage.

---

### **Type B Permit (Moderate-Impact Activities)**

Required when any of the following occur **outside local government boundaries**:

| Activity | Threshold |
|--------|----------|
| Use of explosives 50–149 kg in 30 days | ❌ Requires permit |
| Use of vehicle ≥ 5 tonnes or exerting ≥ 35 kPa ground pressure (except on roads, landfills, quarries, airports) | ❌ Requires permit |
| Fuel storage facility 4,000–80,000 L | ❌ Requires permit |
| Fuel container 2,000–4,000 L | ❌ Requires permit |
