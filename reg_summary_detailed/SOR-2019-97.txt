**Detailed Summary of the *Corded Window Coverings Regulations* (S.C. 2016, c. 9, s. 67)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Corded Window Coverings Regulations* are a set of safety standards introduced under the *Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)*. These regulations were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Health, pursuant to **section 37a of the CCPSA**, which empowers the government to establish safety requirements for consumer products.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **prevent strangulation hazards** associated with corded window coverings—particularly those that pose a risk to young children. The regulations apply to all indoor window coverings (such as blinds, shades, or curtains) that are equipped with at least one cord.

These rules were **repealed and replaced** by the *Corded Window Coverings Regulations* in 2016, and they came into force on the **second anniversary of their publication in the Canada Gazette, Part II** (effective May 1, 2021).

### **Key Definitions**

1. **Cord**  
   - Any component that can fold in every direction when tension is removed.  
   - Includes bands, ropes, straps, strings, chains, wires, or combinations of such components connected end-to-end.  
   - The definition emphasizes flexibility and potential for entanglement.

2. **Corded Window Covering**  
   - An indoor window covering that has **at least one cord** attached to it.

3. **Loop**  
   - A shape formed by a reachable cord that creates a **completely bounded opening** (e.g., a circular or oval shape formed by a cord).  
   - A loop is considered hazardous if it can be accessed by a child and is large enough to pose a strangulation risk.

4. **Reachable**  
   - Refers to any part of a cord that a person (especially a child) can physically touch when the window covering is installed—regardless of whether it is fully open, closed, or in between positions.

---

### **Safety Requirements**

#### 1. **Detachment Resistance for Small Parts**
- Every part of a corded window covering that is:
  - Accessible to a child, and  
  - Small enough to fit entirely within a **small parts cylinder** (as illustrated in *Schedule 1*)  
  must be **affixed securely** to the covering.
- The part must **not detach** when subjected to a force of **90 N** applied in any direction.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Prevents small detachable parts (e.g., plastic clips, beads, or small components) from becoming loose and posing a choking hazard.

---

#### 2. **Lead Content Limit**
- All **external components** of corded window coverings must not contain more than **90 mg/kg of lead**.
- Testing must follow the **OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (ENV/MC/CHEM(98)17)**, specifically the English version dated January 21, 1998, and the French version dated March 6, 1998.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Limits toxic lead exposure, which can be harmful, especially to children.

---

#### 3. **Non-Reachability of Cords**
- A cord that is **not reachable** (i.e., out of a child’s reach) must **remain unreachable** throughout the entire useful life of the product—whether the window covering is fully open, closed, or in any intermediate position.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Prevents children from accessing cords during normal use or accidental movement.

---

#### 4. **Maximum Cord Length (Reachable Cords)**
- **Cord with one free end**:
  - Must not exceed **22 cm** in length when pulled gradually with a force of **35 N**.
- **Cord with no free end** (e.g., looped or fixed):
  - Must not exceed **22 cm** between two consecutive contact points under the same 35 N pull.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Reduces the risk of a child being able to grasp and pull a long cord, which could lead to entanglement or strangulation.

---

#### 5. **Loop Size Limit**
- When a reachable cord is pulled with **35 N**, the **perimeter of any loop** (existing, created, or enlarged) must not exceed **44 cm**.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Prevents the formation of large loops that could trap a child’s neck or head.

---

#### 6. **Connection of Two Reachable Cords**
- If two cords (each with one free end) can be connected end-to-end after being pulled with 35 N:
  - The **combined length** must not exceed **22 cm**.
  - The **perimeter of the resulting loop** must not exceed **44 cm**.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures even if cords are joined, the total length and loop size remain safe.

---

### **Labeling and Information Requirements**

All required information must be:

- **In both English and French** (bilingual compliance).
- **Legible, prominent, and clearly displayed**.
- **High contrast** between text and background (e.g., black text on white background).
- **Visible throughout the product’s useful life** under normal transportation, storage, sale, and use.
- **Indelibly printed** on the product itself or on a **permanently affixed label**.

#### **Typeface Requirements**
- Must use a **standard sans-serif font**.
- Must be:
  - **Not compressed, expanded, or decorative**.
  - Have a **large x-height** relative to ascenders or descenders (as shown in *Schedule 2*).
  - Measured using uppercase or lowercase letters with ascenders or descenders (e.g., “b” or “p”).

#### **Minimum Font Sizes**
- **"Warning" and "Mise en garde"**:
  - Must be in **bold, uppercase**, and **not less than 5 mm** in height.
- **All other required information**:
  - Must be in **type not less than 2.5 mm** in height.

### **Mandatory Information on Every Product**

The following details must appear on every corded window covering and on any packaging:

| Information | Details |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model name or number** | Clearly identified. |
| **Date of manufacture** | Year and either month or week (e.g., 2023–05 or 2023–21). |
| **Manufacturer details** | If made in Canada: name and principal place of business. |
| **Importer details** | If imported: name and principal place of business of the manufacturer and importer. |

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures transparency and traceability for consumer safety and recalls.

---

### **Instructions Required**

Every corded window covering must include instructions in text, drawings, or photographs (or a combination):

1. **Assembly instructions** (if sold unassembled) including a **quantitative list of parts**.
2. **Installation instructions**.
3. **Operating instructions** (how to open/close, adjust, etc.).

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Empowers consumers to install and use the product safely.

---

### **Mandatory Safety Warning**

A standardized warning must appear on:
- The product itself,
- Packaging,
- Instructions,
- And all advertisements.

#### **English Warning:**
> **WARNING**  
> STRANGULATION HAZARD — Young children can be strangled by cords. Immediately remove this product if a cord longer than 22 cm or a loop exceeding 44 cm around becomes accessible.

#### **French Warning:**
> **MISE EN GARDE**  
> RISQUE D’ÉTRANGLEMENT — Les enfants en bas âge peuvent s’étrangler avec des cordes. Enlevez immédiatement ce produit si une corde mesurant plus de 22 cm devient accessible ou si le contour d’une boucle de plus de 44 cm devient accessible.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Provides clear, actionable safety guidance to parents and caregivers.

---

### **Repeal of Previous Regulations**

- The *Corded Window Covering Products Regulations* (prior version) are **fully repealed** by these new regulations.

> 🔍 *Purpose*: Ensures regulatory modernization and alignment with current safety science and best practices.

---

### **Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the **second anniversary** of their publication in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*.
- As of **May 1, 2021**, the regulations were in full effect.
