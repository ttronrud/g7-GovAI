**Detailed Summary of the Marketing Authorization for Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for Veterinary Drugs in Foods**

---

**Regulatory Basis and Authority**  
This Marketing Authorization is issued by the **Minister of Health** under specific provisions of the *Food and Drugs Act*:

- **Subsection 30.3(1)a** and **30.5(1)a** of the *Food and Drugs Act*  
These sections grant the Minister the authority to establish and enforce maximum residue limits (MRLs) for veterinary drugs in food products. The authorization enables the government to define safe levels of veterinary drug residues that may remain in food after animal treatment, thereby protecting public health.

**Legal Citation**  
- **S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 416** (Statutory Citation)  
- **R.S., c. F-27** (Regulations: Food and Drug Regulations)  
This authorization is formally registered and comes into force upon registration.

**Date of Issue**  
- **Ottawa, May 1, 2013**  
This marks the official date when the authorization was issued and is legally effective from that point forward.

**Key Definitions and References**

- **"List"** refers to the *List of Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for Veterinary Drugs in Foods*, published by the Department of Health on its official website.  
  - The List is **subject to periodic amendments** and updates, meaning any changes to MRLs are reflected in the current version accessible online.  
  - The List is the primary reference document for determining acceptable residue levels.

- **Words and expressions** used in the List have the **same meaning as defined in Part B of the Food and Drug Regulations**.  
  This ensures consistency in interpretation and application across regulatory contexts, particularly regarding terms like "veterinary drug," "metabolite," "food," and "residue."

**Core Provision: Exemption from Prohibitions**

When the following conditions are met, a food product is **exempt from the application of paragraphs 4(1)(a) and (4)(d) of the Food and Drugs Act**:

1. **Presence of a veterinary drug or its metabolite**  
   - The substance must be one listed in **Column I** of the MRL List.  
   - It must be **analyzed and identified as the substance named in Column II** (i.e., the specific chemical form detected in the food).

2. **Presence in a specific food product**  
   - The drug or metabolite must be found in a food listed in **Column III** of the List (e.g., milk, eggs, meat, or other specific food categories).

3. **Residue level does not exceed the MRL**  
   - The **amount of the substance** in the food must be **equal to or below the maximum residue limit** specified in **Column IV** of the List for that particular food.

4. **All other conditions in Column IV are met**  
   - The List may include **additional requirements** (e.g., specific treatment protocols, withdrawal periods, or analytical methods) that must also be satisfied for the exemption to apply.  
   - These conditions ensure that the exemption is not applied in cases where residues could pose a risk to human health or safety.

**Purpose and Public Health Significance**

This Marketing Authorization serves several key functions:

- **Protects public health** by establishing scientifically based thresholds for veterinary drug residues in food.  
- **Enables safe food production** by allowing the use of veterinary drugs in livestock under controlled conditions, provided residues are kept within safe limits.  
- **Provides legal clarity** for food producers, processors, regulators, and importers by defining when a food product is exempt from strict prohibitions on veterinary drug residues.

---

**Effective Date**  
- The authorization **comes into force on the day it is registered** — **May 1, 2013**.  
  This means that from that date onward, the MRLs and associated exemptions in the List are legally enforceable and apply to all relevant food products and veterinary drug use.

---

**Conclusion**  
This Marketing Authorization is a critical regulatory tool that balances the need for effective veterinary medicine in animal health with the imperative to ensure food safety. By setting clear, science-based maximum residue limits and defining conditions under which food is exempt from prohibitions, it supports responsible animal treatment while safeguarding consumer health. The regulation is dynamic, relying on an up-to-date List published and maintained by the Department of Health, ensuring that standards evolve with new scientific evidence and regulatory needs.

**Key Takeaway**:  
Food containing veterinary drug residues (or metabolites) is exempt from certain restrictions under the *Food and Drugs Act* **only if** the residue level is within the legally defined maximum and all conditions in the List are satisfied. This exemption is conditional, precautionary, and strictly tied to the scientific and regulatory framework established in the MRL List.
