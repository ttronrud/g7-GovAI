**Detailed Summary of the National Capital Commission Animal Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *National Capital Commission Animal Regulations* were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, under **subsection 20(1) of the National Capital Act**. These regulations establish specific rules governing the presence, behavior, and management of domestic animals on National Capital Commission (NCC) lands, including both unleased and leased properties. The primary objectives are to **protect public safety, preserve natural environments, maintain property integrity, and ensure responsible animal ownership**.

The regulations apply to all domestic animals (defined as non-fish, domesticated vertebrates) and regulate their use in various settings across NCC-managed lands in the National Capital Region (e.g., Ottawa and Gatineau).
