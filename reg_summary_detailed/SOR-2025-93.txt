## **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **limit the retail sale of natural health products (NHPs) containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine** — substances known to have potential for misuse in the illicit production of controlled drugs (such as methamphetamine) — due to the **risk of harm to public health** when used outside their intended medical purposes.

This regulation introduces **specific controls on who can sell these products**, **how they can be sold**, and **under what conditions**, aiming to prevent unauthorized access and misuse while allowing limited, regulated access through licensed pharmacy professionals.

## **Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Combination Product** | A natural health product that contains ephedrine or its salts, pseudoephedrine or its salts, or a combination of both, **in addition to one or more other substances listed in Schedule 1 of the Natural Health Products Regulations**. |
| **Non-Combination Product** | A natural health product containing **only** ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or their salts, or a combination of those ingredients — no other substances listed in Schedule 1. |
| **Pharmacist** | As defined in subsection C.01.001(1) of the Food and Drug Regulations — refers to a licensed pharmacist registered under the Health Professions Act. |
| **Regulations** | Refers to the *Natural Health Products Regulations* (NHP Regulations). |

> All terms used in this Order are interpreted consistently with their definitions in the NHP Regulations unless otherwise specified.

---

## **Scope of Application**

- **Applies to**: The **sale of both combination and non-combination products** containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.
- **Exclusions**:
  1. Sales for **clinical trials** that are governed under **Part 4 of the NHP Regulations**.
  2. **Distribution as samples** under **section 103.4** of the Regulations.

> This means the rules do not apply to research settings or promotional sample distributions.

---

## **Core Provisions and Restrictions**

### 1. **General Prohibition on Retail Sales**
> **Subsection (2)**: *Subject to subsections (3) to (5), a person must not sell a combination product or non-combination product at the retail level.*

This establishes a **broad ban** on retail sales of ephedrine/pseudoephedrine-containing NHPs, unless specific exceptions apply.

---

### 2. **Permitted Sales by Pharmacists or Supervised Personnel**

#### ✅ **Non-Combination Product – Restricted Access**
- A **pharmacist** or a person **working under the supervision of a pharmacist** may sell a **non-combination product** at the retail level **only if it is not accessible to the public for self-selection**.
- This means:
  - The product must be **available only upon request**.
  - It cannot be placed on open shelves where consumers can freely choose it.
  - The sale must involve **direct interaction** with a pharmacist or supervised staff.

> *Example:* A customer asks a pharmacist for a non-combination ephedrine product; the pharmacist checks the need and provides it after a consultation.

---

#### ✅ **Combination Product – Self-Selection with Pharmacist Availability**
- A **pharmacist or other retail staff** may sell a **combination product** that is **accessible to the public for self-selection** — **only if**:
  - A **pharmacist is physically present and available** at the retail location.
  - The purchaser **requests a discussion** with the pharmacist **before purchase**.

> *Example:* A customer picks up a combination product (e.g., ephedrine + antihistamine) from a shelf, but is required to speak with a pharmacist to discuss its use, risks, and appropriateness.

> This ensures **professional oversight** even when the product is available on display.

---

#### ✅ **Combination Product – No Public Access (Supervised Sale)**
- A **pharmacist or a person working under their supervision** may sell a **combination product** at the retail level **without making it accessible to the public for self-selection**.
- This allows for **private, controlled dispensing**, similar to non-combination products.

> *Example:* A pharmacist dispenses a combination product directly to a patient during a consultation — no public display.

---

### 3. **Prohibition on Resale**
> A person must **not sell a combination or non-combination product to another person for further retail sale** — **unless the recipient is a pharmacist**.

This prevents **secondary distribution** of these products (e.g., selling to friends, online retailers, or unlicensed sellers), which could lead to misuse or diversion.

> *This effectively closes off unauthorized retail channels.*

---

## **Interpretation and Integration with Existing Regulations**

- The **existing NHP Regulations apply** to both combination and non-combination products.
- However, **references to “these Regulations”** in key sections — specifically:
  - Paragraphs **18(1)(a)** and **39(1)(a)**  
  - Section **92** of the NHP Regulations  
  — are **to be interpreted as including this Order**.

> This ensures that the supplementary rules are **fully integrated** into the regulatory framework and take precedence where applicable.

---

## **Effective Date**

- The Order **comes into force on May 18, 2025**.
- If the Order is **registered later than May 18, 2025**, it will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This provides a clear timeline for compliance by retailers, pharmacies, and distributors.

## **Key Objectives and Public Health Rationale**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prevent misuse** | Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are precursors to methamphetamine. Unregulated access increases risk of illicit drug manufacturing. |
| **Ensure professional oversight** | Only pharmacists or supervised personnel can handle these products, ensuring proper education and risk assessment. |
| **Protect vulnerable populations** | Limits self-selection, which may lead to overuse or incorrect use, especially among youth or those without medical guidance. |
| **Align with international standards** | Reflects global trends in regulating stimulant-containing NHPs to prevent diversion. |

---

## **Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Pharmacies** | Must implement new protocols for product availability, pharmacist availability, and customer consultations. May need to reorganize product displays and staff training. |
| **Retailers (non-pharmacies)** | Cannot sell ephedrine/pseudoephedrine products at retail level — must stop such sales immediately. |
| **Consumers** | Will have limited access to these products — only through pharmacist-led consultations or direct pharmacist dispensing. |
| **Distributors/Manufacturers** | Must ensure products are labeled correctly and distributed only to compliant channels. |
| **Healthcare Providers** | Increased role in patient education and risk assessment before dispensing. |

## **Conclusion**

This supplementary regulation represents a **significant tightening of controls** on the sale of natural health products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. It reflects the **Minister of Health’s concern** about the potential for these substances to be misused or diverted for illegal drug production.

By restricting retail access, requiring pharmacist involvement, and banning resale, the Order **prioritizes public health and safety** while maintaining a **balanced approach** that allows for legitimate medical use under professional supervision.

It is a **critical step in modernizing the regulatory framework** for natural health products, aligning Canada’s policies with both public health imperatives and international best practices.

> **Final Note**: This Order is not a standalone law but a **supplementary rule** under the *Food and Drugs Act* and the *Natural Health Products Regulations*, designed to address specific risks associated with ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. It should be read in conjunction with the full NHP Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations.
