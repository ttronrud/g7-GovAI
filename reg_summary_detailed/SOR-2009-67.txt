**Detailed Summary of the Radiocommunication Act (subsection 4(1) and paragraph 9(1)(b)) Exemption Order (Security, Safety and International Relations), No. 2009–1**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
This exemption order was issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **subsection 3(2)a of the Radiocommunication Act**. This provision grants the government the authority to create exemptions from certain provisions of the Act when necessary for national security, safety, or international relations.

The order is formally referenced in:
- **S.C. 2006, c. 9, s. 34** (Statutory authority for exemptions)
- **R.S., c. R-2; S.C. 1989, c. 17, s. 2** (Relevant provisions of the Radiocommunication Act)

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this exemption is to **allow the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)** — acting on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada — to **interfere with or obstruct radiocommunications** in specific geographic areas within the **National Capital Region (NCR)** of Canada, **without being subject to the normal regulatory requirements** of the Radiocommunication Act.

This exemption is specifically justified for **security, safety, or international relations** purposes, where such interference may be essential to protect national interests.

### **3. Scope of the Exemption**
#### **Who is Exempted?**
- **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, represented by the **Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)**, is exempt from the application of:
  - **Subsection 4(1)** of the Radiocommunication Act
  - **Paragraph 9(1)(b)** of the Radiocommunication Act

> These provisions normally regulate the use, installation, operation, or possession of radio apparatus that interferes with or obstructs radiocommunications — which would otherwise require licensing or regulatory approval.

#### **When Does the Exemption Apply?**
- The exemption **comes into force on the day of registration**.
- It becomes effective on **February 19, 2009** — the date specified in the Order.

#### **Geographic Limitation**
The exemption is **limited to a specific area within the National Capital Region of Ontario and Quebec**, defined by a quadrilateral bounded by the following geographic coordinates:

| Point | Latitude | Longitude |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| A | 45°27′ N | 75°43′ W |
| B | 45°29′ N | 75°42′ W |
| C | 45°19′ N | 75°35′ W |
| D | 45°17′ N | 75°42′ W |

This area corresponds to a defined region centered around **Ottawa**, the capital of Canada, and includes parts of the **National Capital Region** where critical security, safety, or diplomatic operations may require temporary radio interference.

> This geographic restriction ensures that the exemption is not broadly applied across Canada, minimizing unintended disruption to civilian or commercial radio services.

### **4. Conditions for the Exemption to Apply**

#### **For Subsection 4(1) – Interference with Radiocommunications**
The exemption applies **only if**:
- The radio apparatus is installed, operated, or possessed **with the specific intent** to interfere with or obstruct a radiocommunication **in accordance with subsection 4(2)** of this Order.
- The interference is conducted **for one of the following purposes**:
  - **Security**
  - **Safety**
  - **International relations**

> This ensures that the use of interference is not arbitrary or for commercial or non-essential purposes.

#### **For Paragraph 9(1)(b) – Obstruction of Radiocommunications**
The exemption applies **only if**:
- The radiocommunication is interfered with or obstructed **for the purpose of security, safety, or international relations**.

> This reinforces the principle that such interference must serve a legitimate and high-level national interest.

---

### **5. Principle of Minimization**
To prevent unnecessary disruption, the Order mandates that:
> *"Every reasonable effort shall be made to confine or restrict to the extent possible interference with or obstruction of a radiocommunication referred to in subsection (1) to the smallest physical area, the fewest number of frequencies, and the minimum duration required to accomplish the objectives of the interference or obstruction."*

This principle reflects a **principle of proportionality and necessity**:
- Interference should be **targeted and limited**.
- The scope (geographic, frequency, time) must be **as narrow as possible** while still achieving the intended outcome (e.g., neutralizing a threat, protecting a sensitive operation, or supporting diplomatic negotiations).

---

### **6. Key Implications**
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: Allows law enforcement (specifically the RCMP) to take action in high-risk scenarios without being bound by standard licensing or interference rules.
- **National Security Priority**: Supports operations that may involve countering threats such as terrorism, espionage, or unauthorized communications during emergencies.
- **Diplomatic Sensitivity**: May be used in international settings where radio interference could be necessary to protect sensitive communications or prevent hostile acts.
- **Safety Applications**: Could apply in emergency response scenarios where communication systems must be temporarily disabled to prevent danger (e.g., during hazardous material incidents or natural disasters).
- **Limited and Justified Use**: The exemption is not a general power; it is strictly tied to specific, justifiable purposes and is confined in space, time, and frequency.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
This Exemption Order (No. 2009–1) is a **targeted, time-limited, and purpose-bound regulatory exception** to the Radiocommunication Act. It enables the Canadian government — through the RCMP — to conduct **authorized interference with radio communications** in a defined area of the National Capital Region **only when necessary for security, safety, or international relations**.

The Order emphasizes **proportionality, necessity, and minimal impact**, ensuring that such powerful tools are not misused. It reflects a balance between national security needs and the broader public interest in maintaining lawful and orderly radiocommunications.

**Note**: This Order is not a permanent or general rule. It is a specific, legally grounded exemption that applies only under strict conditions and within a clearly defined geographic and operational framework. Its relevance may have diminished over time, as modern security and communication protocols may have evolved. However, it remains a key example of how Canada applies emergency or security-based exemptions under the Radiocommunication Act.
