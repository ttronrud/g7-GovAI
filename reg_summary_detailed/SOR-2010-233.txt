### **Prescribed Financial Statements Required**

The regulations mandate the submission of the following five core financial statements:

1. **Balance Sheet as at the End of the Financial Year**  
   - A comprehensive statement of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time (the end of the fiscal year).  
   - It lists all assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity, providing a snapshot of the company’s financial health.

2. **Statement of Income for the Financial Year**  
   - Reports the company’s revenues, expenses, and net income (or loss) over the fiscal year.  
   - Includes key income-generating activities such as premiums received, claims paid, and investment returns.

3. **Statement of Cash Flows for the Financial Year**  
   - Details the inflows and outflows of cash during the year, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.  
   - Helps assess liquidity, solvency, and the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations.

4. **Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the Financial Year**  
   - Tracks changes in shareholders’ equity over the year, including contributions, dividends, share issuances, and retained earnings.  
   - Provides insight into capital structure and shareholder returns.

5. **Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Financial Year**  
   - Reports not only net income but also other comprehensive income (OCI), such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments, foreign currency translation adjustments, and actuarial gains or losses.  
   - Offers a more complete picture of a company’s financial performance beyond just profit and loss.

These statements are aligned with international financial reporting standards (IFRS), ensuring consistency with global accounting practices and facilitating cross-border comparisons.
