**Detailed Summary of the Regulation Prescribing Physical Injuries**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, under **subsection 45.79(3)a of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act (RCMP Act)**. This provision grants the government the authority to prescribe specific physical injuries that qualify as "serious injuries" for the purposes of the Act.

The regulation is formally referenced as:
- **S.C. 2013, c. 18, s. 35** (Statutory Citation)
- **R.S., c. R-10** (Regulation Series)

**Purpose of the Regulation:**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to **define and prescribe what constitutes a "serious injury"** for the purposes of **subsection 45.79(1)** of the RCMP Act. This definition is critical because it determines whether an individual who has been involved in an incident involving the RCMP (such as a collision, assault, or incident during duty) may be eligible for certain protections, benefits, or legal consequences under the Act — particularly in relation to liability, compensation, or reporting obligations.

**Key Definition: "Serious Injury"**

Under this regulation, a physical injury is considered a "serious injury" if it meets **one or more of the following criteria**, and is **not transient or trifling in nature**:

1. **Substantial Loss or Impairment of Mobility**  
   The injury results in a significant reduction in the ability to move or perform physical activities. This includes conditions that affect walking, balance, or overall bodily movement to a degree that substantially limits daily functioning.

2. **Loss of Function (Whole or Partial)**  
   Any permanent or significant loss of function in any limb, organ, or body part. For example:
   - Loss of hand dexterity
   - Impaired vision or hearing
   - Reduced ability to perform basic tasks due to damage to internal organs or systems

3. **Loss of Vision or Hearing (Whole or Partial)**  
   Includes any impairment in sight or hearing that is not temporary or minor. This could range from partial blindness to permanent hearing loss or significant reduction in auditory perception.

4. **Substantial Disfigurement**  
   A visible and significant alteration to the appearance of the body that affects self-image, social functioning, or quality of life. This is not limited to cosmetic changes but includes injuries that result in scars, deformities, or other lasting physical changes that are noticeable and impactful.

5. **Fracture of Specific Body Parts**  
   The regulation explicitly includes fractures of:
   - Any limb (e.g., arm, leg)
   - Any rib
   - Any vertebra (spine)
   - The skull

   These fractures are considered serious due to their potential for long-term pain, disability, or complications.

6. **Burns, Cuts, or Lacerations to a Major Portion of the Body**  
   Injuries involving significant tissue damage, such as:
   - Burns covering a large area (e.g., over 10% of total body surface area)
   - Deep cuts or lacerations that affect major body regions (e.g., torso, limbs, face)
   - Wounds requiring medical intervention beyond first aid

**Medical Attention Requirement:**

A key condition of the definition is that the injury must have **resulted in medical attention received from a person who is legally authorized to practice medicine or nursing under provincial law**. This ensures that the injury is not self-diagnosed or minor and has been evaluated by a qualified health professional.

This requirement serves to:
- Prevent the classification of minor or self-managed injuries as "serious"
- Ensure that only injuries that have been clinically assessed and documented are considered serious under the Act

**Exclusions:**

- Injuries that are **transient** (short-lived, temporary) or **trifling** (minor, insignificant) are **not included**.
- Injuries that do not meet any of the above criteria — even if they are painful or distressing — are not considered serious under this regulation.

**Effective Date:**

The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette. This means that they are immediately enforceable upon official publication, without requiring a separate date of implementation.

**Summary in Plain Language:**

This regulation provides a clear, legally binding list of physical injuries that qualify as "serious injuries" under the RCMP Act. It helps ensure consistency in determining whether an injury is significant enough to trigger specific legal or administrative responses — such as liability, compensation, or reporting requirements — involving the RCMP. The injuries must be serious, not temporary or minor, and must have been evaluated by a licensed medical or nursing professional.

This regulation is essential for maintaining accountability, protecting individuals involved in RCMP-related incidents, and ensuring that only genuinely serious injuries are recognized under the legal framework.

**Relevance and Implications:**

- **For the RCMP**: Helps in assessing the nature of incidents involving officers or members of the public, especially in cases involving use of force or accidents.
- **For Victims**: Provides a clear standard for claiming benefits or compensation when serious injuries occur.
- **For Legal and Investigative Processes**: Offers a consistent, objective definition that reduces subjectivity in determining injury severity.

This regulation is a key component of the legal framework governing the responsibilities and liabilities of the RCMP in relation to physical harm.
