**Detailed Summary of the Potato Production and Sale (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Purpose**

The **Potato Production and Sale (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations** were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 4 of the Plant Quarantine Act**.  

This regulation is a targeted measure designed to **prevent the spread of the golden nematode** (*Globodera rostochiensis*), a destructive plant pathogen that infects potato crops and can cause significant economic and agricultural damage.  

The primary objective is to **restrict the production and sale of potatoes** in a specific area of the Municipality of Central Saanich, British Columbia, where infestation with the golden nematode has been confirmed. By restricting production and prohibiting the sale of infested potatoes, the regulation aims to protect the broader agricultural sector and maintain the integrity of the province’s potato industry.

### **2. Regulatory Title**

These Regulations are officially titled:  
**"Potato Production and Sale (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such in legal and administrative contexts.

---

### **3. Definition of "Sale"**

The regulation provides a broad definition of "sale" to ensure comprehensive enforcement. "Sale" includes the following activities:  
- Offering or exposing for sale  
- Displaying or advertising for sale  
- Having in possession for sale  
- Bartering or exchanging  
- Disposing of potatoes for consideration (i.e., monetary or other value)  
- Distributing potatoes for sale or consumption  

This expansive definition ensures that even informal or indirect commercial transactions are covered under the restriction.

### **4. Prohibited Activities (Section 1)**

**Subject to subsection (3), no person shall:**  
- Seed, plant, grow, produce, or harvest any potatoes; or  
- Sell or dispose of any potatoes that were seeded, planted, grown, produced, or harvested  
in the designated area of the Municipality of Central Saanich — specifically, **the portion east of West Saanich Road**.

This means that **all stages of potato production and post-harvest commercial activity** are strictly prohibited in this region.

### **5. Exemptions (Subsection 3)**

Not all individuals are subject to the full restrictions. The following exemption applies:

> **A person is exempt from the restrictions in Section 1 if:**  
> - The potatoes are grown **for their own personal consumption only**, and  
> - The potatoes are consumed **within the boundaries of the property** where they were harvested; and  
> - The property **was not previously used** for the production of potatoes intended for sale **before the coming into force of these Regulations**.

This exemption recognizes that small-scale, private gardening or home use does not pose a risk of spreading the golden nematode, especially if the land has not been previously involved in commercial potato farming.

### **6. Key Geographic Scope**

- **Location**: The Municipality of Central Saanich, Province of British Columbia  
- **Specific Area**: The portion **east of West Saanich Road**  
- This delineation ensures that only affected zones are restricted, minimizing economic disruption in unaffected parts of the municipality.

### **7. Legal Status and Historical Note**

- The regulation was **originally enacted** to address the threat of golden nematode infestation.  
- It was **revoked and replaced** by **SOR/83-294, section 1**, indicating that the original version was superseded by a later amendment or replacement.  
  > **Note**: This revocation suggests that the current version may be a revised or reissued regulation, possibly incorporating updated scientific findings, pest status, or administrative changes. However, the core intent — restricting production and sale of infested potatoes — remains consistent.

### **8. Regulatory Impact and Objectives**

| Objective | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Disease Control** | Prevents the spread of golden nematode, which can survive in soil and infect future potato crops. |

### **Conclusion**

The **Potato Production and Sale (Central Saanich) Restriction Regulations** represent a targeted, science-based intervention to combat the spread of the golden nematode in a specific geographic area. By restricting potato production and sale in the portion of Central Saanich east of West Saanich Road, the regulation protects agricultural ecosystems, ensures food safety, and supports sustainable farming practices. The limited exemption for personal consumption helps balance public health and economic realities, ensuring that only commercial operations are affected.
