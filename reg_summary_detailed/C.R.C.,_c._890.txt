The regulation you provided—originally part of the **Canada Grain Regulations**—has been **repealed** under **SOR/2021-177, s. 2** and **SOR/84-615, s. 2 and s. 3**. As such, **this entire provision is no longer in force** and does not apply to current grain grading practices in Canada.

However, for completeness and historical context, here is a **detailed summary** of the **former content** of the regulation, including its structure, intent, and key provisions—before its repeal:

---

## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Repealed Regulation**

### 📌 **Overview**
This regulation established grading standards for **grain that fails to meet standard grades** under the *Canada Grain Act* or *Canada Grain Regulations*. It introduced specific rules for:
- Grain with excessive moisture,
- Grain with stones or foreign material,
- Grain that does not qualify for any standard grade,
- Screenings (by-products of cleaning),
- Mixtures of wild oats and cereal grains,
- And other off-grade or class IV classifications.

These classifications were known as:
- **Off Grades** or **Class III Grades** (for non-standard grain),
- **Grades of Screenings** or **Class IV Grades** (for by-products of cleaning).

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: This regulation was **fully repealed** by **SOR/2021-177, section 2**, and thus **no longer applies** as of the date of repeal. The current grain grading framework is governed by updated regulations, including the *Canada Grain Regulations* as amended more recently.

## 📚 Key Provisions (Historical Summary)

---

### 1. **Grading of Grain That Cannot Be Assigned a Standard Grade**
> *Repealed under SOR/2021-177, s. 2*

Grain that:
- Is of a type for which grades are established under the *Canada Grain Act* or *Canada Grain Regulations*,  
- But **cannot have a standard grade assigned** unless it is treated or specially cleaned,

**shall be graded according to the specifications for the off grades** (Class III grades) established under this Part.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To provide a grading system for grain that is unsuitable for standard grades due to contamination, damage, or lack of treatment.

---

### 2. **Grading of Grain with Excessive Moisture**
> *Repealed under SOR/2021-177, s. 2*

If grain contains **excessive moisture**, it shall be graded according to the **standard grade** it would receive **if it were dry**, **with a moisture descriptor added** to the grade name.

- **Moisture descriptors**:
  - "Tough" – for moisture levels up to 13%
  - "Damp" – 13–15%
  - "Moist" – 15–17%
  - "Wet" – over 17%

> 📚 **Schedule Reference**:
- Canada grain grades → **Schedule I**
- Canada Western grain grades → **Schedule II**
- Canada Eastern grain grades → **Schedule III**

> ✅ **Purpose**: To reflect the condition of grain during storage or transport, ensuring buyers and sellers are aware of moisture-related quality risks.

---

### 3. **Grain with Excessive Stones (≤2.5%)**
> *Repealed under SOR/84-615, s. 2*

Western grain with **stones or similar material between 0% and 2.5%**:
- Shall be graded according to the standard grade it would otherwise receive,
- With the descriptor **“Rejected — Account Stones”** added to the grade name.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To identify minor stone contamination that does not affect quality but is still detectable and must be reported.

---

### 4. **Grain with Stones >2.5% or Gravel/Cinders**
> *Repealed under SOR/84-615, s. 3*

If grain contains:
- **More than 2.5% stones**, or  
- **Gravel, cinders, or similar material** (typically from grain salvaged from a wreck in transit),

Then it shall be graded as **“Sample Salvage”**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: To classify damaged or salvaged grain that is unsuitable for standard use.

---

### 5. **Grain That Does Not Qualify for Any Grade**
> *Repealed under SOR/84-615, s. 3*

Grain that fails to meet any established grade:
- Shall be graded as **“Sample”**,
- With **additional descriptors** indicating:
  - Damage,
  - Condition,
  - Admixtures (e.g., foreign material, mold, etc.).

> ✅ **Purpose**: To provide a baseline classification for unusable or non-conforming grain.

## 🌾 Grades of Screenings (Class IV Grades)

This section established specific standards for **screenings**—material removed during grain cleaning (e.g., broken grain, chaff, weed seeds).

### ✅ **No. 1 Feed Screenings**
- Must be **cool and sweet**.
- Must contain:
  - ≥35% broken or shrunken grain,
  - ≤2% hare’s ear mustard,
  - ≤1% hulls,
  - ≤3% small weed seeds (passing through 4½/64 inch sieve) + chaff/hulls/dust,
  - ≤6% small weed seeds (including mustard, canola, rapeseed),
  - ≤8% wild oats,
  - ≤1% weed seeds designated in the *Feeds Regulations, 2024*,
  - May contain **wild buckwheat** and up to **10% other large seeds** not named.

> ✅ **Purpose**: High-quality feed-grade screenings suitable for animal feed.

---

### ✅ **No. 2 Feed Screenings**
- Must be **cool and sweet**.
- Must contain:
  - ≤2% hare’s ear or wild mustard,
  - ≤1% hulls,
  - ≤3% small weed seeds (same sieve),
  - ≤10% small weed seeds (including mustard, canola, etc.),
  - ≤49% wild oats,
  - ≤1% weed seeds in Feeds Regulations (up to 2% if excess is hare’s ear or wild mustard),
  - May contain **wheat scourings**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Lower-quality but still usable screenings.

---

### ✅ **Uncleaned Screenings**
- Does **not meet No. 1 or No. 2** standards due to weed/hull content,
- But contains **≥35% material** that would meet No. 1 Feed Screenings if separated,
- And has **≤1% excessive wild oat hulls**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: A transitional or less-processed screening grade.

---

### ✅ **Refuse Screenings**
- Fails to meet **No. 1, No. 2, or Uncleaned** standards due to weed, chaff, or dust content.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Lowest-quality screenings, often unsuitable for feed.

---

### ✅ **Grade Naming for Screenings (Inspector’s Discretion)**
An inspector may add to the grade name:
- The **name of the grain** from which the screenings originated (e.g., “Wheat Screenings”), if typical,
- Words indicating **deterioration, condition, or odour** (e.g., “Rotten”, “Moldy”, “Foul-smelling”).

> ✅ **Purpose**: To provide transparency about quality and origin.
