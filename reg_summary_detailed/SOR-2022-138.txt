### **Detailed Summary of the Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations (Canada)**

The **Single-use Plastics Prohibition Regulations** are a set of federal regulations under the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)**, enacted to reduce the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastics. These regulations were published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 25, 2021**, following a public consultation period and review by relevant authorities. The final regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Minister of Health**, pursuant to **subsection 93(1) of CEPA 1999**.

## **I. Background and Regulatory Process**

### 1. **Legal Authority**
- The regulations are based on **subsection 332(1)a of CEPA 1999**, which allows the Minister of the Environment to prohibit or regulate substances or products that pose a risk to the environment or human health.
- The proposed regulations were made available for public comment, allowing individuals and organizations to submit feedback or file a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review**.
- The **National Advisory Committee** (NAC) was given the opportunity to provide expert advice under **section 6c** of CEPA 1999.
- The Governor in Council concluded that the proposed regulations **do not conflict with other federal laws** and provide **adequate environmental and health protection**, thus approving the final version.

## **II. Definitions of Prohibited Single-use Plastic Items**

The regulations define and prohibit specific types of single-use plastic products based on their material composition, physical properties, and intended use. The following are the key defined categories:

| Item | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Single-use plastic checkout bag** | A plastic bag designed to carry purchased goods, made entirely or partially from plastic, excluding fabrics that would break when used to carry 10 kg over 53 meters 100 times or when washed per ISO 6330 standards. |
| **Single-use plastic cutlery** | Includes forks, knives, spoons, sporks, or chopsticks made from **polystyrene or polyethylene**, or those that change physical properties after 100 cycles in a household dishwasher. |
| **Single-use plastic flexible straw** | A straw with a corrugated section that allows bending and maintaining position at various angles. **This type is exempt from prohibition** under certain conditions. |
| **Single-use plastic foodservice ware** | Includes clamshell containers, lidded containers, cups, plates, or bowls designed for serving or transporting food/beverages, and made from: <br> - Expanded or extruded polystyrene foam <br> - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <br> - Plastics containing black pigments produced via incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons <br> - Oxo-degradable plastics |
| **Single-use plastic ring carrier** | A series of deformable plastic rings or bands designed to hold beverage containers together. **Prohibited from manufacture, import, or sale**. |
| **Single-use plastic stir stick** | A plastic item designed to stir beverages or prevent spilling. **Prohibited from manufacture, import, or sale**. |

> **Note**: The definitions are designed to target high-volume, low-recyclability, and environmentally harmful plastic items while allowing exceptions for specific, low-impact products.

---

## **III. Scope and Exemptions**

The regulations **do not apply** to the following:

1. **Plastic items in transit** through Canada (from outside Canada to outside Canada), provided they are accompanied by **written evidence of transit**.
2. **Items intended for export** — plastic items manufactured or imported solely for export are exempt.
3. **Waste plastic** — plastic that is already considered waste is not covered.

> This ensures the regulations do not interfere with international trade or the movement of goods.

---

## **IV. Prohibited Activities**

### 1. **Manufacturing and Importing**
- **Prohibited**:
  - Single-use plastic ring carriers
  - Single-use plastic cutlery
  - Single-use plastic foodservice ware
  - Single-use plastic stir sticks
  - Single-use plastic checkout bags
  - Single-use plastic straws (non-flexible)

> All of these items are banned from being **manufactured or imported** into Canada.

### 2. **Selling Restrictions**
- **Prohibited**:
  - Selling single-use plastic checkout bags, cutlery, foodservice ware, or stir sticks.

> These items cannot be sold in retail or commercial settings.

---

## **V. Exceptions and Permitted Sales**

Despite the broad prohibitions, several **exceptions** allow limited sales of certain single-use plastics:

| Exception | Conditions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Single-use plastic flexible straws** | May be sold in **non-commercial, non-industrial, and non-institutional settings** (e.g., personal use). |
| **Business-to-business sales** | A business may sell **a package of 20 or more flexible straws** to another business. |
| **Retail sales to customers** | A retail store may sell a package of 20+ flexible straws **only if**: <br> - The customer requests them <br> - The package is **not displayed openly** (must require assistance from a store employee to view). |
| **Healthcare institutions** | Hospitals, medical facilities, long-term care facilities, or similar institutions may sell flexible straws to patients or residents. |

> These exceptions aim to balance environmental goals with practical needs in healthcare and business operations.

## **VI. Laboratory Requirements for Testing**

To ensure consistency and scientific validity, any analysis of the physical characteristics of the regulated items must be conducted by a **laboratory meeting strict accreditation standards**:

- Must be **accredited under**:
  - **ISO/IEC 17025** (by an accrediting body that is a signatory to the **ILAC MRA**) **OR**
  - The **Environment Quality Act (CQLR, c. Q-2)** in Quebec
- The **scope of accreditation** must include testing of:
  - Checkout bags
  - Cutlery
  - Foodservice ware
  - Flexible straws
  - Standard straws

> If no recognized method exists, testing must follow **good scientific practice** as generally accepted at the time.

---

## **VII. Recordkeeping Requirements (for Export-Related Activities)**

Any person who **manufactures or imports plastic items for export** must maintain detailed records for each item, including:

### For **manufacturers**:
- Common/generic name and trade name (if any)
- Quantity manufactured at each facility
- Date of manufacture
- Date and quantity exported (or intended export date and quantity)
- Name of entity to which item is sold in Canada for export

### For **importers**:
- Common/generic name and trade name
- Quantity imported
- Date of import
- Copies of **bill of lading, invoice, and documents submitted to CBSA**
- Date and quantity exported (or intended export)
- Name of entity to which item is sold in Canada for export

> Records must be kept:
- At the **principal place of business** in Canada (or another Canadian location)
- For **at least five years** after creation
- If moved, the person must **notify the Minister in writing within 30 days**

> This ensures transparency and accountability in the supply chain for exported goods.

## **VIII. Implementation and Enforcement Timeline**

The regulations are phased into effect to allow time for compliance, industry adjustment, and public awareness:

| Provision | Effective Date |
|--------|----------------|
| **Section 3(1)** | One year after registration (first anniversary) |
| **Section 5 and subsection 6(2)** | 18 months after registration (same day or last day of the month) |
| **Subsection 3(2) and Section 11** | Two years after registration |
| **Section 10** | 42 months after registration (same day or last day of the month) |
| **Subsection 2(2)** | Repealed (no longer applies) |

> Example: If the regulations are registered on **January 1, 2022**, the enforcement timeline would be:
- **Section 3(1)**: January 1, 2023
- **Section 5 & 6(2)**: January 1, 2024
- **3(2) & Section 11**: January 1, 2024
- **Section 10**: January 1, 2026 (42 months later)

> The phased approach allows industries time to adapt while ensuring compliance over time.

## **IX. Key Objectives and Environmental Rationale**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Reduce plastic pollution** in landfills, oceans, and ecosystems.
2. **Limit microplastic and chemical leaching risks** from products containing polystyrene, PVC, and oxo-degradable plastics.
3. **Promote sustainable alternatives** (e.g., paper, reusable materials).
4. **Protect human health** by reducing exposure to toxic additives (e.g., black pigments from incomplete combustion, phthalates in PVC).
5. **Support Canada’s climate and environmental commitments**, including the **Canadian Environmental Protection Act** and broader **plastic reduction strategies**.
