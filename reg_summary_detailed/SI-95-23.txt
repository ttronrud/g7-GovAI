**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Kelly Lake Area, N.W.T.)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Background**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, and is made by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It serves to formally **revoke an earlier withdrawal order** and replace it with a new, more specific one.

- **Revoked Order**:  
  The original *Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Kelly Lake Area, N.W.T.)* issued by **Order in Council P.C. 1994-73**, dated January 13, 1994, is hereby **revoked**.

- **New Order**:  
  A new *Withdrawal from Disposal Order (Kelly Lake Area, N.W.T.)* is introduced, which is **attached as an annex** to this regulation. This new order supersedes the revoked one and is officially cited as such.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw specific lands in the Northwest Territories (N.W.T.) from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of development) in order to:

> **Set aside and protect the lands** in accordance with **paragraph 17.4.1(a) of the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement (SDLCA)**.

- The **Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act (S.C. 1994, c. 27)** was passed on **June 23, 1994**, and formally approved, given effect, and declared valid. This Act provides the legal basis for the land claim agreement, which recognizes Indigenous rights and establishes land use protections for the Sahtu people.

- The withdrawal is therefore a **legally binding implementation** of a key provision in the land claim agreement, ensuring that certain lands are preserved for cultural, environmental, or traditional purposes.

---

### **3. Scope of the Withdrawal**

- The lands subject to withdrawal are **described in a schedule** attached to the Order. These lands are located in the **Kelly Lake area** of the **Northwest Territories**.

- The withdrawal is **effective from the date of registration** of this Order and will **continue until** some or all of those lands are officially designated as a **territorial park**.

> This means the lands remain protected from disposal (e.g., for mining, oil and gas, logging, or development) until a formal park designation is made.

---

### **4. Limitations and Exceptions**

Despite the withdrawal from disposal, **certain existing rights, interests, permits, and privileges are preserved and not affected** by this Order. These include:

| Type of Right/Interest | Description |
|------------------------|-----------|
| **Existing mineral claims or prospecting permits** | Located or recorded mineral claims or prospecting permits in good standing under the *Canada Mining Regulations* are protected. |
| **Rights under the Territorial Lands Act (Section 8)** | Existing rights created under section 8 of the Territorial Lands Act or under Territorial Lands Regulations (e.g., surface lease rights) are preserved. |
| **Surface lease rights** | Rights to obtain a surface lease on existing mineral claims are protected. |
| **Oil and gas permits** | Existing permits, special renewal permits, and leases under the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* remain valid. |
| **Quarrying permits** | Existing permits under the *Territorial Quarrying Regulations* are preserved. |
| **Petroleum rights** | Rights granted under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* are protected. |
| **Coal, dredging, and forestry rights** | Rights under the *Territorial Coal Regulations*, *Territorial Dredging Regulations*, and the *Forest Management Act of the Northwest Territories* are preserved. |
| **Rights under the 1988 Acquisition Agreement** | Interests in lands described in **Exhibit 2 to the Acquisition Agreement dated May 5, 1988** (between Canada, Northern Canada Power Commission, Government of N.W.T., and N.W.T. Power Corporation) are preserved. |

> This ensures that **existing legal arrangements** are not disrupted by the new withdrawal.

### **5. Geographical Basis of the Withdrawal**

The withdrawal is also defined geographically using a **National Topographic Series (NTS) map**:

- Map title: *"Lands to be Withdrawn from Disposal of Surface Interests, per Clause 17.4 of the Sahtu Land Claim"*
- Approved on **August 13, 1993** by **Jim Umpherson**, Regional Manager, Land Resources Division, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
- District: **Mackenzie District, N.W.T.**
- Map series: **96E**

This map identifies the specific parcel of land designated as "Surface Withdrawal" and serves as the **official geographic reference** for the area under protection.

---

### **6. What Is NOT Withheld**

Importantly, the Order **does not withdraw** the following:

- **Mines and minerals**, including:
  - Solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons (oil, gas, natural gas)
  - Other mineral resources (e.g., metals, coal)

> This is explicitly **"saving and excepting"** the rights to mine or extract minerals. The protection applies only to **surface use and disposal**, not subsurface mineral rights.

- This means that while surface development (e.g., logging, quarrying, construction) is blocked, **mining activities remain possible** under existing rights or future approvals.

---

### **7. Key Legal Principles and Implications**

- **Section 4 of the Territorial Lands Act** governs the general rules of land disposal. However, this Order **does not apply to section 4** in respect of the lands described — meaning the normal disposal processes are suspended only for the surface interests.

- The Order reflects a **recognition of Indigenous rights** under the Sahtu Land Claim Agreement, reinforcing the principle of **self-determination and land-based cultural protection**.

- It demonstrates how **modern land claims agreements** are implemented through administrative and legal instruments that balance Indigenous rights with federal land management responsibilities.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

This regulation is a **critical step in implementing Indigenous land rights** under the Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement. By withdrawing certain lands in the Kelly Lake area from disposal, the government:

- Protects the land for cultural, environmental, or traditional purposes;
- Respects and upholds the legal rights of the Sahtu people;
- Preserves existing rights and interests in mineral and surface use;
- Provides a clear, legally defined boundary for land protection, based on a map and schedule;
- Ensures that only surface development is restricted, while mineral exploration and extraction remain possible.

This Order is not just a land management tool — it is a **symbolic and substantive recognition of Indigenous sovereignty and land stewardship** in Canada’s northern territories.

---

**In short**:  
This Order protects specific surface lands in the Kelly Lake area of the N.W.T. from being sold or leased for development, in accordance with a land claim agreement, while preserving existing mineral rights and other legal interests. It is a key example of how federal policy supports Indigenous rights through administrative action.
