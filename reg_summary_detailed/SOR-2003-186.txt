### **Regulation Summary: Foreign Institutions Subject to the Canadian Residency Requirements Regulations (Trust and Loan Companies)**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- **Enacted by:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council  
- **On the recommendation of:** The Minister of Finance  
- **Under the authority of:** Section 531a of the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*  
- **Primary Statutory Reference:**  
  - *S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 569* (Statutory Citation)

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of these regulations is to **ensure that foreign institutions and their holding bodies meet Canadian residency requirements** when engaging in financial services activities within Canada. Specifically, the regulation applies to foreign institutions that are structured through a holding body corporate and are engaged in financial services.

This is done to:
- Strengthen Canada’s financial regulatory framework by ensuring that foreign entities involved in trust and loan company activities are subject to Canadian residency rules.
- Prevent tax avoidance or non-compliance by ensuring that foreign entities do not operate in Canada without meeting Canadian legal and residency criteria.
- Align with broader Canadian financial stability and regulatory transparency goals.

#### **3. Definition of "Holding Body Corporate" of a Foreign Institution (Under Subsection 163(2) of the Trust and Loan Companies Act)**

A **holding body corporate** of a foreign institution is defined as a corporation that meets **both of the following criteria**:

##### **Criterion 1: Incorporation Outside of Canadian Jurisdiction**
> The holding body corporate must be:
> - **Incorporated or formed otherwise than by or under an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province of Canada.**

This means:
- The entity is **not created under Canadian law** (i.e., not incorporated in Canada).
- It is established under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction (e.g., a U.S. state, UK company law, Singaporean law, etc.).

> This distinguishes it from Canadian-incorporated companies and ensures that the regulation applies only to entities formed outside Canada.

##### **Criterion 2: Primary Business Activity – Financial Services**
> The holding body corporate, **together with the entities it controls**, must, when viewed as a whole, be **engaged primarily in the business of providing financial services**.

This includes:
- Activities such as:
  - Trust administration
  - Loan and credit services
  - Investment management
  - Asset management
  - Financial advisory services
- The "primary" nature of the business is key — if the holding body and its subsidiaries are primarily involved in financial services, the regulation applies.

> This ensures that only those foreign structures with a core financial services function are subject to Canadian residency requirements, avoiding overreach into non-financial or non-related activities.

#### **4. Regulatory Effect and Application**
- These regulations **apply specifically to foreign institutions** that meet the above definition of a holding body corporate.
- The regulation **subjects such foreign institutions to the Canadian Residency Requirements Regulations** (under the Trust and Loan Companies Act).
- This means that:
  - The foreign holding body and its controlled entities must satisfy Canadian residency requirements (e.g., physical presence, control, or operational nexus) to legally operate in Canada.
  - The requirement may impact tax, reporting, and compliance obligations, especially in areas like anti-money laundering, capital adequacy, and disclosure.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The regulations **come into force on the day on which they are registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- This ensures immediate applicability upon formal publication and legal recognition, allowing regulatory bodies and financial institutions to prepare accordingly.

#### **6. Key Implications and Significance**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Jurisdictional Scope** | Applies only to foreign entities formed outside Canada. |
| **Business Focus** | Only applies if the holding body and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in financial services. |
| **Residency Requirement** | Forces foreign financial entities to meet Canadian residency standards to operate legally. |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Increases transparency and accountability in foreign financial operations in Canada. |
| **Enforcement** | Provides a clear legal basis for Canadian regulators (e.g., Financial Services Regulatory Authority) to assess and monitor foreign financial institutions. |

---

#### **7. Contextual Background**
- This regulation is part of Canada’s broader effort to **enhance financial stability and prevent regulatory arbitrage**.
- It complements other anti-avoidance and anti-money laundering frameworks.
- It aligns with international standards such as those from the OECD and FATF (Financial Action Task Force), which emphasize transparency in cross-border financial operations.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation establishes a clear, legally binding framework for determining when a foreign institution — through a holding body corporate — is subject to Canadian residency requirements under the *Trust and Loan Companies Act*. It ensures that foreign financial entities operating in Canada are not operating in a regulatory vacuum and are subject to Canadian oversight, particularly where financial services are central to their operations. By focusing on entities formed outside Canada and engaged primarily in financial services, the regulation promotes regulatory consistency, transparency, and national financial integrity.

---

**Final Note:**  
This regulation is not a standalone rule but a **targeted application** of broader residency and regulatory requirements under the Trust and Loan Companies Act. It is designed to close loopholes that could allow foreign entities to circumvent Canadian financial oversight through offshore holding structures.
