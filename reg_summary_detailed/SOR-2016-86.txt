**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Title of the Regulation:**  
*Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Kootenay River Population Order*

**Date of Issuance:**  
April 21, 2016  
(Registered under S.C. 2002, c. 29 — the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA))

---

### **Background and Legal Basis**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically **subsection 58(4) and (5)**, which empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate and establish the critical habitat for a wildlife species listed as endangered.

The White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*) population in the Kootenay River is recognized as an **endangered species** under **Part 2 of Schedule 1** to SARA. This listing signifies that the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild and requires urgent conservation measures.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Designation of Critical Habitat**  
   The Order formally identifies and designates the **critical habitat** for the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Kootenay River population.  
   - Critical habitat refers to the specific areas that are essential for the survival or recovery of the species, including those needed for breeding, feeding, growth, and other vital life processes.  
   - The designated areas are based on scientific findings from the species’ recovery strategy, which has been officially published and registered in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*.

2. **Legal Status and Jurisdiction**  
   - The designation is legally binding under **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, which applies to the critical habitat of endangered species.  
   - The critical habitat identified in this Order is **not located in any area referred to in subsection 58(2)** of SARA. This is significant because subsection 58(2) typically excludes certain areas (e.g., areas not directly related to the species’ survival or where development is not likely to impact the species). By confirming that the designated habitat is not in such excluded areas, the Order ensures that the protected status is fully enforceable.

3. **Purpose of the Order**  
   The primary purpose is to:
   - Provide legal protection to the specific areas essential for the recovery of the White Sturgeon population.
   - Ensure that any federal projects, activities, or development plans that may impact this habitat are assessed and modified to avoid harm.
   - Support the recovery of the species by preserving the environmental conditions necessary for its survival.

4. **Enforcement and Compliance**  
   - The Order comes into force on the day it is registered with the Government of Canada.  
   - It is enforceable under SARA, meaning that any federal undertaking (such as infrastructure development, mining, or water management) that would impact the designated critical habitat must undergo a **federal environmental assessment** and may be required to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects.

5. **Public Access and Transparency**  
   - The recovery strategy and the critical habitat designation are publicly accessible in the *Species at Risk Public Registry*, ensuring transparency and public awareness of conservation efforts.

### **Significance of the Regulation**

- This Order represents a key step in the formal conservation of the endangered White Sturgeon population in the Kootenay River.  
- It aligns with the broader goals of SARA: to prevent extinction, promote recovery, and protect biodiversity.  
- It provides a clear legal framework for land and water use decisions, ensuring that ecological needs of the species are integrated into federal planning.

### **Conclusion**

The *Critical Habitat of the White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) Kootenay River Population Order* is a legally binding instrument under the *Species at Risk Act* that officially designates and protects the essential habitats required for the survival and recovery of this endangered fish population. By establishing these areas and confirming their exclusion from exempted zones, the Government of Canada ensures that federal actions will be subject to environmental scrutiny and conservation safeguards, contributing to the long-term viability of the species.

This regulation is both a scientific and legal milestone in the conservation of one of Canada’s most vulnerable native fish species.
