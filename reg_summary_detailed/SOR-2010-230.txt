   - Includes information on loans, deposits, investments, reserves, and other financial instruments.

2. **Statement of Income for the Financial Year**  
   - Reports the revenues, expenses, and net income (or loss) over the course of the fiscal year.  
   - Provides insight into the profitability and operational performance of the institution.

3. **Statement of Cash Flows for the Financial Year**  
   - Details the inflows and outflows of cash during the year, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.  
   - Assesses the liquidity and financial flexibility of the institution.

4. **Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the Financial Year**
