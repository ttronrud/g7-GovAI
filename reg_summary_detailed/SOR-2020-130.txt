### **Detailed Summary of the Work Place Harassment and Violence Prevention Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Authority**

These regulations are made under **subsection 157(1)c** of the *Canada Labour Code* (CLC), which empowers the **Governor in Council** to establish workplace safety and health standards for employees working on **ships, trains, aircraft**, or in **oil and gas exploration, drilling, production, processing, or transportation in "frontier lands"**.

- The regulations are developed **on the recommendation of**:
  - The **Minister of Labour**,
  - The **Minister of Transport** (for transportation-related workplaces),
  - The **Minister of Indigenous Services** and
  - The **Minister of Natural Resources** (with consideration of recommendations from the **Canadian Energy Regulator**, though *no such recommendation has been made* in this instance).

> **Key Note**: Since the Canadian Energy Regulator has not made any recommendation, the regulations are adopted solely on the joint recommendation of the four Ministers.

This demonstrates a **multi-agency, collaborative approach** to ensure that workplace harassment and violence prevention policies are inclusive, culturally sensitive, and aligned with both labor and transportation safety standards.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objective is to **prevent, reduce, and respond to harassment and violence in the workplace**, particularly in high-risk environments such as transportation and energy sectors.

The regulations aim to:
- Establish clear definitions and procedures for identifying and responding to harassment and violence.
- Promote a **proactive, preventive culture** through workplace assessments, policies, training, and emergency procedures.
- Ensure **accountability, transparency, and employee protection**, including privacy and support mechanisms.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to Part II of the Canada Labour Code (i.e., the core occupational health and safety provisions). |
| **Designated Recipient** | A work unit or individual designated by the employer to receive reports of harassment or violence. Acts as a central point of contact. |
| **Occurrence** | Any incident of harassment or violence that takes place in the workplace. |
| **Principal Party** | The employee or employer who is the subject (target) of the harassment or violence. |
| **Responding Party** | The person alleged to have caused or been responsible for the occurrence (as reported in the notice). |
| **Witness** | A person who observed the occurrence or was informed of it by the principal party or responding party. |
| **Applicable Partner** | Either the **policy committee**, if it exists; otherwise, the **workplace committee** or **health and safety representative**. |

> These definitions provide clarity in determining responsibilities and rights during the resolution process.

---

#### **4. Joint Responsibilities and Decision-Making**

- Employers and their **applicable partner** (policy/workplace committee or health and safety rep) must **jointly carry out** all key activities:
  - Conduct workplace assessments,
  - Develop and implement preventive measures,
  - Review and update policies and procedures,
  - Monitor effectiveness and respond to changes.

- If disagreement arises between the employer and the applicable partner, the **employer’s decision prevails** — a pragmatic balance to ensure operational feasibility while maintaining employee involvement.

---

#### **5. Time Extensions for Former Employees**

Under **subsection 125(4)** of the CLC, the **Head of Compliance and Enforcement** may extend the deadline for reporting an occurrence if a former employee can demonstrate:
- They suffered **trauma** due to the incident, or
- They have a **health condition** that prevented them from reporting within the required timeframe.

> This recognizes the psychological impact of harassment and ensures that victims are not penalized for delayed reporting due to mental health challenges.

---

#### **6. Timeframe for Complaints by Former Employees**

A former employee may file a complaint under **subsection 127.1(1)** of the CLC until the **later of**:
1. **Three months after they cease employment**, or  
2. **Three months after the resolution process is completed** (if notice was provided under section 15(1)).

> This ensures that individuals have a reasonable window to pursue redress even after leaving employment.

---

#### **7. Workplace Assessment Process**

The employer and applicable partner must:

##### **Step 1: Identify Risk Factors**
- Conduct a comprehensive analysis of internal and external factors contributing to harassment and violence, including:
  - Workplace culture, structure, and activities,
  - External factors (e.g., family violence),
  - Reports and data on harassment/violence,
  - Physical layout of the workplace,
  - Existing psychological health and safety measures.

##### **Step 2: Develop Preventive Measures**
- Within **six months** of identifying risks, jointly develop:
  - Preventive measures that **mitigate** harassment/violence,
  - And **do not create or increase** such risks,
  - An implementation plan,
  - And implement the measures according to the plan.

##### **Step 3: Monitor and Update the Assessment**
- Regularly monitor the accuracy of the assessment.
- Update it when:
  - Risk factors change,
  - Preventive measures lose effectiveness,
  - New incidents occur.
- Conduct a **full review every three years**.
- If an occurrence is unresolved and involves a non-employee responding party, or if the occurrence is not resolved under section 23, the assessment must be reviewed and updated — **taking into account the specific circumstances of the incident**.

> Multiple related occurrences can be addressed together in one review and update, improving efficiency.

#### **8. Workplace Harassment and Violence Prevention Policy**

The employer and applicable partner must jointly develop a comprehensive policy that includes:

1. **Mission statement** on preventing harassment and violence.
2. **Roles and responsibilities** of:
   - Employer,
   - Designated recipient,
   - Employees,
   - Policy/workplace committee,
   - Health and safety representative.
3. **Summary of risk factors** (internal and external).
4. **Training plan** (content and delivery).
5. **Resolution process**:
   - Name and contact details of the designated recipient,
   - How a principal party or witness can report an occurrence,
   - When a review and update of the assessment is required.
6. **Emergency procedures** (for immediate threats to health/safety).
7. **Privacy protections** for individuals involved.
8. **Additional recourse options** beyond the CLC or these regulations.
9. **Support measures** available to employees (e.g., counseling, medical services).
10. **Name of person designated to receive complaints** under section 127.1(1).

> The policy must be **accessible to all employees** and reviewed at least every **three years**, or after any material change.

---

#### **9. Emergency Procedures**

- Must be developed and implemented in response to:
  - Immediate danger to health/safety,
  - Threat of such danger.

- Must be **available to all employees**.
- After each implementation, the procedures must be **reviewed and updated**.

> This ensures that emergency responses remain current and effective.

Training must be:
- **Tailored to the workplace’s culture, conditions, and activities**,
- And include:
  - Elements of the harassment and violence prevention policy,
  - Links between harassment/violence and **prohibited grounds of discrimination** under the *Canadian Human Rights Act* (e.g., race, gender, disability),
  - How to recognize, prevent, minimize, and respond to harassment and violence.

**Mandatory Training Schedule**:

- Employers must **designate a person or work unit** to receive reports of harassment or violence.

- **Notice of an occurrence** may be provided:

  - By the **principal party** or **witness**.

> **Exceptions where notice cannot be provided**:
- If the **responding party is neither the employer nor an employee**,

- And if the employer already has **measures in place** to address such exposure.

> If the **principal party or responding party is the employer**, notice must be given to the designated recipient.
