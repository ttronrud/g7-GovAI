**Detailed Summary of Oil and Gas Land Order No. 2-1961**

---

**Order Citation:**  
This regulation is officially cited as *Oil and Gas Land Order No. 2-1961*.

---

**Definition of Key Terms:**  
- The term *"Regulations"* refers to the *Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations* and all other terminology used in this Order has the same meaning as defined in those Regulations. This ensures consistency in interpretation across related legal instruments.

---

### **1. Scope of the Order**  
This Order establishes the framework for issuing new oil and gas leases on **Canada lands** that are referred to in **subsection 57(1)** of the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations.  
These lands must **not have already been disposed of** under *Oil and Gas Land Order No. 1-1961*.  
Thus, this Order applies to **unallocated or remaining Crown lands** eligible for lease under the regulatory regime.

### **2. Types of Tenders for Oil and Gas Leases**  
Tenders for oil and gas leases may be issued under **one of three sets of terms and conditions**, as specified in **section 57** of the Regulations:

#### **a) Cash Bonus**  
- The lessee must pay **a fixed sum of money** to Her Majesty (the Crown) in addition to complying with all provisions of the Regulations.  
- This is a straightforward financial commitment with no obligation to conduct exploration or drilling.

#### **b) Exploratory Work Bonus**  
- The lessee must **deposit money, bonds, or an approved note** with the Chief (the federal land authority) equal to the amount they commit to spend on exploratory work within **one or more fixed time periods**.  
- The **amount of actual expenditure** made by the lessee during the specified period is determined in the same way as "allowable expenditure" under **section 43** of the Regulations.  
- Upon completion of the period:  
  - The portion of the deposit **equal to the actual expenditures** is **returned to the lessee (permittee)**.  
  - The **unspent portion of the deposit is forfeited to Her Majesty**.  
- Importantly, **expenditures incurred to recover the deposit** (e.g., costs to get the deposit back) **cannot be used to reduce rental payments** under **section 80** of the Regulations.

#### **c) Cash Bonus Plus Drilling Commitment**  
- The lessee pays a **fixed cash bonus** and **undertakes to drill a well** within a specified lease area to a **fixed depth or horizon** within a set timeframe.  
- The **size of the lease area** is not fixed—it varies based on:  
  - The **geographic location** of the area  
  - The **depth of the potential reservoir horizons**  
- The lease is **automatically cancelled** if the lessee fails to:  
  - Drill to **commercial production**,  
  - Drill to a **Precambrian horizon**, or  
  - Reach the **depth specified in the condition**,  
  within the time frame set out in the terms.  
- The **drilling period may be extended** by the Chief if, in their judgment, drilling operations have **already commenced**.  
- Like the exploratory bonus, **expenditures incurred to drill the required well cannot be used to reduce rental payments** under section 80 of the Regulations.

### **3. Who Can Request a Lease Tender?**  
Any individual or entity (person or corporation) may **request that an oil and gas lease be offered for tender** under **any one** of the three sets of terms and conditions outlined above.

---

### **4. Eligibility Requirements for Lessees**  
- Every oil and gas lease granted under this Order must be issued to a **person or corporation that meets the requirements** specified in **subsection 54(2)** of the Regulations.  
- These requirements typically include:  
  - Legal capacity to enter into a lease  
  - Financial stability  
  - Compliance with certain corporate or licensing standards (as defined in the Regulations)  
- This ensures that only qualified and responsible parties are granted access to Crown lands.

---

### **5. Exemption for Pre-existing Permits**  
- This Order **does not apply** to oil and gas leases issued on Canada lands that were previously held under an **earlier permit**.  
- Specifically, if a person or corporation already held a permit for those lands, and a lease is issued to **that same holder**, then the lease is **not subject to the terms of this Order**.  
- This provides continuity and protects existing rights holders from being required to meet the new tender conditions.

### **Key Regulatory Principles and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| **Three Tender Models** | Offers flexibility depending on the risk profile and investment strategy of potential lessees. |
| **Deposit Return Mechanism (Exploratory Bonus)** | Encourages exploration while protecting public funds—only the actual spend is returned. |
| **Lease Cancellation Risk (Drilling Commitment)** | Creates a strong incentive to act quickly; failure to drill results in loss of lease. |
| **No Rental Reduction from Drilling Costs** | Prevents lessees from offsetting rental payments with exploration or drilling expenditures—ensures consistent revenue for the Crown. |
| **Eligibility Thresholds** | Maintains a standard of accountability and financial viability among lessees. |
| **Exemption for Existing Permit Holders** | Preserves stability and continuity in long-standing land use rights. |

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**  
This Order serves several key government objectives:  
- To **efficiently manage and allocate** Crown-owned oil and gas lands.  
- To **encourage exploration** through structured financial incentives.  
- To **protect public interest** by ensuring transparency, accountability, and clear conditions for lease acquisition.  
- To **maintain fiscal integrity** by preventing lessees from using exploration costs to reduce rental obligations.  

It also reflects a balance between **incentivizing investment** and **protecting Crown revenue and land rights**.

---

### **Conclusion**  
*Oil and Gas Land Order No. 2-1961* provides a comprehensive, structured approach to leasing Canada’s oil and gas lands. It introduces three distinct tender models—cash bonus, exploratory work bonus, and cash bonus with drilling commitment—each with specific conditions, financial rules, and risk provisions. The Order ensures that only qualified entities participate, protects public funds through deposit forfeiture rules, and maintains continuity for existing permit holders. It is a critical regulatory tool in Canada’s framework for managing energy resources on federal Crown lands.
