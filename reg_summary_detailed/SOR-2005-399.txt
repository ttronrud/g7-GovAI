### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Health Information Custodians in the Province of Ontario Exemption Order, S.C. 2005, c. 5**

#### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
This Order establishes a legal exemption for certain entities in the Province of Ontario from the application of **Part 1 of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** — the federal personal information protection law — in relation to the collection, use, and disclosure of **personal health information**.

The exemption is specifically designed to ensure that **health information custodians** (entities that hold personal health information) are governed by **Ontario’s own health privacy legislation**, namely the *Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA)*, rather than the more general federal PIPEDA framework.

---

#### **2. Legal Basis and Authority**
- The Order is made under **paragraph 26(2)(b) of PIPEDA**, which allows for exemptions from Part 1 of PIPEDA when:
  - The personal information is health-related.
  - The information is handled by a designated custodian.
  - The applicable provincial law (in this case, PHIPA) already provides adequate protection.
- The Governor in Council (the provincial executive authority) acts **on the recommendation of the Minister of Industry**, indicating that the decision was informed by industry and regulatory considerations.

---

#### **3. Key Provisions**

##### **(a) Scope of Exemption**
- The exemption applies to **health information custodians** that are subject to **Schedule A of the PHIPA** (S.O. 2004, c. 3).
- These custodians include healthcare providers, hospitals, long-term care homes, mental health facilities, and other organizations that collect, use, or disclose personal health information.
- The exemption covers **all activities related to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health information** within the Province of Ontario.

##### **(b) Exemption from PIPEDA**
- Despite being subject to PIPEDA at the federal level, these health information custodians are **exempt from the application of Part 1 of PIPEDA** in respect to health-related personal information.
- This means that the strict requirements of PIPEDA (such as those related to consent, data minimization, access rights, and security) **do not apply** to these entities when handling health information, **provided** that they are complying with PHIPA.

##### **(c) Substantive Similarity to PHIPA**
- The regulation explicitly notes that **PHIPA is substantially similar to Part 1 of PIPEDA** in terms of its objectives and protections.
- This similarity justifies the exemption — the province has its own comprehensive and tailored health privacy law that provides sufficient safeguards.

---

#### **4. Regulatory Context**
- PHIPA (the Ontario law) is specifically designed to protect the privacy of individuals’ health information and to ensure that health information is collected, used, and disclosed in a manner that respects individual rights and confidentiality.
- By exempting health information custodians from PIPEDA, Ontario ensures that:
  - Health data is governed by laws that are **more specific and contextually appropriate** to the healthcare environment.
  - The **provincial jurisdiction** over health privacy is preserved.
  - The **complexity and sensitivity** of health data are properly addressed through specialized rules.

---

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** with the Statutes of Ontario.
- This means it becomes legally effective immediately upon publication in the *Ontario Gazette*, ensuring prompt implementation.

---

#### **6. Implications and Significance**
- **Provincial Sovereignty**: This Order reinforces Ontario’s ability to regulate health privacy independently, consistent with its jurisdiction over health services.
- **Consistency and Clarity**: It avoids regulatory overlap and confusion by aligning health privacy governance with the province’s own legislation.
- **Practical Benefits**:
  - Health providers can operate under clear, familiar rules.
  - Patients receive protection under PHIPA, which includes specific rights (e.g., access to records, consent for disclosure, complaints mechanisms).
  - Reduces administrative burden on healthcare organizations that would otherwise have to comply with both federal and provincial laws.

---

#### **7. Limitations and Boundaries**
- The exemption **only applies to personal health information**.
- It does **not extend to other types of personal information** (e.g., financial, demographic, or non-health-related data), which remain subject to PIPEDA.
- The exemption applies **only within Ontario**.
- The exemption is conditional upon compliance with PHIPA — if a health information custodian fails to meet PHIPA requirements, it may still face penalties or enforcement actions.

---

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a critical piece of regulatory policy that:
- Recognizes the unique nature of health information.
- Ensures that health data is protected under a law specifically designed for that context.
- Provides legal clarity and consistency for healthcare providers and patients in Ontario.

By exempting health information custodians from Part 1 of PIPEDA, Ontario affirms its commitment to **provincial control over health privacy**, while maintaining alignment with federal standards in other areas of personal information protection.
