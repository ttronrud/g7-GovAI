### **Key Implications and Context**

1. **Reorganization of Government Functions**  
   The transfer reflects a strategic shift in government structure to place immigration and employment services under a single, specialized body—the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission—enhancing coordination and policy coherence.

2. **Separation of Functions**  
   - **Consular services** (such as passport issuance and assistance to foreign nationals) were retained within the Department of External Affairs to preserve diplomatic and international obligations.  
   - **Immigration processing and policy development** were transferred to CEIC to allow for more focused, professional management.

3. **Geographic Coverage**  
   The transfer applies to all overseas missions, ensuring that immigration-related functions (e.g., application processing, visa issuance, program implementation) are now managed under CEIC’s oversight, even in foreign countries.

4. **Legal Authority**  
   The transfer is authorized under **Section 2 of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign responsibilities among public service departments for administrative efficiency and policy effectiveness.

### **Outcome and Significance**

- The Canada Employment and Immigration Commission (CEIC) became the central body responsible for:
  - Immigration policy development and implementation
  - Processing of immigration applications
  - Management of international immigration programs
  - Oversight of immigration operations abroad

- This reorganization laid the foundation for future reforms in Canada’s immigration system, eventually contributing to the establishment of the modern **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** in later years.
