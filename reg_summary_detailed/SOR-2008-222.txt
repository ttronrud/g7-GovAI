## 🔍 Key Definitions and Interpretations

### 1. **Definition of "Wages" (Subsection 2(1) of the Act)**
The term *wages* includes the following amounts:
- **Gratuities** accounted for by the employer (e.g., tips, bonuses, or performance-based payments).
- **Disbursements** of a travelling salesperson properly incurred in the business of a bankrupt or receiver.
- **Production bonuses and shift premiums** (performance-based or shift-based compensation).

> ✅ *Note*: These are considered "eligible wages" and are protected under the program.

---

### 2. **Termination of Employment (Paragraph 5(a) of the Act)**
An individual’s employment is deemed to have ended for the purposes of the program if it ended due to any of the following:
- Resignation or retirement;
- Termination of employment;
- Expiration of the employment term.

> 📌 This triggers eligibility for protection under the program.

### 3. **Determining Foreign Proceedings (Subsection 5(2) of the Act)**
A court may determine whether a foreign legal proceeding (e.g., in another country) relates to a former employer that:
- Has terminated **all employees in Canada**, except those retained to wind down operations.

> ⚖️ This ensures that only legitimate claims arising from full or partial business closures are considered.

---

### 4. **Former Employer’s Status (Subsection 5(5) of the Act)**
A court may determine whether the former employer:
- Has terminated **all of its Canadian employees**, except those retained for winding down.

> 🔍 This is critical in determining whether the employer qualifies as a "bankrupt" or "subject to receivership" under the program.

---

### 5. **Controlling Interest (Paragraph 6(b) of the Act)**
An individual has a **controlling interest** if they own:
- More than **40% of the voting shares**;  
- A **block of shares** large enough to prevent any shareholder from blocking a motion (i.e., de facto control);  
- Enough shares to **control business policy** (e.g., strategic decisions).

> 💡 This is relevant for determining whether an individual may be eligible for protection if they were a significant stakeholder.

---

### 6. **Managerial Position (Paragraph 6(c) of the Act)**
An individual occupies a **managerial position** if their responsibilities include:
- Making **binding financial decisions** affecting the business;

> 📌 Managers are often entitled to greater protection due to their role in wage management.

## 💰 Payment Allocation Order (Subsection 7(1.1) of the Act)

Payments under the program are allocated in a strict priority order:
1. **Wages other than those in (b) to (e)** (i.e., base wages, gratuities, etc.)

3. **Vacation pay**  
4. **Termination pay**

## 💳 Trustee Fees and Expenses (Section 22.1 of the Act)

The Minister may pay fees and expenses to a trustee **on application** if:
- The trustee submits a claim in the form approved by the Minister;
- The claim shows a **deficit** (i.e., fees exceed available funds);
- The total amount of **third-party deposits or guarantees** is **less than the deficit**.

### Amount Payable = Lesser of:
1. **Deficit minus third-party deposits/guarantees**;  
   OR  
2. **Amount determined by a formula**:

#### Formula for Maximum Fee Payment:
> **Total = A + B**

Where:
- **A** = $1,000 (adjusted) +  
  - $150 (adjusted) × number of first 10 claims  
  - $100 (adjusted) × number of additional claims  
  → Maximum total for A is **$6,000 (adjusted)** (excluding sales tax)

- **B** = Costs for specific items:
  - Possession of property, inventory, securing/insuring property;
  - Mail-outs to creditors;
  - Publishing a newspaper notice;
  - Official receiver and registrar fees;
  - All other allowable disbursements (up to $1,000 adjusted)

> ⚠️ **Cap on B**: If the calculated value of B exceeds **$10,000 (adjusted)**, then **B = $0**.

> 💡 This prevents excessive or unjustified payments to trustees.

- The **annual average all-items CPI for Canada** (not seasonally adjusted), published by **Statistics Canada**.
