**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Fees in Respect of Fingerprinting and Criminal Record Verification (Reclaimed Names) Remission Order*

**Legal Basis:**  
This regulation is made under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11). It allows for the remission (i.e., full waiver or cancellation) of certain government fees associated with fingerprinting and criminal record verification for specific individuals seeking to reclaim Indigenous names that were imposed during the residential school system.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary purpose of this Order is to support the **reclamation of Indigenous names** that were forcibly changed on children during the Canadian residential school system. These name changes were part of a broader policy of cultural assimilation, which disrespected Indigenous identity, language, and heritage. This regulation recognizes the historical trauma and ongoing impacts of this policy and provides a practical, accessible pathway for affected individuals and their descendants to reclaim their ancestral names—without being burdened by associated administrative fees.

By remitting fees for fingerprinting and criminal record verification, the government acknowledges the disproportionate impact of colonial policies on Indigenous peoples and supports the healing process through the restoration of cultural identity.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Recognition of Historical Harm**:  
   The regulation formally acknowledges the legacy of the residential school system, particularly the systematic erasure of Indigenous names and identities.

2. **Support for Cultural Revitalization**:  
   By removing financial barriers to name reclamation, the government supports the broader movement toward cultural healing, identity restoration, and the revitalization of Indigenous languages and traditions.

3. **Accessibility and Equity**:  
   The fee remission ensures that individuals—especially those from marginalized or historically disadvantaged communities—can access essential services (e.g., applying for citizenship, employment, or legal documentation) without financial hardship.

4. **Alignment with National Reconciliation Efforts**:  
   This Order is consistent with Canada’s commitments under the *Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Calls to Action*, particularly **Call to Action #58**, which urges the government to support the reclamation of Indigenous names and identities.

5. **Non-Discriminatory and Inclusive**:  
   The regulation applies to all Indigenous peoples in Canada, regardless of specific First Nation, Métis, or Inuit status, as long as the conditions are met.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission **does not apply** to:
  - Name changes for non-Indigenous persons.
  - Requests made outside the five-year window.
  - Requests that do not clearly identify the imposed and reclaimed names.
  - Other types of name changes (e.g., for marriage, legal reasons unrelated to residential school history).
- The regulation **does not cover** fees for other services such as passport applications or immigration processes (unless those services are directly linked to fingerprinting or criminal record checks).

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a meaningful and timely step toward **restoring dignity, identity, and self-determination** for Indigenous individuals and their descendants. By waiving administrative fees tied to name reclamation, it reduces systemic barriers and affirms the importance of Indigenous cultural identity in Canada’s legal and social frameworks. It reflects a commitment to reconciliation, accountability, and justice in addressing the harms of colonialism.

This Order serves as both a practical policy tool and a symbolic gesture of recognition—honoring the resilience and strength of Indigenous communities in reclaiming their heritage.
