**Detailed Summary of the Critical Habitat of the Pugnose Minnow (Opsopoeodus emiliae) Order**

---

**1. Background and Legal Basis**

This regulatory instrument is a **Critical Habitat Order** issued under the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*, which is Canada’s primary legislation for the protection and recovery of wildlife species at risk. The Order specifically designates and formally recognizes the **critical habitat** of the **Pugnose Minnow (*Opsopoeodus emiliae*)**, a fish species listed as **threatened** under Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SARA (S.C. 2002, c. 29).

---

**2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made under **subsection 58(4) and 58(5)** of the *Species at Risk Act*, which empower the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to designate critical habitat for species at risk. These provisions allow the Minister to:

- Identify and define the specific areas essential for the survival or recovery of a species;
- Prohibit or restrict actions that could destroy or adversely affect that critical habitat;
- Ensure that such habitat is protected and managed appropriately.

The Order is issued in accordance with **subsection 58(1)** of SARA, which states that the critical habitat of a species at risk must be identified in the species’ recovery strategy. This ensures that the designation is grounded in scientific and conservation-based planning.

**3. Species at Risk Status**

The **Pugnose Minnow (*Opsopoeodus emiliae*)** is a small, native freshwater fish found primarily in the Canadian Prairies, particularly in the southern parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the southern portion of the United States (e.g., Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma). It is classified as **threatened** under SARA due to:

- Habitat loss and degradation;
- Changes in hydrology (e.g., water level fluctuations, channelization);
- Invasive species;
- Climate change impacts;
- Reduced water quality and flow regimes.

Its survival depends on specific ecological conditions, such as shallow, slow-moving, warm, and sandy-bottomed streams with stable water levels and natural vegetation.

**4. Recovery Strategy and Public Registry**

The critical habitat for the Pugnose Minnow was identified in the **official recovery strategy** for the species. This strategy was developed by the Canadian government in collaboration with scientists, Indigenous communities, and conservation partners to outline the necessary actions for the species’ recovery.

This recovery strategy, including its identification of critical habitat, has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, a publicly accessible database maintained by Environment and Climate Change Canada. This transparency ensures that the public, stakeholders, and regulators can access and review the scientific basis for the designation.

---

**5. Exclusion of Prohibited Areas (Subsection 58(2)b)**

A key legal consideration in this Order is that **no portion of the designated critical habitat falls within a place referred to in subsection 58(2)b of SARA**. This provision prohibits the Minister from designating critical habitat in areas that are:

- Already subject to a **provincial or territorial conservation or management plan** that is incompatible with the designation;
- Or areas that are **exempted or excluded** by other federal or provincial laws or policies.

By confirming that the designated critical habitat is **not in such a restricted or excluded area**, the Order avoids legal conflicts and ensures that the designation is both lawful and enforceable under SARA.

---

**6. Purpose and Effect of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:

- **Formally recognize and protect** the specific geographic areas essential for the survival and recovery of the Pugnose Minnow;
- Provide a legal basis for **prohibiting or restricting activities** (such as construction, dredging, or water diversion) that could degrade or destroy this habitat;
- Support the implementation of the species’ recovery strategy by ensuring that key ecological requirements are preserved;
- Enhance the effectiveness of conservation efforts through clear, legally binding spatial boundaries.

The Order does **not** impose direct restrictions on land use or development in general, but rather sets a legal framework under which future actions affecting the habitat must be assessed for potential harm.

---

**7. Effective Date**

The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette. This is the standard mechanism under SARA to ensure that the designation becomes legally effective once officially published and accessible to the public and regulatory bodies.

---

**8. Key Takeaways**

- The Pugnose Minnow is a **threatened species** under SARA.
- Its **critical habitat** has been scientifically identified and is formally recognized in the recovery strategy.
- The Order is **lawful and enforceable** because it does not fall within areas excluded under subsection 58(2)b.
- It establishes **legal protection** for specific areas essential to the species’ survival.
- The designation supports broader conservation goals under the Species at Risk Act and promotes ecosystem-based recovery.

---

**Conclusion**

This Critical Habitat Order represents a critical step in the conservation of the Pugnose Minnow. By legally defining and protecting its essential habitat, the Government of Canada ensures that the species has the best possible chance of recovery in the face of ongoing environmental pressures. It also exemplifies the integration of science, policy, and public transparency in Canada’s biodiversity protection framework.
