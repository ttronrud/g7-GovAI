### **Background and Legal Basis**

1. **Legal Framework – Navigable Waters Protection Act (NWPA):**  
   The *Navigable Waters Protection Act* (R.S.C. 1985, c. 27) is a Canadian federal law designed to protect the integrity of navigable waters and their surrounding ecosystems.  
   - **Section 22** of the Act establishes that certain rivers, streams, and waters are subject to specific environmental protections, including restrictions on activities that could degrade water quality or harm aquatic ecosystems.  
   - These protections apply to waters designated as "navigable" or otherwise under federal jurisdiction.

2. **Section 23 – Proclamation Power:**  
   Section 23 grants the Governor in Council the authority to issue a proclamation declaring that certain waters — even if they fall under the scope of Section 22 — may be **exempt from the operation of Section 22**.  
   - This exemption is permitted **only if the Governor in Council is satisfied that the public interest would not be injuriously affected** by such an exemption.

### **Subject of the Proclamation**

The proclamation declares that the following bodies of water in **Quebec** are exempt from the operation of **Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**:

- **Lake Pignac**  
- **Lake B**

> Note: "Lake B" is not a widely recognized or standard geographical name in official Canadian hydrology. It may refer to a local or lesser-known lake, possibly a typo or a reference to a specific lake within a regional context (e.g., in a municipal or provincial document). However, in this proclamation, it is formally recognized as a named body of water in Quebec.

---

### **Reason for Exemption**

The Governor in Council has determined — based on a thorough assessment — that:

- Exempting Lake Pignac and Lake B from Section 22 of the NWPA **would not harm the public interest**.
- This determination was made after considering environmental, economic, social, and operational factors, including:
  - The nature and use of the lakes (e.g., recreational, agricultural, or industrial purposes),
  - Potential impacts of restrictions on water use,
  - Alternatives to regulation,
  - Environmental sensitivity and ecological status of the lakes,
  - Public safety and community needs.

> The exemption is not a blanket removal of all environmental protections, but rather a specific, limited exemption from the **prohibitions and restrictions under Section 22**.

---

### **Legal Process and Precedent**

- The proclamation follows **Order in Council P.C. 2013-615**, issued on **May 30, 2013**, which authorized the issuance of the proclamation.
- This order demonstrates the formal administrative process: the Governor in Council first issued a directive to issue a proclamation, and then the proclamation itself was published and affixed with the Great Seal of Canada.
- The proclamation is issued under the authority of the **Governor General of Canada**, who acts on the advice of the Privy Council.

---

### **Effect of the Proclamation**

- **Lake Pignac and Lake B** are **exempt from the restrictions and obligations imposed by Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**.
- This means that:
  - Activities such as dredging, construction, discharges, or modifications to the lakes that would otherwise be prohibited under Section 22 may proceed **without requiring prior environmental approvals** under that section.
  - The exemption applies **in whole or in part**, depending on the specific nature of the water body and the activities involved.
- However, **other federal environmental laws** (such as the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act* or *Fisheries Act*) may still apply.

---

### **Public Notice and Compliance**

- The proclamation is **publicly published** and serves as legal notice to:
  - Government agencies,
  - Municipalities,
  - Private landowners,
  - Environmental organizations,
  - Industry operators,
  - The general public.
- All persons and entities affected by the exemption are **required to take notice** and **govern themselves accordingly**.
- This ensures transparency and legal clarity in the application of environmental regulation.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Environmental Balance:**  
   The exemption reflects a balance between environmental protection and economic or community needs. It allows for development or use of these lakes without the full burden of Section 22 restrictions.

2. **Jurisdictional Flexibility:**  
   It demonstrates the flexibility within Canadian environmental law to tailor protections based on local conditions and stakeholder input.

3. **Administrative Oversight:**  
   The process underscores the role of the Governor in Council and the Privy Council in exercising discretionary powers under federal environmental legislation.

4. **Potential for Future Review:**  
   Since the exemption is conditional on the public interest not being harmed, it may be subject to periodic review or revocation if future assessments indicate adverse impacts.

### **Key Figures and Authority**

- **David Johnston** (Governor General of Canada at the time):  
  Signed the proclamation as Governor General, affirming its legal validity.  
  His title includes:  
  - Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada  
  - Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Military Merit  
  - Chancellor and Commander of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces  
  - Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada

- **Privy Council:**  
  Provided the legal and policy advice that justified the exemption under Section 23.

### **Conclusion**

This proclamation is a formal, legally binding instrument that **exempts two specific lakes in Quebec — Lake Pignac and Lake B — from the environmental restrictions under Section 22 of the Navigable Waters Protection Act**, based on a determination that the public interest would not be harmed. It reflects a discretionary, case-specific application of environmental law, emphasizing practicality and stakeholder considerations while maintaining legal accountability through a transparent and published process.

---

**Final Note:**  
This proclamation is a **non-binding environmental decision** in the sense that it does not override broader environmental standards, but rather provides a specific exemption within the existing legal framework. It remains subject to future review and potential modification based on new environmental or social data.
