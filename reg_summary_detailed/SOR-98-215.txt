## 🚪 **Importation of Firearms by Non-Residents**

### 1. **Declaration Requirements**
- A **non-resident importing a firearm** must **declare it in writing** under **paragraph 35(1)(b)** of the Act.
- **Exception**: If the non-resident meets the conditions in **subparagraph 35(1)(b)(iii)**, the declaration may be made **orally**.

### 2. **Information Required in Declaration (for each firearm)**
The non-resident must provide the Registrar with the following details:
- Full name and address
- Date of birth
- Gender
- Reason(s) for importing the firearm
- Total number of firearms being imported

For **each firearm**, the following must be specified:
- Destination in Canada
- Whether it is a **frame or receiver only**
- Make
- Manufacturer (if different from make)
- Model
- Serial number (if any)
- Type
- Action (e.g., semi-automatic, bolt-action)
- Calibre or gauge
- Capacity of cartridge magazine (number of rounds)
- Barrel length

> This detailed reporting ensures transparency and traceability of imported firearms.

### 3. **Reporting Deadline**
- The **Registrar’s report** (confirmation of receipt) expires **six months** from the date it is sent.
- A report is considered "sufficiently sent" if:
  - It is addressed to the non-resident at their current address (as updated in writing), or
  - It is transmitted via **electronic means that can produce a paper record** (e.g., email with printable attachment).

> This ensures timely processing and compliance with reporting timelines.

## 🚗 **Customs Officer Confirmation of Importation**

- A customs officer must **confirm** the declaration and **authorize transport** by providing the non-resident with a **confirmation number**.
- **Method of confirmation**:
  - Can be **in writing** or **orally**.
- **Exception**: If the non-resident satisfies **subparagraph 35(1)(b)(iii)**, the customs officer may confirm the declaration by **stamping the documents with the date of importation** instead of issuing a formal confirmation number.

> This flexibility allows for efficient processing under certain conditions.

---

## 🚚 **Exporting Firearms (After Importation)**

### 1. **Eligibility to Export**
A non-resident may export a firearm they imported under **section 35 or 35.1** of the Act **only if**:
- They meet the requirements of **paragraph 37(1)(a)** of the Act, **and**
- At the time of importation, they provided the customs officer with the **intended date of export**.

> This requirement ensures that export intentions are recorded and tracked.

### 2. **Change in Export Date**
- If the non-resident learns **after importation** that the firearm will be exported **after the originally stated date**, they must:
  - Notify the **Registrar** **on or before** the original intended export date.
  - If the new date is known, provide it; if not, notify the Registrar **without delay** once the date becomes known.

> This maintains accountability and prevents unreported exports.

### 3. **Permits and Authorizations**
- Permits issued under **section 7 of the Export and Import Permits Act** are **deemed authorizations** to export under the *Firearms Act*.

> This links export permit law to import/export procedures.
