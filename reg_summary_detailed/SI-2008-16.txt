The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2017-9" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 2017/9 has been officially repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling legislation, or the subject matter — e.g., environmental, health, transport, or employment regulation), a detailed summary of its content cannot be provided, because:

1. **The regulation itself is repealed**: The fact that it is marked as "Repealed, SI/2017-9" means that the instrument no longer exists in force. It was formally revoked by a later legislative or statutory instrument, and therefore has no current legal effect.

2. **No content is available**: Repealed instruments are typically archived in official databases (such as the UK Statutory Instruments database or the legislation.gov.uk website). To obtain a detailed summary, one would need to consult the original text of SI 2017/9 before it was repealed — which is not provided here.

3. **Possible origin**: SI 2017/9 may have been a minor or technical regulation (e.g., relating to licensing, administrative procedures, or compliance) that was later deemed obsolete or superseded by a more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation.

**Conclusion**:
The regulation SI/2017-9 has been formally repealed and is no longer in force. As such, it does not currently have legal effect, and no detailed summary of its content can be provided without access to the original, pre-repeal version of the instrument.

To obtain a detailed summary of what SI 2017/9 originally contained, you should consult the official UK legislation database (e.g., legislation.gov.uk) and search for "Statutory Instrument 2017 No. 9" prior to its repeal. Once the original text is accessed, a summary can be prepared based on its provisions.
