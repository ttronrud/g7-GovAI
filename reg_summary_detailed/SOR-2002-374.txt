Certainly. Below is a **detailed, structured summary** of the **New Substances Fees Regulations**, as published under the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, effective January 1, 2003.

## 📚 **Detailed Summary of the New Substances Fees Regulations**

### 🔹 **Legal Basis and Adoption**
These regulations were made under **section 328** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999)*, which authorizes the Minister of the Environment to establish fees for services related to the assessment of new substances. The regulations were:
- **Proposed** on June 30, 2001, in *Canada Gazette, Part I*.
- **Reviewed** with public comment periods, including opportunities for objections and formal submissions.
- **Approved** by the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Health, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board.
- **Effective** January 1, 2003.

The fees are **not to exceed** the actual cost incurred by Her Majesty in Right of Canada in providing the services (as required by section 328), and the Ministers consulted with relevant stakeholders before final adoption (section 329).

### 🔹 **Key Definitions**
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* |
| **Assessment** | The evaluation of information about a new substance to determine if it is toxic or capable of becoming toxic (under section 83 of CEPA) |
| **DSL** | Domestic Substances List — substances already registered and listed by the Minister under subsection 66(1) of CEPA |
| **NDSL** | Non-Domestic Substances List — substances not in Canada but regulated under CEPA (subsection 66(2)) |
| **New Substance** | Any substance not currently on the DSL |
| **Notifier** | A person who manufactures or imports a new substance, or intends to, and who provides required information under the *New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)* (paragraph 81(1)(a)) |

---

### 🔹 **Exclusions (Where Regulations Do Not Apply)**

The fees **do not apply** to the following:

1. **Biochemicals, biopolymers, and research and development substances** — regulated under the *New Substances Notification Regulations (Chemicals and Polymers)*.
2. **Organisms** — regulated under the *New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)*.
3. **Substances used in regulated activities** — where the use is governed by other federal Acts, such as:
   - *Food and Drugs Act*
   - *Fisheries Act*
   - *Health of Animals Act*

> ⚠️ This means that if a new substance is used in food, fisheries, or animal health, the fees under these regulations are **not triggered** — instead, other regulatory frameworks apply.

### 🔹 **Fee Structure and Application**

#### ✅ **Section 3: First-Time Notification (Initial Assessment)**
- A notifier who **first provides** information under any schedule in **column 1 of Schedule 1** must pay a fee for the assessment.
- The fee is determined based on the **notifier’s annual sales in Canada**.
- Fees are set in **column 2** of Schedule 1, under the appropriate sales bracket.

| Sales Bracket | Fee (CAD) |
|--------------|----------|
| ≤ $13 million | [Fee amount] |
| > $13 ≤ $26 million | [Fee amount] |
| > $26 ≤ $40 million | [Fee amount] |
| > $40 million | [Fee amount] |

> *Note: Specific amounts are not provided in the text, but the structure is clear — fees increase with sales.*

#### ✅ **Section 4: Subsequent Schedules (Additional Assessments)**
- If a notifier has already provided information under one schedule and later provides information under **another schedule** (same substance), they must pay a **reduced fee**.
- The fee is reduced by **any amount previously paid** for the same substance under prior schedules.
- **No negative fee** — the reduction cannot result in a negative amount.

> Example: If $500 was paid for a prior schedule, and a new schedule requires $800, the fee becomes $300 (not -$300).

#### ✅ **Section 5: No Further Reporting Required (Final Assessment)**
- For a substance where the notifier **does not need to provide further information** under the regulations (e.g., only Schedule 5 or 9 is required and no future updates are needed), the fee is based on **Schedule 2, column 2**, again linked to annual sales.
- Like Section 4, **any prior fees are subtracted**, but not below zero.

#### ✅ **Section 6: Matched Notification (Information Sharing)**
- If a notifier requests the **use of previously provided information** from another notifier (a "matched notification"), they are **not required** to pay under Sections 3, 4, or 5.
- Instead, they pay a **flat fee of $200** for the assessment.

> This encourages information sharing and reduces duplication of effort.

#### ✅ **Section 7: Consolidated Notification (Same Class, Identical Info)**
- If a notifier provides information for **up to six substances of the same class**, and the information is **identical** (a "consolidated notification"), then:
  - They pay the **full fee for one substance** (as per Section 3, 4, or 5).
  - They pay **$250 per additional substance** (up to five more).

> This promotes efficiency in reporting for substances with similar chemical profiles.

#### ✅ **Maximum Fee Cap**
- Despite all other provisions, the **maximum fee** is capped:
  - **$2,625** if annual sales in Canada are **less than $40 million**
  - **$3,500** if annual sales are **$40 million or more**

> This ensures fees remain reasonable even for large-scale producers.

---

### 🔹 **Fee for Specific Services (Schedule 3)**

- A fee is charged for each service listed in **Schedule 3** (e.g., masked name applications, Four Corners Agreement services).
- The fee is determined by the **notifier’s annual sales in Canada**, using the same sales brackets as in Schedule 1.

> These services include:
- Search of substances on DSL or NDSL under masked names
- Application for a masked name (as defined in the Masked Name Regulations)
- Application under the **Four Corners Agreement** with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Environment Canada / Health Canada

---

### 🔹 **Sales Reporting Requirement**

- To qualify for fees based on **annual sales in Canada**, the notifier must:
  - Provide **sales reports** for Canada
  - Based on **financial statements** from the previous fiscal year
  - Prepared in accordance with **Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)**
  - **Certified as true and correct** by:
    - The notifier (individual), or
    - The manager responsible for financial affairs (in the case of a corporation)

> Without certified sales data, fees default to the **$40 million+ bracket**.

---

### 🔹 **Payment Method**

Fees must be paid at the time of service request via:
1. **Certified cheque or money order** to the Receiver General of Canada, **or**
2. **Credit card** — only if the card issuer has entered into an agreement with the Government of Canada to accept such payments.

> This ensures secure, traceable, and government-accepted payment methods.

---

### 🔹 **Effective Date**
- These regulations **come into force on January 1, 2003**.

## 📌 Key Objectives and Implications

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cost Recovery** | Fees are designed to recover the actual cost of assessing new substances, ensuring sustainability of the regulatory process. |
| **Incentivize Information Sharing** | Matched and consolidated notifications reduce costs and encourage collaboration among industry players. |
| **Prevent Overcharging** | Maximum fee caps protect smaller companies from excessive fees. |
| **Promote Efficiency** | By allowing fee reductions for repeated assessments and shared data, the system reduces administrative burden. |
| **Regulatory Clarity** | Clear definitions and schedules make it easier for industry to understand and comply. |

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes and Limitations

- **Not applicable** to substances under other federal Acts (e.g., food, animal health).
- **No fees** for substances that are already on the DSL or NDSL.
- **Fees are only for assessment**, not for other regulatory actions (e.g., approvals, testing, labeling).
- **Sales data is critical** — failure to provide it results in default to the higher fee bracket.
