The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the repeal of specific sections of a regulation, specifically:

- **SOR/2013-159, s. 1**  
- **SOR/2004–117, s. 2**

However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text — only annotations indicating that certain sections have been repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Text:**  
This is not a summary of an active regulation, but rather a list of **repeal notices**. The repeated entries indicate that specific provisions of prior regulations have been formally removed from force by later amendments.

**2. Repealed Regulation References:**

- **SOR/2004–117, s. 2**:  
  This refers to Section 2 of the *Regulation respecting the operation of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOLTC) – Emergency Measures* (or a similar regulation), which was repealed in 2013. The repeal under SOR/2013-159, s. 1 indicates that this section was no longer in effect after the coming into force of the 2013 regulation.

- **SOR/2013-159, s. 1**:  
  This section of the *Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/2013-159)* explicitly repeals certain prior provisions. The repeated references suggest that multiple sections (or provisions) were repealed under this single section, possibly including those referenced in SOR/2004–117, s. 2.

**3. Legal Context:**  
In Ontario, Statutory Rules (SORs) are official instruments that implement or amend legislation. When a section is "repealed," it means it is officially removed from the law and no longer has legal effect. Repeals are often introduced to modernize regulations, eliminate outdated provisions, or align with new legislative frameworks.

**4. Implications of the Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, requirements, or definitions previously established under the repealed sections are no longer enforceable.  
- Entities (such as healthcare providers, government departments, or private organizations) that relied on those provisions must now comply with current, updated regulations.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader reform to streamline or modernize health or administrative regulations.

**5. Status of the Regulation:**  
As of now, **the specific regulation being referred to (the one previously containing s. 2 of SOR/2004–117) is no longer in force** due to the repeal. The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2013-159, s. 1**, which formally removed those provisions from the legal framework.

### Final Summary:

The provided text is a list of repeals indicating that certain sections of a prior Ontario regulation — specifically **Section 2 of SOR/2004–117** and **various provisions under SOR/2013-159, s. 1** — have been formally removed from legal effect. These repeals were enacted to update or modernize the regulatory framework, likely in the context of health or administrative services. As a result, the referenced provisions are **no longer valid or enforceable** under current Ontario law. There is no active regulation described in the text — only a record of legislative repeal.
