**Detailed Summary of the Agricultural Marketing Programs Regulations (S.C. 1997, c. 20)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Agricultural Marketing Programs Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 20), made under the authority of the *Agricultural Marketing Programs Act*, establish detailed rules governing the administration, eligibility, security, repayment, and oversight of agricultural marketing programs. These regulations define key terms, prescribe criteria for determining eligibility and default, set financial thresholds, and outline procedures for collection, overpayment, and enforcement.

They are designed to support Canadian farmers and producers by providing financial advances for agricultural production, while ensuring that repayments are managed fairly and responsibly, with protections for individuals facing hardship (e.g., death, incapacity, or financial distress).

### **3. Criteria for Determining "Not Processed" (Paragraph 4.1(1)(c) of the Act)**

An agricultural product is considered **not processed** if:
- **Animals** (e.g., cattle, sheep): are **alive**.
- **Plants** (e.g., crops): are in the **natural state in which they grew**, except for:
  - Harvesting;
  - Perishable storage (e.g., refrigeration, freezing, controlled atmosphere) to prevent spoilage;
  - Addition of preserving agents (only if necessary for storage).
- **Plant parts** (e.g., fruits, grains): are in their **harvested, unaltered state**, with the same exceptions as above.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that only minimally processed products qualify for certain marketing program benefits.

---

### **4. Designation of Livestock and Agricultural Products**

- **Livestock** under the Act includes: **cattle, goats, sheep, hogs, rabbits, red deer, boar, and elk**.
- **Cervid antler velvet and bees** are designated as **agricultural products subject to Part I** of the Act.

> *Purpose:* To expand coverage to specific high-value or niche agricultural products.

The following breeding animals are covered:
- **Cattle, goats, and sheep** if intended for **sale during the production period** of the advance.
- **Hogs**:
  - **Less than 12 months old** if intended for **breeding purposes** during the production period.
  - **More than 10 months old** if intended for **non-breeding purposes** (e.g., meat, sale) during the production period.

> *Purpose:* To ensure that breeding stock is properly supported and that advances are tied to actual production timelines.

---

### **6. Ceasing to Own or Be Responsible for Marketing (Paragraph 10(1)(a) of the Act)**

A producer is deemed to have **ceased ownership or marketing responsibility** when:
- The product has been **sold or processed**; and
- (Except for horticultural crops, maple syrup, or honey) the product has been **placed in a pool**.

> *Purpose:* To trigger the end of an advance obligation upon actual sale or pooling.

---

### **7. Administrator’s Percentage (Paragraph 19(1)(c) of the Act)**

- **Initial percentage**: 3% if the administrator has **not completed one program year**.
- **Calculation method**:
  - Uses the **five most recent program years** (or all completed years if fewer than five).
  - Formula:
    $$
    \text{Administrator’s percentage} = \frac{\text{Sum of outstanding principal balances of defaulting producers (10 months after year-end)}}{\text{Sum of total principal advanced in those years}}
    $$
- **Exclusions**:
  - Amounts owed by **deceased producers** in default.
  - Amounts owed by producers deemed **legally incapable** of making decisions.

> *Purpose:* To assess administrative liability in cases of default and determine compensation or recovery obligations.

### **8. Attribution of Advances to Related Producers (Paragraphs 9(2) and 20(2) of the Act)**

Advances received by related producers are attributed based on their **ownership or profit-sharing structure**:

| Scenario | Attribution Rule |
|--------|------------------|

| One individual + one partnership | Individual gets **percentage of their profit entitlement** in the partnership |
| One individual + one corporation | Individual gets **percentage of voting shares** they own |
| One individual + one cooperative | Individual gets **percentage of revenue or profit entitlement** |
| Two non-individuals related under paragraph 3(2)(d) | Each gets **100%** |
| Two non-individuals related otherwise (e.g., corporation + partnership) | Non-individual gets **percentage of ownership or profit entitlement** |

> **Key Provisions**:

### **9. Overpayment Definition (Paragraph 10(2) of the Act)**

- The **value of the produced product or security is reduced** (due to no fault), and the advance exceeds the reduced value of the security by more than the **limit**.

> **Limit** = greater of:
- 10% of the advance; or
- $10,000

> **Priority Rule**:
- If both (1)(a) and (1)(b) apply, **overpayment is calculated under (1)(b)**.
