**Detailed Summary of the *Posting Abroad of Letter-Post Items Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**"Posting Abroad of Letter-Post Items Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and serves to govern the handling of letter-post items (mail) that are sent *outside of Canada* to an addressee *in Canada* under specific conditions involving volume or purpose.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

#### **(a) "Large Quantities" (Grande quantité)**
- Refers to the volume of letter-post items posted in a single day or over a month.
- **Thresholds:**
  - **More than 50 letter-post items** posted on **any one day** by or on behalf of a person.
  - **More than 300 letter-post items** posted in **any one month** by or on behalf of the same person.
- This threshold is designed to identify bulk mailing activities that may be used to exploit postal rate differences.

#### **(b) "Letter-Post Item"**
- Defined consistently with the **International Letter-Post Items Regulations**.
- Typically refers to standard postal items such as letters, printed cards, envelopes, or wrappers that are sent via postal services.
- Excludes other forms of mail (e.g., parcels, registered mail, or non-letter items).

#### **(c) "Person"**
- Includes any of the following:
  - Individual
  - Sole proprietorship
  - Partnership
  - Incorporated entity (corporation or legal business structure)
- The regulation applies to all such entities or individuals when they engage in posting letter-post items abroad.

---

### **3. Applicable Situation**

The regulation applies when:
- A **letter-post item** is posted **in a country other than Canada**.
- The item is sent **to an addressee in Canada**.
- The sender is **a person resident in Canada** (i.e., the sender has a Canadian address or legal presence).
- The posting qualifies as **"large quantities"** (i.e., exceeds the thresholds defined above).

---

### **4. Regulatory Actions When Conditions Are Met**

If the above conditions are met, the **Corporation** (referring to Canada Post or the Canadian postal service) has two possible responses:

#### **Option 1: Return the Items to the Country of Origin**
- If the Corporation has **reasonable grounds to believe** that:
  - The **sole purpose** of posting the items abroad is to **profit from lower postage rates** in the foreign country,  
    *(i.e., the sender is using foreign postal rates to reduce costs and gain a financial advantage)*,
- Then the Corporation may **return the letter-post items to the country of origin** (where they were sent from).

#### **Option 2: Require Payment of Full Canadian Postage**
- If the items are **printed papers** (such as cards, envelopes, or wrappers) that:
  - Are **addressed for return to an address in Canada**,  
    *(indicating a potential return or refund mechanism)*,
- Then the Corporation may **require the sender to pay full postage**.
- This postage must be calculated at the **rate that would have applied if the items had been posted directly in Canada**.

> ✅ **Key Point**: The sender is not charged the foreign postal rate — they are charged what they would have paid had the mail been sent directly within Canada.

---

### **5. Determining the "Post Office of Posting" for Postage Calculation**

For the purpose of calculating the required Canadian postage under paragraph (1)(e):

- The **Canadian post office** where the letter-post items are **received from the foreign country** is deemed to be the **"post office of posting"**.
- This ensures consistency in the application of rates and prevents manipulation of the calculation process.

> Example: If a Canadian sender mails 100 letters to Canada via a foreign postal service, and those letters are later received by a Canadian post office in Toronto, then the Toronto post office is treated as the "post office of posting" for calculating Canadian postage.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Consequences of Non-Compliance**

If the sender **refuses to pay** the required Canadian postage:
- The Corporation will treat the letter-post items as **undeliverable mail**.
- This action is governed by the **Undeliverable and Redirected Mail Regulations**.
- As a result:
  - The mail will be **declared undeliverable**.
  - It may be **returned to the sender** or **destroyed**, depending on postal policy.
  - The sender may face **financial penalties or administrative consequences**, depending on the jurisdiction and enforcement mechanisms.

---

### **7. Status and Legal Note**

> ⚠️ **Revoked**  
This regulation has been **revoked** by **SOR/83-620, section 2** (Statutory Order 83-620, Section 2).  
- This means the regulation is **no longer in force** as of the date of revocation.
- It has been replaced or superseded by newer legislation or policy.

> 🔍 **Implication**:  
Although the regulation is technically revoked, its **principles and intent** — to prevent abuse of lower foreign postal rates and to ensure fair postage charges for mail sent abroad — may still be reflected in current postal policies or in other regulations (such as the *International Letter-Post Items Regulations* or *Postal Services Regulations*).

### **8. Summary of Key Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prevent rate abuse** | Stops individuals or businesses from sending large volumes of mail abroad to exploit lower postage rates. |
| **Ensure fair pricing** | Requires payment of Canadian postage rates even when mail is sent abroad. |

### **Conclusion**

While the *Posting Abroad of Letter-Post Items Regulations* are now **revoked**, they historically played a key role in regulating cross-border mail to prevent financial exploitation of postal rate differences. The core principles — identifying large-volume mail sent abroad with return addresses, and requiring Canadian postage — remain relevant in modern postal policy and may be incorporated into current regulations governing international mail.

> 📌 **Note for Practitioners**: Businesses or individuals sending bulk mail to Canada from abroad should ensure compliance with current postal regulations, especially regarding volume thresholds, return addresses, and postage obligations. Always consult the most up-to-date official sources (e.g., Canada Post website or federal legislation databases) for current rules.
