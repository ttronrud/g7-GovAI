The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-13" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 13 of 2018 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title or the enabling legislation under which it was issued), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the *content* of the regulation that was repealed. The designation "SI/2018-13" refers to the 13th Statutory Instrument passed in the United Kingdom in 2018, but the actual substance of the regulation (its provisions, objectives, scope, or impact) is not disclosed in the reference alone.

In general, when a regulation is described as "repealed," it means that it is no longer in force and has been officially cancelled by a subsequent legal instrument, typically to:

- Replace outdated or ineffective rules  
- Reflect changes in policy or law  
- Simplify the regulatory framework  
- Align with new legislation  

Therefore, a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be provided because:

1. The specific title and content of SI/2018-13 are not included in your query.  
2. The regulation has been repealed, meaning it is no longer active or applicable.  
3. Repeal does not provide details about the original regulation's content.

To obtain a detailed summary of the original regulation, you would need to consult the official UK legislation database (such as legislation.gov.uk) and search for "Statutory Instrument 2018 No. 13" to view the full text of the instrument prior to repeal.

If you can provide the full title or subject matter (e.g., "Regulation on road safety" or "Rules on environmental permits"), I can assist in summarizing the original content of that regulation before it was repealed.
