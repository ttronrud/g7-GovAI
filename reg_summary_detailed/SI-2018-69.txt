---

**Regulation Summary:**

**1. Legal Authority and Source:**

- The regulation is issued under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (commonly referred to as the "PSR Act").
- This provision grants the Governor General in Council the authority to transfer powers, duties, and functions between ministers in the federal government, particularly in the context of public service restructuring or administrative realignment.

**2. Subject Matter of the Transfer:**

- The regulation concerns the **transfer of powers, duties, and functions** previously assigned to the **Minister of State styled the Minister of Science**.
- These powers, duties, and functions were originally transferred to the Minister of State (Minister of Science) under **Part I of the Budget Implementation Act, 1997** (S.C. 1997, c. 26).
- Specifically, the transfer was initially made via **Order in Council P.C. 2017-76**, dated **February 1, 2017** (SI/2017-10), which reorganized certain responsibilities between ministers.

**3. Nature of the Action:**

- The current regulation **reverts or reassigns** those powers, duties, and functions **back to the Minister of Science** (the main Minister, not the Minister of State).
- In other words, it **transfers the responsibilities previously held by the Minister of State (Minister of Science)** — which were granted to that office under the 2017 Order — **to the full Minister of Science**.
- This action effectively **reinstates the Minister of Science as the holder of those functions**, consolidating authority in that ministerial office.

**4. Legal and Procedural Context:**

- The regulation is published under **S.C. 2003, c. 22, section 207**, which provides the legal framework for ministerial transfers and reassignments within the federal government.
- The reference to **R.S., c. P-34** (the *Public Service Act*) indicates that the transfer is consistent with the broader public service structure and accountability framework.
- The **Budget Implementation Act, 1997** (S.C. 1997, c. 26) is the original legislative instrument that authorized the initial transfer of duties, and the 2017 Order (P.C. 2017-76) implemented that transfer in practice.

**5. Purpose and Implication:**

- The purpose of this regulation is to **restore or realign ministerial responsibility** for science-related functions to the Minister of Science, ensuring that the primary minister (not a junior minister or minister of state) retains oversight.
- This may reflect a policy decision to strengthen the coordination and accountability of science policy, research, innovation, or technology within the federal government.
- It may also indicate a reorganization of ministerial portfolios to improve efficiency, clarity of responsibility, or alignment with current government priorities.

**6. Effective Date and Publication:**

- The regulation is published in the *Canada Gazette*, a formal legal publication of the Government of Canada.
- The citation **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207** indicates that it is a statutory provision, and the reference to **SI/2017-10** confirms that it is an Order in Council that was enacted on February 1, 2017, and is now being reactivated or reaffirmed.

**In Summary:**

This regulation formally reassigns certain powers, duties, and functions related to science policy — originally transferred to a Minister of State in 2017 — back to the **Minister of Science** (the main minister) under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. It reaffirms the Minister of Science’s responsibility for those functions, ensuring continuity and proper ministerial oversight in the federal science portfolio. The action is rooted in established legislative authority and aligns with broader government efforts to streamline and clarify ministerial responsibilities.

**Note:**  
This is a technical, administrative regulation rather than a policy or legislative change. It does not create new laws but rather reorganizes existing responsibilities between government offices.
