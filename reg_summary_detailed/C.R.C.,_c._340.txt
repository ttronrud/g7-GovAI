**Detailed Summary of the Rabies Indemnification Regulations**

**Regulation Title:**  
The Rabies Indemnification Regulations (SOR/81-136, s. 1)

---

**1. Citation and Applicability**  
These regulations are formally known as the *Rabies Indemnification Regulations*. They establish a framework under which the federal government may provide financial reimbursement to provincial governments for costs incurred by provinces in compensating owners of animals that have died due to rabies.

---

**2. Definition of Key Term**  
- **"Minister"** refers to the **Minister of Agriculture** of the federal government. This Minister has the authority to administer and implement the indemnification provisions under these regulations.

---

**3. Reimbursement Authority**  
Subject to specific limitations outlined in **Sections 4 and 5**, the Minister may reimburse **any province** for **2/5 (40%)** of the amount that the province has paid to animal owners for animals that died as a result of rabies.

- This means that if a province pays an owner $1,000 for a rabid animal, the federal government may reimburse the province up to **$800** (i.e., 40% of $1,000).
- The reimbursement is **not a direct payment to the animal owner**, but rather a **reimbursement to the province** for its own out-of-pocket expenditures.

---

**4. Maximum Reimbursement per Animal**  
The Minister is limited in the amount of reimbursement that can be provided per animal, based on the type of animal. The maximum amounts are as follows:

| Animal Type | Maximum Reimbursement per Animal |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Cattle     | $400                             |
| Horses     | $200                             |
| Sheep      | $80                              |
| Swine      | $80                              |
| Goats      | $80                              |

- These limits apply to the **total amount reimbursed by the Minister** to the province per animal, regardless of the province's original payment.
- The reimbursement cap ensures that the federal government does not cover excessive or disproportionate costs.

**5. Requirement for Certification**  
No payment under Section 3 (the reimbursement provision) may be made **unless** the Minister has first received a **certificate** from a **veterinary inspector**.

- The certificate must be issued under the *Animal Disease and Protection Act*.
- The certificate must **certify that the animal died as a result of rabies**.
- This requirement ensures that only animals confirmed to have died from rabies are eligible for reimbursement, preventing fraudulent claims or payments for animals that died from other causes.

---

**Key Implications and Purpose**  
- The regulations serve as a **financial safety net** for provinces, helping to offset the economic burden placed on them when animal owners are compensated for livestock that die from rabies.
- The 40% reimbursement rate (2/5) is designed to provide **partial support**, not full compensation, reflecting a balance between federal responsibility and provincial accountability.
- The animal-specific caps ensure **proportional and fair compensation**, based on the typical economic value of different livestock types.
- The veterinary certification requirement ensures **accuracy, transparency, and public health integrity**—preventing misuse of funds and supporting disease control efforts.

---

**Limitations and Exceptions**  
- The regulations are **subject to Sections 4 and 5**, which may impose further conditions or restrictions (e.g., time limits, reporting requirements, or eligibility criteria for specific provinces or circumstances). These are not detailed in the provided text but are implied to govern the scope and operation of the reimbursement program.
- The Minister is **not required** to reimburse all claims; eligibility is conditional upon both certification and compliance with the stated limits.

---

**Conclusion**  
The Rabies Indemnification Regulations provide a structured, accountable, and limited mechanism for federal financial support to provinces. By reimbursing up to 40% of provincial payments for animals that died from rabies—within species-specific caps and only after veterinary certification—the regulations aim to support animal owner relief while maintaining fiscal responsibility and disease control standards.
