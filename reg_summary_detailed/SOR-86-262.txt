  Refers to a company incorporated under Ontario law with its principal place of business at **Baie Verte, Newfoundland**.

- **Minister**:  
  The **Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion** (the responsible government department for overseeing regional industrial development).

  Any individual or entity that lends money to Baie Verte Mines Inc., *excluding*:
  - The Government of Canada
  - Any provincial government of Canada
  - Any agency of the above governments or any company effectively controlled by them

> This definition ensures that public or government-related financial institutions are excluded from qualifying for insurance under the scheme.

### **3. Scope and Purpose of Insurance**

- The Minister may provide **insurance coverage** for **losses up to a maximum aggregate of one million Canadian dollars (CAD)** resulting from loans made by private lenders to Baie Verte Mines Inc.
- The insurance covers **only losses** arising from the **default or non-repayment** of such loans.
- The coverage is **limited in total** to **CAD 1,000,000 across all insured loans** — not per loan, but cumulatively.

---

### **4. Eligibility Criteria for Loans to Be Insured**

A loan made by a private lender to Baie Verte Mines Inc. **may only be insured** if it meets **both** of the following conditions:

1. **Purpose and Amount**:
   - The loan must be for **revolving credit advances** used for **working capital purposes**.
   - The total loan amount must **not exceed four million CAD**.

2. **Security Requirement**:
   - The loan must be **secured** by:
     - The **inventory** of Baie Verte Mines Inc., or
     - The **accounts receivable**, or
     - **Both inventory and accounts receivable** together.

> This ensures that the loan is backed by tangible, measurable assets of the company, reducing risk to the insurer.

---

### **5. Duration of Insurance**

- The insurance provided under these regulations **expires on March 1, 1987**.
- After this date, the insurance program is no longer active, and no further coverage will be provided.

> This indicates a **temporary, time-limited initiative**, likely designed to support a specific phase of economic development or stabilization of a key mining operation.

---

### **6. Reduction of Insurance Coverage**

- The Minister has the authority to **reduce the amount of insurance in force** at the request of the private lender.
- This provision allows flexibility in response to changing risk assessments, financial performance, or other factors.

> The private lender must formally request such a reduction.

---

### **7. Premium Payments**

- Private lenders are required to pay a **semi-annual premium** to the Minister.
- The premium rate is **1% per year** of the **amount of insurance currently in force**.
- Payments are made **in advance** (i.e., before the period begins).

> Example: If a private lender has CAD 500,000 of insurance in force, they must pay 1% of CAD 500,000 = CAD 5,000 every six months.

---

### **8. Limits on Minister's Liability Upon Demand**

When a private lender demands repayment of a loan that is insured under these regulations, the Minister’s obligation is **limited** to the **lesser of two amounts**:

1. The **amount of insurance currently in force** on the date of the demand.
2. **100% of the actual loss** incurred by the private lender.

> This means:
> - The Minister will not pay more than the insurance limit (e.g., if insurance is CAD 800,000, the maximum payout is CAD 800,000).
> - The Minister will not pay more than the actual financial loss suffered by the lender.

> This caps the government’s liability and protects against overpayment in cases where the loss is less than the insurance coverage.

---

### **9. Application Process**

- Any request for insurance must be submitted **directly to the Minister**.
- The application must include **all information and documents** that the Minister may reasonably require to assess the risk and eligibility of the loan.

> This ensures transparency, due diligence, and proper oversight in the insurance process.

- The **strict eligibility criteria** (working capital, security, loan limits) ensure that only high-quality, well-secured loans are covered.
- The **time-limited nature** (ending in 1987) suggests this was a **short-term intervention**, possibly tied to a specific economic development initiative or a period of financial instability.

### **Conclusion**

The *Baie Verte Mines Inc. Regulations, 1985* constitute a **targeted, temporary, and risk-managed insurance scheme** designed to support private lending to a key mining company in Newfoundland. By setting clear eligibility standards, defining coverage limits, and imposing financial obligations on lenders, the regulations balance the need for private investment with fiscal responsibility and risk control. The program was designed to last until March 1, 1987, after which it was discontinued, indicating its role as a transitional or development-focused policy rather than a long-term financial instrument.
