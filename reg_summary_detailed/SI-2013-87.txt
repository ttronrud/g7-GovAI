**1. Legal Authority and Context**

- The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (commonly referred to as the "PSRTDA").
- This Act empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reorganize the federal public service, including the transfer of administrative control, responsibilities, and supervision of specific offices or departments.
- The transfer is not a reorganization of personnel or budget, but a shift in **administrative oversight and governance** of a specific office within the federal public administration.

---

**2. Key Action: Transfer of Control and Supervision**

- On **July 15, 2013**, the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada** (OIC) was formally transferred from the **Minister of Transport** to the **President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**.
- This means that the **day-to-day control, policy direction, and administrative supervision** of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada are now exercised by the President of the Privy Council, not by the Minister of Transport.
- The Office of Infrastructure of Canada is a distinct entity within the federal public service, responsible for overseeing federal infrastructure policy, planning, and coordination across various sectors (e.g., transportation, energy, water, and public works).

**3. Role of the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**

- The President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada is a senior constitutional and administrative officer of the federal government.
- This role is typically held by the **Prime Minister** (or, in some cases, another senior Cabinet minister), and serves as a central point of coordination for key federal departments and agencies.
- By assigning the Office of Infrastructure of Canada to the President of the Privy Council, the government signals a **strategic shift toward centralized oversight** of infrastructure policy.
- The President is now **responsible for presiding over the Office of Infrastructure of Canada**, which includes:
  - Setting strategic priorities for infrastructure investment and development.
  - Coordinating cross-ministerial infrastructure initiatives.
  - Ensuring alignment between infrastructure planning and broader federal policy goals (e.g., economic development, climate change, national security).

**4. Legal Basis and Statutory References**

- **Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (PSRTDA): This is the enabling legislation that allows for the reassignment of administrative responsibilities within the federal public service. Paragraph 2(a)(a) specifically authorizes the transfer of control and supervision of public administration offices.
- **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**: This refers to a section of the *Statutes of Canada, 2003*, Chapter 22 (the PSRTDA), which provides the legal foundation for the transfer of duties and offices. Section 207 likely contains provisions related to the establishment or reorganization of offices within the public service.
- **R.S., c. P-34**: This refers to the *Regulations of the Public Service*, Chapter P-34, which may contain procedural or administrative rules governing the operation of offices like the Office of Infrastructure of Canada. These regulations may define the structure, functions, and reporting lines of the office under the new leadership.

**5. Implications and Significance**

- **Enhanced Coordination**: The transfer enables better inter-ministerial coordination in infrastructure planning, as the office now operates under a high-level, cross-departmental leadership structure.
- **Policy Integration**: Infrastructure is a complex, multi-sectoral issue. Centralizing oversight under the President of the Privy Council allows for more cohesive national policy development.
- **Accountability and Oversight**: The President of the Privy Council, as a senior figure in the federal government, brings greater accountability and visibility to infrastructure policy.
- **Shift in Ministerial Responsibility**: While the Minister of Transport may still be involved in specific infrastructure projects, the **strategic direction and governance** of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada are no longer under their direct control.

---

**6. Effective Date**

- The regulation takes effect on **July 15, 2013**. This date marks the formal implementation of the transfer of control and supervision, and the beginning of the President of the Privy Council’s role as head of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada.

---

**Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the Canadian federal public service. By transferring the Office of Infrastructure of Canada from the Minister of Transport to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, the government established a more centralized, strategic, and coordinated approach to federal infrastructure policy. The move underscores the importance of infrastructure as a national priority and reflects a broader trend toward inter-ministerial coordination in complex public policy areas.
