## 🔍 **Comprehensive Summary of the Mail Receptacles Regulations, 1983**

### 📌 **Background and Purpose**
The regulation was introduced to standardize and improve the **delivery and collection of mail** in both urban and rural areas, particularly in commercial, apartment, and office buildings. It replaces the previous *Mail Receptacles Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1282*, which had been in effect prior to 1983.

This new set of regulations establishes **clear requirements for mail receiving and dispatching facilities**, ensures **safe and accessible mail handling**, and provides **procedural guidelines** for mail delivery, access, and service authorization. It reflects a shift toward **greater accountability, efficiency, and consistency** in postal operations across Canada.

The regulation was developed after a public consultation period, during which interested parties were invited to submit representations to the Minister. The final version was approved by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Honourable André Ouellet, pursuant to **Section 17 of the Canada Post Corporation Act**.
