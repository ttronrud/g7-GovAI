### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Taxation Statistical Analyses and Data Processing Services Fees Order* was issued on **February 25, 1992**, by the **Minister of National Revenue** under the authority of **Order in Council P.C. 1988-2270**, passed on **September 29, 1988**. This order serves to establish specific fees that must be paid by individuals or entities receiving certain statistical analysis and data processing services from the **Department of National Revenue (DNR)**.

The regulation is formally cited as **SI/88-188**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **September 29, 1988**, and is applicable to services provided by the DNR in the context of taxation administration and data management.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

- Define and standardize the fees charged for specific data processing and statistical analysis services delivered by the Department of National Revenue.

### **Key Concept: Resource Unit**

A **resource unit** is a composite metric developed internally by the Department of National Revenue to account for the cost of computing resources. It represents a standardized measure combining:

- **CPU-seconds** (central processing unit time),
- **Memory space** (RAM usage),
- **Input/output (I/O) services** (data transfer operations).

While the fee schedule is based on **hourly rates**, the underlying cost structure is derived from resource unit consumption. This allows the Department to:

- Accurately allocate costs based on actual system usage,
- Ensure that fees reflect the true cost of processing,
- Provide a transparent and scalable billing model for future services.

> *Note: The resource unit is not directly billed to users but serves as an internal accounting tool to justify and support the hourly fee structure.*

---

### **Application and Compliance**

- Any individual or entity (e.g., tax preparers, third-party service providers, or government agencies) receiving a service listed in the Schedule must **pay the corresponding fee**.
- Fees are **per hour** and are based on actual time spent providing the service.
- The fees are **not subject to tax** unless otherwise required by law.
- The Department may adjust fees in future amendments to reflect changes in technology, labor costs, or operational needs.

---

### **Legal and Practical Implications**

- **Transparency**: The fee structure is clearly defined and publicly available, promoting accountability.
- **Fairness**: Rates are tiered to reflect the complexity and resource intensity of the service.
- **Administrative Efficiency**: By standardizing fees, the Department can streamline billing and reduce disputes.
- **Cost Recovery**: The regulation enables the Department to recover operational costs associated with data processing and analysis, which are essential for tax administration.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Taxation Statistical Analyses and Data Processing Services Fees Order* establishes a clear, transparent, and cost-based framework for charging fees for data processing and administrative services provided by the Department of National Revenue. It ensures that users are fairly compensated for the time and resources expended in delivering tax-related data services, while also enabling the Department to maintain operational efficiency and financial sustainability.

This regulation remains a foundational policy instrument in the administration of Canada’s tax data infrastructure and reflects the evolving needs of tax data management in the 1990s.
