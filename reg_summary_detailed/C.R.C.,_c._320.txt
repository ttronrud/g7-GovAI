**Detailed Summary of the Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977 – Leasing Regulations**

---

### **1. Citation and Applicable Scope**
- The regulation is officially titled: *Appropriation Act No. 1, 1977 – Leasing Regulations*.
- It applies specifically to the **lease of certain public lands** and associated structures, governed by strict conditions to ensure public accountability, transparency, and long-term fiscal responsibility.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **"Lands"**:  
  Refers to specific lands, along with any buildings or structures located upon them, as described in **Instrument No. 592102**, registered in the **Registry Office of the Registry Division of the City of Ottawa, Ontario**, on **June 7, 1971**.  
  This land is referred to in legal terminology as an *immeuble* (a parcel of land and improvements, often treated as a single unit for ownership and use purposes).

- **"Minister"**:  
  Refers to the **Minister of Public Works** of the Government of Ontario. This minister is responsible for managing the leasing of the designated lands and acting as the principal authority in lease approvals.

---

### **3. Maximum Lease Term (Section 3)**  
- **No lease** (including renewals) of the lands may be granted for a term **exceeding 50 years** without the **prior approval of the Treasury Board**.  
  - This restriction limits long-term private control over public property and ensures that leases remain within a reasonable timeframe, promoting eventual public reacquisition or re-leasing.
  - The 50-year cap applies to both initial leases and any extensions or renewals.

---

### **4. Lease Structure: Crown Leasehold Acquisition (Section 4)**  
- All leases of the lands must be issued under an **agreement where Her Majesty (the Crown)** acquires a **leasehold interest** in the land.  
- The term of this Crown leasehold interest must **expire not more than one day prior to the expiry of the term of the private lease**.  
  - This ensures that the Crown retains ownership rights just before the private lease ends, allowing for a smooth transition and potential re-leasing or repurchase of the property.
  - It prevents indefinite private control and ensures the Crown maintains a legal and financial stake in the land.

---

### **5. Sublease Restrictions (Section 5)**  
- The Minister of Public Works may not issue a **sublease** of Her Majesty’s leasehold interest (acquired under Section 4) for a term exceeding **20 years**, unless such sublease is approved in advance by the **Treasury Board**.  
  - This limits the duration of secondary private use of the land and protects public interest.
  - Applies to both initial subleases and renewals.

- **Sublease for Banking Purposes**:  
  - No lease or sublease intended for **banking or financial operations** may be issued without **prior written approval from the Minister of Finance**.  
  - This reflects a policy of financial oversight and risk management, ensuring that sensitive financial activities on public land are subject to additional scrutiny.

---

### **6. Rent Determination for Subleases (Section 5 – Rent Calculation)**  
- When determining the **rent payable under a sublease**, the Minister must consider:
  - All **costs incurred by Her Majesty** in acquiring and constructing the public property affected by the sublease.
  - The **anticipated future administrative costs** of managing the land.
- However, **the rent must not be less than the current market rental value** of the land.  
  - This ensures fair compensation to the Crown, preventing under-rental that could lead to financial loss or underutilization of public assets.

---

### **7. Public Advertisement Requirement (Section 5 – Transparency)**  
- A sublease must be **publicly advertised** before being issued, unless the Minister determines, in good faith, that such advertisement is **not practicable**.  
  - This promotes **transparency and public accountability** in the leasing process.
  - Public notice allows potential bidders or lessees to compete fairly, enhancing the integrity of the leasing process.
  - Exceptions are permitted only when practical constraints (e.g., urgency, technical limitations) make public advertising unreasonable or impossible.

### **Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public Accountability** | Leases are subject to Treasury Board and Ministerial approvals, ensuring oversight by senior government bodies. |
| **Prevention of Long-Term Private Control** | The 50-year lease cap and 20-year sublease limit prevent monopolization of public land. |
| **Crown Interests Protected** | The Crown acquires leasehold interest just before private lease ends, preserving ownership and control. |
| **Fair Compensation** | Rent must reflect market value, ensuring the Crown is fairly compensated for its property. |
| **Transparency & Fair Competition** | Public advertisement ensures open, competitive leasing processes. |
| **Financial Oversight** | Banking-related leases require Finance Minister approval, protecting public financial institutions and systemic stability. |

---

### **Conclusion**
These Leasing Regulations establish a comprehensive, transparent, and accountable framework for the leasing of specific public lands in Ottawa, Ontario. They balance the need for private use of public assets with the imperative to preserve public ownership, ensure fair compensation, and maintain fiscal and administrative integrity. The regulations are designed to prevent long-term private control, ensure market-based pricing, and promote public interest through mandatory approvals and public disclosure.

This framework remains a foundational piece of land management policy in Ontario, particularly for government-owned real estate used for commercial, financial, or institutional purposes.
