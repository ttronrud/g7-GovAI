## 🔍 **Detailed Summary of the Marine Spark-Ignition Engine, Vessel and Off-Road Recreational Vehicle Emission Regulations**

### 📌 **Legal Basis and Context**
- The regulation was **adopted by the Governor in Council** on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to:
  - **Section 160**: Authority to make regulations under CEPA.
  - **Section 162**: Power to establish emission standards and credit systems.
  - **Section 319**: Authority to regulate emissions from engines, vessels, and off-road vehicles.
- It was issued following a **public consultation process** under **subsection 332(1)a of CEPA 1999**, where the Minister published a **proposed regulation** in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on December 30, 2006, allowing stakeholders to submit comments or file objections to the proposed rules.

This regulation establishes **national emission standards** for marine spark-ignition engines, vessels, and off-road recreational vehicles, aligning Canada’s standards with those of the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**.

| **Crankcase emissions** | Pollutants from engine lubrication or ventilation systems. |
| **Evaporative emissions** | Hydrocarbons released from fuel tanks or lines (not exhaust or crankcase). |
| **Permeation emissions** | Evaporation through fuel line or tank materials. |
| **Diurnal emissions** | Evaporation due to daily temperature changes while engine is off. |
| **Emission control system** | Any device or software (hardware, software, calibration, logic) that reduces emissions. |
| **Element of design** | Any part of the engine, vessel, or vehicle design that affects emissions (e.g., software, calibration). |
| **Emission family** | Grouping of engines/vehicles/fuel systems based on EPA certificate or CFR 230 classification. |
| **Family emission limit** | Maximum emission level set by a company for fleet averaging. |
| **Fuel line** | Hose/tubing exposed to liquid fuel; excludes primers used only for starting or portable tanks. |
| **Fuel tank** | Non-portable fuel tank. |
| **High-performance inboard engine** | Engine rated >373 kW with power-enhancing features and expected operating time <480 hours. |
| **Conventional inboard engine** | Inboard engine rated at ≤373 kW. |
| **Model year** | Year used by manufacturers to designate a product; determined based on production period. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: References to the EPA or its discretion are **excluded** from the incorporated standards. The regulation **only recognizes EPA standards**, not alternative standards (e.g., averaging, banking, financial hardship, or foreign conformity).

## 🎯 **Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives are:

1. **Reduce air pollution** from:
   - Hydrocarbons (HC)
   - Oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
   - Carbon monoxide (CO)

2. **Limit emissions of toxic substances** including:
   - Formaldehyde
   - 1,3-Butadiene
   - Acetaldehyde
   - Acrolein
   - Benzene

3. **Establish emission standards and testing procedures** that are **aligned with U.S. EPA standards** (specifically CFR parts 1045, 1051, and 1060).
