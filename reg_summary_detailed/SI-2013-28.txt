**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2) of the *Species at Risk Act* (S.C. 2002, c. 29)**. These subsections empower the Governor General to refer species assessments back to the **Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)** for further evaluation when new information or concerns arise that affect the species’ status or the scientific basis of its current designation.

The regulation includes two key actions:
1. **Referral of species assessments back to COSEWIC** for additional review.
2. **Approval of a public registry statement** under **section 120** of the *Species at Risk Act*, which explains the reasons for the referrals and is made available to the public.

### 1. **Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) – North Pacific Population**

#### Current Status and Historical Assessment:
- The **North Pacific population** of the Humpback Whale is currently listed as **Threatened** under the *Species at Risk Act*.
- In **May 2011**, COSEWIC reassessed the population and downgraded its status to **Special Concern**. This change was based on recent data indicating a **positive trend in abundance**, suggesting a recovery or stabilization of the population.

#### Reasons for Referral Back to COSEWIC:
Despite the positive trend in abundance, concerns were raised during consultations conducted between **November 2011 and January 2012** by several species experts regarding the **structure of the designatable unit (DU)** in Canada.

- A **designatable unit** is a scientifically defined population of a species that is considered distinct enough to be managed separately under Canadian wildlife protection laws.
- Experts expressed concern that COSEWIC’s 2011 assessment **did not fully consider key data** related to the population structure in Canadian waters.
- Specifically, there is a scientific argument that the North Pacific Humpback Whale population may consist of **two distinct designatable units within Canada**, which would require different management approaches and conservation strategies.
- The **Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)** has not yet issued scientific advice on this issue.

#### Action Taken:
- The assessment of the Humpback Whale (North Pacific population) is **referred back to COSEWIC** for further scientific review and evaluation of the population structure.
- COSEWIC will be asked to reassess whether two designatable units exist in Canada, based on the available data and expert input.
- DFO has committed to **collaborating with COSEWIC** to support this process, including providing relevant data and facilitating scientific dialogue.

#### Purpose of Referral:
To ensure that the species’ status and management framework are based on the most up-to-date and scientifically sound understanding of population structure, which is essential for effective conservation planning.

### 2. **Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) – Nass River and Skeena River Population**

#### Current Status and Historical Assessment:
- The Eulachon (a short-lived, fat-rich fish) population in the **Nass River and Skeena River** was previously assessed by COSEWIC as **Threatened** in May 2011.

#### Key Biological and Ecological Characteristics:
- Eulachon reproduces only **once in its lifetime**.
- It spends **over 95% of its life in marine environments**, making it highly dependent on marine conditions and riverine access for spawning.
- Its population dynamics are sensitive to changes in water temperature, flow, and habitat quality.

#### Reasons for Referral Back to COSEWIC:
- **Recent data** collected from the Nass River and Skeena River indicate a **decline in Eulachon abundance**.
- There has also been a **substantial decline in abundance in adjacent marine areas**, suggesting a broader ecological trend.
- COSEWIC has determined that **new information** is now available that was not accessible during the 2011 assessment.
- This new information raises concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the original assessment.

#### Action Taken:
- The status of the Eulachon (Nass River and Skeena River population) is **referred back to COSEWIC** for a **reassessment**.
- COSEWIC will now evaluate the population trends, habitat conditions, and the implications of the new data to determine whether the species should be reclassified or if further conservation measures are needed.

#### Purpose of Referral:
To ensure that the conservation status of this vulnerable species reflects the most current scientific evidence. Given its life history and sensitivity to environmental change, timely and accurate status assessments are critical for effective protection and recovery planning.

### 3. **Public Registry Statement**

- The Minister of the Environment is authorized to include in the **public registry** (established under **section 120** of the *Species at Risk Act*) a **statement attached as an annex** to this regulation.
- This statement:
  - Clearly outlines the **reasons for referring both species back to COSEWIC**.
  - Provides transparency to the public and stakeholders about the scientific basis for the referrals.
  - Supports public access to information on species at risk and the decision-making process.

### Key Takeaways and Implications

| Aspect | Summary |
|-------|--------|
| **Objective** | To ensure that species assessments under the *Species at Risk Act* are based on the most current and comprehensive scientific data. |
| **Process** | The referral mechanism allows for scientific review and updating of status when new data or concerns emerge. |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Expert input and inter-agency collaboration (especially between DFO and COSEWIC) are emphasized. |
| **Conservation Relevance** | Accurate status determination is essential for developing appropriate recovery strategies, habitat protection, and policy decisions. |
| **Transparency** | Public access to the reasons for referrals strengthens accountability and public trust in species at risk management. |

### Conclusion

This regulation reflects a commitment to **scientific rigor and adaptive management** in Canada’s species at risk framework. By referring two key species—the Humpback Whale (North Pacific) and the Eulachon (Nass and Skeena populations)—back to COSEWIC, the government acknowledges that new information and scientific questions require further evaluation. The process ensures that conservation decisions are grounded in the best available science and that population structure and ecological trends are properly understood. This action underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring, expert review, and stakeholder collaboration in protecting Canada’s biodiversity.
