## 📖 **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|

## 📋 **3. Designation of Provisions**

- Each item in the schedule lists:
  - **Column 1**: A specific provision from the *Aeronautics Act* (e.g., a clause about aircraft operations, air traffic control, or safety standards).
  - **Column 2 or 3**: The **maximum penalty amount** applicable to a contravention of that provision.

> ✅ A provision listed in **Column 1** is "designated" — meaning that any violation of it may be dealt with under the penalty procedure outlined in **sections 7.7 to 8.2 of the Aeronautics Act**.

> ⚠️ Note: The original schedule (not shown here) would contain the actual list of provisions and corresponding penalties.

## 💰 **4. Maximum Penalties (Financial Sanctions)**

The regulation sets out **maximum amounts payable** depending on whether the contravention involves an **individual** or a **corporation**:

| Violation Type | Individual Maximum Penalty | Corporation Maximum Penalty |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| As specified in the schedule | $X | $Y |

> 🔍 These amounts are **prescribed** and serve as the upper limit for penalties that can be assessed for a given contravention.

> 📌 The table includes multiple entries (implied by the repeated headers), indicating that different provisions in the schedule may carry different penalty levels. The exact values are not included in the text provided but would be found in the attached schedule.

## 📢 **5. Notice Requirements (Under Section 7.7(1) of the Aeronautics Act)**

When the Minister issues a **notice of alleged contravention**, it must contain the following **mandatory elements**:

1. **Particulars of the Alleged Contravention**  
   → Clearly states what rule or provision was allegedly violated.

2. **Option for the Person to Choose Between:**
   - Pay the specified penalty amount, OR  
   - File a request for review with the Tribunal (a formal administrative body).

3. **Acceptance of Payment as Full Satisfaction**  
   → If the person pays the amount specified in the notice, the Minister will accept it as full and final satisfaction of the penalty.  
   → No further administrative proceedings under Part I of the Act will be pursued against that person for that specific contravention.

4. **Right to a Fair Hearing Before the Tribunal**  
   → The person has the right to present evidence and make representations before the Tribunal if they choose to file a review request.  
   → This ensures procedural fairness and natural justice.

5. **Deemed Contravention upon Non-Compliance**  
   → If the person **fails to pay** the amount and **fails to file a review request within the prescribed period**, they are **deemed to have committed** the contravention.  
   → This creates a legal presumption of guilt unless challenged.

> ⚠️ The notice must be issued in a manner that respects **procedural fairness**, including providing clear information and a reasonable time frame for response.

> 🔁 This process allows for both **immediate enforcement** (via payment) and **legal recourse** (via tribunal review), balancing efficiency with due process.

## 🚨 **6. Important Notes and Clarifications**

- **Application Before Publication:**  
  For the purposes of **paragraph 11(2)(a) of the Statutory Instruments Act**, these regulations **apply immediately upon enactment** — even before being published in the *Canada Gazette*.  
  → This ensures that the designated provisions and penalties are enforceable from the moment they are made, not only after public notice.

- **Repealed Sections:**  
  - The original version of this regulation included a section that was **repealed by SOR/2011-318, section 801**.  
  - This suggests that outdated or inconsistent provisions were removed, and the current version reflects updated policy or legal standards.

- **No Further Proceedings After Payment:**  
  Once a person pays the penalty, the Minister will **close the case** under Part I of the Act. This prevents repeated penalties for the same violation.

---

## 🏁 **7. Overall Function and Impact**

This regulation serves as a **key enforcement tool** in the administration of the *Aeronautics Act*. It:

- Identifies specific aviation rules that are punishable by financial penalties.
- Sets clear, enforceable limits on penalties for individuals and corporations.
- Establishes a transparent and fair process for addressing violations:
  - Option to pay or appeal.
  - Right to a hearing.
  - Automatic assumption of guilt if no action is taken within the deadline.

This mechanism supports **effective compliance** while protecting individuals and businesses from arbitrary or excessive penalties through due process.
