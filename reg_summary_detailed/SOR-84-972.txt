**Detailed Summary of the Earlton Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The *Earlton Airport Zoning Regulations* were approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport**, under **Section 6* of the Aeronautics Act**. This regulatory instrument establishes specific zoning and environmental constraints around Earlton Airport to ensure safe aircraft operations, particularly regarding visibility, terrain, and obstructions.

- **Regulation Citation**: *Earlton Airport Zoning Regulations*, S.C. 1976-77, c. 28, s. 2 and 49.
- **Purpose**: To regulate land use and development near Earlton Airport to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation defines several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Earlton Airport, located in the Township of Armstrong, District of Timiskaming, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point at a known elevation (235.0 m above sea level), used as a baseline for all measurements. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. Designed to ensure unobstructed visibility during aircraft approach. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at a constant elevation (45 m above ARP), with a minimum of 9 m above ground level to prevent ground-level obstructions. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area (runway and adjacent zones) for specific runway directions (e.g., 07-25, 16-34). |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of a strip and its approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

---

### **3. Elevation Reference Point**
- The **assigned elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is **235.0 meters above sea level**.
- All other surfaces (approach, outer, transitional) are measured relative to this point.

---

### **4. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Earlton Airport**, including public road allowances, as precisely described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

This includes:
- Land within the boundary defined by the zoning plan.
- Areas where development or natural growth could interfere with aircraft operations.

---

### **5. Prohibited Development (Height Restrictions)**
**No person may erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object** on regulated land **if the highest point of that object exceeds**:

1. **The approach surface** of any strip;
2. **The outer surface**;
3. **The transitional surface**.

> ⚠️ *Exception*: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) that exceeds these surfaces may be removed at the discretion of the **Minister of Transport**.

---

### **6. Waste Disposal Restrictions**
- **No owner or occupier** of regulated land may allow the land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.
- This restriction is intended to reduce bird strikes, which pose a significant risk to aircraft safety.

---

### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

#### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located **75 meters northwesterly at right angles** to the centerline of runway 07–25.
- Measured from a point **915 meters northeasterly along the centerline** from the **southwesterly end of runway 07–25**.
- Coordinates: Not explicitly provided, but referenced in the zoning plan (Sheet 5, June 26, 1984).

---

#### **B. Approach Surfaces**
Four approach surfaces are defined—one for each runway end:

| Runway | Approach Surface Description |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **07 (Runway 07-25)** | - Inclined plane with **1:60 slope** (1 m vertical per 60 m horizontal).<br>- Rises to a horizontal line **15,000 m horizontally** from the end of the strip.<br>- Outer ends of this line are **2,400 m from the runway centerline**.<br>- The horizontal line is **250 m above the elevation at the end of the strip**. |
| **25 (Runway 07-25)** | - Same as 07: **1:60 slope**, 15,000 m horizontal distance, 2,400 m lateral offset, 250 m above strip end elevation. |
| **16 (Runway 16-34)** | - **1:40 slope** (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal).<br>- Rises to a horizontal line **2,500 m horizontally** from the end.<br>- Outer ends are **295 m from the centerline**.<br>- Horizontal line is **62.5 m above the strip end elevation**. |
| **34 (Runway 16-34)** | - Identical to 16: **1:40 slope**, 2,500 m horizontal, 295 m lateral offset, 62.5 m above strip end elevation. |

> These surfaces ensure that aircraft approaching the runway have a clear visual path, free from tall structures or trees.

---

#### **C. Outer Surface**
- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 235.0 + 45 = 280.0 m AGL).
- **Exception**: If the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This surface defines the upper boundary for all development and natural growth beyond the approach and transitional zones.

---

#### **D. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising from the **lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces**.
- Slope: **1:7** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extends upward and outward until it intersects:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface of an adjacent runway**.
- These surfaces prevent obstructions near the sides of runways and ensure consistent visibility during approach and departure.

#### **E. Boundary of Regulated Land**
The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed **coordinate-based boundary** (as per Earlton Airport Zoning Plan No. 54-090-83-158, Sheets 1–13, June 26, 1984). The boundary follows a precise path through multiple lots and concessions across several townships:

**Key Features of the Boundary Path:**
1. Begins at the **northwest corner of Lot 5, Concession 4, Township of Armstrong**.
2. Proceeds **easterly** to the northeast corner of the same lot.
3. Turns **southerly** along the boundary between Lots 4 and 5, Concession 4.
4. Follows the **northwesterly limit of approach surface (25)** on an azimuth of **53°57′39″** to its intersection with the northeast corner of that surface (coordinates: N 5,292,610.40; E 599,549.26).
5. Proceeds **southeasterly** along the eastern limit of approach surface (25) to its southwesterly corner (coordinates: N 5,288,354.99; E 601,765.28).
6. Continues along the southeasterly edge to the line between Lots 3 and 4 in Concession 3.
7. Travels **southerly** through Concessions 3, 2, and 1 to the southeast corner of the **north half of Lot 4, Concession 1**.
8. Moves **westward** to the southwest corner of that lot.
9. Proceeds **southerly** to the southeast corner of Lot 5, Concession 1.
10. Travels **westward** along the southern boundary of Lots 5 and 6, Concession 1 (also the boundary between Armstrong and Kerns Townships).
11. Continues **southerly** through Lots 6–7, Concession 6, Kerns.
12. Proceeds **westward** along the southern limits of Lots 7–11, Concession 6.
13. Turns **northerly** along the line between Lots 11 and 12, Concession 6.
14. Travels **westward** to the southwest corner of Lot 12, Concession 6 (also the southeast corner of Lot 1, Concession 1, Beauchamp).
15. Proceeds **northerly** along the east boundary of Lot 1, Concession 1, Beauchamp.
16. Turns **westward** along the north limit of the south half of Lot 1 to meet the **southeasterly limit of approach surface (07)**.
17. Follows the southeasterly limit of approach
