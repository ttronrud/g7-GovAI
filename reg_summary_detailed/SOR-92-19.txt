The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2013-61, s. 7]"

This indicates that the regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 7 of the Statutory Rules of 2013 (SOR/2013-61)**.

---

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on the date specified in the statutory order, SOR/2013-61, under section 7 of that order.

**Repeal Instrument:**  
- **SOR/2013-61**: This is a Statutory Order issued in 2013 by the Government of Canada (or a provincial jurisdiction, depending on context).  
- **Section 7**: This section specifically includes the repeal of certain provisions or regulations.  
- The repeated references to "s. 7" confirm that the regulation was targeted by this section as being obsolete or no longer applicable.

**Implications of Repeal:**  
- The regulation no longer applies to any legal or administrative context.  
- Any prior actions, interpretations, or enforcement based on this regulation are now invalid or superseded.  
- Legal or regulatory bodies must refer to current, active legislation or regulations that have replaced its function (if any), or may have been absorbed into another statute.

**Reason for Repeal (Inferred):**  
While the exact reason for repeal is not detailed in the provided text, common reasons include:
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant to current policy.
- It was redundant due to the enactment of a more comprehensive or modern law.
- It created inconsistencies or conflicts with newer regulations.
- It was replaced by a more effective or precise legal framework.

**Jurisdictional Note:**  
The specific jurisdiction (federal, provincial, or territorial) depends on the context of SOR/2013-61. For example:
- If SOR/2013-61 is a **provincial** regulation, it would pertain to a provincial government (e.g., Ontario, British Columbia).
- If it is **federal**, it would relate to a federal department or agency.

Without additional context (e.g., the full title of the regulation or the governing statute), the precise subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.) cannot be identified.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially repealed** by **Schedule 7 of the Statutory Rules of 2013 (SOR/2013-61, s. 7)**. As such, it is **no longer valid or enforceable**. Any legal or administrative reliance on it is now incorrect. For current compliance or interpretation, authorities must consult active, un-repealed regulations or updated statutes that may have replaced its function.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The repeated entries are likely a formatting or data-entry error, as the same repeal notice is listed multiple times. This does not indicate multiple regulations being repealed, but rather a single repeal notice repeated for emphasis or technical reasons.

If you can provide the **original regulation title** or the **governing statute**, a more detailed and context-specific summary can be developed.
