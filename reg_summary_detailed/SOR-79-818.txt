**Detailed Summary of the British Columbia Tree Fruit Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *British Columbia Tree Fruit Order* (C.R.C., c. 145) is a regulatory instrument issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture**, under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**. This Order serves to **revoke the previous British Columbia Tree Fruit Order** and **replace it with a new, updated regulatory framework** that grants authority to the **British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** to regulate the marketing of tree fruit in British Columbia.

This new Order establishes a modernized, transparent, and equitable system for managing the interprovincial and export marketing of tree fruit, ensuring fair market practices, financial stability for producers, and efficient distribution of revenues.

### **Key Provisions and Components**

#### **1. Citation and Applicability**
- The Order is officially titled: **"The British Columbia Tree Fruit Order"**.
- It applies to **tree fruit grown and produced within the Province of British Columbia**.
- The Order is effective in all areas of the province where tree fruit is produced or marketed.

#### **2. Definitions**
The Order defines key terms used throughout:
- **Act**: Refers to the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the Commodity Board’s authority.
- **Commodity Board**: The **British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Board**, established under the Act. It is responsible for overseeing the marketing and financial management of tree fruit.
- **Plan**: The *British Columbia Tree Fruit Marketing Scheme*, which is established and amended over time under the Act and associated regulations. This Plan sets out the rules, pricing mechanisms, and operational procedures for the marketing of tree fruit.
- **Tree fruit**: Includes all tree fruits grown in BC, such as apples, pears, cherries, plums, peaches, and other similar fruits (e.g., apricots, prunes), as long as they are produced within the province.

---

#### **3. Authority of the Commodity Board**

The Commodity Board is granted broad powers to regulate the **marketing of tree fruit in interprovincial and export trade** — meaning the sale of tree fruit outside of British Columbia or to international markets.

These powers extend to **all or any powers** that the Board previously had under the original Act and the Marketing Scheme for **local marketing within BC**, allowing consistency in policy and operations.

---

#### **4. Levies and Charges on Producers**

A central feature of the Order is the Commodity Board’s authority to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on producers and marketers of tree fruit who operate within British Columbia.
- **Classify persons** into different groups (e.g., by type of farm, size of operation, or fruit type) to ensure equitable and targeted financial obligations.
- **Set different levies or charges** for different groups, based on factors such as production volume, market share, or risk exposure.

> *Example*: A small orchard may be charged a lower levy than a large commercial producer, reflecting differences in scale and market influence.

These levies are **collectible** from individuals or entities engaged in tree fruit production or marketing.

---

#### **5. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges are to be used for specific, legitimate purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (financial buffers to manage market volatility or downturns).
- **Payment of operational expenses** related to marketing, logistics, and administrative functions.
- **Reimbursement of losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of tree fruit (e.g., price drops, spoilage, or market disruptions).
- **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among producers.

> This mechanism ensures that producers who benefit from stable market conditions (e.g., through fair pricing or government support) can contribute fairly to a shared fund, which helps **distribute financial risk** and **support equity** across the industry.

The Commodity Board may determine **when and for how long** such equalization or adjustment will be applied — for example, during periods of market downturns or price fluctuations.

---

### **Purpose and Objectives of the Order**

1. **Stability in Market Conditions**: By creating reserves and managing price volatility, the Order aims to protect producers from sudden market crashes or poor harvests.
2. **Equitable Distribution of Financial Risk**: The equalization mechanism ensures that producers, regardless of size or location, are not disproportionately affected by market fluctuations.
3. **Efficient Marketing and Export Support**: The Board can manage interprovincial and export sales more effectively, ensuring fair pricing and market access.
4. **Sustainable Industry Growth**: By supporting marketing infrastructure and reducing financial risk, the Order fosters long-term investment in tree fruit production in BC.
5. **Modernization of Regulatory Framework**: Replacing the old Order with a new, flexible structure allows for better adaptation to changing market dynamics, trade policies, and producer needs.

---

### **Legal Basis and Governance**

- The Order operates under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which authorizes the Governor General to revoke and replace existing orders when necessary.
- The **Commodity Board** is established under the *Natural Products Marketing (British Columbia) Act*, which provides the legal authority for its functions.
- The **Marketing Scheme (Plan)** is the operational blueprint that guides how the Board implements its responsibilities, including pricing, classification, and financial management.

### **Key Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Implications |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Producers** | May face new levies or charges based on group classification. However, they benefit from financial protection during downturns and equalization of income. |
| **Marketers and Exporters** | Gain access to a more stable and coordinated marketing system, improving predictability in pricing and market access. |
| **Government** | Maintains oversight of agricultural markets, ensuring fair competition and economic stability. |
| **Consumers** | Benefit indirectly through more stable supply chains and potentially better quality fruit due to improved production and marketing practices. |

### **Conclusion**

The *British Columbia Tree Fruit Order* represents a significant evolution in the regulation of tree fruit marketing in the province. It replaces outdated provisions with a more **flexible, equitable, and market-responsive framework**. By empowering the Commodity Board to impose targeted levies, manage financial reserves, and ensure fair revenue distribution, the Order strengthens the resilience and sustainability of BC’s tree fruit industry in both domestic and international markets.

This regulation reflects a balance between **producer support**, **market efficiency**, and **regulatory accountability**, aligning with broader goals of agricultural stability and economic development in British Columbia.
