**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Authorization to Prescribe Charges for Use of Canadian Coast Guard Pollution Countermeasures Equipment

**Issuing Authority:**  
His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board.

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board) to authorize the Minister of Transport to establish charges for the use of certain government assets—specifically, pollution countermeasures equipment operated by the Canadian Coast Guard.

**Scope of Authority:**  
The Minister of Transport is authorized to issue a **regulatory order** (a formal government directive) that prescribes **charges for the use of Canadian Coast Guard pollution countermeasures equipment**.

**Key Conditions for Charges:**  
The charges must meet the following criteria:

1. **Cost Recovery Principle:**  
   The charges must be designed to **recover the actual costs** associated with the use of the equipment. This includes:
   - The **purchase cost** of the equipment;
   - The **ongoing maintenance costs** (e.g., repairs, servicing, consumables);
   - Other direct and indirect costs incurred in operating and managing the equipment.

2. **Replacement Value Basis:**  
   The charges must be **related to the replacement value** of the equipment. This means that the pricing model should reflect the cost of replacing the equipment if it were to be lost or damaged, ensuring that the financial recovery is based on a realistic and sustainable valuation.

**Purpose of the Regulation:**  
The primary objective is to ensure **financial sustainability** of the Canadian Coast Guard’s pollution countermeasures program. By charging users (such as shipping companies, operators, or other entities that may use the equipment during oil spills or environmental emergencies), the government ensures that the costs of maintaining and operating this critical environmental protection infrastructure are covered. This promotes accountability and prevents undue fiscal burden on the federal government.

**Implications:**  
- The regulation enables the Minister of Transport to create a transparent, cost-based pricing structure for equipment used in pollution response.
- It supports the operational readiness and long-term viability of pollution countermeasures by ensuring adequate funding.
- It aligns with financial accountability standards under the Financial Administration Act, which requires that government charges be justified, transparent, and based on legitimate cost recovery.

**Limitations or Exclusions:**  
- The regulation does not establish a specific rate or method for calculating the charges; that is left to the Minister of Transport, who must ensure compliance with the cost-recovery and replacement value principles.
- The charges are not intended to generate profit but to cover the actual costs of providing and maintaining the equipment.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation provides a clear legal and financial framework for the Canadian Coast Guard to charge users for the use of its pollution countermeasures equipment. It ensures that such charges are fair, transparent, and grounded in real cost data, thereby supporting environmental protection efforts while maintaining fiscal responsibility.
