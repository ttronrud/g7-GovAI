**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation establishes a formal mechanism for the Department of National Revenue (Taxation) to charge fees for statistical analyses and data processing services provided to the public. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of its key elements:

---

### **1. Background and Rationale**
- The Governor in Council (the federal government’s executive authority) has determined that the **cost of providing statistical analyses and data processing services**—offered by the Department of National Revenue (Taxation)—should **not be borne by the government**, but rather by the **individuals or entities that use these services**.
- This decision is rooted in the principle of **cost recovery**, ensuring that users of public services contribute directly to the cost of those services, promoting fiscal responsibility and sustainability.

---

### **2. Legal Authority**
- The regulation is issued under **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**.
- This provision grants the **Minister of National Revenue** (with the approval of the Treasury Board) the authority to **prescribe fees** for services provided by federal departments, including those related to data processing and statistical analysis.
- The use of this specific paragraph reflects the government’s intent to maintain transparency, accountability, and financial oversight in public service pricing.

### **3. Key Provisions**

  - Issue a **regulatory order** (formal directive) that specifies:
    - The **exact fees** to be charged for specific statistical analyses and data processing services.
    - The **types of services** covered (e.g., data compilation, trend analysis, reporting, processing of tax-related datasets).
    - The **conditions under which fees apply** (e.g., access level, volume of data, complexity of analysis).
    - The **method of billing and payment**.
- The order will be **binding on all persons** who request or receive such services from the Department of National Revenue (Taxation).

### **4. Purpose and Objectives**
