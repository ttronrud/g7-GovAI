**Detailed Summary of the Quebec Beef Cattle Order**

---

**1. Introduction and Authority**

The *Quebec Beef Cattle Order* is a regulatory instrument issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Agriculture. This action is authorized under **Section 2 of the Agricultural Products Marketing Act**, which empowers the federal government to delegate marketing authority to provincial organizations for specific agricultural commodities.

This Order grants the **Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec (Fédération)** — the Quebec Beef Producers Federation — the legal authority to regulate the **marketing of beef cattle** produced in the Province of Quebec, specifically in **interprovincial trade and export trade**.

The Order may be cited as the *Quebec Beef Cattle Order*.

**2. Key Definitions**

- **Beef cattle**: Refers to any beef cattle (cattle raised for beef production) that are produced within the Province of Quebec. This includes all cattle raised in the province for the purpose of producing beef, regardless of age, gender, or breed, as long as they are raised in Quebec.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec*. This body is formally recognized as the regulatory authority for beef cattle marketing in this context.

---

**3. Regulatory Powers Granted**

The Commodity Board (Fédération) is authorized to regulate the marketing of beef cattle in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial trade**: Sales of beef cattle from Quebec to other provinces in Canada.
- **Export trade**: Sales of beef cattle from Quebec to foreign countries.

For these purposes, the Commodity Board may exercise **all or any powers** that are currently available to it under the *Marketing of Agricultural, Food and Fish Products Act of Quebec* (the Quebec Marketing Act), **but specifically in relation to the local marketing of beef cattle within Quebec**. This means that the powers it exercises in interprovincial and export markets are modeled on those used in local marketing, allowing for consistency in rules, standards, and procedures.

This provision ensures that the Fédération can apply well-established regulatory frameworks (such as pricing, quality standards, documentation, and market access rules) to both domestic and international sales, enhancing market stability and fairness.

**4. Levies and Charges**

Under **Section 3 of the Order**, the Commodity Board has the authority to:

- **Fix and impose levies or charges** on persons involved in the **production or marketing** of beef cattle.
- These levies or charges may be applied **differently depending on the group** of producers or marketers, based on classification.
- The Board may **classify persons** (e.g., small-scale farmers, large ranchers, processors, exporters) into distinct groups and set **different rates** of levies or charges for each group.

This classification system allows for equitable and proportionate financial contributions based on the scale or type of involvement in the beef cattle sector.

**5. Use of Levies and Charges**

The funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves**: To build financial buffers for times of market downturns or price volatility.
- **Payment of expenses**: Including administrative costs, marketing costs, and operational expenses related to the regulation and promotion of beef cattle.
- **Compensation for losses**: To cover financial losses incurred due to the sale or disposal of beef cattle (e.g., due to market crashes, disease outbreaks, or poor demand).
- **Equalization and adjustment of revenues**: To ensure that producers who may have experienced poor market returns (e.g., low prices) are fairly compensated. The Board may redistribute revenues from sales during specific periods to balance income across producers, promoting equity in the sector.

This financial mechanism helps stabilize the beef cattle industry by protecting producers from market shocks and ensuring fair distribution of market gains.

**6. Scope and Application**

- The powers granted apply **only to persons and property situated within the Province of Quebec**.
- The regulation is **specific to beef cattle produced in Quebec**, and does not extend to other livestock or agricultural products.
- The Order applies to **all stages of marketing**, from production through to export, ensuring that the entire supply chain is governed by consistent and transparent rules.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**

- **Market Stability**: By establishing a regulatory body with financial and operational powers, the Order enhances market stability in Quebec’s beef cattle sector.
- **Producer Protection**: The ability to collect levies and use them for loss compensation and equalization safeguards small and medium-sized producers who may be more vulnerable to market fluctuations.
- **International Trade Facilitation**: The regulatory framework enables Quebec beef producers to meet international standards and participate in export markets with confidence.
- **Provincial Autonomy**: The Order reflects Quebec’s ability to self-regulate key agricultural commodities, consistent with provincial jurisdiction over agricultural marketing under Quebec law.

**Conclusion**

The *Quebec Beef Cattle Order* is a comprehensive regulatory tool that empowers the *Fédération des producteurs de bovins du Québec* to manage the interprovincial and export marketing of beef cattle produced in Quebec. It provides the Fédération with the authority to regulate market practices, impose equitable levies based on producer classification, and use collected funds to stabilize the industry, compensate for losses, and promote fairness among producers. This Order strengthens the resilience and competitiveness of Quebec’s beef cattle sector in both domestic and international markets.
