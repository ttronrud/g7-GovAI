**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

**Regulation Title:**  
*Certain Fees in Respect of the Issuance of Temporary Resident Visas for Certain Extended Family (Crisis in Gaza) Remission Order*

**Legal Authority:**  
This regulation is issued under subsection 23(2.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)), and is based on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. It operates under the authority granted to the Governor in Council to act in the public interest, particularly in response to humanitarian or emergency situations.

### **Purpose of the Regulation**

The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., waive or forgive) the fees** associated with the application for a temporary resident visa for certain individuals who are members of extended families affected by the crisis in Gaza. This remission is intended to support the humanitarian response by easing financial barriers for individuals seeking to temporarily relocate to Canada due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

### **Who Qualifies for Fee Remission?**

Fee remission applies to **any person who:**

1. Applies for a temporary resident visa under one of the following two temporary public policies:
   - *The Temporary Public Policy to Facilitate Temporary Resident Visas for Certain Extended Family Affected by the Crisis in Gaza*  
   - *The Updated Temporary Public Policy to Facilitate Temporary Resident Visas for Certain Extended Family Affected by the Crisis in Gaza*

2. **Submitted their application during the specified period:**  
   The period begins on **January 9, 2024**, and ends on **April 22, 2025**.

> This means that only applications filed within this timeframe — specifically, those that fall under either of the two referenced public policies — are eligible for fee remission.

---

### **What Fees Are Being Remitted?**

The fees being waived are those payable under:

- **Subsection 296(1)** of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR), or  
- **Subsection 315.1(1)** of the IRPR  

These fees typically include application processing fees and other associated charges for temporary resident visa applications.

> Importantly, the remission applies **only to the fees paid or payable** in connection with the specific visa application under the Gaza-related public policy.

---

### **Timing of Fee Remission**

The remission of fees occurs on two distinct dates, depending on when the fee was paid:

1. **Fees paid BEFORE the Order comes into force:**  
   These fees will be remitted **on the day the Order comes into force**.

2. **Fees paid DURING the period from the Order’s coming into force to April 22, 2025:**  
   These fees will be remitted **on April 23, 2025**.

> This ensures that all eligible applicants receive the benefit of fee remission in a timely and consistent manner, with a clear deadline for final processing.

### **Effective Date of the Order**

The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the government). This date is not specified in the text but will be determined by the government’s official registration process.

---

### **Key Features and Implications**

- **Humanitarian Focus:** The policy reflects Canada’s commitment to supporting individuals affected by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, particularly those who are part of extended family units and may face displacement or instability.
- **Temporary Nature:** The remission is limited to a specific time frame (January 9, 2024 – April 22, 2025), and only applies to applications made under the designated public policies.
- **Policy Alignment:** The regulation is directly tied to two temporary public policies that were introduced to facilitate visa processing for extended family members of those affected by the Gaza crisis.
- **No Broad Application:** The remission does not apply to all temporary resident visa applications or to individuals not affected by the Gaza crisis. It is narrowly targeted and conditional.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a **temporary, targeted relief measure** to remove financial barriers for individuals seeking temporary resident visas due to the crisis in Gaza. By waiving application fees for eligible applicants who submit their applications during the specified period under designated public policies, the government aims to promote family reunification and humanitarian access during a time of global crisis.

It demonstrates the flexibility of Canada’s immigration framework to respond to emergencies, while maintaining clear eligibility criteria and procedural timelines to ensure fairness and accountability.
