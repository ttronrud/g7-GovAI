**Detailed Summary of the Bank of Canada Notes Regulations (Revoked and Replaced, Effective July 1, 1989)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This document is a **revocation and replacement** of an earlier regulation—Regulation No. 1 made by Order in Council P.C. 2752 of October 28, 1936—by the **Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 25(3) of the Bank of Canada Act**.

The new regulations, effective **July 1, 1989**, establish the current legal framework governing the **denominations and signature requirements** for banknotes issued by the **Bank of Canada**. These regulations are officially cited as the **Bank of Canada Notes Regulations**.

Importantly, this regulation was **not published in the Canada Gazette, Part II**, which is the official publication for statutory instruments in Canada. This may indicate a procedural or administrative detail, but does not affect its legal validity or enforceability.

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Denominations of Banknotes**

The regulation specifies the **authorized denominations** of Bank of Canada notes:

- Five dollars ($5)  
- Ten dollars ($10)  
- Twenty dollars ($20)  
- Fifty dollars ($50)  
- One hundred dollars ($100)

> **Note**: The original provision listing these denominations was **repealed** by **SOR/96-122, section 1** (September 29, 1996), and again by **SOR/2000-174, section 1** (April 12, 2000). This indicates that the list of denominations has since been updated or superseded by later legislation, and the 1989 regulation is no longer in full force in its original form. However, the 1989 version reflects the denomination structure in effect at that time.

> **Interpretation**: The 1989 regulation represents a historical snapshot of the Bank of Canada’s note issuance policy prior to the later removal of the $5 note and the introduction of new denominations (e.g., the $20 note was later redesigned, and the $100 note has been phased out in some forms). The repeal of these provisions suggests that the current denominations are governed by more recent regulations.

#### **2. Signature Requirements on Banknotes**

All Bank of Canada notes must bear **facsimiles (copies)** of the following signatures:

- The **Governor of the Bank of Canada** in office at the time the notes are printed.
- The **Deputy Governor** appointed under **subsection 6(1)** of the Bank of Canada Act, who is in office at the time of printing.

> **Exception**: If the Deputy Governor is:
> - Absent,
> - Unable to act, or
> - The position is vacant,

Then the note may bear the signature of an **additional Deputy Governor** appointed under **subsection 7(1)** of the Bank of Canada Act.

> **Purpose of Signature Requirement**: This ensures **authenticity, accountability, and legal validity** of Bank of Canada notes. The presence of two authorized signatures (Governor and Deputy Governor) serves as a critical safeguard against counterfeiting and provides a clear chain of authority for the issuance of currency.

### **Legal Authority and Procedural Background**

- **Authority**: The regulation is issued under **subsection 25(3) of the Bank of Canada Act**, which grants the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) the power to make or amend regulations related to the issuance of Bank of Canada notes.
- **Purpose**: To modernize and clarify the rules governing the design, denominations, and authentication of Bank of Canada currency, ensuring consistency with evolving monetary policy and security needs.

---

### **Historical and Current Context**

- The 1989 regulation was a significant update to the earlier 1936 rules, reflecting changes in the Bank of Canada’s structure, financial policy, and public confidence in currency.
- However, **subsequent amendments** (notably in 1996 and 2000) have **repealed or modified** the specific provisions listed here, suggesting that:
  - The Bank of Canada has introduced new note designs,
  - Updated denominations (e.g., removal of the $5 note in favor of other designs),
  - Enhanced security features,
  - Or restructured governance (e.g., changes in deputy governor appointments).

> As of today, the **current Bank of Canada Notes Regulations** are governed by more recent legislation, including the **Bank of Canada Act** and its amendments, and are likely managed under a different regulatory framework.

---

### **Conclusion**

The 1989 Bank of Canada Notes Regulations represent a **historical regulatory instrument** that:

- Defined the **authorized denominations** of Bank of Canada notes at the time,
- Established **signature requirements** to ensure authenticity and accountability,
- Was later **repealed or amended** to reflect changes in currency design, governance, and public policy.

While the regulation itself is **no longer in force** due to subsequent repeals (SOR/96-122 and SOR/2000-174), it provides valuable insight into the evolution of Canada’s currency issuance system and the regulatory framework underpinning the Bank of Canada’s role in issuing legal tender.
