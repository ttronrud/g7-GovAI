The reference "[Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 68]" indicates that a specific regulation or section of a statute was officially repealed (cancelled or removed) on or around 2014, under the provisions of **Chapter 2, Section 68** of a particular legislative act.

However, without specifying the **jurisdiction** (e.g., Canada, a U.S. state, a province, or another country), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the actual content of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a regulation or section is described as "repealed," it means:

- The law or provision was formally removed from the legal code.
- It is no longer in force or applicable.
- The repeal was enacted by a legislative body (such as a parliament or legislature) through a new statute.
- The repeal may have been done to modernize legislation, eliminate outdated provisions, or align with new legal standards.

For example, in the context of **Canadian law**, if this reference appears in a federal or provincial statute (such as the *Criminal Code* or *Health Act*), the repeal would have been formally recorded in the official journal (e.g., the *Canada Gazette* or a provincial government publication). In that case, Section 68 of Chapter 2 of the relevant act would have contained the legal text that was later repealed.

To provide a detailed summary of the regulation that was repealed, the following information would be required:

1. The **full name of the statute or act** (e.g., *The Ontario Motor Vehicle Act*, *The Canada Labour Code*).
2. The **jurisdiction** (country, province, or state).
3. The **original content or purpose** of the section (which may be found in the original legislation or legal database).

Without this context, a detailed summary cannot be accurately provided.

**Conclusion**:  
The entry "[Repealed, 2014, c. 2, s. 68]" signifies that a legal provision was officially removed in 2014 via Section 68 of Chapter 2 of a legislative act. However, due to the lack of specific jurisdiction and original content, a detailed summary of the regulation itself cannot be offered. To proceed, the name of the act and jurisdiction must be specified.
