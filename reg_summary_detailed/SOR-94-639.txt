The regulation you have provided consists entirely of repeated lines stating:

> "[Repealed, SOR/2007-108, s. 5]"

This indicates that the specific regulation in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked) by **Schedule 5 of the Statutory Rules (SOR) /2007-108**, which was published in the Canada Gazette on May 18, 2007.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status**: The regulation is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2007-108, section 5**. This is a statutory rule (a regulation made under a parent act) that removes certain provisions from the legislative framework.
- **Date of Repeal**: May 18, 2007 (the date the regulation was published in the Canada Gazette, which is the official publication for federal statutory instruments in Canada).
- **Purpose of the Repeal**: The repeal suggests that the original regulation was either:
  - Outdated or obsolete,
  - Overlapping with newer legislation,
  - Contradictory to current law,
  - Or no longer necessary due to changes in policy or administrative structure.

### What This Means for Practitioners or Legal Entities:

- Any reference to this regulation in legal documents, compliance procedures, or operational guidelines should be treated as **invalid or irrelevant**.
- Legal or regulatory compliance efforts should not rely on this provision, as it no longer applies.
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative update or consolidation of regulations, aimed at simplifying or modernizing the regulatory framework.

### Important Note:

Since the original regulation is not provided in your query (only the repeal notice), it is not possible to summarize its **former content, scope, or intent**. To fully understand what the regulation *used to cover*, one would need to consult the original text of the regulation prior to its repeal — which is likely archived in the *Canada Gazette* or accessible through the *Canada Gazette, Part I* or the *Federal Regulations database* (e.g., through the Government of Canada’s legislation website: [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).

### Conclusion:

The provided text is a **repeal notice**, not a regulation itself. It confirms that a prior regulation has been officially removed from the legal system. As such, it does not contain substantive content but serves as a legal marker of its termination. Without the original regulation, a detailed summary of its former provisions cannot be provided.
