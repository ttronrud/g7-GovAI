**Detailed Summary of the Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1990**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**
The regulation is issued under the authority of the *Unemployment Insurance Act* of Canada. Specifically, it is authorized by:
- Subsection 24(4): Grants the Governor General in Council the power to set maximum benefit amounts under Section 24 of the Act.
- Subsection 25(10): Authorizes the setting of maximum benefit levels for benefits under Section 25.
- Subsection 26(8): Provides the legal basis for establishing the maximum amounts payable under Section 26.

This Order is made on the recommendation of two key governmental bodies:
- The **Minister of Employment and Immigration**, responsible for policy and administration related to employment and social insurance.
- The **Treasury Board**, which oversees federal financial management and budgetary decisions.

The Order is formally enacted by the Governor General in Council, representing the Crown, and serves as a formal administrative directive to implement benefit funding limits for the year 1990.

**2. Effective Date:**
The benefits authorized under this Order take effect on **January 1, 1990**. This marks the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funding limits are established.

**3. Title of the Order:**
The regulation is officially titled the **Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1990**. It may be cited as such in legal, administrative, and policy contexts.

**4. Key Provisions: Maximum Benefit Amounts for 1990:**
The Order establishes the maximum total amounts of benefits that may be paid in the year 1990 under the three primary sections of the *Unemployment Insurance Act*:

| Section | Benefit Type | Maximum Amount Authorized (1990) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Section 24** | Unemployment Insurance Benefits (for individuals who lose employment through no fault of their own) | **$130,000,000** |
| **Section 25** | Disability Benefits (for individuals who are unable to work due to illness or injury) | **$120,000,000** |
| **Section 26** | Parental Benefits (for parents who are taking time off to care for a newborn or newly adopted child) | **$376,000,000** |

**5. Interpretation and Implications:**
- These figures represent **total annual funding caps** for each benefit category. They do not represent individual benefit amounts but rather the total pool of funds available to the government to disburse through the respective programs in 1990.
- The significantly higher cap for **Section 26 (Parental Benefits)**—at $376 million—reflects the government’s recognition of the importance of parental leave and child-rearing support, possibly indicating a policy priority at the time.
- The lower caps for Sections 24 and 25 suggest a more conservative allocation of funds, possibly due to economic conditions or fiscal constraints in 1990, which was a period of economic transition in Canada.

**6. Purpose and Context:**
This Order ensures that the federal government maintains financial accountability and fiscal responsibility in administering unemployment and related benefits. By setting clear annual limits, it:
- Prevents uncontrolled spending.
- Provides a transparent framework for budget planning and program administration.
- Aligns benefit disbursements with the government’s overall fiscal policy and economic outlook.

**7. Legal and Administrative Significance:**
- This Order is binding on all relevant government departments and service providers involved in administering unemployment insurance programs.
- It serves as a foundational document for the calculation of benefit payments, eligibility determinations, and fund allocations for the year 1990.
- It is subject to review and potential revision in subsequent years based on economic performance, changes in legislation, or shifts in policy priorities.

**Conclusion:**
The *Unemployment Insurance Benefits Order, 1990* is a critical administrative instrument that defines the maximum annual funding levels for three key components of Canada’s social safety net: unemployment, disability, and parental benefits. By establishing caps of $130 million, $120 million, and $376 million respectively, the Order provides a clear, legally grounded framework for the fiscal management of these programs during the 1990 fiscal year. It reflects both the government’s commitment to social protection and its need to balance benefit provision with fiscal responsibility.
