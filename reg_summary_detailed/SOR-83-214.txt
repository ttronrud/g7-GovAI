The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal is enacted under **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which stands for *Statutory Instrument 2017-84, section 1*. This is a formal legislative instrument issued by the Government of Canada (or a provincial government, depending on context) that removes or replaces a previous regulation.
- **Frequency of Repeats**: The phrase "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" appears seven times. This repetition likely reflects a formatting or technical error in the original source, possibly due to a copy-paste issue or data duplication. It does not indicate that the regulation was repealed multiple times or that there are multiple instances of the same repeal.
- **Implication**: Since the regulation is repealed, it is **no longer in force** and has **no legal effect**. Any prior provisions, requirements, or obligations derived from it are no longer applicable.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. It is **no longer valid or enforceable**. The repeated entries are likely a technical error and do not alter the legal status — the regulation is simply gone from the current regulatory framework.

> **Note**: To identify the original regulation that was repealed, one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2017-84, section 1, which would specify the name and scope of the repealed regulation. However, based solely on the provided text, no such details are available.

If you have additional context (e.g., the title or subject area of the regulation), I can help identify the specific regulation that was repealed.
