**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Context:**  
This regulation is issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, specifically pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of that Act. This provision empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer certain powers, duties, and functions between federal departments and ministers. The purpose of such transfers is to improve administrative efficiency, align responsibilities with expertise, and ensure that public service functions are managed by departments best equipped to carry them out.

**Effective Date:**  
The transfers take effect on **July 1, 1996**.

**1. Transfer of Powers, Duties, and Functions to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**  
Under this provision, the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food** is granted the powers, duties, and functions previously held by the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** relating to the **inspection of food** under the *Food and Drugs Act*.

- **Scope of Transfer:**  
  This includes all responsibilities associated with the inspection of food products, such as ensuring food safety, compliance with labeling and quality standards, and enforcement of food safety regulations.
  
- **Legal Basis:**  
  The transfer is based on the *Food and Drugs Act*, which governs the regulation of food, drugs, and medical devices in Canada. By transferring these functions to the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the government consolidates food safety oversight under a department with strong agricultural and food production expertise.

- **Rationale:**  
  The move reflects a strategic realignment to place food inspection within a department with direct knowledge of agricultural production, food processing, and supply chains—enhancing the coherence and effectiveness of food safety policy.

**2. Transfer of Control and Supervision to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**  
The **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food** is given control and supervision over specific public service units previously located within the **Department of National Health and Welfare**. These include:

- **Food Inspection Division** for the following regions:  
  - Atlantic Region  
  - Ontario  
  - Quebec  
  - Central Region  
  - Western Region  

- **Food Inspection Programme Support Unit** of the Food Directorate  

- **Scope of Transfer:**  
  This transfer involves the administrative, operational, and supervisory authority over these units. The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food now oversees day-to-day activities, staffing, budgeting, and program delivery related to food inspection in these regions and the support functions that enable the inspection program.

- **Rationale:**  
  This reallocation ensures that regional food inspection operations are managed by a department with a stronger connection to agricultural and food industry practices. It streamlines coordination, reduces duplication, and improves responsiveness to regional food safety challenges.

**3. Transfer of Control and Supervision to the Department of National Health and Welfare**  
Conversely, the **Department of National Health and Welfare** retains control and supervision over a specific unit within the **Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food**:

- **Animal Health Bacteriology Centre of Expertise**  
- **Health of Animals Laboratory** (located in Guelph, Ontario)

- **Scope of Transfer:**  
  These units remain under the administrative and supervisory jurisdiction of the Department of National Health and Welfare. This includes oversight of research, testing, and expert analysis related to animal health and disease detection.

- **Rationale:**  
  The Animal Health Bacteriology Centre and the Health of Animals Laboratory are critical for monitoring and responding to zoonotic diseases (diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans), foodborne pathogens, and animal health threats. Their continued placement under the Department of National Health and Welfare reflects their importance in public health and disease surveillance, particularly in protecting human health through animal health monitoring.

---

**Overall Implications and Significance:**  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization of federal food safety and animal health governance:

- It shifts the primary responsibility for **food inspection** from a health-focused ministry to an agriculture-focused ministry, reflecting a broader trend of functional alignment based on expertise.
- It strengthens the integration of food safety into agricultural policy and practice.
- It preserves key public health functions—particularly those related to animal disease monitoring—within the health portfolio, recognizing their direct impact on human health.

**Conclusion:**  
The regulation effectively restructures the federal government’s oversight of food and animal health by transferring key inspection responsibilities to the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food while maintaining critical animal health research and surveillance functions within the Department of National Health and Welfare. This realignment enhances administrative efficiency, improves interdepartmental coordination, and ensures that food safety and animal health are managed by departments best equipped to address their respective domains.
