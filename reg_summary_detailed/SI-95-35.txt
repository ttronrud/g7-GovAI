**Background and Context:**

On June 25, 1993, by Order in Council P.C. 1993-1488, the control and supervision of the **Income Security Programs Branch** (ISPB) was transferred from the **Department of National Health and Welfare (DNHW)** to the **Department of Employment and Immigration (DEI)**. This reorganization aimed to align public service responsibilities with broader employment and social welfare policy objectives.

However, on August 28, 1995, a subsequent transfer was made under the same enabling provision — paragraph 2(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* — to further realign administrative responsibilities within the federal public service.

**Key Provision of the 1995 Order:**

Effective **August 28, 1995**, the **control and supervision** of the following specific components of the Income Security Programs Branch — previously under the Department of Employment and Immigration — were transferred to the **Department of National Revenue (DNR)**:

1. **The Child Tax Benefit Program**  
   - This includes all administrative, operational, and financial responsibilities related to the administration of the Child Tax Benefit, a federal program designed to provide financial support to low- and middle-income families with children.
   - The transfer involves the management of eligibility assessments, benefit calculations, payments, record-keeping, and compliance with program rules and regulations.

2. **Special allowances under the Children’s Special Allowances Act**  
   - This refers to specific financial benefits provided to children under certain conditions, such as those with disabilities or in cases of exceptional need.
   - These allowances are administered through the Children’s Special Allowances Act, and their operational oversight — including processing applications, determining eligibility, and disbursing funds — is now placed under the DNR’s jurisdiction.

---

**Purpose and Rationale of the Transfer:**

- **Administrative Efficiency and Expertise:** The Department of National Revenue has established expertise in tax administration, financial management, and revenue collection. Transferring these benefit programs to DNR was intended to improve the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of benefit disbursement through integration with existing tax and financial systems.
  
- **Streamlined Oversight:** By placing these programs under a revenue-focused department, there is a potential for better coordination with tax filings, income verification processes, and financial reporting systems — reducing duplication and enhancing data integrity.

- **Policy Alignment:** The Child Tax Benefit and special allowances are closely tied to family income and financial status, which are often assessed through tax returns. Placing them under DNR allows for more seamless data sharing and cross-referencing with tax information.

**Legal Authority:**

The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer control and supervision of public service functions between departments. This provision allows for reorganization based on policy, efficiency, and administrative effectiveness.

**Effective Date:**

The transfer became effective on **August 28, 1995**. All administrative, operational, and supervisory responsibilities for the specified programs were transferred from the Department of Employment and Immigration to the Department of National Revenue on this date.

---

**Implications:**

- **Departmental Responsibility Shift:** The Department of National Revenue now bears responsibility for the day-to-day management, monitoring, and compliance of the Child Tax Benefit and Children’s Special Allowances programs.
- **Interdepartmental Coordination:** While the transfer of control occurred, ongoing coordination with the Department of Employment and Immigration (for employment-related aspects) and the Department of National Health and Welfare (for broader social policy) may still be necessary.
- **Public Service Impact:** Citizens and families receiving these benefits would experience continuity in service delivery, though administrative processes may be subject to changes in policy or procedures under the new departmental oversight.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a significant administrative realignment within the Canadian federal public service. It reflects a broader trend in the 1990s of consolidating social programs under departments with strong financial and data management capabilities. By transferring the Child Tax Benefit and Children’s Special Allowances to the Department of National Revenue, the government aimed to enhance operational efficiency, improve financial accountability, and strengthen integration with tax and income verification systems.

This transfer is a formal, legally valid action under existing public service legislation and underscores the flexibility of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* in adapting to evolving governance needs.
