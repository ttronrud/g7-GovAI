**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulation:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to subsection 3(1.1)a of the *Financial Administration Act*, amends *Schedule I.1* to that Act.

**Key Provisions of the Amendment:**

1. **Subject of the Amendment:**  
   The regulation modifies *Schedule I.1* of the *Financial Administration Act*, which is a schedule that sets out the official designations and responsibilities of individuals or offices responsible for the administration of federal government funds and the oversight of certain government bodies and committees.

2. **Specific Change:**  
   The amendment involves a change to the designation of the individual or office responsible for the *Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat* (CICS).  
   - **Before the amendment:** The name listed in *column II* of Schedule I.1, opposite the entry for the Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat, was **"the President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada."**  
   - **After the amendment:** This reference is **struck out** (removed), and replaced with **"the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs."**

3. **Legal Authority:**  
   The amendment is authorized under **subsection 3(1.1)a** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision allows the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to make changes to the administrative structure and official designations in the Act, particularly where such changes are necessary to reflect shifts in government roles, responsibilities, or administrative arrangements.

4. **Purpose and Significance:**  
   - The change reflects a **realignment of responsibilities** within the federal government’s intergovernmental affairs structure.  
   - The *Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat* is a key body responsible for facilitating coordination and communication between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments.  
   - By designating the **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs** as the official responsible for this secretariat, the government signals that this role is now formally under the leadership and oversight of that specific ministerial office.  
   - This change ensures that official government records, financial administration, and accountability mechanisms correctly reflect the current administrative structure, enhancing transparency and clarity in intergovernmental relations.

5. **Legal Citation:**  
   - The regulation is published in the *Statutes of Canada, 2003, c. 22, paragraph 224(z.37)*.  
   - It is also referenced in the *Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter F-11* (the *Financial Administration Act*).

6. **Effective Date and Context:**  
   This amendment was enacted in **2003**, during a period of government restructuring and modernization of intergovernmental coordination. It aligns with broader efforts to streamline federal operations and clarify the roles of key ministers in intergovernmental affairs.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a technical but significant update to the formal administrative structure of the Canadian government. It removes a legacy reference to the President of the Queen’s Privy Council (a largely ceremonial office) and replaces it with a more operationally relevant and active ministerial designation—the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. This ensures that financial and administrative records accurately reflect current governance responsibilities and strengthens accountability in intergovernmental coordination.

**Note:** The President of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada is a constitutional office typically held by the Prime Minister or a senior cabinet minister. In practice, the role is largely symbolic and not directly involved in day-to-day policy or administrative oversight. The shift to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs reflects a move toward functional, ministerial accountability in intergovernmental affairs.
