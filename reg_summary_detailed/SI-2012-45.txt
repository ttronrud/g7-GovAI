**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation is issued under the **Species at Risk Act (SARA)**, enacted in 2002 (S.C. 2002, c. 29), specifically pursuant to **subsections 27(1.1) and (1.2)** of the Act. These provisions empower the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to **decide not to add certain wildlife species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** and to **approve the inclusion of a public statement explaining the rationale** for such decisions.

The regulation is a formal **Order in Council**, published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on April 21, 2012, as part of a proposed amendment to Schedule 1 of SARA. The proposed Order initially intended to add 18 species to the List and reclassify seven others. However, after a 30-day public comment period, the Minister of the Environment recommended **not to add three specific species**—the **Laura’s Clubtail (*Stylurus laurae*)**, **Coast Manroot (*Marah oreganus*)**, and **Four-leaved Milkweed (*Asclepias quadrifolia*)**—to the List.

The final decision is to **reject the addition** of these three species and to **approve the public registration** of a detailed statement explaining the reasons for this decision.

### **Key Decisions and Rationale**

#### 1. **Laura’s Clubtail (*Stylurus laurae*) – A North American Dragonfly**

- **Distribution in Canada**: Known only in **two locations** in **southwestern Ontario**, specifically in **unusual fast-moving sandy streams** on **private or non-federal land**.
- **Habitat Threats**: 
  - Pollution
  - Water extraction for irrigation
  - Invasive species
- **Population Status**: 
  - No reliable data on population size or trends.
  - COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) acknowledges uncertainty in population dynamics.
- **Global Significance**: 
  - Canada’s contribution to the species’ global conservation is considered **negligible**.
- **Existing Protections**:
  - Already protected under **Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007**.
  - This Act prohibits:
    - Killing, harming, capturing, or taking of listed species
    - Possession, trade, collection, or transport of such species
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - The species has an **extremely limited range** in Canada.
  - Recovery efforts in Canada would have **minimal impact** on the species’ global status.
  - Protection is already in place at the provincial level.
  - **Resource allocation** is more efficient if efforts are directed toward species where Canada can make a **measurable and significant contribution** to conservation.

> **Conclusion**: Not added to the List to **conserve federal resources** and avoid duplication of protection.

#### 2. **Coast Manroot (*Marah oreganus*) – A Perennial Vine**

- **Distribution in Canada**: Found at **three sites** in **southeastern Vancouver Island and adjacent Gulf Islands**, British Columbia.
- **Habitat Threats**:
  - Development of known sites
  - Invasive species
  - Random events (e.g., fire, disease)
- **Population Status**:
  - Never common in British Columbia; only at the **northern edge of its range**.
  - COSEWIC notes that the species is not naturally re-established from outside populations.
- **Global Significance**:
  - Canada’s role in the species’ global conservation is **minimal**.
- **Existing Protections**:
  - Protected under **British Columbia’s Red List**, which serves as a tool for:
    - Land-use planning
    - Prioritizing conservation and research
    - Managing environmental protection activities
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - Extremely small Canadian range.
  - Limited potential for recovery in Canada.
  - Existing provincial protections are sufficient.
  - **No significant benefit** to be gained from federal listing.
- **Additional Note**:
  - The **Garry Oak ecosystem**, which includes Coast Manroot, remains a **priority ecosystem** under Canada’s **Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk (HSP)**, which has been in place since 2000 and receives annual funding of **$9 to $13 million**.

> **Conclusion**: Not added to the List due to **lack of federal impact potential** and **existing provincial safeguards**.

#### 3. **Four-leaved Milkweed (*Asclepias quadrifolia*) – A Rare Milkweed Species**

- **Distribution in Canada**: Only **two small extant populations** at the **eastern end of Lake Ontario** (Ontario).
- **Population Size**: Very low numbers in each population.
- **Historical Status**: Populations in the **Niagara Falls region are believed extirpated**.
- **Habitat**:
  - Found only in **rare limestone deciduous woodlands**.
  - All known sites are on **private, non-federal land**.
- **Threats**:
  - Habitat conversion
  - Habitat degradation
  - Invasive species
  - Future residential development remains a risk at the largest site.
- **Population Trends**:
  - Limited observations suggest **no decline since 2006–2007**, though data are sparse.
- **Global Significance**:
  - No evidence that Canada plays a significant role in the species’ global status.
- **Existing Protections**:
  - Protected under **Ontario’s Endangered Species Act, 2007**, with the same prohibitions as for Laura’s Clubtail:
    - Killing, harming, capturing, or taking
    - Trade, collection, or possession
- **Decision Rationale**:
  - Extremely restricted range in Canada.
  - Recovery efforts in Canada would have **negligible impact** on the species’ overall survival.
  - Protection is already in place at the provincial level.
  - Federal resources would be better used elsewhere.

> **Conclusion**: Not added to the List to **ensure efficient use of conservation funding** and to avoid overlapping with existing provincial protections.

### **Public Engagement and Feedback**

- The proposed Order was published in the *Canada Gazette* with a **30-day comment period**.
- **Eleven individuals or organizations submitted formal oppositions**, arguing that:
  - The decision was **inconsistent with the spirit and intent of SARA**.
  - The scientific and economic justifications were **weak or insufficient**.
  - Relying on **limited occurrence** in Canada could **set a precedent** that undermines conservation of southern Canadian ecosystems.
- Despite these concerns, the Minister concluded that:
  - The **provincial protections are adequate**.
  - The **range and impact of recovery efforts in Canada are too small** to justify federal listing.
  - The decision is consistent with **SARA’s principles of proportionality and resource efficiency**.

---

### **Policy and Strategic Implications**

1. **Resource Allocation Efficiency**:
   - The primary justification for not listing these species is **pragmatic resource management**.
   - Federal funds and personnel are limited, and their use must be focused on species where Canada can make a **measurable and meaningful contribution** to conservation.

2. **Provincial Jurisdiction and Co-Management**:
   - The decision reflects a **recognition of provincial responsibility** in protecting species with limited ranges within their territories.
   - It emphasizes **cooperative conservation**, where federal and provincial governments share responsibilities.

3. **Ecosystem-Level Protection**:
   - Although the species themselves are not listed, their **associated ecosystems** (e.g., Garry Oak, limestone deciduous woodlands) remain priorities under Canada’s **Habitat Stewardship Program (HSP)**.
   - This ensures that **habitat-level conservation** continues, even if individual species are not formally listed.

4. **Precedent and Policy Caution**:
   - The decision is seen as a **cautious approach** to avoid over-listing species with very small ranges and limited recovery potential.
   - It sets a precedent for **evaluating the significance of Canada’s contribution** to a species’ global status before listing.

### **Final Outcome of the Regulation**

- ✅ **The Laura’s Clubtail, Coast Manroot, and Four-leaved Milkweed are NOT added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk** under SARA.
- ✅ The **Minister of the Environment’s statement** explaining the decision is **approved and registered in the public registry** under Section 120 of SARA.
- ✅ The decision is based on:
  - Extremely limited Canadian range
  - Existing provincial legal protections
  - Minimal potential for recovery in Canada
  - Efficient use of federal conservation resources

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation exemplifies a **pragmatic, science-based, and ecologically grounded** application of the Species at Risk Act. It balances **conservation responsibility** with **realistic expectations of what federal intervention can achieve**. By not listing species with very narrow distributions and limited recovery potential, the government ensures that **federal conservation efforts are directed toward species where Canada can make a significant difference**, thereby maximizing the impact of limited resources. At the same time, it acknowledges and respects **provincial conservation frameworks**, promoting a collaborative, multi-level approach to biodiversity protection.
