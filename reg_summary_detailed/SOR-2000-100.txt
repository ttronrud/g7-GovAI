**Detailed Summary of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Regulations, 1999 (as amended and in force)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Regulations, 1999* (S.C. 1999, c. 31, s. 93) are a set of rules established under **section 40a of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act**. These regulations govern the **fiscal equalization payments** made by the federal government to provinces and the **recovery of overpayments** that arise due to methodological revisions in key data used to calculate those payments.

Importantly, **these regulations were repealed in 2007** (SOR/2007-303, s. 43), indicating they are no longer in force. However, the content provided appears to be a **draft or historical version** of the regulations, possibly from a transitional or interim phase, and may reflect provisions that were temporarily enacted before full replacement or repeal.

Despite the repeal, this summary provides a comprehensive analysis of the **provisions, structure, purpose, and key financial mechanisms** contained in the original text.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

The regulations are organized around several core themes:

1. **Recovery of Overpayments from Provinces**
2. **Methodological Revisions of Data and Their Impact**
3. **Adjustments to Equalization and Transfer Payments**
4. **Recovery Timelines and Caps**
5. **Definitions and Data Sources**
6. **Specific Financial Amounts for Provinces**
7. **Effective Dates and Exceptions**

## **1. Recovery of Overpayments Due to Methodological Revisions**

### **Purpose**
To ensure that provinces do not receive **unjustified overpayments** in fiscal equalization or Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST) due to **improvements in statistical methodologies** used to calculate population or capital stock data.

### **Key Provisions:**

- **Section 1 (General Recovery Rule)**  
  If a methodological revision (e.g., improved statistical methodology for residential net capital stock) occurs **before April 1, 2003**, and results in a **higher equalization payment**, the **overpayment must be recovered** from the province.

- **Definition of "Methodological Revision"**  
  A revision resulting from **planned research or development** to improve statistical methodology — *not* from data updates or benchmarking without changing the methodology.

- **Residential Net Capital Stock Data**  
  This is the key metric used in equalization calculations. It reflects the value of housing stock owned by residents.

- **Calculation of Overpayment**  
  The overpayment is the difference between:
  - The equalization estimate based on **pre-revision** residential net capital stock data  
  - The estimate based on **post-revision** residential net capital stock data  
  → This is calculated under **paragraph 8(1)(a)** of the main regulations.

- **Recovery Period**  
  Overpayments are recovered in **equal monthly installments** from **April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2008**.

- **Cap on Recovery**  
  If the total overpayment (including other recoveries under section 24) exceeds the **limit set in subsection 24(2)**, the recovery under this part is **reduced by the excess**.

- **Deferral of Outstanding Balances**  
  Any balance remaining after adjustments is **deferred to the next fiscal year**.

- **Exception for April 1, 2007 Balance**  
  Any balance outstanding on **April 1, 2007** (after adjustments) must still be recovered in equal monthly installments until **March 31, 2008**.

## **2. Adjustments for Post-Coming-Into-Force Revisions (Before March 1, 2003)**

### **If revisions occur after the regulations came into force (March 15, 2000) and before March 1, 2003**:

- **For provinces that previously received overpayments**:  
  The overpayment amount is **increased** by the value of any additional overpayment due to the new revision.

- **For provinces that did not previously receive overpayments**:  
  The new overpayment is **recovered under this regulation** (i.e., not waived).

- **If a revision reduces an overpayment**:  
  The recovery amount is **adjusted downward** accordingly.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Subsections (4) to (7) remain in force even after these adjustments — meaning the recovery schedule and caps still apply.

---

## **3. Further Estimate of Equalization and CHST (March 15, 2004)**

### **Purpose**
To correct overpayments or underpayments caused by **population data revisions**.

### **Key Provisions:**

- The Minister must issue a **further estimate** of equalization and CHST payments by **March 15, 2004**.
- This estimate uses the **June 1, 2000 population** from the **1996 Census** (not the 2001 census).
- Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from this estimate is **settled on the first and third working days after March 15, 2004**.

### **Subsequent Estimates Use 2001 Census Data**
- From fiscal years beginning **April 1, 2001 onward**, all interim and final calculations use the **June 1, 2001 census population**:
  - For **fiscal equalization**: paragraph 8(3)(c) and subsection 9(2)
  - For **Canada Health and Social Transfer**: subsection 5(7)

---

## **4. Recovery of Overpayments from Population and Tax Revisions**

### **Trigger Events**:
The Minister must recover overpayments due to:

1. **Revision of provincial population** (June 1, 2001 census)
2. **2002 federal individual income tax and corporate taxable income** (assessed as of December 31, 2003)

### **Applicable Fiscal Years**:
- April 1, 2000 to April 1, 2003

### **Recovery Schedule**:
- Overpayments are recovered in **equal monthly installments** from **April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2016**

### **Per Capita Cap**:
- If the total recovery exceeds **$120 per capita** of the province’s population, the recovery is **reduced by the excess**.

> This cap prevents excessive recovery, especially in large provinces with high populations.
