## 🏦 Transfer Options and Restrictions

### Option 1: Transfer to a **Locked-in Registered Retirement Savings Plan (LRSP)**

The LRSP must meet **strict conditions** to ensure financial protection and income security:

#### 1. **Transfer Restrictions**
The funds may only be transferred to:
- Another **LRSP**
- A **life income fund (LIF)**
- An **immediate or deferred life annuity**

#### 2. **Death Benefit Protection**
Upon the death of the holder, the funds must be paid to the survivor by one of the following:

#### 3. **Prohibition on Encumbrances**
- Funds and any interest in them **must not be**:
  - Transferred
  - Charged
  - Attached
  - Anticipated
  - Given as security
- Any transaction that appears to do so is **void** (or **null in Quebec**)

#### 4. **Gender Neutrality Requirement**
- If the original pension benefits were **not adjusted for gender** (e.g., no sex-based variation), then:
  - Any life annuity purchased with the transferred funds **must not differentiate between male and female** holders.

#### 5. **Valuation Requirements**
- The LRSP must clearly state:
  - The **method used to determine its value**
  - The valuation method used on the **date of death** or **date of transfer**

---

### Option 2: Transfer to a **Life Income Fund (LIF)**

The LIF must meet a comprehensive set of conditions to ensure sustainable, predictable income and protect against financial risk.

#### 1. **Transfer Restrictions**
Funds may only be transferred to:
- An **LRSP**
- Another **LIF**
- An **immediate or deferred life annuity**

#### 2. **Death Benefit Protection**
Upon death, funds must be paid to the survivor by:
- Transfer to an **LRSP**
- Transfer to another **LIF**
- Purchase of an **immediate or deferred life annuity**

#### 3. **Annual Withdrawal Rules**
- The holder must decide **each calendar year** how much to withdraw from the LIF.
- If no decision is made, the **minimum amount** required by the *Income Tax Act* must be paid out.

#### 4. **Income Limits (Before Age 90)**  
For any calendar year **before the holder reaches 90 years of age**, the annual income paid out must not exceed:

> **Maximum Amount = (Balance at start of year OR at transfer date) × (Value of a $1 pension)**

Where:
- The value of the $1 pension is determined using a **specific interest rate formula**:
  - **First 15 years**: ≤ monthly average yield on 10-year Canadian Government bonds (as published by the Bank of Canada, two months before the year starts)
  - **After Year 15**: ≤ **6% per year**

> This cap ensures that withdrawals do not outpace the fund's value or risk long-term depletion.

#### 5. **Income Limits (From Age 90 Onward)**
- After age 90, the amount of income paid out **must not exceed the value of the fund immediately before the payment**.
- This allows greater flexibility in later years, with no cap on withdrawals.

#### 6. **Proportional Calculation for Partial Years**
- For the **first year** of the LIF, if the fund was established in the middle of the year:
  - The income for that year is calculated as:
    > (Total income) × (number of months in the year) ÷ 12  
    - Any incomplete month counts as **one full month**

#### 7. **Zero Income for Prior LIF Funds**
- If part of the new LIF consists of funds previously held in **another LIF** during the same calendar year:
  - The income for that portion is **deemed zero** for that year.

#### 8. **Prohibition on Encumbrances**
- Same as LRSP: funds cannot be used as security or encumbered.
- Any such transaction is **void** or **null in Quebec**.

#### 9. **Gender Neutrality Requirement**
- If the original pension was not adjusted for gender, any annuity purchased from the LIF **must not differentiate by sex**.

#### 10. **Valuation Requirements**
- The LIF must clearly state:
  - The method used to determine its value
  - The valuation method used on the date of death or transfer

## 📣 Disclosure and Risk Warnings

The administrator **must provide a written statement** to each former member and their spouse or common-law partner (or survivor), including:

### 1. **Transfer Options**
- Clearly describe the available transfer paths (LRSP or LIF)

### 2. **Restrictions**
- Explain the limitations and rules governing each option

### 3. **Life Annuity Alternative**
- Inform the member that **if no transfer is made**, the administrator **must purchase a life annuity** on their behalf.

### 4. **Key Risks of Transfer**
> These are critical disclosures to ensure informed decision-making:

| Risk | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Lower-than-expected returns** | If investment performance is lower than anticipated, the income generated may be significantly reduced. |
| **Insufficient income** | Even if returns meet expectations, income may still fall short of what would have been received via a life annuity. |
| **Income volatility** | The income stream is dependent on investment performance, which is unpredictable. |

### 5. **Amount Comparisons**
- The statement must include:
  - The **calculated value** of the transferred assets (based on a formula)
  - The **amount** the member would receive under a **life annuity purchased by the administrator**

This enables members to compare the financial outcomes of transferring vs. receiving a guaranteed annuity.
