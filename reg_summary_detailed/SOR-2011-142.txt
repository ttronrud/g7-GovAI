### **Regulatory Context and Legal Authority**

This regulation was issued by the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** under two specific provisions of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)*:

- **Subsection 91(5)a**: Grants the Minister the authority to designate a body to act as a regulatory entity for immigration consultants.
- **Subsection 91(7)a**: Provides the power to designate a body whose members in good standing may represent or advise individuals in connection with immigration or refugee proceedings.

### **Automatic Transition of Members from CSIC to ICCRC**

A critical transitional provision allows for the **automatic transfer of membership** from the **Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (CSIC)** to the ICCRC.

#### Key Provisions:
- Any person who was a **member in good standing** of the CSIC **on the date these regulations come into force** is automatically considered a member of the ICCRC **for the purposes of the IRPA**.
- This automatic status lasts until the **earlier of two dates**:
  1. **120 days** after the regulations come into force
  2. The date on which the individual **discontinues their membership in the ICCRC**

> This transitional period ensures that existing consultants are not suddenly excluded from representing clients during a critical transition phase.

#### Membership Fee Waiver:
- During the transitional period (as defined above), members who are transferred from CSIC to ICCRC are **not required to pay membership fees** to the ICCRC.
- This provision supports continuity and avoids financial barriers for consultants during the transition.

### **Effective Date and Registration Requirements**

- The regulations **come into force on the day that Section 1 of the *Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*, Chapter 8 of the Statutes of Canada, 2011, comes into force**.
- If the regulations are **registered later than that date**, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures that the regulation is implemented in a timely and legally sound manner, with flexibility for administrative processing.
