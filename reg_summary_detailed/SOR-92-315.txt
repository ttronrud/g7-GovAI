**Detailed Summary of the Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations**

**Regulatory Context and Authority**  
These regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, under paragraph 703(h) of the *Insurance Companies Act* (*Act*). The regulations are formally titled the **Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations** and came into effect on **June 1, 1992**. They are referenced in the official publication as *S.C. 1991, c. 47*.

### **Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to **allow insurance companies to permit their subsidiaries to hold shares in the parent company**, under specific conditions. This provision enables greater flexibility in corporate governance and capital structure, particularly where subsidiaries are engaged in regulated financial activities such as securities underwriting.

### **Key Definitions**  
The regulations introduce or clarify several key terms:

1. **"Act"**  
   Refers to the *Insurance Companies Act*, which provides the legal framework governing insurance companies in Canada.

2. **"Distribution"**  
   Defined as "distribution as defined in section 296 of the Act."  
   → This refers to the public offering or issuance of shares of an insurance company, such as through a share issuance, capital increase, or public offering. It is a critical term because it triggers special rules regarding shareholding limits.

3. **"Regulated Securities Entity"**  
   A financial institution whose primary business is dealing in securities and that is regulated in its securities activities by:
   - An Act of Parliament,
   - Provincial legislation, or  
   - The laws of a foreign country.  
   → This definition ensures that only entities operating under recognized regulatory oversight are eligible to hold shares in the parent insurance company.

### **Main Provisions**

#### **1. General Shareholding Limit**  
Under **paragraph 74(c)** of the *Insurance Companies Act*, subject to the provisions of **section 4**, an insurance company may permit a subsidiary that qualifies as a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares in the parent company — **provided** that:

> The **aggregate value** of shares of the parent company held by all such subsidiaries (excluding shares referred to in section 76 of the Act) **does not exceed 1% of the company’s regulatory capital**.

- **Regulatory capital** refers to the capital amount set by the regulator (e.g., the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions) to ensure financial stability and solvency of the insurance company.
- This 1% cap is a **strict limit** designed to prevent excessive concentration of ownership in subsidiaries, which could compromise the financial stability or independence of the parent company.
- The cap applies to **all subsidiaries** that meet the "regulated securities entity" definition and hold shares in the parent company.

#### **2. Exception for Securities Underwriting Activities**  
A significant exception is provided when a subsidiary is acting as a **securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution of shares** of the parent company.

- In such cases, the insurance company may permit the subsidiary to hold shares **in excess of the 1% limit** (i.e., beyond the cap set in section 3 of the regulations).
- This exception is **temporary** and only applies **until the distribution is ended**.
- The distribution must be a formal share issuance or offering (as defined in section 296 of the Act), such as a public offering or capital increase.

> **Example**: If an insurance company issues new shares to the public, and its subsidiary (a regulated securities entity) is acting as an underwriter for that offering, it may temporarily hold more than 1% of the parent company’s shares during the underwriting process. Once the offering concludes, the subsidiary must return to compliance with the 1% limit.

### **Legal and Regulatory Significance**

- These regulations balance **operational flexibility** with **financial stability**. They recognize that subsidiaries involved in securities markets may need access to parent company shares to support underwriting or investment activities.
- The 1% cap protects the parent insurance company from potential conflicts of interest, concentration of control, and risks associated with excessive ownership by affiliates.
- The temporary exception during share distributions acknowledges the practical realities of capital markets and underwriting processes, where temporary shareholding may be necessary.

---

### **Key Limitations and Conditions**

- **Eligibility Requirement**: Only subsidiaries that are **regulated securities entities** can hold shares under these rules.
- **Exclusion of Section 76 Shares**: Shares referred to in **section 76 of the Act** (which may include shares held by certain affiliates or for specific purposes such as reinsurance or internal management) are **excluded** from the 1% aggregate limit.
- **Section 4 Compliance**: The general rule applies subject to **section 4 of the Act**, which may impose additional conditions or restrictions depending on the nature of the company or its operations.

### **Conclusion**  
The *Subsidiaries Holding Company Shares (Insurance Companies) Regulations* provide a **practical and balanced framework** allowing insurance companies to permit their regulated securities subsidiaries to hold shares, under strict conditions. The core principles are:

1. **Controlled shareholding**: No more than 1% of the parent company’s regulatory capital may be held collectively by such subsidiaries.
2. **Exception during distributions**: Temporary relaxation of the 1% cap when a subsidiary acts as a securities underwriter in a share distribution.
3. **Regulatory oversight**: Ensures that only properly regulated entities participate, maintaining financial integrity and market transparency.

These regulations reflect a careful balance between enabling corporate flexibility and safeguarding the financial soundness and independence of insurance companies. They remain in force as a key component of Canada’s insurance regulatory framework, particularly in relation to corporate structure and shareholder governance.
