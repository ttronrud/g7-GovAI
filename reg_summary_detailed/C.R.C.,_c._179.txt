**Detailed Summary of the Ontario Cheese Order**

---

**1. Title and Citation**  
The regulation is formally titled *The Ontario Cheese Order* and may be cited as such. This Order establishes the legal framework governing the marketing of cheese produced in Ontario, particularly in relation to interprovincial trade and exports.

---

**2. Key Definitions**  

- **"Act"**: Refers to *The Milk Act, 1965* of Ontario (French: *Loi sur le lait, 1965*). This foundational legislation provides the legal authority for the regulation of milk and cheese marketing in the province.  
- **"Cheese"**: Encompasses *all varieties of cheese* that are produced within the province of Ontario. This broad definition ensures that no type of cheese—whether soft, hard, semi-hard, or aged—is excluded from the scope of this Order.  
- **"Commission"**: Refers to *The Milk Commission of Ontario*. This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing and distribution of milk and dairy products within Ontario, including cheese.  
- **"Commodity Board"**: Refers to *The Ontario Milk Marketing Board*, established by Order in Council under the authority of the *Milk Act, 1965*. This entity is tasked with managing the marketing of milk and dairy products, including cheese, with a focus on pricing, supply, and market stability.  
- **"Provincial Regulations"**: Refers to *The Cheese-Marketing Regulations*, officially published as *O. Reg. 44-66*, dated February 17, 1966. These regulations were made by the Commission under the authority of the Milk Act and provide specific rules governing the marketing of cheese within Ontario.

**3. Authority and Powers**  

This Order grants both the **Milk Commission** and the **Ontario Milk Marketing Board (Commodity Board)** the authority to regulate the **marketing of cheese** in two key areas:

- **Interprovincial Trade**: The sale or distribution of Ontario-produced cheese to other provinces in Canada.  
- **Export Trade**: The sale or shipment of Ontario cheese outside of Canada.

For these purposes, both bodies are authorized to exercise powers similar to those granted under the *Provincial Regulations*, specifically:

#### Powers of the Commission:
Under sections 3, 4, and 8 to 12 of the *Cheese-Marketing Regulations*, the Commission may:
- Set marketing standards and conditions.
- Regulate pricing, distribution, and sales practices.
- Impose requirements on producers and dealers.
- Monitor and enforce compliance with cheese marketing rules.

#### Powers of the Commodity Board:
Under sections 5 to 7 and subsection 8(3) of the *Cheese-Marketing Regulations*, the Commodity Board may:
- Establish marketing policies and pricing mechanisms.
- Administer pricing controls and quotas.
- Regulate the supply and distribution of cheese within the province.
- Ensure fair market practices and prevent market manipulation.

> Importantly, these powers are exercisable **with respect to persons and property situated within the Province of Ontario**. This means that any individual, business, or entity operating within Ontario—such as cheese producers, distributors, or retailers—must comply with the rules and regulations established under this Order.

---

**4. Purpose and Scope**  

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- Ensure fair and stable marketing conditions for cheese produced in Ontario.
- Prevent market distortions, price manipulation, or unfair competition.
- Protect producers and consumers by establishing clear rules for trade, both within the province and beyond.
- Provide a structured regulatory mechanism for the orderly development of the cheese market in Ontario.

By granting both the Commission and the Commodity Board similar powers, the Order creates a coordinated system of oversight where both entities can act in alignment to promote market stability and equitable access to markets.

---

**5. Legal Basis**  

All powers conferred under this Order are derived from the *Milk Act, 1965*, which empowers the Commission and the Commodity Board to regulate the marketing of milk and dairy products. The *Cheese-Marketing Regulations* (O. Reg. 44-66) provide the detailed operational rules that guide the exercise of these powers.

---

**Conclusion**  

The *Ontario Cheese Order* is a critical piece of regulatory legislation that enables effective oversight of the cheese industry in Ontario. It grants both the Milk Commission and the Ontario Milk Marketing Board the authority to regulate cheese marketing in interprovincial and export markets, using powers derived from the *Cheese-Marketing Regulations*. The Order ensures that all cheese produced in Ontario is marketed fairly, transparently, and in a manner that supports both producers and consumers, while maintaining market stability and protecting the interests of the province’s dairy sector.

This framework reflects a long-standing policy of provincial control over key agricultural commodities to ensure sustainable and equitable development of the dairy industry.
