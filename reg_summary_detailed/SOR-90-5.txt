The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SOR/2014-75, s. 10]

This indicates that a specific regulation (section 10 of the Statutory Instrument SOR/2014-75) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed) by another legislative or regulatory action.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation in question — Section 10 of Statutory Instrument No. 2014-75 (SOR/2014-75) — is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed by the same instrument (SOR/2014-75), specifically under **section 10** of that instrument.

**What does "repealed" mean?**  
Repeal means that the law or regulation previously existing in section 10 of SOR/2014-75 has been officially canceled. It is no longer enforceable, applicable, or valid. Any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously established in that section are now void.

**Context of SOR/2014-75:**  
SOR/2014-75 is a Statutory Instrument (SI) issued under the authority of the Canadian government. These instruments are used to implement or amend laws passed by Parliament. The exact title of SOR/2014-75 is typically listed in the official government publications (such as the Canada Gazette). While the full title is not provided in your query, SOR/2014-75 often relates to administrative or regulatory amendments in areas such as:

- Environmental protection  
- Transportation  
- Health and safety  
- Licensing or compliance  

However, without the full title or subject matter of the instrument, the precise content of the repealed section cannot be described in detail.

**Implications of Repeal:**  
- Any actions, decisions, or procedures previously governed by section 10 are now subject to the current law or a successor provision.  
- Legal or regulatory compliance must now be based on the remaining provisions of the instrument or on other applicable legislation.  
- Entities or individuals relying on the repealed section must adjust their operations or documentation accordingly.

**Note on Repetition:**  
The repeated listing of "[Repealed, SOR/2014-75, s. 10]" suggests a possible formatting or data entry error. It may have originated from a database or document where multiple references to the same repealed section were duplicated. In legal or regulatory databases, such repetition is not standard and does not add new information.
