### **Detailed Summary of the Kenora Airport Zoning Regulations**

The **Kenora Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of official rules established under the authority of the *Aeronautics Act* of Canada. These regulations were adopted by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, to ensure the safe operation of Kenora Airport by controlling land use and development in its vicinity. The regulations are designed to minimize hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases by establishing strict limits on height, development, and environmental factors.

## **1. Legal Basis and Publication Process**

- **Legal Authority**: The regulations are made pursuant to **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which allows the Minister of Transport to issue zoning regulations for airports.
- **Public Consultation**: A proposed version of the regulations was published in two successive issues of *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **June 19 and 26, 1993**, and in two successive issues of *The Daily Miner and News* on **July 21 and 22, 1993**.
- This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties** (e.g., residents, developers, aviation stakeholders) to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport.
- Following public consultation, the final regulations were formally adopted and published.

## **2. Definition of Key Terms**

The regulations define several key spatial and technical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Kenora Airport**, located in the Towns of Jaffray and Melick, in the Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used to establish elevation and horizontal coordinates for all other surfaces. Its elevation is **403.8 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip. These surfaces are designed to ensure safe aircraft approach paths. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, but **not less than 9 meters above ground level** where terrain is lower. |
| **Strip** | The main landing area, specifically the **300-meter-wide, 1,888-meter-long** strip associated with runway 07–25. It includes the runway and its adjacent areas. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward to intersect with the outer surface. |

## **3. Key Provisions and Restrictions**

### **3.1 Height Restrictions on Buildings and Structures**
- **No construction or development** may occur on land subject to these regulations if the **highest point** of any building, structure, or object exceeds:
  - The **approach surfaces**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surfaces**.
- This restriction applies to both **new constructions** and **additions to existing structures**.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Prevents obstructions that could interfere with aircraft visibility, navigation, or flight paths during takeoff and landing.

---

### **3.2 Prohibition of Interference with Aeronautical Communications**
- No person may use any part of the regulated land in a way that:
  - Interferes with **radio or signal transmission** to or from aircraft,
  - Interferes with **aeronautical facilities** (e.g., radar, navigation aids, control towers).
- This includes placement of antennas, towers, or other equipment that may disrupt communication signals.

> ✅ **Purpose**: Ensures reliable and uninterrupted communication between pilots and air traffic control.

---

### **3.3 Management of Natural Growth**
- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs) grows beyond the elevation of any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister may require** the owner or lessee to **remove the excessive growth**.
- This provision allows for proactive management of vegetation that could pose a hazard (e.g., branches interfering with flight paths or signals).

> ✅ **Purpose**: Prevents uncontrolled growth from becoming a safety risk.

---

### **3.4 Prohibition of Bird Attractants**
- No waste (including food scraps, organic matter, or other edible materials) may be disposed of on regulated land if such waste is **attractive or edible to birds**.
- Bird activity near airports poses a serious threat to flight safety (e.g., bird strikes).

> ✅ **Purpose**: Reduces the risk of bird-related incidents during flight operations.

## **4. Geospatial Descriptions and Boundaries**

### **4.1 Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at **UTM coordinates: 402,008.73 E and 5,515,873.71 N**.
- Defined as the point 81.08 meters north of the centerline of runway 07–25, measured from the threshold of runway 07 (westerly end).

> 📌 This point serves as the **origin for all elevation and horizontal measurements** in the regulation.

---

### **4.2 Approach Surfaces**
- Two approach surfaces, one for each end of runway 07–25:
  - **Ratio**: 1 meter vertically to 50 meters horizontally (1:50 slope).
  - **Rise to**: An imaginary horizontal line 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end.
  - **Width**: The outer ends of this horizontal line are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline.
  - **Elevation**: The horizontal line is **300 meters above the elevation at the end of the runway**.

> 📌 These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring a clear visual and navigational path.

---

### **4.3 Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane located **45 meters above the ARP**.
- **Exception**: If this plane would be below 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to avoid impracticality.

> 📌 This surface defines the maximum allowable height for any structure or object outside the strip area.

---

### **4.4 Strip**
- Associated with runway 07–25:
  - **Length**: 1,888 meters
  - **Width**: 300 meters (150 meters on each side of the runway centerline)

> 📌 The strip is the core operational zone where aircraft land and take off.

---

### **4.5 Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter vertical per 7 meters horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces** up to the **outer surface**.
- Ensures a gradual transition from the runway edge to the outer surface, preventing abrupt changes in terrain or height.

> 📌 These surfaces help maintain safe clearance and reduce turbulence risks during aircraft maneuvering.

---

### **4.6 Boundary of Regulated Land**
The regulations apply to **all land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances. The boundary is defined in a detailed, step-by-step description using **geographic coordinates and land parcels**.

#### **Geographic Coverage**:
- Towns: **Jaffray and Melick**
- Townships: **Haycock, Coyle, Jackson, Pettypiece**
- Towns: **Kenora and Keewatin**
- District: **Kenora**

#### **Boundary Description (Summary)**:
The outer boundary follows a complex path that:
- Begins at the **southwest corner of Location 555P** in Jaffray.
- Traverses through several concessions and lots (e.g., Lot 14, Concession 4; Lot 13, Concession 5).
- Crosses **approach surfaces** for both runway 07 and 25.
- Moves through **natural features** like the **Black Sturgeon Lakes** and **Breakneck Lake**.
- Follows **water’s edges** and **land boundaries**.
- Ends at the **starting point (POINT OF COMMENCE)**, completing a closed loop.

> 📌 The boundary ensures that only land within a defined safety zone is subject to the zoning restrictions.
