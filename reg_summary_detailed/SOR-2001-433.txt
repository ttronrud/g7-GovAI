**Detailed Summary of the *Subsidiaries that Hold Bank Holding Company Shares Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The regulations are issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **section 978a of the Bank Act**.  
- This means the regulation is a formal administrative measure enacted to implement or clarify provisions within the Bank Act, specifically concerning the ownership structure and shareholding limits of subsidiaries of bank holding companies.

The regulation is referenced in the following statutory sources:
- **S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 183** – Section 183 of the *Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act* (2001), which amended section 714 of the Bank Act.
- **S.C. 1991, c. 46** – The original *Bank Act* (as amended), which provides the foundational legal framework.

### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**
The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- Define under what circumstances a **subsidiary of a bank holding company** may hold shares in the parent bank holding company.
- Establish **specific limits** on such shareholding to ensure stability, transparency, and risk management in the banking system.
- Allow **flexibility** in certain circumstances—such as underwriting activities—where temporary exceedance of shareholding limits may be permitted.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing banking institutions in Canada. |
| **Distribution** | Defined in two ways:<br>1. A trade (buying or selling) by or on behalf of a bank holding company in **newly issued securities** (shares) of the bank holding company;<br>2. A trade in **previously issued securities** by a person or group acting in concert who holds **more than 10% of any class of voting shares** in the bank holding company. |
| **Regulated Securities Entity** | A financial institution whose primary business is dealing in securities and is regulated in its securities activities by:<br>• An Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature; or<br>• The laws of a foreign country. |

> This definition ensures that only entities with established regulatory oversight in securities markets are eligible to hold shares in a bank holding company.

### **4. Core Provision: Shareholding Limit (Section 2)**

Under **paragraph 714(c) of the Bank Act**, a bank holding company may allow a subsidiary that is a **regulated securities entity** to hold shares of the bank holding company—**provided** that:

> The **aggregate value** of all shares of the bank holding company held by **all such subsidiaries** (that are regulated securities entities)  
> **does not exceed 1% of the regulatory capital** of the bank holding company.

- **Regulatory capital** refers to the capital base required by regulators to support the bank holding company’s risk profile and financial stability.
- This 1% cap applies **except** for shares specifically referred to in **section 716 of the Bank Act**, which may be excluded from the calculation.

> ⚠️ This limit is designed to prevent excessive concentration of ownership and potential conflicts of interest between the parent bank holding company and its subsidiaries.

### **5. Exception: Temporary Excess During Share Distributions**

A critical exception is provided when a **regulated securities entity subsidiary** is acting as a **securities underwriter** in connection with a **distribution of shares** (i.e., a public offering or share issuance) of the bank holding company.

- In such cases, the bank holding company may **permit the subsidiary to hold shares in excess of the 1% limit**.
- This exception is **temporary** and applies **only until the distribution is completed** (i.e., until the offering ends).
- The purpose is to allow subsidiaries to participate in underwriting activities without violating the ownership cap, as underwriting often requires temporary access to shares.

> This provision supports market liquidity and ensures that subsidiaries can function effectively in capital markets without being restricted by ownership rules during active share issuances.

### **6. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day that **section 714 of the Bank Act** is activated by **section 183 of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada Act**, as enacted in **S.C. 2001, c. 9**.

- The effective date is **October 24, 2001** (as noted in the note).
- This aligns the subsidiary shareholding rules with broader reforms to improve transparency and oversight in the Canadian banking sector.

### **7. Regulatory Context and Implications**

- These regulations are part of a broader effort by the Canadian government to:
  - Strengthen **capital adequacy** and **risk governance** in bank holding companies.
  - Prevent **conflicts of interest** between parent companies and their subsidiaries.
  - Ensure that subsidiaries engaged in securities activities are properly regulated and do not gain undue influence over the parent bank.

- By limiting shareholding to 1% (except during underwriting), the rules promote **market discipline** and **independent governance**.

- The temporary exception during share distributions reflects a pragmatic recognition that underwriting activities require flexibility and market participation.
