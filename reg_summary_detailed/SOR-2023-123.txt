**Detailed Summary of the Vaping Products Reporting Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

The *Vaping Products Reporting Regulations* are a regulatory framework established under **Section 7.8a of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVP Act)**, as amended by *S.C. 2018, c. 9, s. 12* and *S.C. 1997, c. 13*. These regulations mandate **transparency and accountability** in the production, sale, and distribution of vaping products in Canada. They require manufacturers to report detailed information about their vaping products—including ingredients, sales volumes, and geographic distribution—to the **Minister of Mental Health and Addictions** (in consultation with the Associate Minister of Health).

These regulations are designed to:
- Improve public health oversight of vaping products,
- Enable effective monitoring of product safety and composition,
- Support policy development related to youth access, nicotine exposure, and market regulation,
- Ensure compliance with federal excise duties and product labeling standards.
