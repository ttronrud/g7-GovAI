### **Admissibility of Records**

A **duly certified transcript** of the original trial and sentencing proceedings is **admissible in evidence** at the hearing of the application.

### **Judicial Ruling on Evidence**

At the hearing, the judge has the authority to:
- Rule on the **admissibility** of any evidence presented.
- Determine whether any evidence is relevant, reliable, or properly authenticated.

---

### **Dismissal Based on Non-Applicability of the Code**

At any point before or during the hearing, if the judge determines that **subsection 745(1)** of the Criminal Code **does not apply** to the applicant:
- The application is **dismissed**.

3. **Judicial Oversight**: The judge maintains control over the hearing process, including jury empanelment, evidence rules, and final decisions.
