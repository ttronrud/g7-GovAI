### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Public Inquiry (Authorized Foreign Banks) Rules* were established by the **Superintendent of Financial Institutions** under **subsection 525(7)a of the Bank Act** (S.C. 1999, c. 28, s. 35(1)), and approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** (S.C. 1991, c. 46).

### **Scope of Application**

These rules apply specifically to **public inquiries** conducted under **subsection 525(5) of the Bank Act**, which authorizes the Superintendent to hold public inquiries when assessing applications from foreign banks seeking authorization to operate in Canada.

---

### **Key Definitions**

- **Act**: Refers to the *Bank Act*, the primary legislation governing financial institutions in Canada.

- **Inquiry**: A public hearing held to examine the merits of an application for authorization.
- **Objection**: A formal challenge to an application filed by a party (either an applicant or an objector).
- **Party**: Any individual or entity that submits an application or files an objection (i.e., applicant or objector).
- **Presiding Officer**: The Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or a person appointed under section 6 of the Bank Act to conduct the inquiry.

### **Mandatory Pre-Inquiry Notice Requirements**

Before holding an inquiry, the Superintendent must:

1. **Publish a notice of the inquiry** in:
   - The *Canada Gazette* (official government publication), and  
   - A newspaper of general circulation at or near the location of the foreign bank’s principal office.

2. **Serve the parties** (applicants and objectors) with:
   - A notice of the inquiry,
   - A copy of the objection (if any),
   - An invitation to attend the inquiry.

---

### **Content of the Inquiry Notice**

The published notice must include:
- The **date, time, and place** of the inquiry,
- The **purpose of the inquiry** and the **substance of the objection**,
- The **name of the presiding officer**, and
- Any **other information** the Superintendent deems appropriate.

This ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to prepare adequately.

---

### **Cancellation of an Inquiry**

An inquiry may be **cancelled** if:
- The application is withdrawn, or  
- The objection is withdrawn (or, if multiple objections exist, **all objections are withdrawn**).

Upon cancellation:
- The Superintendent must **serve the parties** with a notice of cancellation, and  
- Publish the notice in the *Canada Gazette* (as per paragraph 3(1)(a)).

This provides formal closure and prevents unnecessary proceedings.

### **Service of Documents**

Documents required under these rules may be served in one of the following ways:
1. **Personal delivery** to the recipient,
2. **Registered or certified mail** to the recipient’s address for service, or  
3. **Last known or usual address** if no current address is available,
4. **Other methods** as specified by the presiding officer.

> **Address for Service**:
> - For an **applicant**: the address provided in the application.
> - For an **objection**: the address provided in the objection.

This ensures proper communication and legal notice to all parties.

### **Presiding Officer and Inquiry Conduct**

- The Superintendent may **appoint a person** (e.g., a legal or financial expert) to preside over the inquiry, in addition to or instead of the Superintendent themselves.
- The presiding officer has discretion to:
  - **Receive relevant information** during the inquiry,
  - **Refuse to receive information** that is not relevant to the inquiry.

This provides procedural flexibility while maintaining focus on material issues.

---

### **Submissions by Parties**

- A party (applicant or objector) may:
  - Submit **written submissions**,
  - Make **oral submissions** to the presiding officer during the inquiry.

This allows for structured and documented participation.

---

### **Attendance and Representation**

- A party may attend the inquiry **in person** or be **represented by legal counsel**.
- This ensures due process and fair representation, particularly for parties with complex legal or financial interests.

---

### **Order of Submissions at the Inquiry**

At the inquiry:
- The **objection must be presented first** by the objector,
- Then the **applicant may respond** with rebuttals or supporting arguments.

This procedural order ensures that the concerns raised against the application are heard and addressed before the applicant can defend itself.

---

### **Public Access and Transparency**

- The inquiry must be **open to the public** — anyone may attend.
- This promotes transparency, accountability, and public confidence in the regulatory process.

---

### **Public Access to Objections and Supporting Documents**

During a specific period:
- From the **day the notice of inquiry is published in the Canada Gazette** until the **Minister makes or declines to make a decision** under section 524 of the Bank Act,
- The public may:
  - **Examine** the objection,
  - **Request a copy** of any document submitted in support of or in opposition to the objection.

This period enables stakeholders (including the general public, media, and other interested parties) to review the evidence and arguments involved.

> **Where to Access**:
> - At the **Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Ottawa**, or  
> - During the inquiry, at the **location where the inquiry is held**.

This ensures accessibility and promotes transparency.

---

### **Distribution of Inquiry Findings**

After the inquiry concludes:
- The Superintendent shall **immediately send a copy of the report of findings** to all parties.
- The report is then made available to the public under **subsection 525(6) of the Bank Act**.

This ensures that all parties receive timely access to the inquiry’s conclusions and that the public is informed of the outcome.

---

### **Effective Date**

These rules came into force on **June 28, 1999**, ensuring they were operational in time to support the regulatory review process for foreign bank authorizations during that period.

---

### **Key Objectives and Significance**

These rules serve several critical functions:
1. **Transparency**: By requiring public notices, open hearings, and public access to documents, the rules ensure that decisions on foreign bank authorizations are made in a transparent and accountable manner.
2. **Due Process**: They provide clear procedures for objections, submissions, and representation, ensuring fairness to both applicants and objectors.
3. **Public Confidence**: Open access to inquiry materials and proceedings fosters trust in the financial regulatory system.
