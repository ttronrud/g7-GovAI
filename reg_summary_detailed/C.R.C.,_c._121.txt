**Detailed Summary of the Victoria International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
- **Title**: *Victoria International Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- These regulations are formally cited as the **Victoria International Airport Zoning Regulations**, and they establish zoning and height restrictions for lands surrounding Victoria International Airport on the Saanich Peninsula in British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **Victoria International Airport**, located on the Saanich Peninsula, British Columbia. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. For regulatory purposes, it is **deemed to be 43 feet above sea level**, regardless of actual elevation. This serves as a reference elevation for all height restrictions. |
| **Strip** | A designated landing area (runway or runway segment) prepared for aircraft takeoff and landing in a specific direction. The width varies by runway: <br> - **Runway 08–26**: 1,200 feet wide (including the runway) <br> - **Runways 02–20 and 13–31**: 1,000 feet wide (including the runway) |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the ends of a strip to provide safe approach zones for aircraft. Dimensions vary by runway: <br> - **Runway 08–26**: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 600 feet on each side at the strip ends <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 2,000 feet on each side at outer ends (200 feet above strip elevation), measured horizontally 10,000 feet from the strip ends <br> - **Runways 13–31 and 20**: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 500 feet on each side at strip ends <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 1,250 feet on each side at outer ends (250 feet above strip elevation), measured 10,000 feet from strip ends <br> - **Runway 02**: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 500 feet on each side at strip end <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;• 500 feet on each side at outer end (500 feet above strip elevation), measured 10,000 feet from strip end |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane centered on and located **150 feet above the assigned elevation of the airport reference point (ARP)**. This forms the upper boundary of the area where structures may not exceed in height. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane that extends upward and outward from the outer lateral limits of the strip and its approach surface, rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally), until it intersects the horizontal surface or another transitional surface. This ensures a smooth transition from the approach surface to the horizontal surface. |

> **Note**: All surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft safety during takeoff and landing by providing clear zones free of obstructions.

### **3. Applicability of the Regulations**

- Applies to **all lands**, including **public road allowances**, located **adjacent to or in the vicinity of Victoria International Airport**.
- The specific lands affected are **more particularly described in Part II of the Schedule**.
- The regulation's jurisdiction covers **all parcels and tracts of land** situated on the Saanich Peninsula, including:
  - Whole sections in various ranges and townships (e.g., Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, etc., across Ranges 1–4 East and West)
  - Specific lots and blocks (e.g., Lot 4, Block 18, Plan 1936; Lot 1, Plan 1237)
  - Waters: **Tsehum (Shoal) Harbour, Blue Heron Basin, All Bay, and Roberts Bay**

> These lands are bounded by the **horizontal surface** described in paragraph 5(a), which defines the outer limit of the regulated zone.

---

### **4. Exclusions from Regulation**

- Certain areas are **exempt** from these height restrictions. These are lands, waters, and roads **within the area bounded by** the following description:
  
  > *Commencing at the Northwesterly corner of Lot 13, Plan 2818… and proceeding through a series of directional boundaries… to the point of commencement.*

- This exclusion zone includes:
  - Areas near the **northwest edge of the airport** (adjacent to West Saanich Road, Mills Road, Henry Avenue, Beacon Avenue, Patricia Bay Highway, Ocean Avenue, Canora Road, Brickyard Road, etc.)
  - A defined polygonal area extending from Lot 13, Plan 2818 to the northeast corner of Lot 13, Plan 2818 — forming a **protected exclusion zone**.

> This exclusion ensures that certain residential or non-urban areas near the airport are not subject to the strict height controls, possibly due to lower risk or existing development.

---

### **5. Height Restrictions**

No person may:
- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object
- **Add any part** to an existing building, structure, or object  
on any land subject to these regulations  
**if the highest point of such structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces at the location of that point:

1. **The Horizontal Surface**  
   - Located 150 feet above the ARP (43 feet above sea level)  
   - Outer limit defined by a detailed, multi-leg boundary description in the schedule

2. **The Approach Surfaces**  
   - For each runway, defined with specific dimensions and elevation profiles:
     - **Runway 08–26**: 600 ft at ends, 2,000 ft at outer ends (200 ft above strip elevation)
     - **Runways 13–31 and 20**: 500 ft at ends, 1,250 ft at outer ends (250 ft above strip elevation)
     - **Runway 02**: 500 ft at ends, 500 ft at outer ends (500 ft above strip elevation)

3. **The Transitional Surfaces**  
   - Sloped at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot up per 7 feet out) from the outer lateral limits of the strip and approach surfaces  
   - Extends upward to meet the horizontal surface or other transitional surfaces

> These surfaces collectively form a **safety buffer zone** around the airport to prevent aircraft from encountering obstructions during critical flight phases.

### **6. Reference to Plans**

- All boundary descriptions are based on **Plan E.900**, dated **March 15, 1966**, which is:
  - On file with the **Department of Transport (Ottawa)**
  - Also available at the **Victoria Land Registry Office**
- The regulated area is shown in **coloured lines** on this plan
- All referenced land descriptions (lots, sections, roads, boundaries) are drawn to scale and referenced by **planning documents and cadastral plans** (e.g., Plans 5468, 6228, 6621, 9207, 1170, 16852, 1936, etc.)

> The plan serves as the **primary legal and spatial reference** for determining which land parcels are subject to the zoning rules.

---

### **7. Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of these regulations is **aircraft safety**. By limiting the height of structures and objects near the airport, the regulations:

- Prevent **visual obstructions** during takeoff and landing
- Ensure **clear flight paths** for aircraft
- Maintain **safety margins** during approach and departure phases
- Protect the **integrity of approach and transition zones**

These rules reflect a **proactive zoning approach** to aviation safety, especially in a region with high air traffic and proximity to residential areas.

---

### **8. Key Notes and Observations**

- **Historical Context**: The regulation was established in 1966 and has remained largely unchanged, indicating long-term stability in airport safety planning.
- **Revocation Note**: The term "Minister" appears in the text but is **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**, suggesting that ministerial authority over these regulations has been transferred or superseded.
- **Elevation Basis**: The ARP is **deemed** to be 43 feet above sea level — this simplifies calculations and avoids needing real-time topographic data.
- **Complex Boundaries**: The horizontal surface is defined by a **long, winding, multi-directional boundary** involving high-water marks, roads, and property lines — reflecting the complex topography and land ownership patterns in the area.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Compliance**

- The regulations apply to **all landowners and developers** within the defined zones.
- Violations could result in **fines, construction orders, or removal of structures**.
- Compliance is enforced through **local zoning authorities** and the **Ministry of Transportation** (or successor body).
- Land use planning and development applications must include **height compliance assessments** against the defined surfaces.

The **Victoria International Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, technically detailed
