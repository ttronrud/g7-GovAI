**Detailed Summary of the Eligible Financial Contract General Rules (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act)**

---

### **Regulatory Background and Authority**

The *Eligible Financial Contract General Rules* (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act) were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Industry**, under **section 209a of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA)**. This provision empowers the federal government to establish rules defining what constitutes an “eligible financial contract” for the purposes of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings.

These rules are critical in determining which financial obligations are protected or recognized under the BIA, particularly in the context of **asset protection, creditor rights, and the ability of a debtor to retain or transfer financial contracts during insolvency**.

The rules are codified under:
- **S.C. 1997, c. 12, s. 112** (Statutes of Canada, 1997)
- **R.S., c. B-3; S.C. 1992, c. 27, s. 2** (Relevant provisions of the BIA)

They came into force on the date that **subsection 91(2) of the Budget Implementation Act, 2007, chapter 29 of the Statutes of Canada, 2007** came into effect — which was **November 17, 2007** (as noted in the footnote). This implementation date ensures alignment with broader fiscal and regulatory reforms.

### **Key Definitions**

#### 1. **Derivatives Agreement**
A *derivatives agreement* is defined broadly as any financial contract whose obligations are derived from, referenced to, or based on one or more underlying reference items. These include:
- Interest rates
- Financial indices (e.g., S&P 500)
- Currencies
- Commodities (e.g., oil, gold)
- Securities or ownership interests
- Credit or guarantee obligations
- Debt securities
- Climatic variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall)
- Bandwidth or freight rates
- Emission rights
- Inflation or macroeconomic data

**Examples of derivative instruments included:**
- **Contracts for differences (CFDs)** – agreements where parties agree to exchange the difference in value between two points in time.
- **Swaps** – including:
  - Total return swaps
  - Price return swaps
  - Default swaps
  - Basis swaps
- **Futures agreements**
- **Caps, collars, floors, and spreads** – instruments that limit exposure to interest rate or currency fluctuations
- **Options** – rights to buy or sell an asset at a specified price
- **Spot or forward contracts** – agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price

> *Note:* The definition covers both **settlement by payment** and **delivery** of underlying assets.

#### 2. **Financial Intermediary**
A *financial intermediary* is defined as:
- A **clearing agency** (e.g., a central clearing house that facilitates settlement of trades), or
- A person (such as a **broker, bank, or trust company**) that, in the ordinary course of business, maintains **securities accounts or futures accounts for others**.

This definition is crucial because it determines which institutions may be involved in transactions that are eligible for protection under bankruptcy laws — especially in relation to margin loans and clearing activities.

### **Eligible Financial Contracts (Under Section 2 of the BIA)**

The rules specify the types of financial agreements that qualify as **"eligible financial contracts"** — meaning they are treated as having a special status in insolvency proceedings. These are protected in certain circumstances and may not be automatically subject to distribution to creditors.

The following types of agreements are designated as eligible:

#### **(a) Derivatives Agreements**
- Must trade on a **futures or options exchange**, or on a **regulated market** (e.g., a recognized exchange or over-the-counter market with oversight).
- Or must be part of **recurrent dealings** in derivatives or over-the-counter (OTC) markets (i.e., actively traded or frequently executed).

> *Purpose:* Ensures that standardized, market-traded derivatives are protected from arbitrary seizure or liquidation during insolvency.

#### **(b) Agreements to Borrow or Lend Securities or Commodities**
- Includes agreements to transfer securities or commodities where the borrower can repay using:
  - Other securities
  - Commodities
  - Cash or cash equivalents

> *Example:* A borrower may pledge shares to secure a loan and repay with other shares or cash.

#### **(c) Clearing or Settlement Agreements**
- Agreements to:
  - Clear or settle securities, futures, options, or derivatives transactions
  - Act as a **depository** for securities (e.g., holding assets on behalf of clients)

> *Purpose:* Protects the integrity of settlement systems and ensures continuity in financial operations during insolvency.

#### **(d) Repurchase, Reverse Repurchase, or Buy-Sellback Agreements**
- Agreements involving the temporary transfer of securities or commodities with a commitment to repurchase at a later date (common in repo markets).

> *Example:* A repo transaction where a party lends securities and receives cash, with an agreement to return the securities later.

#### **(e) Margin Loans (Specifically)**
- Only applies when the loan is made **in respect of a securities account or futures account** maintained by a **financial intermediary**.

> *Note:* This limitation ensures that margin loans tied to personal or non-intermediary accounts are not automatically protected — only those involving institutional or professional accounts.

#### **(f) Master Agreements**
- A **master agreement** is eligible if it governs:
  - Any of the agreements listed in (a) through (e)
  - Or a **master agreement** that governs one of the above agreements

> *Purpose:* Provides protection to overarching contracts (e.g., master netting agreements) that govern multiple derivative transactions, allowing for more efficient and predictable insolvency treatment.

#### **(g) Guarantees, Indemnities, or Reimbursement Obligations**
- A guarantee, indemnity, or reimbursement obligation related to liabilities under any of the agreements listed in (a) through (h) is eligible.

> *Example:* A parent company guarantees a subsidiary’s derivative obligations — such a guarantee is protected if the underlying contract is eligible.

#### **(h) Agreements Relating to Financial Collateral**
- Includes:
  - Any form of **security or security interest** in collateral
  - A **title transfer credit support agreement** (e.g., a contract that allows a party to transfer ownership of collateral to support a financial obligation)

> *Purpose:* Ensures that collateral arrangements are preserved and respected during insolvency to maintain financial stability.

### **Key Implications and Objectives**

1. **Protection of Financial Markets**  
   The rules aim to preserve the **functionality and stability of financial markets** during insolvency. By protecting derivatives and other complex financial instruments, the rules prevent disruptions that could cascade through interdependent financial systems.

2. **Continuity of Transactions**  
   By recognizing eligible financial contracts, the rules allow for **continued settlement and performance** of obligations even during bankruptcy, reducing the risk of default or market panic.

3. **Clarity in Insolvency Proceedings**  
   The detailed definitions and categories provide **legal certainty** for debtors, creditors, and financial institutions about which contracts are eligible for protection or treatment under the BIA.

4. **Alignment with International Standards**  
   The rules reflect global best practices in financial regulation and insolvency law, particularly in how derivatives and over-the-counter instruments are treated.

5. **Role of Financial Intermediaries**  
   The definition of financial intermediaries ensures that institutions that facilitate market activity (e.g., brokers, clearing houses) are recognized as key players in the financial ecosystem and are entitled to certain protections when managing client accounts.

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The rules **do not apply to all financial instruments**. Only those meeting the specific criteria (e.g., trading on regulated markets, recurrent dealings, or involving financial intermediaries) qualify.
- **Personal or non-professional margin loans** (not involving a financial intermediary) are excluded from protection.
- **Non-traded or infrequently executed agreements** (e.g., one-off private arrangements) are not considered eligible.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Eligible Financial Contract General Rules* under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act establish a comprehensive and market-responsive framework for identifying and protecting financial contracts during insolvency proceedings. By clearly defining what constitutes an "eligible financial contract," the rules:

- Support the stability of financial markets
- Facilitate orderly insolvency processes
- Provide legal clarity for stakeholders
- Ensure that critical financial instruments — especially derivatives and interbank agreements — are not disrupted or unfairly liquidated

These rules are foundational in modern insolvency law, particularly in an era of increasingly complex financial products and global trading networks.
