**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order Declaring that the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations Do Not Apply in Quebec**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation is a formal legal instrument issued by the **Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**, under the authority of **section 4.2(1)a of the Fisheries Act**. It serves to **declare that the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations (WSER)** — a federal regulation governing the discharge of wastewater into water bodies — **do not apply in the province of Quebec**.

The regulation is rooted in two key developments:

1. **Proposed Order (March 21, 2015)**  
   On March 21, 2015, the Minister of the Environment published a proposed order in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, declaring that the WSER would not apply in Quebec. This proposal was accompanied by a public comment period, allowing stakeholders (e.g., municipalities, environmental groups, industry) to submit feedback. The public input helped inform the final decision.

2. **Agreement Between Federal and Provincial Governments (August 23, 2018)**  
   On August 23, 2018, the **Minister of the Environment** and the **Government of Quebec** entered into an agreement under **section 4.1a of the Fisheries Act**. This agreement confirmed that **Quebec already has laws and regulations in place** that are **functionally equivalent** to the federal Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations. In other words, Quebec’s environmental laws provide the same level of protection and regulatory oversight for wastewater discharges as the federal regulations.

This equivalence means that the federal regulations are **not needed** in Quebec for wastewater systems, as the provincial framework already ensures compliance with environmental standards.

### **Legal Authority**

- The regulation is made under **subsection 4.2(1)a of the Fisheries Act** (S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 134; R.S., c. F-14; SOR/2012-139).  
- This provision allows the federal government to **exclude certain federal regulations from applying in a province** if there are **equivalent provincial laws** in place, and such equivalence has been formally recognized through agreement.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

#### **1. Scope of Non-Application**
The Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations **do not apply in Quebec** in the following circumstances:

- **For municipal wastewater systems** that:
  - Would otherwise be subject to the WSER, **and**
  - Are governed by the **Environment Quality Act (CQLR c. Q-2)** and the **Regulation respecting municipal wastewater treatment works (CQLR c. Q-2, r. 34.1)**.

> This means that in Quebec, municipal wastewater treatment facilities are regulated under provincial law — not federal law — and are therefore exempt from the federal WSER.

- **For wastewater systems owned or operated by the Government of Quebec**:
  - Where an **authorization** is issued or amended **on or after the date the Accord Canada–Québec relatif aux lois et règlements applicables aux ouvrages municipaux et provinciaux d’assainissement des eaux usées au Québec comes into force**.

> The Accord (agreement) between Canada and Quebec, which came into force on a specific date (not explicitly stated in the text), establishes that Quebec’s provincial regulations now meet the federal standard. Any government-issued wastewater authorization issued after that date is exempt from the federal regulations.

#### **2. Exemption from Section 36(3) of the Fisheries Act**
- **Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act** normally applies to **any deposit of effluent** from a wastewater system’s final discharge point, and would require a permit or restriction if the effluent would otherwise be regulated under the WSER.
- This regulation **exempts such deposits** from that requirement **if** the wastewater system falls under the scope of the above exemptions (i.e., it is regulated under Quebec’s Environment Quality Act and related regulations).

> This ensures that wastewater discharges from qualifying systems in Quebec are not subject to federal restrictions under the Fisheries Act, due to the presence of equivalent provincial regulation.

---

### **Definitions (for clarity)**

For the purposes of this Order:
- **Effluent** = as defined in section 1 of the Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations.
- **Final discharge point** = as defined in section 1 of the WSER.
- **Wastewater system** = as defined in section 1 of the WSER.

These definitions ensure consistency with the federal regulations, even though the WSER itself does not apply in Quebec.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** in the Canada Gazette (i.e., the date of official publication).

> This ensures immediate legal effect upon registration, without delay.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Provincial Regulatory Autonomy**  
   This Order recognizes Quebec’s ability to manage its own wastewater regulations, reinforcing **provincial jurisdiction** in environmental matters and promoting **cooperative federal-provincial governance**.

2. **Environmental Protection Continuity**  
   Despite the non-application of federal regulations, the agreement confirms that **equivalent environmental protections** are in place. This ensures that water quality and public health are not compromised.

3. **Simplification of Compliance**  
   Municipalities and government entities in Quebec no longer need to comply with the federal WSER, reducing administrative burden and costs.

4. **Legal Precedent**  
   This is a landmark example of how federal and provincial governments can resolve regulatory overlaps through formal agreements under the Fisheries Act, setting a precedent for similar arrangements in other areas (e.g., air quality, land use).

5. **Alignment with Quebec’s Environmental Framework**  
   The exemption is based on Quebec’s comprehensive environmental legislation, including:
   - The *Environment Quality Act* (CQLR c. Q-2)
   - The *Regulation respecting municipal wastewater treatment works* (CQLR c. Q-2, r. 34.1)

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally **exempts Quebec from the federal Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations** due to the existence of **functionally equivalent provincial laws**. It is grounded in a **federal-provincial agreement** and supported by a public consultation process. The exemption applies to both municipal and government-owned wastewater systems, and it removes the need for federal oversight under section 36(3) of the Fisheries Act for qualifying discharges. The Order ensures that environmental protection is maintained through Quebec’s robust provincial regulatory framework, while promoting efficiency and cooperation between levels of government.

**Key Takeaway**:  
> *Quebec is now fully self-regulated for wastewater discharges under its own laws, which are deemed equivalent to the federal Wastewater Systems Effluent Regulations — a result of a formal agreement between Canada and Quebec.*
