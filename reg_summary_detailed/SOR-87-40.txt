### ✅ **Broiler Hatching Eggs and Chicks** produced for chicken production.

#### **Marketing Coverage**:
| Type | Scope |
|------|-------|
| **Signatory Provinces** (Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, BC, Saskatchewan, Alberta) | Broiler hatching eggs and chicks produced **within** these provinces and marketed in **interprovincial or export trade** |
| **Non-Signatory Provinces** (NS, NB, PEI, NL, Yukon, NWT, Nunavut) | Broiler hatching eggs and chicks produced **within** these provinces and **shipped into** signatory provinces for **interprovincial trade only** (not for export) |

---

## **6. Quota Systems (Core Regulatory Tool)**

CHEP may establish **quota systems** to control the volume of broiler hatching eggs and chicks marketed in interprovincial or export trade.

### **A. Quota System for Signatory Provinces**
- CHEP allocates quotas to **producers** in signatory provinces.
- Quotas are set such that:
  - The **total number of broiler hatching eggs** authorized for marketing (via quotas and intraprovincial sales) **plus** anticipated non-quota sales
  - **Equals the total number** of eggs set out in a provincial table (attached in the schedule).
- **No increase or decrease** in total marketing volume (quota + non-quota) is allowed unless the Agency follows the **allocation system** in **Schedule B** of the *Federal-Provincial Agreement* (P.C. 1986-2653).

### **B. Quota System for Non-Signatory Provinces**
- CHEP allocates quotas to individuals in non-signatory provinces who market eggs into signatory provinces (interprovincial only).
- The total number of eggs authorized under quotas **must not exceed** the number set in the provincial table.
- **Proportional Adjustment Rule**:
  - If CHEP increases or decreases the **total number of chicks** allowed to be marketed from a non-signatory province, it must do so by:
    - The **same percentage** as the change in broiler hatching eggs for that province, **or**
    - The **average percentage** change across all provinces in the area (if multiple provinces are involved)

> 📌 This ensures that quota changes in chicks are **proportionally aligned** with changes in egg production, preventing market distortion.

---

## **7. Licensing System**

CHEP may establish a **licensing system** for persons involved in marketing broiler hatching eggs or chicks.

### **Scope**:
- **Signatory Provinces**: Licensing applies to marketing **in interprovincial or export trade**
- **Non-Signatory Provinces**: Licensing applies to marketing **into signatory provinces** (interprovincial only, not export)

### **Licensing Requirements**:
- Must include:
  - Compliance with CHEP orders, regulations, and the National Farm Products Marketing Council’s rules
  - Mandatory **collection and reporting of marketing data**
  - Conditions for **suspension or cancellation** of licences
- CHEP determines:
  - Criteria for granting, refusing, or renewing licences
  - Fees associated with each licence or class of licence

## **8. Levies and Charges**

CHEP may impose **levies or charges** on marketers of broiler hatching eggs.

### **Types of Charges**:
| Charge Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **General Levies** | Imposed on all marketers to cover **administrative and marketing costs** of the agency. Levels are set to ensure sufficient funding for annual operations. |
| **Excess Quota Charges** | Imposed on marketers who sell **more than their authorized quota**. This is a penalty for over-marketing. |

> 💡 The levies are designed to:
> - Fund agency operations (e.g., administration, pricing, compliance)
> - Prevent over-supply and market instability
> - Ensure financial sustainability

> 📝 CHEP may create **reserves** and account for **essential expenses** when estimating costs.

- Applies to:
  - Any **variety, class, or grade** of broiler hatching eggs
  - In **signatory provinces**, for marketing in **interprovincial or export trade**

> 🔍 This gives CHEP significant control over market prices to stabilize supply and prevent price volatility.

---

## **10. Prohibitions and Limitations**

  - Increase or decrease the **total number of broiler hatching eggs** authorized for marketing (quota + non-quota) beyond the levels set in the provincial tables **unless** it follows the allocation rules in Schedule B of the Federal-Provincial Agreement.
