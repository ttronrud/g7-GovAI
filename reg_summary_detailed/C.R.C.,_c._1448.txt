**Detailed Summary of the Minor Waters Order**

---

**Order Title:**  
*Minor Waters Order*

**Purpose:**  
This regulation designates specific sheltered waters along the coastlines of Canada as "minor waters" under federal jurisdiction. The designation is primarily intended to establish legal boundaries for the application of federal maritime regulations, particularly those related to navigation, safety, environmental protection, and the administration of marine activities. These waters are considered "minor" in size and significance compared to major harbors or inland seas, and thus fall under the regulatory authority of the federal government, specifically the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) or the Canadian Coast Guard.

### **Geographic Scope and Designated Minor Waters by Province/Territory**

#### **1. British Columbia**
The following waters are designated as minor waters:
- **Alberni Inlet** and the **eastern channel of Barclay Sound**, extending westward to **Bamfield Inlet**.
- **Quatsino Sound** and all connected waters, extending westward to **Koprino Harbour**.
- **False Creek, Vancouver**, specifically **east of the Burrard Bridge**.
- **Jervis Inlet**, bounded by a line connecting **Thunder Point** to **Ball Point**, including all connected waters **not seaward of Fox Island** in Telescope Passage. This includes:
  - The **Agamemnon Channel**
  - **Pender Harbour**, bounded by a line from **Fearney Point** to **Moore Point**
- **Prince Rupert Harbour**, extending **south to Charles Point**.

> *Note:* These areas are typically small, sheltered inlets or estuaries that are important for local maritime activity but not large enough to qualify as major ports.

#### **2. New Brunswick**
The following areas are designated:
- **Saint John Harbour**:
  - Within the **southern breakwater**
  - Bounded by a line from the **southern extremity of the northern breakwater** to the **most easterly point of Partridge Island**
- **Shediac Harbour**:
  - West of a line drawn from **Pointe du Chêne** to **Caissie Point**
- **Miramichi Bay**:
  - West of a line from the **eastern shore of Neguac Beach** to the **eastern shores of Portage and Fox Islands**, then continuing to the **western point of Preston Beach**
- **Nepisiquit Bay**:
  - Bounded by a line between **Alston Point** and **Carron Point**
- **Dalhousie Harbour and the Restigouche River**:
  - West of a line extending from **Maguacha Point (Quebec)** to the **mouth of the Charlo River**
- **Shippigan Sound**:
  - Within the **breakwater at Shippigan Gulley**
  - South of a line from **Grasse Point** to **Pokesudi Point**
- **Miscou Harbour**:
  - East of a line from **Herring Point** to **Mya Point**
- **Passamoquoddy Bay**:
  - Extends as far as **Campobello Island**
  - Bounded at the northern entrance by a line between **east Quoddy Head** and **Deadman Head**

> *Note:* These waters are often tidal inlets or bays with limited commercial significance, used primarily for fishing, local boating, and small-scale maritime operations.

#### **3. Newfoundland**
- **Humber Arm**:
  - East of a line drawn from **Frenchman’s Head triangulation station** to **McIver’s Point triangulation station**

> *Note:* Humber Arm is a sheltered arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, used for local fishing and small vessel traffic.

---

#### **4. Nova Scotia**
- **Bras d’Or Lake**, including **Great Bras d’Or** and all connected waters:
  - Bounded by a line joining **Carey Point** and **Noir Point**
  - Extending **northward of the seaward end of St. Peters Canal**
- **Annapolis Basin and Digby Gut**:
  - Bounded by a line from **Prim Point lighthouse** to **Victoria Beach** (entrance to Digby Gut)
- **Halifax Harbour** and its connected waters:
  - Bounded by a line joining:
    - The **triangulation station on Osborne Head**
    - The **eastern extremity of Chebucto Head**

> *Note:* Although Halifax Harbour is a major port, the regulation specifically defines the "minor waters" component within it, likely for administrative or regulatory clarity in applying federal rules.

---

#### **5. Northwest Territories**
- **Kugmallit Bay**:
  - South of a line drawn from the **northern tip of the peninsula adjacent to Kidluit Bay** to **Toker Point**

> *Note:* This is a remote, northern inlet with limited access and low maritime traffic, typical of minor waters in Arctic regions.

---

#### **6. Prince Edward Island**
- **Charlottetown Harbour**:
  - Bounded by **Canseaux Point** and **Battery Point**
- **Summerside Harbour**:
  - Bounded by a line from **Phelan Point** to the **Indian Head Breakwater**
- **Cardigan Bay**:
  - Bounded by a line from **Panmure Head** to **Red Point**

> *Note:* These are local harbors used by residents and small vessels, with minimal commercial traffic.

### **Key Legal and Regulatory Implications**

1. **Jurisdictional Assignment**:
   - The designation of these waters as "minor waters" places them under **federal jurisdiction**, meaning that federal laws (e.g., *Marine Safety Act*, *Fisheries Act*, *Navigation Acts*, or *Marine Protection, Pollution and Biodiversity Act*) apply.
   - This ensures consistent enforcement of safety, environmental, and navigational standards across Canada.

2. **Exemption from Provincial Control**:
   - While provinces may have local regulations, federal control over minor waters prevents inconsistent or overlapping rules and ensures national standards are applied uniformly.

3. **Navigation and Safety**:
   - These waters are subject to federal navigation rules, including marking, depth charts, and vessel traffic management.
   - The inclusion of specific boundaries (e.g., triangulation stations, points, and lines) ensures precise enforcement and reduces ambiguity.

4. **Environmental Protection**:
   - Minor waters may be subject to federal environmental regulations, especially if they contain sensitive habitats or are near protected species.

5. **Marine Planning and Development**:
   - The designation supports federal oversight in matters such as dredging, construction, or marine infrastructure projects in these areas.

6. **Legal Citation**:
   - The Order may be cited as the *Minor Waters Order*, and it is typically published in the *Canada Gazette* and incorporated into federal regulatory frameworks.

### **Conclusion**

The *Minor Waters Order* serves as a foundational legal instrument that clearly defines and categorizes specific sheltered coastal waters across Canada as "minor waters." These designations are essential for the federal government to maintain consistent, safe, and environmentally responsible maritime governance in areas of limited scale and traffic. By specifying exact geographic boundaries using natural landmarks, triangulation points, and directional lines, the Order provides clarity and precision in regulatory application, ensuring that federal authority is appropriately exercised in coastal and estuarine environments.

This regulation reflects a balance between administrative efficiency and environmental stewardship, allowing for effective federal oversight without overburdening small, local maritime communities.
