Certainly. Below is a **detailed and clear summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

#### **1. Background and Context**
This regulation pertains to the **continuation of a list of entities designated as "listed entities"** under the *Criminal Code of Canada* (specifically, *Criminal Code*, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46). The list was originally established on **July 23, 2002**, under **subsection 83.05(1)b** of the Criminal Code, which empowers the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to create and maintain a list of entities involved in terrorist activities.

- The original list was established in **2002** (as per SOR/2002-284).
- As of **July 23, 2014**, **12 years** had passed since the initial establishment of the list, prompting a review to assess whether the entities on the list still posed a continuing threat.

---

#### **2. Legal Basis for the Review and Continuation**
The regulation is grounded in **subsection 83.05(9)d** of the *Criminal Code*, which grants the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness the authority to:
- Review the list of entities as it existed on a specified date (in this case, **July 23, 2014**);
- Determine whether there are **reasonable grounds to believe** that each entity on the list:
  - Has **knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in, or facilitated** a terrorist activity;
  - Or is **knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or in association with** such an entity.

This provision allows the government to maintain the list even after the initial designation period, provided that ongoing threats or suspicious activities justify continued designation.

---

#### **3. Findings of the Minister**
Following a comprehensive review of the list as of **July 23, 2014**, the Minister concluded that:
- There are **still reasonable grounds to believe** that **each entity** listed on that date:
  - Is involved in or has been involved in **terrorist activities**;
  - Or is currently **acting in association with** or **on behalf of** a known terrorist entity.

This determination reflects the government’s assessment that the threat posed by these entities has not diminished and remains credible and relevant.

---

#### **4. Official Action and Legal Effect**
Based on the Minister’s findings:
- **His Excellency the Governor General in Council** (i.e., the federal government acting on ministerial advice) has formally **accepted and affirmed** that:
  > Each entity listed as of July 23, 2014, **remains a "listed entity"** under the *Criminal Code*.

This means the legal status of the entities on the list is **continued and not terminated**, even though 12 years have passed since the list was first created.

---

#### **5. Key Legal and Policy Implications**
- **Continuity of Designation**: The regulation ensures that entities identified as terrorist-related in 2014 are not automatically removed from the list after a period of time. The designation is **not time-limited**—it remains valid as long as the Minister maintains reasonable grounds to believe the entity remains a threat.
- **Ongoing Threat Assessment**: The government maintains a dynamic, risk-based approach to counter-terrorism, where designation is not static but depends on current evidence and intelligence.
- **Legal Authority**: The power to maintain the list is rooted in the *Criminal Code*, particularly subsection 83.05(9)d, which allows for periodic review and continuation based on reasonable suspicion.
- **Public Safety Objective**: The ultimate purpose is to **protect national security** by enabling law enforcement and judicial authorities to take appropriate actions against entities linked to terrorism.

---

#### **6. Relevant Statutory Provisions**
- **SOR/2002-284** – Original regulatory instrument establishing the list.
- **S.C. 2005, c. 10, subpar. 34(1)(f)(iii)** – Clarifies the scope of entities subject to listing.
- **R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Criminal Code), section 83.05(1)b and (9)d** – Provides the legal framework for listing and continuation of entities.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally **extends and confirms the status of a list of terrorist-related entities** that were designated on July 23, 2014. It reflects the Canadian government’s ongoing commitment to counter-terrorism by maintaining legal designations based on **current, reasonable grounds** of suspicion. The decision underscores that the threat posed by these entities has not been resolved and remains a legitimate concern under Canadian law.

It is a **continuation of a prior designation**, not a new listing, and operates under the authority of the *Criminal Code* to ensure that terrorist-related entities are not removed from legal scrutiny simply due to the passage of time.

This summary is consistent with the principles of **security, accountability, and proportionality** in Canadian counter-terrorism policy.
