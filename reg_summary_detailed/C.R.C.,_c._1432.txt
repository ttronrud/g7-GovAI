It appears that you've started a request to provide a detailed summary of a regulation, but no specific regulation has been included in your message. Could you please provide the text or reference of the regulation you'd like summarized?

Once I have the regulation (e.g., a statute, rule, policy, or legal document), I will offer a comprehensive, clear, and structured summary covering key provisions, objectives, scope, applicable parties, enforcement mechanisms, and any notable implications or exceptions. 

Please paste the regulation or its full text so I can assist you effectively.
