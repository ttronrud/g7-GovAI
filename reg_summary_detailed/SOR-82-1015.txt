**Detailed Summary of C.T.C. 1982-8 RAIL – Railway Prevention of Electric Sparks Regulations**

---

### **Overview**

On **November 16, 1982**, the **Canadian Transport Commission (CTC)**, acting under **Section 46 of the National Transportation Act** and **Section 227 of the Railway Act**, revoked the outdated *Electric Sparks Prevention Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1181*, and introduced the new **Railway Prevention of Electric Sparks Regulations** (hereinafter referred to as the *Regulations*). These regulations were enacted to **prevent the occurrence of electric sparks** during the transfer of **flammable liquids or compressed flammable gases** between railway rolling stock and stationary bulk storage facilities — a process that poses a significant fire and explosion hazard.

The primary objective is to **eliminate ignition sources** (specifically electric sparks) that could ignite flammable vapours or gases, thereby enhancing safety in railway operations involving hazardous materials.

### **Key Definitions**

To ensure clarity and consistency, the Regulations define several key terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Cathodic Protection** | A technique used to prevent metal corrosion by making the metal surface the cathode in an electrochemical cell. This is critical when tanks are protected against corrosion, but grounding must not interfere with this process. |
| **Compressed Flammable Gas** | Any product, material, or mixture that meets *any one* of the following criteria:<br> - Critical temperature < 50°C<br> - Absolute vapour pressure > 295 kPa at 50°C<br> - Absolute pressure > 275 kPa at 21.1°C or > 716 kPa at 54.4°C<br> AND is flammable when mixed with air at normal atmospheric conditions (13% or less by volume) or has a flammable range wider than 12% (regardless of lower limit). |
| **Flammable Range** | The difference between the minimum and maximum volume percentages of a substance in air that form a flammable mixture. A wider range increases the risk of ignition. |
| **Flammable Liquid** | Any liquid that emits flammable vapours at or below 61°C in a closed cup test (a standard test for volatility). |
| **Railway Company** | Any railway company operating under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transport Commission. |

### **Core Prohibition**

> **General Rule:**  
> *Except as permitted under these Regulations*, **no railway company may transfer flammable liquids or compressed flammable gases** between a unit of railway rolling stock and a stationary bulk storage facility.

This establishes a **default ban** on such transfers unless specific, stringent safety conditions are met.

---

### **Permitted Transfers – Conditions**

A railway company may conduct a transfer **only if** the following conditions are fully satisfied **before** the transfer begins:

#### **1. Permanent Electrical Connection Between Track and Piping System**
- A **permanent electrical connection** must be established between:
  - The section of railway track where the rolling stock is standing, and
  - The piping system used for transfer.
- The connection must consist of **at least two wires**, each made of:
  - Flexible copper or another **corrosion-resistant material**.
- The **resistance per kilometer** of the connection must be **≤ 1.33 ohms/km**.

> *Purpose:* Ensures that any potential electrical potential difference between the track and the piping system is safely dissipated, preventing spark formation due to static buildup.

#### **2. Bonding of Rail Joints**
- The section of track must be **bonded at each rail joint**.
- The two rails of the section must be **cross-bonded in at least two locations**.
- Bonding ensures continuity of electrical contact between rails, minimizing voltage differences.

#### **3. Grounding of the Track**
- The bonded track section must be grounded using **at least two ground rods** that meet the following specifications:
  - Length: **≥ 2.5 meters**
  - Diameter: **≥ 15.8 mm**
  - Connected together and to the track via **two wires per connection point**.
- Each wire must have a **resistance ≤ 1.33 ohms/km** between the connection point and the track.

> *Purpose:* Provides a safe path for stray electrical currents to flow into the earth, preventing static charge accumulation.

#### **4. Grounding of Non-Current-Carrying Piping Components**
- All **non-current-carrying parts** of the piping system (e.g., tanks, pumps, stands) must be **properly grounded**.
- This includes ensuring that all metal components that are not actively conducting current are electrically connected to ground.

> *Purpose:* Prevents static charge buildup in tanks or equipment that could discharge as sparks during transfer.

#### **5. Installation of Insulated Rail Joints**
- **Insulated rail joints** must be installed to **electrically isolate** the section of track where the rolling stock is standing from all other railway tracks.
- These joints prevent stray currents from flowing between different sections of track, which could otherwise generate sparks.

> *Note:* These joints must **not be bridged** by any rolling stock or other object during transfer operations.

> *Purpose:* Eliminates the risk of electrical continuity between the rolling stock and other parts of the network, which could create spark hazards.

---

### **Flexibility Clause – Where Grounding is Difficult**

> If **local conditions** make full compliance with the grounding requirements impractical, the railway company must take **additional measures** to ensure safety, including:
- Installing **insulated joints in the piping system**,
- Adding **extra ground rods**,
- Providing **additional bonds** between the piping system and the rolling stock.

> *Purpose:* Allows for practical implementation in challenging environments (e.g., rocky terrain, underground installations, or areas with poor soil conductivity).

---

### **Cathodic Protection Exception**

> If the **tanks** of a piping system are protected by **cathodic protection**, the grounding must be arranged in a way that **does not interfere** with the cathodic protection system.

> *Purpose:* Balances safety with technical requirements — prevents disruption of corrosion protection systems that are vital for tank longevity and integrity.

---

### **Proximity Restrictions – New Safety Zones**

> **No transfer may occur within:**
- **150 meters** of a **power transmission line** operating at **360 kV or higher**, or
- **75 meters** of a power transmission line operating at **230 kV to 359 kV**.

> *Rationale:* High-voltage transmission lines generate strong electromagnetic fields and may induce electrical currents in nearby metal structures (e.g., rails or piping), increasing the risk of static discharge or spark formation during transfers.

> *Note:* This restriction applies only to **newly constructed** storage facilities or transfer points. Existing facilities may be grandfathered in, but future developments must comply.

### **Key Safety Principles Underlying the Regulations**

1. **Spark Prevention**: The core principle is to **eliminate or neutralize any potential for electric sparks** that could ignite flammable vapours or gases.
2. **Electrical Continuity and Grounding**: By establishing a low-resistance, continuous path to ground, static charges are safely dissipated.
3. **Isolation**: Insulated joints prevent unintended electrical connections that could create spark risks.
4. **Site-Specific Flexibility**: Recognizes that not all locations are equally suitable for full compliance and allows for adaptive safety measures.
5. **Future-Proofing**: The proximity restrictions ensure that new infrastructure is built with modern safety standards in mind.

### **Significance and Impact**

- **Enhanced Safety**: Significantly reduces the risk of fire and explosion during hazardous material transfers, which are common in the oil and chemical industries.
- **Compliance with National Standards**: Aligns with international best practices for static electricity control in industrial settings.
- **Regulatory Clarity**: Replaces ambiguous or outdated rules with clear, enforceable technical standards.
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: The CTC has the authority to inspect compliance and impose penalties for violations.

### **Conclusion**

The *Railway Prevention of Electric Sparks Regulations, C.T.C. 1982-8 RAIL* represent a **comprehensive, technically sound, and safety-focused update** to Canada’s regulatory framework for handling flammable materials via rail. By mandating strict electrical bonding, grounding, and isolation measures — while allowing flexibility for difficult sites — the Regulations strike a balance between operational feasibility and public safety.

These rules remain a foundational element in the safe transportation of flammable liquids and gases in Canada and continue to influence modern railway safety protocols.
