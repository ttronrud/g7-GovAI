**Detailed Summary of the Perfluorinated Ion-Exchange Membranes Remission Order**

**Title:**  
Perfluorinated Ion-Exchange Membranes Remission Order

**Citation:**  
This Order may be cited as the *Perfluorinated Ion-Exchange Membranes Remission Order*.

**Purpose and Scope:**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to provide a formal remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of customs duties that were previously imposed on certain perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes. Specifically, the remission applies to:

- **Product Type:** Perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes  
- **Intended Use:** Membranes used in the production of chlorine or sodium hydroxide  
- **Time Period:** Imports that occurred between **January 1, 1979**, and **June 30, 1990**

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Remission of Customs Duties:**  
   All customs duties that were paid or that remain payable under the applicable provisions of the Customs Tariff for perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes used in chlorine or sodium hydroxide production are hereby remitted. This means that importers are no longer required to pay those duties, and any duties previously assessed are effectively waived.

2. **Eligible Imports:**  
   The remission applies only to perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes that were:
   - Imported into the United States during the specified period (January 1, 1979 – June 30, 1990)
   - Used specifically in the production of chlorine or sodium hydroxide (a major industrial chemical process, often conducted via the electrolysis of brine)

3. **Exclusion of Other Uses:**  
   The remission is limited to membranes used in chlorine or sodium hydroxide production. Membranes used for other industrial, commercial, or research purposes outside of this specific application are not covered by this order.

4. **Legal Authority:**  
   The order is issued under the authority of U.S. customs and trade regulations, likely under the authority of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or the U.S. Trade Representative, in accordance with provisions allowing for duty remissions in response to technological, economic, or environmental considerations—particularly in cases involving early adoption of specialized industrial materials.

5. **Historical Context:**  
   Perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes (such as those based on perfluorosulfonic acid, e.g., Nafion) were introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a significant technological advancement in the chlor-alkali industry. These membranes improved efficiency and reduced corrosion in electrolytic cells, enabling more sustainable and cost-effective chlorine and sodium hydroxide production. The remission may reflect recognition of the economic and industrial importance of these materials during a formative period of their adoption.

6. **Impact on Importers and Industry:**  
   This remission provides financial relief to companies that imported these membranes during the specified period, effectively reducing their historical cost of entry. It may also serve as a recognition of the role these materials played in advancing industrial processes and environmental performance (e.g., reduced energy use, lower emissions).

7. **No Retroactive Application Beyond the Period:**  
   The remission does not extend beyond June 30, 1990. Imports outside this timeframe are not eligible. Additionally, the order does not apply to future imports of such membranes, nor does it extend to other types of ion-exchange membranes (e.g., non-perfluorinated or those used in other applications).

**Conclusion:**  
The *Perfluorinated Ion-Exchange Membranes Remission Order* is a targeted, historical duty remission designed to correct or acknowledge the economic impact of early technological adoption in the chlor-alkali industry. It serves as a formal recognition of the importance of perfluorinated ion-exchange membranes in industrial processes and provides relief to importers who paid duties on these materials during a specific, defined period. The order reflects a policy of supporting innovation and industrial efficiency through targeted regulatory relief.

**Note:**  
This order is not a general waiver of tariffs or a policy change for future imports. It is a retroactive, time-bound relief measure for a specific class of goods under specific conditions.
