**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: *Locally Engaged Employees of the Canadian Embassy and Consulates in the United States Remission Order* (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11)**

---

### **1. Purpose and Authority**
This regulation establishes a tax remission (exemption or reduction) for certain Canadian citizens who work at Canadian diplomatic missions in the United States — specifically, the Embassy in Washington, D.C., and Consulates General in the U.S. — under specific conditions.

- **Governing Authority**:  
  The Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, has issued this Order under **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the government to make rules that are in the public interest, particularly in relation to tax administration and international obligations.

- **Public Interest Justification**:  
  The Order is justified as being in the public interest, likely to support Canada’s diplomatic workforce by reducing the tax burden on individuals who serve in government roles abroad, especially where there are tax treaty provisions that prevent double taxation.

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms used in the Order are clearly defined:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Income Tax Act* (ITA), which governs individual income taxation in Canada. |
| **Canada-US Tax Convention** | Refers to the *Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984*, which establishes rules to prevent double taxation and avoid tax avoidance between Canada and the U.S. Article XIX of this Convention is central to the remission. |
| **Embassy or Consulate** | Includes:  
- The Embassy of Canada in Washington, D.C., and  
- Any Consulate General of Canada located in the United States. |
| **Locally Engaged Employee** | An individual who meets **all three** of the following criteria during a taxation year:  
1. Is a **non-resident of Canada** (i.e., not a resident for tax purposes in Canada);  
2. Is a **Canadian citizen**;  
3. Is **paid by the Government of Canada** for services performed in a governmental capacity at an Embassy or Consulate. |

> *Note:* Unless otherwise stated, all terms used in this Order have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act.

### **3. Tax Remission Provisions**

#### **Eligibility and Amount of Remission**
For taxation years beginning **after 2016**, a *locally engaged employee* is entitled to a **remission of tax** under the Income Tax Act, provided that the remitted amount is the **lesser of two amounts**:

1. **The amount added to the employee’s tax payable under Part I of the Income Tax Act** due to **subsection 120(1)** of the Act (which applies to non-residents who are Canadian citizens and earn income in Canada).  
   - This is typically the "additional tax" imposed on non-resident Canadians earning income in Canada (e.g., from employment abroad), which is designed to ensure that such income is taxed in Canada.

2. **The amount of United States state-level income tax paid by the employee during the year** (if any).  
   - This recognizes that the employee may have already paid income tax at the state level in the U.S., and the remission helps avoid double taxation.

> **Key Point**: The remission is limited to the lesser of these two amounts — it does not cover the full Canadian tax liability or the full U.S. state tax paid.

---

#### **Conditions for Remission**
The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to strict conditions:

- The employee must **apply in writing** to the Minister of Finance **on or before the day two years after the filing due date** for the taxation year.  
  - Example: If the filing due date is April 30, the application must be submitted by April 30 of the year two years later.

- The application must be accompanied by **all required documentation** to verify:
  - The employee’s eligibility (e.g., citizenship, non-residency, employment at a Canadian Embassy/Consulate);
  - The amount of Canadian tax due under subsection 120(1);
  - The amount of U.S. state-level income tax paid.

> **Note**: The remission is **not available** if the amount has already been:
- Rebated,
- Remitted,
- Credited, or
- Refunded  
to any person under the Income Tax Act, the Financial Administration Act, or any other federal Act.

This ensures that the remission does not result in double benefits or create fiscal imbalances.

### **4. Scope and Effective Date**

- **Applicable Taxation Years**: Begins **after 2016** (i.e., 2017 and onwards).
- **Applicable Entities**: Only applies to employees working at Canadian Embassies and Consulates in the United States.
- **Effective Date**: The Order comes into force on the day it is made (i.e., when it is published in the Canada Gazette).

---

### **5. Key Rationale and Implications**

- **International Tax Treaty Compliance**:  
  The Order aligns with **Article XIX of the Canada–U.S. Tax Convention**, which generally allows for tax relief for non-resident Canadians who are employed in the U.S. by Canadian government entities. This ensures compliance with international tax agreements and prevents double taxation.

- **Support for Diplomatic Staff**:  
  Canadian diplomatic staff are often required to live and work in the U.S. for extended periods. This remission helps reduce their financial burden by offsetting the Canadian tax on income earned in the U.S. (or on income subject to Canadian tax due to citizenship and employment).

- **Prevention of Double Taxation**:  
  By allowing a remission of the Canadian tax that would otherwise be due on income taxed in the U.S., the regulation supports the principle of avoiding double taxation while respecting Canadian tax law.

- **Administrative Safeguards**:  
  The requirement for a written application and supporting documentation ensures that the remission is used appropriately and only when justified, preventing misuse or abuse of the benefit.

### **6. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **Does not apply to residents of Canada**: Only non-resident Canadian citizens are eligible.
- **Does not cover all types of income**: Only applies to remuneration that is taxable in Canada but not in the U.S. due to the tax treaty.
- **No refund of U.S. federal income tax**: The remission only covers **state-level** U.S. income tax, not federal tax.
- **No automatic entitlement**: Must be applied for and approved by the Minister.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation provides a targeted, fair, and internationally compliant tax relief mechanism for Canadian citizens who serve in government roles at Canadian diplomatic missions in the United States. It balances the need to maintain Canadian tax equity with the obligations under the Canada–U.S. Tax Convention and the principle of avoiding double taxation. By requiring formal application and documentation, it ensures accountability and transparency in its implementation.

It remains a key tool in supporting the operational and financial sustainability of Canada’s diplomatic workforce abroad.
