**Detailed Summary of the Goods Imported and Exported Drawback Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulations are officially titled:  
**"Goods Imported and Exported Drawback Regulations"**  
They may be cited as such and form a key component of Canada’s customs and trade policy framework related to the recovery of duties and taxes on exported goods.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of National Revenue** (MNRR), who is responsible for administering and enforcing the regulations. This includes authorizing payments of drawback claims and determining eligibility.

---

### **3. Eligibility for Drawback Payment**
Under these regulations, an **exporter or importer** may be entitled to a **drawback** — that is, a refund or credit — of **99% of the customs duty and excise taxes** paid on imported goods, **provided** the following conditions are met:

#### **Conditions for Entitlement to Drawback:**
The imported goods must:
- Be **exported** (i.e., physically sent out of Canada);
- **Not have been used in Canada** for any purpose other than:
  - The **exclusive development or production** of goods that are themselves to be exported;
  - As **plant equipment** (e.g., machinery or tools used in manufacturing);
  - Being **damaged prior to export**.

> **Note**: This means that if goods are used in Canada for any domestic purpose (e.g., for local consumption, manufacturing, or resale), they are not eligible for drawback. The only acceptable use is strictly for export-related production or as equipment, or if damaged before export.

### **4. Requirements for Filing a Drawback Claim**

A claim for drawback must meet the following requirements:

#### **(a) Form of Claim**
- Must be submitted in the **form prescribed by the Minister**.
- The Minister has the authority to specify the format, including forms, documentation, and submission procedures.

#### **(b) Waivers from Third Parties**
- The claimant must obtain **waivers** from any **other persons** (other than the claimant) who may also be entitled to a drawback under the regulations.
- This is to prevent **double recovery** or overlapping claims. For example, if a third party (e.g., a supplier or a co-owner) has a valid claim to the same goods, the claimant must secure their consent to avoid disputes or fraud.

#### **(c) Supporting Evidence**
- Must include **such other evidence as is satisfactory to the Minister**.
- This may include invoices, shipping documents, production records, export declarations, or other documentation proving:
  - The goods were imported and paid duty/excise taxes on;
  - The goods were exported;
  - The goods were not used in Canada for domestic purposes;
  - The goods were used exclusively for export development or production;
  - The goods were damaged prior to export (if applicable).

#### **(d) Filing Deadline**
- The claim must be **filed at a customs office within two years** of the **date of exportation** shown on the export entry.
- This two-year window is critical — failure to file within this period results in the claim being **barred**.

---

### **5. Conditions for Payment of Drawback**

No payment will be made **unless**:
- The **customs duty and excise taxes** on the imported goods were **actually paid**;
- The payment was made **within the three-year period immediately preceding the date of exportation**;
- The taxes have **not been refunded** (i.e., they are still in the government’s possession and not already returned).

> This ensures that the drawback is only available for taxes that were genuinely paid and are not already recovered or forfeited.

---

### **6. Key Policy Objectives**
These regulations serve several important purposes:
- **Incentivize export activity**: By allowing a refund of nearly all duties and excise taxes paid on goods that are exported, Canada encourages businesses to produce and export goods.
- **Prevent misuse**: The strict eligibility criteria (especially the "exclusive use" rule) prevent the use of imported goods for domestic consumption or profit.
- **Ensure accountability**: The requirement for waivers and supporting documentation ensures transparency and fairness in claims.
- **Protect government revenue**: The three-year tax payment requirement and non-refund condition ensure that only legitimate, paid taxes are eligible for recovery.

---

### **7. Practical Implications for Businesses**
- Exporters and importers must carefully track the use of imported materials.
- They must ensure that any imported inputs are not used in domestic production unless specifically allowed (e.g., as plant equipment).
- They must maintain accurate records of tax payments and export dates.
- They must act promptly to file claims within **two years** of export.
- They must coordinate with other stakeholders (e.g., suppliers or joint owners) to obtain waivers if multiple parties may have claims.

---

### **8. Conclusion**
The **Goods Imported and Exported Drawback Regulations** establish a structured, transparent, and accountable system for refunding customs and excise taxes on goods that are exported and not used in Canada for domestic purposes. The rules are designed to:
- Support Canada’s export economy;
- Prevent fraud and double claims;
- Ensure compliance with tax laws;
- Maintain the integrity of the customs and revenue system.

By requiring strict eligibility criteria, timely filing, and third-party waivers, the regulations promote responsible and legitimate export activity while safeguarding public revenue.

**Summary in One Sentence**:  
These regulations allow exporters or importers to claim a 99% refund of customs and excise taxes paid on imported goods that are exported and not used in Canada for domestic purposes, provided the claim is filed within two years of export, the taxes were paid within the three years prior to export, and all third-party entitlements are waived.
