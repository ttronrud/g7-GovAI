---

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation is **no longer in force**. It was formally repealed on or around the date of the publication of SOR/2012-285, which was issued by the Government of Canada (specifically, the Minister responsible for the relevant department, such as the Minister of Health or Minister of Natural Resources, depending on the subject matter).

**Repeal Mechanism:**  
Section 17 of SOR/2012-285 specifically identifies the repeal of certain provisions from a prior regulation. The repetition of this notation suggests that multiple provisions or subsections were affected by the repeal. However, without additional context (such as the original regulation’s title or subject matter), it is not possible to identify the exact content of the repealed regulation.

**Implications of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, definitions, requirements, or procedures established by the repealed regulation are **no longer applicable**.  
- Legal or administrative actions based on the repealed regulation are **invalid or unenforceable**.  
- The repeal may have been enacted to modernize legislation, correct errors, or align with new policies or laws.

**Source of Repeal:**  
SOR/2012-285 is a **Supplemental Order of Regulations** issued in 2012 under a federal statute. These orders typically amend or repeal existing regulations. The specific regulation being repealed would have been referenced in the prior version of the regulation or in the legislative text that led to the repeal.

**Note on Lack of Content:**  
The absence of the original regulation’s title, subject, or key provisions in the provided text means that a detailed summary of *what* the regulation did cannot be given. The only factual information available is that it was **repealed by SOR/2012-285, section 17**.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the provided text has been **fully repealed** and is **no longer part of the current legal framework**. It was removed by **Section 17 of SOR/2012-285**, a government regulation issued in 2012. Without the original regulation’s title or subject, a detailed summary of its content or purpose cannot be provided. To obtain further details, one would need to consult the full text of the prior regulation or the official document SOR/2012-285.

If you can provide the **original regulation’s title or subject matter** (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of medical practitioners" or "Regulation on emissions from industrial facilities"), I can offer a more specific and detailed summary.
