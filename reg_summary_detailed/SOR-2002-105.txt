### **Detailed Summary of the Notice of Branch Closure (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Authority and Basis**
These regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 385.27(5)a of the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act* (CCA)**.  
- **Statutory Citation**: S.C. 2001, c. 9, s. 313; S.C. 1991, c. 48  
- The purpose is to establish clear, enforceable procedures for **notifying customers and the public** before a cooperative credit association (CCA) closes a branch or ceases certain financial activities.

#### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulations define several key terms to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Cooperative Credit Associations Act*. |
| **Retail Deposit-Taking Branch** | A branch or office where a financial institution opens retail deposit accounts (e.g., savings, chequing) through a natural person and disburses cash to customers. |
| **Rural Area** | Any territory in Canada located outside an urban area. |
| **Urban Area** | A geographic area defined in the most recent Statistics Canada census dictionary as an urban area with a population of **at least 10,000 persons**. |

> These definitions are critical for determining the **notice requirements** based on geographic classification.
