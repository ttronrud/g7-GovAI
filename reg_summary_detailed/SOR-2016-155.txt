### **Purpose and Context**

This regulation serves as a formal administrative notice to terminate specific provisions of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations*. The Act and its associated regulations were established to implement an export charge on softwood lumber products, primarily to address concerns related to trade imbalances, market distortions, and the impact of foreign competition—particularly from Canada’s own softwood lumber industry.

The expiry of these sections reflects a policy decision to phase out or remove certain regulatory provisions that were previously in effect, likely due to changes in trade policy, economic conditions, or the expiration of a temporary measure.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Expiry of Specific Sections**  
   - Sections 10 to 12 and Sections 13 to 15 of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations* are officially declared to cease to be in force on **October 12, 2015**.  
   - This means that all legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or administrative requirements contained within these sections are no longer enforceable or applicable after that date.

2. **Deemed Effective Date**  
   - The regulation is deemed to have "come into force" on **October 13, 2015**.  
   - This is a procedural detail indicating that the expiry is effective from October 12, and the regulatory change is formally recognized in the legal system from the next day. It ensures continuity and clarity in the administrative timeline.

3. **Legal Basis**  
   - The regulation is issued under the authority of:
     - **Paragraph 101(a)** of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006*: This grants the Governor General in Council the power to make regulations as necessary to implement the Act.
     - **Section 102** of the same Act: This authorizes the Minister of National Revenue to recommend and assist in the making of regulations, particularly those related to export charges and administrative procedures.

### **Implications and Effects**

- **End of Export Charges or Administrative Requirements**:  
  The expiry of Sections 10 to 12 and 13 to 15 suggests that the export charge mechanism or associated administrative procedures (such as documentation, reporting, or compliance requirements) that were previously governed by these sections are no longer in effect.

- **Policy Shift**:  
  The move indicates a shift in Canada’s approach to softwood lumber exports—potentially reflecting a decision to:
  - Remove temporary export charges due to economic or diplomatic reasons,
  - Reassess the need for such a charge in light of market conditions,
  - Align with international trade agreements or domestic economic priorities.

- **Legal Continuity**:  
  By setting a clear expiry date and a deemed effective date, the regulation ensures that all stakeholders (e.g., exporters, importers, customs officials) are aware of the change and can adjust their operations accordingly.

### **Background on the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006**

- The original Act was introduced to impose an export charge on softwood lumber products exported from Canada, particularly to the United States, to help offset the economic impact of trade imbalances and protect domestic producers.
- The regulations under this Act provided detailed rules on how the charge would be calculated, administered, and enforced.
- Over time, the policy framework evolved, and the 2015 expiry reflects a phase-out of the earlier regulatory framework, possibly in favor of alternative mechanisms or a more permanent trade policy.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally terminates specific provisions of the *Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act, 2006 Regulations* that were responsible for administering export charges or compliance measures related to softwood lumber. The provisions cease on **October 12, 2015**, and the regulation itself is deemed effective from **October 13, 2015**. This marks a significant administrative and policy change, signaling the end of a temporary export charge regime and reflecting broader shifts in Canada’s approach to softwood lumber trade policy.

This action underscores the flexibility of Canadian regulatory frameworks and the ability to adjust trade policies in response to economic, political, or market developments.
