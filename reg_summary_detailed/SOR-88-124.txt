**Detailed Summary of the Churchill Airport Zoning Regulations (Canada Gazette, Part I, 1987)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

The **Churchill Airport Zoning Regulations** are established under the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically **Sections 4.4 and 4.5**, which authorize the Minister of Transport to:

- Publish proposed zoning regulations for airports to ensure safe aviation operations.
- Allow public comment on proposed rules before final adoption.
- Enact final regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input.

This regulation was published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **August 22 and 29, 1987**, and in two successive issues of the *Thompson Citizen* on **October 9 and 13, 1987**, providing interested parties with a clear opportunity to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.

Following this public consultation, **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, formally adopted these regulations on **October 1987**.

### **2. Official Name and Scope**

- **Regulation Title**: *Churchill Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Applicability**: These regulations apply to all lands—**including public road allowances**—that are:
  - Within the **outer limits** described in **Part VI of the Schedule**, or  
  - Directly beneath portions of the **approach surfaces** that extend beyond those outer limits.

This ensures that all areas surrounding the airport, particularly those near runways and approach paths, are subject to strict height and land-use restrictions to prevent hazards to aircraft during takeoff and landing.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Churchill Airport in the vicinity of Churchill, Manitoba. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific geographic point at the midpoint between the midpoints of runways 07–25 and 15–33. Coordinates: Northing 6,511,764.202 m; Easting 438,254.808 m. Elevation: **18.5 meters above sea level**. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip. Designed to ensure clear visibility and safe approach paths for aircraft. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 18.5 m + 45 m = 63.5 m ASL), **except** where this elevation is less than 9 meters above ground level—then it is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The designated landing area, including runways, used for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of a strip and its associated approach surface, connecting to the outer surface or to adjacent transitional surfaces. |

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:

- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations, **if the highest point of that object exceeds** any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This means that all structures (including trees, buildings, towers, or signs) must remain **below** the defined imaginary surfaces to prevent visual obstructions or hazards to aircraft.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, shrubs, vegetation) on regulated land exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:
  - Remove or trim the excessive growth.
- This provision ensures that even natural features do not interfere with aircraft operations.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Bird-Attractive Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier may:
  - Use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:
    - Edible by birds, or  
    - Attractive to birds.

> This is a critical measure to reduce bird strikes—a major aviation hazard—by eliminating food sources that attract birds to the airport area.

### **7. Detailed Description of Key Components (Based on Zoning Plan E2244, October 23, 1986)**

#### **A. Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Midpoint between the midpoints of runways 07–25 and 15–33.
- Coordinates:  
  - Northing: 6,511,764.202 m  
  - Easting: 438,254.808 m  
- Elevation: **18.5 meters above sea level**

#### **B. Approach Surfaces (by runway)**

| Runway Approach | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **07 (Runway 07)** | - Inclined plane: 1:40 slope (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal)<br> - Rises to a horizontal line 3,000 m from the end of the strip<br> - Outer ends of this line are 525 m from the runway centerline<br> - Horizontal line is 75 m above the elevation at the end of the strip |
| **25 (Runway 25)** | - Same as 07 (1:40 slope)<br> - 3,000 m horizontal distance<br> - 525 m from centerline<br> - 75 m above end elevation |
| **15 (Runway 15)** | - Inclined plane: 1:50 slope (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)<br> - Rises to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end of the strip<br> - Outer ends are 2,400 m from centerline<br> - Horizontal line is 300 m above end elevation |
| **33 (Runway 33)** | - Same as 15 (1:50 slope)<br> - 15,000 m horizontal distance<br> - 2,400 m from centerline<br> - 300 m above end elevation |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach by ensuring unobstructed flight paths and clear visibility.

#### **C. Outer Surface**
- A flat, imaginary plane at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (i.e., 63.5 m ASL).
- **Exception**: If the 45-meter plane would be **less than 9 meters above ground level**, then the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level**.
- This ensures that the surface is not unrealistically high in low-lying areas, while still maintaining safety margins.

#### **D. Strips (Runway Areas)**
| Runway | Width | Length | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| **07–25** | 150 m wide | 1,973.5 m long | 75 m on each side of centerline |
| **15–33** | 300 m wide | 2,924 m long | 150 m on each side of centerline |

> These define the active landing zones and are critical for aircraft operations.

#### **E. Transitional Surfaces**
- Inclined planes with a **1:7 slope** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of each strip and its approach surface**.
- Continue upward and outward until they intersect with:
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - Another transitional surface from an adjacent strip.
- These surfaces ensure a smooth, safe transition between the runway area and the outer safety zone.

#### **F. Outer Limits of Land (Boundary Description)**
The boundary of the regulated land is defined by a precise, geometric path:

1. **Start**: Intersection of the southeasterly limit of **Parcel 1, Plan 5292 Neepawa Land Titles** with a **circle of 4,000 meters radius** centered at the ARP.
2. **Southwesterly** along the southeasterly limit of Parcel 1 to its most southerly corner.
3. **Northwesterly** along the southwesterly limit of Parcel 1 to the most southerly corner of **Parcel A, Plan 7597**.
4. **Northerly** along the easterly limit of Parcel A to its most northerly corner.
5. **Northeasterly** along the northwesterly limits of **Parcels 3 and 2 (Plan 5292)** to the **ordinary high water mark of Hudson Bay**.
6. **Southeasterly** along the high water mark of Hudson Bay back to the **4,000-meter circle** centered at the ARP.
7. **Return clockwise** along the circumference of the circle to the starting point.

> This creates a **circular buffer zone** (4 km radius) around the airport, with a land boundary that respects natural topography and water features.

### **8. Purpose and Safety Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by eliminating
