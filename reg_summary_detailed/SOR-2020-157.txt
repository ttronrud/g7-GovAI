### **Detailed Summary of the CUSMA Tariff Preference Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**

The **CUSMA Tariff Preference Regulations** are issued under the authority of **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff** (Act), by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. These regulations implement and clarify the tariff preferences established under the **Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)**, specifically regarding the eligibility of **originating goods** for preferential tariff treatment when imported into Canada.

These regulations ensure that goods originating in one of the three CUSMA countries — Canada, the United States, or Mexico — can benefit from reduced or eliminated tariffs upon entry into Canada, provided certain conditions are met, particularly concerning the **origin of the goods**, **shipping routes**, and **compliance with classification rules**.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The following definitions apply throughout the regulations:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Customs Tariff*, the primary legislation governing import duties and tariff classifications. |
| **CUSMA country** | Any party to the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (Canada, the United States, or Mexico). |
| **Minimal operation** | Activities that do not constitute a significant transformation of a good and are considered non-essential or ancillary. Includes: <br> - Preservation of goods for transport/storage <br> - Packaging, re-packaging, breaking up, or putting up for retail sale (e.g., placing in bottles, boxes) <br> - Mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the good’s characteristics <br> - Collection of goods to form sets, kits, or composite goods <br> - Any combination of the above. |
| **Originating good** | Defined in accordance with *subsection 1(1) of the CUSMA Rules of Origin Regulations*. A good that meets the rules of origin established under CUSMA (e.g., produced in a CUSMA country using qualifying materials). |
| **Originating material** | Defined similarly — materials used in the production of an originating good that meet the origin criteria under CUSMA. |

> **Note**: Minimal operations are explicitly excluded from being considered "production processes" for determining origin. This means that such activities do not change the origin of a good.

#### **3. Eligibility for Preferential Tariff Treatment (United States Tariff)**

**Condition**: For originating goods exported from the **United States** to be eligible for the **United States Tariff** (i.e., preferential treatment under CUSMA), the following must be true:

- **Origin Requirement**: The **last production process** (excluding minimal operations) must have occurred in the **United States**.
- **Shipping Route Requirement**:
  - The goods must be shipped **directly to Canada from the U.S. without transhipment through a non-CUSMA country**, OR
  - If transhipment through a non-CUSMA country occurs, the importer must provide:
    - Documentary evidence showing the **complete shipping route**, including all points of shipment and transhipment; **AND**
    - A **copy of customs control documents** proving the goods remained under customs control during their time in the non-CUSMA country.

> **Note**: The requirement applies whether the shipment uses a **through bill of lading** or not.

---

#### **4. Special Provision for Goods Classified in the Schedule**

Despite the general eligibility rules, **goods classified under specific subheadings in the schedule** are subject to an additional requirement:

> If goods were produced in the **United States using originating materials from Mexico**, they are **only eligible** for the U.S. tariff if they meet the **change in tariff classification** specified in the schedule (i.e., a specific classification shift must occur in the U.S. or Canada).

> This ensures that even if the goods originate from the U.S., they must undergo a specific classification change to qualify for preferential treatment.

---

#### **5. Eligibility for Preferential Tariff Treatment (Canada Tariff)**

**Condition**: For originating goods exported from **Canada** to be eligible for the **Canada Tariff** (preferential treatment), the following must be true:

- The **last production process** (excluding minimal operations) must have occurred in **Canada**.
- The goods must be shipped **to Canada from a CUSMA country without transhipment through a non-CUSMA country**, OR
- If transhipment occurs, the importer must provide:
  - Full shipping route documentation; **AND**
  - Customs control documents confirming the goods remained under customs control during the stop in the non-CUSMA country.

> Again, this applies whether the shipment uses a through bill of lading or not.

---

#### **6. Special Provision for Goods Produced in Canada with U.S. Originating Materials**

> If goods were produced in **Canada** using **originating materials from the United States**, they are eligible for preferential treatment **only if** they satisfy the **change in tariff classification** specified in the schedule **in Canada**.

> This ensures that such goods meet specific classification thresholds to qualify for tariff preference.

---

#### **7. Eligibility for Preferential Tariff Treatment (Mexico Tariff)**

**Condition**: For originating goods exported from **Mexico** to be eligible for the **Mexico Tariff**:

- The **last production process** (excluding minimal operations) must have occurred in **Mexico**.
- The goods must be shipped to Canada **without transhipment through a non-CUSMA country**, OR
- If transhipment occurs, the importer must provide:
  - Full shipping route documentation; **AND**
  - Customs control documents confirming the goods remained under customs control during the stop in the non-CUSMA country.

> Applies regardless of whether a through bill of lading is used.

---

#### **8. Special Provision for Goods Produced in Mexico with U.S. Originating Materials**

> If goods were produced in **Mexico** using **originating materials from the United States**, they are eligible for the Mexico Tariff **only if** they satisfy the **change in tariff classification** specified in the schedule — either in **Mexico or Canada**.

> This ensures that such goods meet a defined classification threshold to qualify for preferential treatment.

---

#### **9. Eligibility for Mexico Tariff When Goods Are Exported from Mexico to Canada (Last Production in Canada)**

**Condition**: For goods exported from **Mexico** to be eligible for the **Mexico Tariff** when the **last production process** occurred in **Canada**:

- The goods must be shipped to Canada **without transhipment through a non-CUSMA country**, OR
- If transhipment occurs, the importer must provide:
  - Full shipping route documentation; **AND**
  - Customs control documents proving the goods remained under customs control in the non-CUSMA country.

> This provision allows for goods that were produced in Canada (using Mexican materials) to still qualify for Mexico’s tariff if the production process occurred in Canada — but only if the goods meet the classification change requirement.

---

#### **10. Special Provision for Goods Produced in Canada with Mexican Originating Materials**

> If goods were produced in **Canada** using **originating materials from Mexico**, they are eligible for the **Canada Tariff** **only if** they satisfy the **change in tariff classification** specified in the schedule **in Canada**.

> This ensures that even if the materials are Mexican, the final product must meet a specific classification threshold to qualify.

---

#### **11. Effective Date and Registration**

- These regulations come into force on the day that **Section 190 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement Implementation Act** comes into force.
- If the regulations are **registered after** that date, they will come into force on the **date of registration**.

> As of July 1, 2020, these regulations were in force (as per SI/2020-33), and were later amended by **SI/2020-46**.

### **Key Takeaways and Practical Implications**

| Aspect | Summary |
|-------|--------|
| **Origin Determination** | The "last production process" (excluding minimal operations) determines origin. Minimal operations (e.g., packaging, storage) do not count. |
| **Shipping Requirements** | Direct shipments from a CUSMA country to Canada are preferred. Transhipments are allowed only if proper documentation is provided. |
| **Documentation Requirements** | Importers must provide full shipping route details and customs control documents if transhipment occurs. |
| **Classification Thresholds** | Certain subheadings in the schedule require a **change in tariff classification** to qualify for preferential treatment — even if the goods are otherwise originating. This acts as a safeguard to prevent abuse of the tariff preference system. |
| **Country-Specific Rules** | Each country (U.S., Mexico, Canada) has its own eligibility pathway based on where the final production occurred. |
| **Enforcement** | Customs officers can request documentation at any time. Failure to provide required evidence may result in denial of preferential treatment or imposition of non-preferential tariffs. |

### **Conclusion**

The **CUSMA Tariff Preference Regulations** establish a clear, transparent, and enforceable framework for determining when goods originating in Canada, the U.S., or Mexico can benefit from preferential tariff treatment upon importation into Canada. The rules emphasize:

- The importance of **true origin** (based on the last significant production process),
- The need for **transparent shipping routes** (especially when transhipment occurs),
- The inclusion of **classification thresholds** to prevent misuse,
- And
