**Detailed Summary of the Proclamation (P.C. 1999-21) under the Visiting Forces Act, Canada**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Context**

This document is a **Proclamation issued by the Governor General of Canada** on **February 10, 1999**, under the authority granted by **Section 4 of the Visiting Forces Act (VFA)**, which is found in **Chapter V-2 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985**.

The VFA governs the legal framework for the presence of foreign military forces and their associated civilian personnel in Canada. It allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal Cabinet) to:

- Designate foreign countries as "designated states";
- Determine the scope of the Act’s application in those countries;
- Define who qualifies as a "civilian component of a visiting force" for the purposes of the Act.

This Proclamation expands and clarifies the scope of the VFA by adding new designated states and reaffirming previous designations.

### **2. Key Provisions of the Proclamation**

#### **(a) Designation of New Designated States**

The following **13 countries** are officially designated as **designated states** under the Visiting Forces Act:

1. Republic of Albania  
2. Republic of Austria  
3. Azerbaijani Republic  
4. Republic of Bulgaria  
5. Republic of Finland  
6. Republic of Georgia  
7. Republic of Kazakhstan  
8. Republic of Moldova  
9. Republic of Slovenia  
10. Kingdom of Sweden  
11. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (now recognized as North Macedonia)  
12. Republic of Uzbekistan  
13. Kingdom of Spain  

> **Note**: This list includes both current and former states, with historical context (e.g., "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia") reflecting the status at the time of the proclamation.

These designations mean that the **Visiting Forces Act applies to the presence of military forces and their civilian personnel from these countries in Canada**, subject to certain exceptions.

---

#### **(b) Scope of Applicability of the Visiting Forces Act**

The Proclamation declares that:

> **The Visiting Forces Act, with the exception of Part VI, is applicable** in respect of the designated states listed above.

- **Part VI of the VFA** typically deals with **immigration, entry, and exit regulations** for foreign nationals, and may contain provisions that are not intended to apply to visiting forces.
- Therefore, **all other parts of the Act (Parts I to V and VII)** apply to visiting forces from these designated states — including matters related to:
  - Security and legal status of personnel;
  - Rights and obligations of military and civilian personnel;
  - Rules governing the use of Canadian infrastructure;
  - Legal protections during visits.

This ensures that visiting forces from these countries are subject to the same legal framework as Canadian forces or other designated foreign forces, **except for those provisions that are excluded by the Act itself**.

---

#### **(c) Designation of Civilian Personnel as a "Civilian Component of a Visiting Force"**

The Proclamation establishes that **civilian personnel** from the designated states are considered part of a "visiting force" **if** they meet the following conditions:

> Civilian personnel are deemed a civilian component of a visiting force **if**:
- They are **in the employ** of the force (i.e., working for the military or government of that country);
- They are **not stateless persons**;
- They are **not nationals of any state that is not a designated state**;
- They are **not citizens of or residents of Canada**.

This provision is critical because it:
- Extends the legal protections and obligations of the VFA to **civilian staff** (e.g., translators, engineers, medical staff, administrative officers) accompanying military forces;
- Prevents the inclusion of individuals from non-designated countries or Canadian nationals, who would not be covered under the Act.

> For example, a civilian engineer from Austria working with the Austrian military would be covered under the Act.  
> A civilian from Germany (a non-designated state) would not be covered.

#### **(d) Reaffirmation of Prior Designations**

The Proclamation also **reaffirms and extends** earlier designations made in previous proclamations:

- **Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine**  
  → Designated by the **Proclamation dated May 19, 1993 (SOR/93-264)**  
  → Civilian personnel from these countries are considered part of a visiting force **if** they meet the same criteria (in employment, not stateless, not nationals of non-designated states, not Canadian citizens/residents).

- **Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania**  
  → Designated by the **Proclamation dated December 28, 1995 (SOR/96-78)**  
  → Similarly, their civilian personnel are included as a civilian component under the VFA if they meet the specified conditions.

> This demonstrates Canada’s ongoing commitment to **engaging with post-Cold War European nations**, particularly those transitioning to democracy and integrating into international military and diplomatic frameworks.

### **3. Purpose and Significance**

This Proclamation serves several key purposes:

1. **Legal Clarity and Predictability**  
   - Provides clear, official recognition of which foreign states are covered under the VFA, reducing ambiguity for military planners, government agencies, and personnel.

2. **Facilitation of International Military Cooperation**  
   - Enables Canada to host and support visiting military forces from these countries, including their civilian support staff, in a legally sound and consistent manner.

3. **Security and Sovereignty Protection**  
   - Ensures that Canadian laws apply appropriately to foreign forces and their personnel, maintaining national security and legal integrity during visits.

4. **Support for Regional Stability and Diplomacy**  
   - Reflects Canada’s diplomatic engagement with countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Balkans — regions of strategic importance and recent geopolitical transformation.

5. **Inclusion of Emerging Nations**  
   - Expands Canada’s engagement with countries like Albania, Uzbekistan, and Georgia — nations that were either newly independent or undergoing political transitions at the time.

### **4. Key Exclusions and Limitations**

- **Part VI of the VFA is explicitly excluded** — meaning that provisions related to immigration, entry, and exit (such as work permits or visa requirements) are **not governed** by this Act in the same way.
- The **exclusion of non-designated state nationals** is significant — it prevents Canadian authorities from extending the Act to personnel from countries not formally designated.
- **Canadian citizens or residents** are explicitly excluded from being considered "civilian components" — protecting Canadian nationals from being treated as foreign visitors under the Act.

---

### **5. Legal and Administrative Effects**

- The Proclamation is registered in the **Supplement to the Statutes of Canada (SOR)** as **SOR/99-21**.
- It is binding on all Canadian authorities and institutions involved in the reception, hosting, or regulation of foreign military and civilian personnel.
- It is subject to **review and amendment** by the Governor in Council, and may be updated in response to changing international relations or security needs.

---

### **6. Historical and Geopolitical Context (1999)**

Issued in 1999, this Proclamation reflects a period of:

- **Post-Cold War realignment** in Europe and Central Asia;
- Canada’s growing engagement with **Eastern European democracies**;
- Increased international military cooperation, including NATO and bilateral defense agreements;
- The **reintegration of former Soviet republics** into international systems (e.g., Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan);
- The **transition of former Yugoslavia** into independent states (Macedonia being one of them).

Canada’s decision to include these countries shows a strategic and diplomatic commitment to regional stability and multilateral security cooperation.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Proclamation is a foundational legal instrument that:

- **Designates 13 countries** as eligible under the Visiting Forces Act;
- **Applies the Act (except Part VI)** to these countries;
- **Recognizes civilian personnel** from these states as part of a visiting force under specific conditions;
- **Reaffirms earlier designations** of Central and Eastern European nations;
- Supports Canada’s international military and diplomatic engagement in a post-Cold War world.

It provides a clear, enforceable, and internationally recognized framework for the lawful presence and operation of foreign military forces and their civilian support staff in Canada.

**Final Note**: This document remains in force unless formally amended or repealed by a subsequent Order in Council. It is a key reference in Canadian defense and foreign affairs law, particularly in matters involving international military visits and the legal status of foreign personnel.
