Certainly. Below is a **detailed summary** of the provided regulation:

### **Regulation Summary: Revocation of Order in Council P.C. 1991-680 and Designation of the Minister of Finance**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Context**
- The regulation is issued under the **Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act** (*the Act*), which was enacted to authorize the divestiture (sale or transfer) of certain assets or business operations of Nordion and Theratronics — two Canadian companies involved in nuclear and medical technologies.
- The authority to issue this order is derived from **subsection 2(1)** of the Act, which defines the role of the "Minister" responsible for administering the Act.
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**, which is a standard constitutional mechanism for executive decision-making in Canada.

#### **2. Key Action: Revocation of Prior Order**
- The regulation **revokes Order in Council P.C. 1991-680**, dated April 11, 1991.
- This prior order had originally designated a different minister as the responsible Minister under the Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act.
- By revoking this earlier order, the current regulation effectively **removes the previous ministerial designation** and invalidates any administrative or legal functions that were previously carried out under that designation.

#### **3. New Designation: Minister of Finance as the Minister**
- The regulation **designates the Minister of Finance** as the official "Minister" for the purposes of the Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act.
- The Minister of Finance is a member of the **Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal body of senior government officials who advise the monarch (in practice, the Governor General) on matters of state and policy.
- This designation means that **the Minister of Finance now has the legal authority and responsibility** to:
  - Administer the Act,
  - Approve or issue directives related to the divestiture of Nordion and Theratronics,
  - Ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the divestiture,
  - Serve as the primary point of contact for regulatory, financial, or policy matters under the Act.

#### **4. Legal and Administrative Significance**
- This change reflects a **shift in administrative responsibility** from another minister (not named in the text) to the Minister of Finance.
- The Minister of Finance’s involvement suggests that the divestiture process has significant **financial or fiscal implications**, such as:
  - Financial reporting,
  - Budgetary impacts,
  - Public accountability,
  - Oversight of asset transfers involving public or publicly traded entities.
- The designation ensures continuity and clarity in governance, especially in a regulatory context where financial oversight is critical.

#### **5. Publication and Legal Effect**
- The regulation was published in **Statutes Canada (S.C. 1991, c. 4)** and in the **Canada Gazette, Part II, on page 1522**, on **April 19, 1991** (as per SI/91-56).
- Publication in the Canada Gazette makes the regulation **officially accessible and legally binding** for all government bodies, courts, and stakeholders.
- The effective date is understood to be the date of publication, unless otherwise specified.

#### **6. Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**
- The change likely occurred due to:
  - A reorganization of ministerial responsibilities,
  - A need for stronger financial oversight in a divestiture involving nuclear or medical technologies (which may have public safety or regulatory implications),
  - A desire to centralize financial governance under a minister with direct access to fiscal policy and budgetary controls.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation formally **revokes a previous ministerial designation** under the Nordion and Theratronics Divestiture Authorization Act and **designates the Minister of Finance as the responsible minister**. It ensures that the financial and administrative aspects of the divestiture are managed by a minister with direct authority over Canada’s fiscal affairs, enhancing accountability and oversight in a potentially sensitive sector involving nuclear technology and public health applications.

This action is part of the broader administrative framework used by the Canadian government to ensure that regulatory processes are appropriately managed and that key responsibilities are assigned to the most suitable ministerial office.
