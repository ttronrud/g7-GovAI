## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
This regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.

The primary purpose is to **facilitate the settlement of native land claims** in the Nunavut region, specifically in accordance with **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**. This provision allows the federal government to withdraw certain lands from disposal (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or development) to support the resolution of Indigenous land claims.

### **2. Revocation of Prior Orders**
The regulation **revokes three previous Orders in Council**:
- **P.C. 1992-824**, **P.C. 1992-825**, and **P.C. 1992-826**, all issued on **April 30, 1992**.

These prior orders had authorized the disposal of certain lands. Their revocation signifies a **reversal of prior disposal plans**, reflecting a shift toward land retention for Indigenous settlement purposes.

The revocation is formally published in the **Canada Gazette, Part II**, under the following statutory instruments:
- SI/92-79 (p. 2010)
- SI/92-80 (p. 2012)
- SI/92-81 (p. 2016)
