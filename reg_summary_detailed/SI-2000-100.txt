**Detailed Summary of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (GST) Remission Order**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**. This provision allows the federal government to make orders that provide for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes when it is in the public interest and based on a recommendation from the Minister of Finance.

The Order specifically applies to the **Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (VGFN)** and relates to the remission of **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was previously paid by the Nation during a defined period.

---

### **2. Legislative Basis**

- The Order is rooted in the **Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Self-Government Agreement**, signed on **May 29, 1993**, and as amended or updated as of **November 2, 2000** (the "Agreement").
- The specific provisions governing the remission of GST are found in **Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Agreement**.
- The Order is also aligned with the **Excise Tax Act** (specifically Part IX), which governs the collection and administration of GST in Canada.

---

### **3. Definitions**

The following key terms are defined for clarity and consistency in the Order:

- **"Agreement"** refers to the **Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation Self-Government Agreement**, as it existed on **November 2, 2000**. This version includes all amendments and updates made up to that date. The Agreement serves as the legal foundation for the tax remission.
  
- **"Person"** is defined in accordance with **subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act**. This definition generally refers to any individual, corporation, or other entity that is subject to excise tax obligations under the Act. In this context, it applies to the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation and any entities acting on its behalf.

### **4. Key Provision: GST Remission**

A **remission of GST** is granted to a "person" (in this case, the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation) under the following conditions:

- **Scope of Remission**:  
  The remission applies to **GST paid by the person** during the period from **October 1, 1997, to October 31, 2000**.

- **Legal Basis for Remission**:  
  The remission is provided **only to the extent and in the manner specified in Sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**. These sections outline the specific circumstances and conditions under which the VGFN is entitled to have GST refunded or waived.

- **Exclusion of Other Refund Rights**:  
  Crucially, **no refund of the same GST will be payable under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**. This means that even though the remission is granted under the Agreement, the VGFN cannot claim a refund through the broader self-government framework under that Act. This provision prevents double recovery or overlapping entitlements.

### **5. Public Interest Justification**

The Governor General in Council determines that it is **in the public interest** to grant this remission. This is a key justification for the Order, reflecting the broader policy of supporting Indigenous self-governance, financial sustainability, and reconciliation. By remitting GST, the federal government recognizes the financial burden placed on the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation during a period when it was establishing its self-governing capacity.

---

### **6. Effective Date**

The Order **comes into force on November 2, 2000** — the date the Agreement was updated and finalized. This timing ensures that the remission is aligned with the legal and administrative framework of the Agreement and provides a clear endpoint for the application of the remission.

---

### **7. Significance and Implications**

- **Financial Relief**: The remission provides direct financial relief to the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation by canceling GST liabilities that were incurred during a critical period of self-government development.
- **Recognition of Self-Governance**: The Order reflects a federal commitment to supporting Indigenous nations in building their economic and administrative autonomy.
- **Clarity in Tax Obligations**: By explicitly excluding refunds under Section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act, the Order avoids potential conflicts in tax entitlements and ensures legal precision.
- **Precedent Setting**: This Order may serve as a model for future tax remissions or financial accommodations for other First Nations under self-government agreements.

### **Conclusion**

The **Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (GST) Remission Order** is a targeted, legally grounded, and constitutionally authorized action that remits GST paid by the VGFN between October 1, 1997, and October 31, 2000. It is based on the terms of the Self-Government Agreement and is conditional on the absence of any refund claim under the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act. The Order underscores the federal government’s recognition of the financial challenges faced by First Nations during the transition to self-governance and affirms a commitment to equitable and supportive fiscal policies.

This regulation is a key example of how federal policy, self-government agreements, and tax law can intersect to support Indigenous communities in achieving economic self-sufficiency.
