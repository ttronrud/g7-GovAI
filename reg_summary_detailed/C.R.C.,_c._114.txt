**Detailed Summary of the Saint John Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **Saint John Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and land-use restrictions around the Saint John Airport in the County of St. John, Province of New Brunswick, to ensure aviation safety and operational efficiency.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to the **Saint John Airport**, located in the County of St. John, New Brunswick.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A designated geographic point used as a baseline for elevation measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be 325 feet above sea level** for all purposes in these regulations.

- **Approach Surface**: An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from each end of a runway strip (i.e., the approach ends of runways 05–23 and 14–32). It is described in **Part III of the Schedule** and has a **1:50 vertical-to-horizontal slope** (1 foot rise per 50 feet horizontal distance). It rises to a horizontal line 200 feet above the end of the strip and 10,000 feet horizontally from that end, with outer ends 2,000 feet from the runway centerline.

- **Outer Surface**: An **imaginary surface** that:
  - Is a **flat plane at 150 feet above the ARP elevation**, or
  - If that plane is less than 30 feet above ground level, then a surface **30 feet above ground**.
  - This surface serves as a boundary beyond which structures are prohibited.
  - Shown on **Department of Transport Plan MT-1144**, dated January 11, 1974.

- **Strip**: The **rectangular area** of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including the runway. Each strip is defined by:
  - **Width**: 1,000 feet (500 feet on each side of the centerline).
  - **Length**:
    - **Runway 05–23**: 7,600 feet long.
    - **Runway 14–32**: 5,700 feet long.
  - Both are described in **Part V of the Schedule** and referenced on the same plan (MT-1144).

- **Transitional Surface**: An **imaginary inclined plane** extending upward and outward from the **lateral edges** of each strip and its approach surfaces. It rises at a **1:7 slope** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal) until it intersects with the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent strip. It ensures a smooth transition between the runway area and the outer safety zones.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to **all lands and lands under water**, including:
  - Public road allowances adjacent to or near the airport.
  - Areas within the **outer limits** defined in **Part II of the Schedule**.
- **Exemption**: Land that is **officially incorporated into the airport** (e.g., operational runways, taxiways, hangars) is **excluded** from these restrictions.

> **Note**: The outer limits are defined by a detailed, precise **boundary description** in Part II of the Schedule, involving a series of bearings, distances, and coordinate references (e.g., N.567,281.81′ and E.1,156,447.82′ in the New Brunswick Grid Coordinate System). This boundary forms a perimeter that encloses the regulated zone.

### **4. Prohibitions on Structures and Objects**

**No person may erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object** on regulated land if the **highest point** of that object exceeds any of the following **imaginary surfaces** at the point of location:

- The **approach surface**
- The **outer surface**
- The **transitional surface**

> This means that any structure (e.g., buildings, towers, antennas, trees, signs) must remain **below or at the elevation** of these defined safety planes. Even minor overhangs or additions that exceed these limits are prohibited.

---

### **5. Regulation of Natural Growth**

- If **natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, vegetation) on regulated land **exceeds** any of the above-mentioned surfaces in elevation, the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove the excessive growth**.

> This provision helps prevent hazards such as bird attraction or obstruction of flight paths due to tall vegetation.

---

### **6. Prohibition on Waste Disposal**

- No owner or occupier of regulated land may **use the land for the disposal of waste** that is:
  - **Edible by birds**, or
  - **Attractive to birds**

> This is a key environmental and aviation safety measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which can be catastrophic during takeoff and landing.

---

### **7. Geographic and Plan References**

All definitions and boundaries are supported by **official transportation plans**:

- **Department of Transport Plan MT-1144**, dated **January 11, 1974**, is referenced repeatedly and serves as the **primary technical document** for:
  - The location of the airport reference point.
  - The approach surfaces.
  - The outer surface.
  - The strip dimensions (length and width).
  - The transitional surfaces.

This plan is considered authoritative and binding in interpreting the regulations.

---

### **8. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

1. **Aviation Safety**: To prevent obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach by limiting structures and vegetation near runways and approach paths.
2. **Flight Path Integrity**: To maintain clear, unobstructed flight paths by enforcing strict elevation limits.
3. **Environmental Protection**: To reduce bird-related hazards through waste disposal and vegetation controls.
4. **Zoning Clarity**: To provide precise, measurable boundaries and elevation limits to guide land use decisions.

---

### **9. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions to remove excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with the rules through administrative or legal means.

This centralized authority ensures consistency and accountability in enforcement.

### **Conclusion**

The **Saint John Airport Zoning Regulations** are a comprehensive, technically precise set of rules designed to **protect aviation safety** by controlling the physical environment around the airport. By defining clear elevation limits (approach, outer, transitional surfaces), specifying exact runway dimensions, and restricting vegetation and waste disposal, the regulations create a **safe, predictable, and hazard-free zone** around the airport. The reliance on a single authoritative plan (MT-1144) ensures consistency and clarity in implementation and enforcement.

These regulations are essential for both **public safety** and **air traffic operations**, and they serve as a model for similar airport zoning frameworks in other regions.
