**Detailed Summary:**

This regulation authorizes the Solicitor General of Canada—acting on the recommendation of the Treasury Board—to issue an order that establishes and prescribes a fee to be paid by individuals who access pardon services provided by the National Parole Board of Canada.

Key Elements:

1. **Legal Authority:**  
   The power to prescribe fees is derived from **paragraph 19(1)(b)** of the *Financial Administration Act*. This provision grants the Governor General in Council (acting on the Treasury Board’s recommendation) the authority to authorize fees for services provided by federal agencies, including those related to administrative and operational functions such as pardons.

2. **Scope of Application:**  
   The fee applies specifically to **any user** who receives pardon-related services from the National Parole Board. This includes individuals who request information, assessments, or decisions regarding their eligibility for pardon or parole, or who are involved in the review process for release from incarceration.

3. **Nature of the Service:**  
   The services provided by the National Parole Board are part of the federal justice system and typically involve assessing an offender’s risk to the public and determining whether they should be released on parole or granted a pardon. The regulation allows for a fee to be charged for these services, which may cover administrative costs, processing, and evaluation.

4. **Prescriptive Power:**  
   The Solicitor General is empowered to issue a formal order setting the fee amount. This order will define:
   - The specific fee structure (e.g., a flat fee, tiered rates, or fees based on service type),
   - The circumstances under which the fee applies,
   - The method of payment,
   - Any exemptions or reduced fees for eligible individuals (e.g., low-income persons, individuals with disabilities, or those in certain legal or vulnerable situations).

5. **Purpose of the Fee:**  
   The fee is intended to:
   - Recoup administrative and operational costs associated with processing pardon applications,
   - Ensure the financial sustainability of the National Parole Board’s operations,
   - Provide a transparent and accountable mechanism for funding public services within the justice system.

6. **Governance and Oversight:**  
   The Treasury Board provides the initial recommendation, ensuring that the fee is reasonable, consistent with public policy, and aligned with broader fiscal and administrative standards. The Governor General in Council formally approves the authorization, reinforcing its legitimacy and alignment with federal financial governance.

7. **Implementation and Review:**  
   While the regulation authorizes the Solicitor General to issue the fee order, it does not prescribe the actual fee amount. That detail is left to the order issued under this authority. The fee may be subject to periodic review or adjustment based on inflation, operational costs, or changes in policy.

**Significance:**

This regulation marks a key step in the formalization of fee structures for services delivered by federal correctional and justice agencies. It ensures that the National Parole Board can operate efficiently and sustainably while maintaining transparency and accountability in its service delivery. It also reflects a broader trend in Canadian government policy toward cost recovery for public services, where fees are used to fund administrative functions without compromising access to justice.

---

**Note on Context:**  
Although the regulation is dated 1991 and is relatively straightforward in wording, it has had lasting relevance. The National Parole Board continues to operate under this framework, with subsequent fee orders issued by the Solicitor General to reflect current financial and operational realities.

---

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation authorizes the federal government to establish a fee for individuals accessing pardon services through the National Parole Board, based on statutory authority under the *Financial Administration Act*. It provides a clear, legally sound mechanism for funding administrative services while ensuring that the process remains accessible and accountable.
