**Detailed Summary of the Petro-Canada Limited — Inter-City Gas Corporation Transactions Authorization Order**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation, known as the *Petro-Canada Limited — Inter-City Gas Corporation Transactions Authorization Order*, is a statutory authorization issued by the Governor in Council (the federal government) under the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA). It grants specific corporate powers to **Petro-Canada Limited** and its **wholly-owned subsidiaries** to facilitate the acquisition of the **propane business assets and operations of Inter-City Gas Corporation (ICGC)**.

The Order is not a standalone transaction or a merger agreement, but rather a **regulatory authorization** that enables Petro-Canada to take certain legal actions necessary to complete the acquisition without requiring additional regulatory approval—specifically because the transaction falls outside the scope of the earlier *Petro-Canada Transactions Authorization Order, 1989* (SOR/89-33).

---

### **Key Legal Basis**

The Order is made under:
- **Section 91(1)** and **Section 91(3)** of the *Financial Administration Act* (FAA), which empower the Governor in Council to authorize certain financial and corporate transactions for public interest purposes.
- The Governor in Council has determined, based on a recommendation from the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, that Petro-Canada and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are **already authorized and capable** of undertaking the necessary transactions under existing legal frameworks.

This authorization is not a new form of financial or corporate power, but rather a **targeted, limited delegation** of authority to enable a specific acquisition.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to:
- **Enable Petro-Canada** to legally and efficiently complete the acquisition of the **propane business** of Inter-City Gas Corporation.
- Allow the necessary corporate actions—such as forming new entities, acquiring shares, transferring assets, and restructuring subsidiaries—without requiring further government approval or triggering broader regulatory scrutiny.

### **Authorized Transactions**

Petro-Canada Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are authorized to undertake the following transactions directly related to the acquisition:

#### 1. **Incorporation of Corporations**
- The ability to establish new corporations.
- Upon incorporation, the shares of these new corporations will be **held by, on behalf of, or in trust for Petro-Canada Limited or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries**.
- This allows Petro-Canada to create legal entities to hold or manage acquired assets or to structure the transaction in a tax-efficient or operational manner.

#### 2. **Acquisition of Shares**
- The power to acquire shares in other corporations.
- After acquisition, those shares will be **held by, on behalf of, or in trust for Petro-Canada Limited or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries**.
- This facilitates the integration of Inter-City Gas Corporation’s operations through ownership of its parent or holding companies.

#### 3. **Acquisition of Assets**
- The authority to acquire **all or substantially all of the assets** of any corporation.
- This is critical for the full integration of the propane business, including physical infrastructure (e.g., storage tanks, pipelines, distribution networks), equipment, customer contracts, and intellectual property.

#### 4. **Dissolution or Amalgamation of Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**
- The right to **dissolve** or **amalgamate** (merge with or into) any wholly-owned subsidiary of Petro-Canada.
- This enables operational streamlining, cost reduction, or restructuring of the corporate structure to better manage the propane business post-acquisition.

### **Additional Powers for Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries**

Each wholly-owned subsidiary of Petro-Canada is further authorized to:
- **Sell or otherwise dispose of** any of its shares.
- **Sell or otherwise dispose of** all or substantially all of its assets.

> These powers are specifically tied to the **completion of the acquisition** and are not general or ongoing. They are intended to allow subsidiaries to:
> - Exit from operations if necessary.
> - Facilitate the transfer of ownership or assets during the integration process.
> - Support the transition of the propane business into Petro-Canada’s portfolio.

### **Scope and Limitations**

- **Limited in Scope**: The authorization applies **only to transactions directly related to the acquisition** of the propane business of Inter-City Gas Corporation.
- **Not a Broad Authorization**: It does not grant general powers to invest, expand, or engage in unrelated business activities.
- **No Public or Market Impact**: The transaction is not subject to antitrust or competition review, as it falls outside the scope of the 1989 Order.
- **No Duration Specified**: The Order is effective until the acquisition is completed or revoked, though such revocation would require formal action.

---

### **Citation and Legal Status**

- The Order is formally cited as:  
  **Petro-Canada Limited — Inter-City Gas Corporation Transactions Authorization Order**
- It is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, as part of the official federal regulatory record.
- It is enforceable under the *Financial Administration Act* and constitutes a binding legal instrument.

### **Significance and Implications**

1. **Operational Efficiency**: Enables Petro-Canada to move swiftly and legally through the acquisition process without delays from regulatory hurdles.
2. **Corporate Flexibility**: Provides the necessary tools to restructure, integrate, and reorganize the propane business as needed.
3. **Government Confidence**: Demonstrates that the federal government has reviewed and approved the transaction, ensuring it aligns with national energy policy and corporate governance standards.
4. **No Market Intervention**: As the transaction is not within the scope of the 1989 Order, it does not trigger broader oversight or scrutiny from competition authorities.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, temporary, and narrowly defined authorization** that empowers Petro-Canada and its subsidiaries to execute the necessary corporate actions to complete the acquisition of Inter-City Gas Corporation’s propane business. It reflects a practical and legally sound approach to enabling a strategic business expansion within the energy sector, while ensuring compliance with federal financial administration rules and maintaining regulatory oversight within appropriate boundaries.

The Order is a critical enabler of the transaction, providing the legal foundation for asset acquisition, entity formation, and corporate restructuring—all essential steps in integrating the propane business into Petro-Canada’s operations.
