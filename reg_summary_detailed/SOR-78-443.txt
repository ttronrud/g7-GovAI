## 📌 OVERVIEW

This regulation was a **set of rules governing fishing activities in inland and coastal waters of Newfoundland and Labrador**, primarily focused on **angling (fishing with a hook and line)**, with specific provisions for **trout, salmon, and other native species**. It was established under the authority of the **Fisheries Act**, specifically **Section 34**, which allows the Minister to make or amend fishery regulations.

Despite being **repealed in 2003**, it provides valuable historical insight into how fishery management was structured in the province during the mid-20th century — particularly regarding **species protection, gear restrictions, seasonal closures, and access for Indigenous communities**.

## 🧩 KEY DEFINITIONS (Important for Understanding the Rules)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Angling** | Fishing with a hook and line (hand-held or rod), including casting and trolling. |
| **Artificial Fly** | A fly made with barbed or barbless hooks, dressed to attract fish, without sinking weights; includes baited hooks or spinning devices. |

| **Insular Newfoundland** | The main island of Newfoundland and adjacent islands. |
| **Labrador** | The Labrador region and adjacent islands. |
| **Trout** | Includes speckled trout, brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, and ouananiche. |
| **Immature Fish** | Fish under size limits: <30 cm for salmon/char, <20 cm for trout/ouananiche. |
| **Spent Fish** | Fish that have not recovered from spawning; must be released. |
| **Set** | When fishing gear is anchored to the bottom, shore, or vessel. |
| **Close Time** | Periods when fishing is prohibited (e.g., winter months). |

## 🎯 CORE PROVISIONS

### 1. **Fishing Methods in Inland Waters**

#### ✅ Allowed:
- **Angling only** is permitted in inland waters (excluding specific exceptions).
- **No netting, sweeping, raking, or foul hooking** (hooking fish outside the mouth) is allowed.
- **Exception**: Use of **gaffs, tailers, or landing nets** is allowed for landing fish.

#### ❌ Prohibited:
- Fishing with **nets, traps, or spears** in inland waters (except for specific Indigenous rights).
- **Foul hooking** (hooking fish in body parts other than the mouth) — banned in inland waters.

> 🔍 *This reflects a strong emphasis on protecting fish populations from non-selective or injurious methods.*

---

### 2. **Indigenous Fishing Rights (Inuit and Indians in Labrador)**

- **Allowed**: Inuit and Indigenous peoples may catch fish **for food only** in inland waters.
- **Prohibited**: No commercial sale or barter of fish.
- **Gear Restrictions**:
  - Nets must not exceed **46 meters in total length** at one time.
  - Every net must have a **visible name tag** (wood or metal) attached so the operator can be identified.

> 📌 This provision recognizes **traditional fishing practices** and supports **cultural rights**, while protecting against overharvesting.

---

### 3. **Net and Trawl Use in Inland Waters**

- **No one may possess a net or trawl near inland waters without a valid licence**.
- This prevents unauthorized or unregulated use of large fishing gear in sensitive ecosystems.

---

### 4. **Angling Restrictions and Quotas (Species-Specific)**

A detailed **table of daily and yearly limits** applies to various species in **inland and tidal waters**:

| Species | Daily Quota | Yearly Quota | Possession Limit | Length Limit | Close Time |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Arctic Char** | 12 (or 2.25 kg + 1 fish) | 24 (or 4.5 kg + 1 fish) | Same as daily | ≤60 cm | Jan 1 – Feb 1 |
| **Brown Trout** | N/A | N/A | N/A | ≤60 cm | Jan 1 – Feb 1 |
| **Rainbow Trout** | N/A | N/A | N/A | ≤60 cm | Jan 1 – Feb 1 |
| **Ouananiche** | 60 cm or less | N/A | N/A | ≤60 cm | Jan 1 – Feb 1 |

> 📝 **Note**: The daily quota and possession limit apply collectively to **all trout species** (speckled, brown, rainbow, ouananiche).  
> The **close time** (Jan 1 to Feb 1) is a seasonal closure to protect spawning fish.

> ⚠️ **Important**: These quotas are **not applicable** to fishing under **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations** — meaning Indigenous communities may fish under different, more flexible rules.

### 5. **Angling Gear Restrictions**

- **One line or rod and line only** at a time (no multiple lines).
- **Lines must be closely and constantly attended** by the angler.
- **In rivers listed in Schedule I**:
  - Only **artificial flies with barbless hooks** allowed.
  - **No more than one hook** per line.
- **During ice fishing**:
  - No more than **three lines/rods**.
  - Same attendance and gear rules apply.

> 🎯 These rules aim to **prevent overfishing**, reduce accidental hooking, and ensure fair access to fishing opportunities.

---

### 6. **Age and Time Restrictions**

- **No person under 14 years old** may fish in rivers listed in **Schedule I** unless **supervised by someone aged 17 or older**.
- **No fishing between sunset and sunrise** in rivers (one hour after sunset to one hour before sunrise).

> 📌 This protects young anglers and ensures safe, responsible fishing practices.

---

### 7. **Prohibitions on Retention and Harm to Fish**

- **No live sport fish** may be retained in inland waters (must be released).
- **Spent fish** (post-spawning) and **immature fish** (under size limits) **must be released immediately**.
- **No wilful disturbance** of fish or spawning grounds.

> 🌿 These rules reflect a **conservation-based approach** to protect spawning stocks and juvenile fish.

---

### 8. **Waste Disposal Restrictions**

- **No deposit or disposal of waste material** (gear, garbage, offal, debris) in inland or tidal waters or on ice, unless:
  - Disposed in **gurry grounds** (designated areas) under fishery officer authority.
  - Permitted under the **Ocean Dumping Control Act**.

> 🚫 This prevents pollution and habitat degradation.

---

### 9. **Fishing in Coastal Waters (Bay St. George)**

> **Partial excerpt**:  
> *No person shall fish except by angling within 365 m off that portion of the shore along that part of Bay St. George commencing at a point marked by a caution notice, approximately 450 m from the mouth of the river.*
