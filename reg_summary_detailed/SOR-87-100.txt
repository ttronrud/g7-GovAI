### **Detailed Summary of the Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

The **Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Regulations** are a set of legally binding rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically pursuant to **Sections 4.4 and 4.5**, to ensure the safe operation of Kapuskasing Airport by regulating land use and physical structures in its vicinity. These regulations were developed after a public consultation process and were officially published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **February 8, 1986**.

---

## **I. Background and Legal Basis**

- **Section 4.5 of the Aeronautics Act** required the publication of proposed zoning regulations for Kapuskasing Airport, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit representations to the Minister of Transport.
- The **Governor in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, enacted these regulations under **Section 4.4** of the Aeronautics Act.
- The regulations are formally titled:  
  **"The Kapuskasing Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
  and may be cited as such.

## **II. Key Definitions**

The regulations define several critical terms used throughout the document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to the Kapuskasing Airport located in the Town of Kapuskasing, District of Cochrane, Province of Ontario. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A precise geographic point used as a datum for elevation and spatial reference. It is located 100 meters southwesterly at right angles from a point 900 meters northwesterly along the runway centerline from the southeasterly end of runway 17–35. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (runway 17–35 and 10–28). These surfaces are designed to ensure aircraft have clear visibility during landing and takeoff. |
| **Outer Surface** | A horizontal imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP**, except where terrain is lower than 9 meters above ground level—then the surface is set at **9 meters above ground**. |
| **Strip** | The actual runway and associated landing area. Two strips are defined: one for runways 10–28 and one for 17–35. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane extending outward from the lateral edges of each strip and its approach surfaces, rising to intersect with the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

---

## **III. Assigned Elevation**

- The **elevation of the Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is fixed at **221.0 meters above sea level**.  
  This serves as the foundational elevation for all other surfaces (approach, outer, transitional).

---

## **IV. Applicability of the Regulations**

- These regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances.
- The exact boundaries of these lands are defined in **Part VI of the Schedule** and are detailed in a formal **topographic description** using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
- The area spans parts of the **Town of Kapuskasing** and the **Townships of Owens, Williamson, O’Brien, and Swanson**, within the District of Cochrane, Ontario.

## **V. Prohibited Activities and Structural Restrictions**

### **1. Building and Structure Height Restrictions**
No person may:
- Erect, construct, or expand any building, structure, or object (including natural growths) such that the **highest point** of that object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

> This ensures that aircraft can maintain unobstructed flight paths during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

### **2. Management of Natural Growth**
- If a **natural object** (e.g., tree, bush, hill) exceeds any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport may require** the owner or occupier to:
  - Remove the growth, or
  - Trim or remove the portion exceeding the surface.

> This provision protects aviation safety by preventing uncontrolled natural features from interfering with flight operations.

### **3. Prohibition on Waste Disposal Attractive to Birds**
- No owner or occupier may allow land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.
- This is a key measure to **prevent bird strikes**, which pose a serious hazard to aircraft.

## **VI. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

### **1. Approach Surfaces (by Runway)**

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 17 (Approach 17)** | Inclined plane with **1:50 slope** (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal), rising to a horizontal line 15,000 m from the end of the strip. The outer ends of this line are 2,400 m from the runway centerline. The horizontal line is **300 m above** the elevation at the end of the strip. |
| **Runway 35 (Approach 35)** | Same as Approach 17: 1:50 slope, 15,000 m from end, outer ends 2,400 m from centerline, 300 m above strip elevation. |
| **Runway 10 (Approach 10)** | 1:40 slope (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal), rising to a horizontal line 2,500 m from the end. Outer ends are 280 m from centerline. The horizontal line is **62.5 m above** the strip elevation. |
| **Runway 28 (Approach 28)** | Same as Approach 10: 1:40 slope, 2,500 m from end, outer ends 280 m from centerline, 62.5 m above strip elevation. |

> These surfaces protect aircraft during final approach and landing by ensuring no obstructions exist within the designated visual and spatial zones.

### **2. Outer Surface**

- A **horizontal plane** located at **45 meters above the ARP (221.0 m)**.
- If the ground elevation is less than 9 meters above sea level, the outer surface is **set at 9 meters above ground** to avoid creating artificial elevation hazards.
- This surface defines the **maximum allowable height** for any structure or natural feature beyond the approach and transitional zones.

---

### **3. Transitional Surfaces**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) from the **lateral edges** of each runway strip and its associated approach surfaces.
- These surfaces extend upward and outward until they meet:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface of an adjacent runway**.
- Ensures a smooth, gradual transition between the runway area and the outer airspace, reducing turbulence and visibility issues.

---

### **4. Boundary of the Regulatory Zone**

The outer boundary of the regulated area is precisely defined by a **legal description in UTM coordinates (Zone 17, Central Meridian 81°W)**. The boundary includes:

- A series of **linear segments** connecting key land parcels across the Townships of O’Brien, Swanson, Williamson, and Owens.
- It follows natural features such as **runway approach limits**, **land boundaries**, and **existing roads**.
- Specific coordinates are provided for key points (e.g., intersections with approach surfaces), ensuring precision in enforcement.

> This boundary ensures that only lands within a defined, safe zone are subject to the height and waste restrictions.

---

## **VII. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

1. **Aircraft Safety**: To prevent obstacles from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Compliance**: To maintain clear visibility for pilots operating under visual flight conditions.
3. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**: To reduce the risk of bird strikes by banning waste disposal that attracts birds.
4. **Public and Environmental Protection**: To preserve the integrity of the airport environment while balancing land use needs.

---

## **VIII. Enforcement and Oversight**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds authority to:
  - Require removal of overgrown vegetation.
  - Enforce height restrictions.
  - Investigate violations.
- Violations may result in penalties or legal action, though enforcement mechanisms are not detailed in this regulation.
- The regulations are **subject to periodic review** and may be amended as needed based on operational requirements or environmental changes.
