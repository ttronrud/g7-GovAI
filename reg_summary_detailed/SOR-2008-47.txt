The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2013-211, paragraph 509(b)**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation referenced — specifically, **paragraph 509(b)** of **SOR/2013-211** — has been **repealed** (officially canceled or removed from legal effect).

**SOR/2013-211** stands for *Statutory Instrument 2013-211*, which is a regulatory document issued by the Government of Canada. This particular instrument typically contains amendments or new rules related to a specific area of law (e.g., taxation, environmental protection, or workplace safety). In this case, paragraph 509(b) was part of a broader regulatory framework, likely governing certain administrative or procedural requirements.

**Repeal Date and Context:**  
The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2013-211**, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* in 2013. The repeal of paragraph 509(b) means that the legal provisions previously contained in that section are no longer in force. This action is typically taken when:

- The provision is outdated,
- It conflicts with newer legislation,
- It is redundant or no longer necessary,
- A more effective or modern regulatory approach has been adopted.

**Implications of Repeal:**  
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedural rules previously set out in paragraph 509(b) are **no longer enforceable**.
- Legal or administrative bodies must now refer to updated or replaced provisions.
- Entities that previously relied on this regulation must adjust their operations or compliance practices accordingly.

**Note on Repetition:**  
The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2013-211, par. 509(b)]" appearing 30 times) are likely a formatting or data entry error. They do not indicate multiple regulations or different versions. In official legal databases, such redundancy is not standard and may result from a copy-paste or technical glitch.
