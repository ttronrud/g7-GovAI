**Detailed Summary of the Ice Hockey Helmet Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21)**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Ice Hockey Helmet Regulations were issued by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Health. This action is authorized under **Section 37 of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)**. Section 37 empowers the Minister of Health to make regulations to ensure that consumer products, including sports equipment, meet safety standards designed to protect users.

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary objective of these regulations is to establish minimum safety requirements for ice hockey helmets sold or used in Canada. By mandating compliance with a nationally recognized safety standard, the regulations aim to reduce the risk of head injuries during ice hockey play, particularly those resulting from impacts, falls, or collisions.

**3. Mandatory Safety Standard**  
All ice hockey helmets that are marketed, sold, or distributed in Canada must comply with the requirements set out in **Standard Z262.1**, titled *Ice Hockey Helmets*, published by the **Canadian Standards Association (CSA)**.  

- This standard outlines specific performance criteria related to:
  - Impact absorption (resistance to blunt force trauma)
  - Structural integrity (durability under stress)
  - Fit and retention systems (ensuring the helmet stays securely on the head)
  - Design and construction (e.g., shell materials, padding, and ventilation)
  - Testing procedures (including drop tests, impact tests, and penetration resistance)

- The standard is **subject to periodic amendments**. Therefore, the regulations are effective only as long as the helmet complies with the version of Z262.1 in force at the time of manufacture, sale, or importation.

**4. Scope and Applicability**  
The regulations apply to all ice hockey helmets that are:
- Manufactured in Canada
- Imported into Canada
- Sold, distributed, or offered for sale in Canada

This includes helmets used by players at all levels—professional, amateur, youth, and recreational—provided they are intended for use in ice hockey activities.

**5. Repeal Clause**  
The regulations explicitly include a **repeal clause**, indicating that these specific rules are intended to replace or supersede any previous regulations related to ice hockey helmets. This ensures clarity and alignment with current safety standards and eliminates outdated or conflicting provisions.

**6. Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on the **day on which they are registered in the Canada Gazette**, which is the official publication of federal regulations. This ensures that all stakeholders—manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and consumers—are aware of the new safety requirements upon their formal implementation.

**7. Enforcement and Compliance**  
While the regulations themselves do not contain enforcement mechanisms, compliance is enforced through the broader framework of the **Canada Consumer Product Safety Act**. The Minister of Health, in coordination with the Canadian Consumer Product Safety Directorate (CCPSD), has the authority to:
- Conduct inspections
- Issue recalls for non-compliant products
- Impose penalties for violations

Manufacturers and importers are legally required to ensure that their products meet the CSA Z262.1 standard and to provide documentation (such as test reports) to verify compliance.

**8. Key Implications**  
- Consumers can be confident that helmets sold in Canada have undergone rigorous safety testing.
- Retailers and distributors must verify that helmets they sell are compliant with the standard.
- Manufacturers must maintain compliance with updated versions of Z262.1 and ensure that their production processes adhere to the standard.

**Conclusion**  
The Ice Hockey Helmet Regulations (S.C. 2010, c. 21) establish a clear, enforceable safety standard for ice hockey helmets in Canada by mandating compliance with the Canadian Standards Association’s Z262.1 standard. These regulations enhance player safety, promote consistency in product quality, and align with national consumer protection goals under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. The regulations are effective upon registration and are designed to remain current through periodic updates to the CSA standard.
