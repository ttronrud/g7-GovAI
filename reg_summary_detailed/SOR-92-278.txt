**Detailed Summary of the *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations***  
*Effective June 1, 1992*  
*Under the Cooperative Credit Associations Act, S.C. 1991, c. 48*

---

### **Overview**

The *Securities Dealing Restrictions (Cooperative Credit Associations) Regulations* are a set of rules established by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, pursuant to **Section 380 of the Cooperative Credit Associations Act**. These regulations restrict the ability of cooperative credit associations (such as co-operative banks or credit unions) in Canada to engage in certain types of securities trading.

The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect members and the public** by preventing cooperative credit associations from participating in high-risk, speculative, or potentially misleading securities markets—particularly those involving primary distributions, secondary market trading, and mutual fund sales—where such activities could compromise financial stability, transparency, or the fiduciary responsibilities owed to members.

### **Prohibited Securities Dealings (Section 2 – What Associations Cannot Do)**

An association is **prohibited from dealing in Canada in securities** if the dealings involve any of the following:

1. **Primary Distribution of Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**  
   – Selling new shares or ownership interests in a company (e.g., initial public offerings or private placements of equity).  
   – Including the issuance of warrants attached to such shares.

2. **Secondary Market Trading in Shares or Ownership Interests or Warrants**  
   – Buying or selling existing shares or ownership interests in a company (i.e., trading on public or private exchanges).  
   – Includes trading in warrants related to such shares.

3. **Primary Distribution of Debt Obligations of a Body Corporate or Warrants Therein**  
   – Selling new bonds or debt instruments issued by a corporation.  
   – Includes warrants linked to such debt.

4. **Acting as a Selling Agent in Connection with the Distribution of Mutual Funds**  
   – Serving as a sales agent to market or distribute mutual funds to the public.

> ⚠️ **Note:** These activities are strictly prohibited unless explicitly exempted under the regulations.

### **Exempted Activities (Section 2 – What Associations May Do)**

Despite the restrictions, the regulations provide several **explicit exemptions** that allow cooperative credit associations to engage in securities activities without violating the rules.

#### 1. **Dealing for Own Account or Member-Administered Accounts**
- An association may **buy or sell securities for its own account** or for accounts it administers (e.g., investment portfolios for members).
- This includes investment activities such as portfolio management or trading for profit, as long as they are conducted in a prudent and transparent manner.

#### 2. **Investment Counselling and Portfolio Management Services**
- Associations may provide **investment advice**, **counselling**, and **portfolio management services** to members.
- These services are permitted even if they involve securities recommendations or trading advice.

- Primary distribution of debt obligations or warrants issued by:

- The association may issue new shares or ownership interests in its own entity (e.g., capital raising for expansion).

> ✅ Example: A co-operative bank may issue new shares to raise capital for new branches.

#### E. **Unsolicited Participation in Secondary Market Trading**

  - The mutual fund is offered to **corporate-sponsored retirement or capital accumulation plans**, such as:
    - Pension plans
    - Deferred profit-sharing plans
    - Retirement plans
    - Other similar plans (e.g., RRSPs, TFSAs, or employer-sponsored savings plans)

> ✅ Example: A co-op may co-underwrite a bond issuance with other banks or financial institutions.

#### H. **Private Placement of Securities (On Comparable Basis to Underwriting)**
- An association may effect a **private placement** of securities (e.g., to institutional investors or select clients) on the same basis as a member of a selling group would in an underwriting arrangement.

| **Risk Management** | The rules aim to prevent co-ops from engaging in speculative or complex financial instruments that could expose members to significant risk. |
| **Member Protection** | By limiting involvement in primary and secondary trading, the regulations protect members from unsuitable or unregulated financial products. |
| **Focus on Core Functions** | Co-ops are encouraged to focus on their traditional roles—such as lending, savings, and member services—rather than becoming investment banks. |
| **Exemptions for Public and Stable Instruments** | The exemptions allow co-ops to participate in safe, government-backed, or stable financial instruments, which are less risky and more aligned with public interest. |
| **Professional Oversight** | Where trading occurs, it must be done through licensed brokers or under specific, regulated conditions. |
