**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:  
Order Imposing a Surtax on the Importation of Certain Steel Goods**  
*(S.C. 2012, c. 26, s. 63(4); S.C. 1997, c. 36; SOR/2018-206; Repealed SOR/2025-155, s. 1)*

---

### **Overview**
This regulation, made under the authority of the *Customs Tariff* and approved by the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, imposes a **50% surtax** on specific steel goods imported into Canada under certain conditions. The surtax applies only when import volumes exceed predefined thresholds, and it is designed to manage supply and prevent over-importation of certain steel products—particularly during a targeted period beginning **August 1, 2025**, and ending **September 25, 2025**.

The regulation is **temporary**, coming into force on **June 27, 2025**, and will be **repealed one year after its effective date** (i.e., June 27, 2026). It is also **repealed by SOR/2025-155, s. 1**, which indicates that it may be replaced or withdrawn due to policy changes or fulfillment of its intended purpose.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

### **1. Applicable Goods**
The surtax applies to steel goods classified under specific tariff headings listed in **Schedules 1 and 2** of the Order. These include a wide range of steel products such as:

- Hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel sheets
- Steel coils and plates
- Structural steel products
- Steel beams, angles, and channels
- Steel pipes and fittings
- Steel used in construction, automotive, and industrial applications

**Full list of tariff items (HS codes)** is provided in the appendix. These are primarily found in Chapters 7208, 7210, 7211, 7212, 7225, and 7226 of the Harmonized System.

> *Note:* Goods classified under Chapter 98 (e.g., "goods in transit") or Chapter 99 (e.g., "miscellaneous") are **exempt**, even if otherwise classifiable under the schedules.

---

### **2. Determination of Origin**
The origin of goods is determined according to the rules of origin under:
- *Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (CUSMA Countries) Regulations* — for goods from CUSMA (Canada, U.S., Mexico) countries  
- *Determination of Country of Origin for the Purpose of Marking Goods (Non-CUSMA Countries) Regulations* — for all other countries

This ensures compliance with trade agreements and origin-based tariff treatment.

### **3. Conditions for Applying the Surtax (50%)**

#### **General Conditions (Applicable to Both Schedules 1 and 2)**

For goods classified under a tariff item in **column 4** of Schedule 1 or Schedule 2:

> A surtax of **50% of the value of duty** (as determined under sections 47–55 of the *Customs Act*) applies **if either** of the following conditions is met:

##### **Condition A: Quantity Exceeds Quarterly Total**
- The **quantity** of goods of the same class imported during a **quarterly period** exceeds the **total quantity** set out in **column 2** of the relevant schedule for that class.

##### **Condition B: Origin-Based Quantity Exceeds Threshold**
- The **quantity of goods from the same country** imported during the same quarterly period exceeds the quantity calculated by multiplying:
  - The **percentage** in **column 3** of the schedule
  - By the **total quantity** in **column 2** of that schedule.

> *Example:* If column 2 = 100,000 tonnes, and column 3 = 20%, then the threshold is 20,000 tonnes. If more than 20,000 tonnes of goods from a single country are imported, the surtax applies.

---

### **4. Special Application Period: August 1, 2025 – September 25, 2025**

For this **specific 65-day window**, the surtax applies under **different thresholds**, based on **permits issued under the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**.

#### **For Schedule 1 Goods (Non-Country-Specific Thresholds)**

The surtax applies if:

> **(A)** The quantity of goods imported during the period exceeds the **quarterly total** (column 2) **adjusted** by the following formula:

> **Quantity threshold = Column 2 × (1 − [percentage in column 3])**  
> *(Actually, the regulation states: exceeds the quantity determined by the formula involving the permit data — see below)*

> **More precisely:**
> - The quantity imported during **August 1–September 25, 2025** exceeds:
>   - The **quarterly total** in column 2 of Schedule 1 (for that class), **OR**
>   - The quantity of goods **originating in the same country** imported during **June 27–July 31, 2025**, under a **valid EIPA permit** issued for steel goods listed in **item 82 of the Import Control List**.

> **OR**
> - The quantity of goods from the same country imported during **June 27–September 25, 2025** exceeds:
>   - The quantity determined by multiplying the **percentage in column 3** by the **quarterly total in column 2**.

#### **For Schedule 2 Goods (Country-Specific Thresholds)**

The surtax applies if:

> **(A)** Quantity imported during August 1–September 25, 2025 exceeds the **total in column 2.1** of Schedule 2 for that class  
> **(B)** Quantity of goods from the same country imported during that period exceeds the quantity calculated by:
> - Multiplying the **percentage in column 3** by the **total in column 2.1**

> **Note:** The **first quarterly period** for Schedule 2 begins on **September 26, 2025**, meaning the threshold applies only to imports after that date.

### **5. Exclusions from the Surtax**

The following goods are **exempt** and **not subject** to the surtax:

1. **Goods in transit to Canada**:
   - Goods referred to in subsections 2(1) and (1.1) that arrive **on or before June 27, 2025**
   - Goods referred to in subsections 2.1(1) and (2) that arrive **on or before August 1, 2025**

2. **Goods originating in Canada, the U.S., or Mexico** — these are exempt regardless of volume.

3. **Casual goods** — as defined in the *Persons Authorized to Account for Casual Goods Regulations*.

4. **Goods classified under Chapter 98 or Chapter 99** — even if otherwise classifiable under the schedules.

> *Note:* This exclusion helps protect legitimate trade flows and temporary shipments.

---

### **6. Priority of Surtax Application**

> Despite any other surtax under the *Customs Tariff*, **only the surtax under this Order applies** to goods that are subject to both this Order and another surtax.

This ensures **no double surtax** is imposed on the same goods.

---

### **7. Enforcement and Compliance**

- Goods are considered to be **imported in excess** of the thresholds **if they are not imported under a valid EIPA permit** issued for steel goods under **item 82 of the Import Control List** and that permit is **valid at the time of accounting** (under sections 32(1), (3), or (5) of the *Customs Act*).

- This means **only permitted imports** are allowed to bypass the surtax threshold. Unauthorized or unpermitted imports trigger the surtax.

---

### **8. Repeal and Duration**

- The Order **comes into force on June 27, 2025**.
- If registered later, it takes effect on the **date of registration**.
- It is **repealed one year after coming into force** (i.e., June 27, 2026).
- It is **also formally repealed by SOR/2025-155, section 1**, which may reflect a policy shift or the end of the targeted intervention.

> *Note:* The repeal of SOR/2018-206 (the original Order) indicates that this current Order is a **renewal or replacement** of an earlier measure.

## **Purpose and Policy Rationale**

This regulation appears to be part of a **targeted trade policy intervention** aimed at:

1. **Managing steel import volumes** during a sensitive period (2025), possibly to:
   - Prevent market distortion
   - Support domestic steel producers
   - Protect national security or economic stability in the steel sector

2. **Encouraging compliance with import permits** under the EIPA
