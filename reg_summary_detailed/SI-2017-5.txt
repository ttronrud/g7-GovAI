**Official Text Reference:**  
S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207  
Referred to in: R.S., c. P-34 (Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act)  
Amended by: S.C. 2000, c. 28

**Summary:**

On the recommendation of the Prime Minister and by order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, pursuant to paragraph 2(a)(a) of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act* (R.S., c. P-34), a significant reorganization of ministerial responsibilities has been implemented within the federal government.

Specifically, the regulation transfers from the **Minister of Industry** to the **Minister of State styled the Minister of Small Business and Tourism** the **powers, duties, and functions** of the Minister of Industry under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*.

---

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Authority:**  
   The Minister of Industry no longer holds responsibility for the administration and oversight of the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*. Instead, these responsibilities are now vested in the newly designated **Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism**.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a)** of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to reallocate ministerial powers, duties, and functions within the Public Service of Canada. This provision facilitates structural changes to improve administrative efficiency, policy coherence, and interdepartmental coordination.

3. **Purpose of the Transfer:**  
   The reallocation reflects a strategic government initiative to strengthen the integration of tourism policy with broader economic development and small business support. By placing tourism under a dedicated ministerial portfolio, the government aims to:
   - Enhance the visibility and strategic direction of tourism as a key economic sector;
   - Improve coordination between tourism promotion and small business development;
   - Ensure that tourism policies are aligned with national economic and regional development goals.

4. **Applicable Legislation:**  
   The transfer applies specifically to the powers, duties, and functions of the Minister of Industry under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*. This includes responsibilities such as:
   - Oversight of the Canadian Tourism Commission’s operations;
   - Policy development and strategic planning for Canada’s tourism industry;
   - Budgetary and financial management of the Commission;
   - Promotion of Canada as a destination for international tourism;
   - Coordination with provincial and territorial governments on tourism-related initiatives.

5. **Effective Date and Implementation:**  
   While the exact date is not specified in the provided text, such transfers typically take effect upon publication in the *Canada Gazette* and are implemented through administrative directives within the Department of Industry and the Department of Small Business and Tourism. The transfer would have been effective following the promulgation of the regulation in 2003 (S.C. 2003, c. 22).

6. **Context and Background:**  
   This reorganization occurred in the context of broader government efforts to streamline federal departments and improve policy coherence. The creation of a dedicated ministerial role for Small Business and Tourism signaled a shift toward a more integrated approach to economic development, where tourism and small business are recognized as interdependent and mutually reinforcing sectors.

---

**Significance:**

- **Policy Integration:** This move demonstrates the government’s recognition of tourism as a key driver of economic growth and employment, particularly in rural and regional communities.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** By consolidating tourism responsibilities under a single minister, the government aims to reduce duplication, enhance accountability, and improve decision-making.
- **Strengthened Small Business Link:** The inclusion of small business in the portfolio underscores the importance of supporting local entrepreneurs who contribute significantly to the tourism economy.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a formal and legally grounded transfer of ministerial responsibilities under the *Canadian Tourism Commission Act*. It shifts the stewardship of tourism policy from the Minister of Industry to the Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism, reflecting a strategic realignment to better serve Canada’s tourism sector and support small business growth. The transfer is authorized under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act and is consistent with the government’s broader goals of administrative efficiency and economic development.
