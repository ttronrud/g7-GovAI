**Detailed Summary of the Lands Surveys Tariff**

**Title:**  
The regulation is titled the *Lands Surveys Tariff* and establishes a structured fee system for accessing records or documents related to land surveys.

---

**1. Base Fee for Copies of Records or Documents**  
- The fee applicable to a single copy of a record or document is specified in **Column II** of each item in the schedule.  
- This base fee is set by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (DEMR) and is charged for the provision of a copy of the record or document listed in **Column I** of the corresponding schedule item.  
- Example: If an item in the schedule lists a "land survey map" in Column I and a fee of $20 is listed in Column II, then a requester must pay $20 for one copy of that map.

**2. Additional Fee for Each Order (Per Request)**  
- In addition to the base fee, a **$3.50** fee is charged for **each order** (i.e., each request) for copies of records or documents listed in Column I of the schedule.  
- This fee is not per copy but per order.  
- Example: If a person requests 5 copies of a land survey document, they pay the base fee (e.g., $20) plus one $3.50 fee for the entire order (regardless of the number of copies).  
- This provision ensures that administrative and processing costs associated with handling requests are covered, even when multiple copies are requested.

**3. Additional Fee for Certified True Copies**  
- In addition to the base and order fees, a **$5.00** fee is charged for each **certified true copy** of a record or document.  
- A "certified true copy" is a copy that has been verified by the Department as being an accurate and authentic reproduction of the original record.  
- This fee reflects the additional cost of authentication, verification, and official certification.  
- Example: If a requester needs a certified true copy of a survey plan, they must pay the base fee, the $3.50 order fee, and an additional $5.00 for the certification.

**Key Points and Implications:**

- **Fee Structure:** The tariff follows a tiered model:
  1. Base fee (per document type)
  2. Order fee (per request, regardless of quantity)
  3. Certification fee (per certified true copy)

- **Applicability:** Applies to all records or documents listed in the schedule under "Column I" (e.g., land survey plans, boundary descriptions, survey maps, etc.).

- **Department Responsibility:** The Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (DEMR) is responsible for enforcing and collecting these fees.

- **Purpose:** The fees are designed to:
  - Recoup administrative, processing, and duplication costs.
  - Ensure that only legitimate and verified requests are processed.
  - Distinguish between standard copies and officially certified ones, which carry greater legal or evidentiary weight.

- **Transparency:** The schedule clearly outlines which records are covered and what fees apply, promoting transparency and predictability for users.

**Conclusion:**  
The *Lands Surveys Tariff* provides a clear, tiered fee structure for accessing land survey records. It ensures that the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources can cover the costs of providing copies, handling requests, and issuing certified copies, while maintaining accountability and fairness in access to land survey documentation. The fees are designed to be proportional to the service provided, with distinct charges for basic copies, multiple requests, and certified reproductions.
