**Regulatory Summary:**

**Regulation: Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 2024-345 and Designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development as Minister for the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act**

**1. Legal Authority:**
The regulation is issued under **Section 4 of the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act (S.C. 2024, c. 2)**.  
Section 4 of this Act empowers the Governor General in Council (i.e., the federal government acting through the Crown) to make or amend regulations, including repealing previous orders in council, and to designate individuals to serve in specific ministerial roles under the Act.

**2. Repeal of Prior Order in Council:**
The regulation **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2024-345**, issued on **April 12, 2024**.  
This prior order likely contained transitional provisions, administrative directives, or interim measures related to the implementation of the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act. Its repeal signifies that the government has replaced or superseded those provisions with new, more current, or aligned regulatory arrangements under the newly enacted Act.  
By repealing this order, the government ensures regulatory clarity, removes outdated or conflicting provisions, and aligns the current framework with the substantive and structural intent of the 2024 Act.

**3. Designation of the Minister of Employment and Social Development:**
The regulation **designates the Minister of Employment and Social Development as the Minister for the purposes of the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act**.  
This designation is significant because:
- It formally assigns responsibility for the administration and implementation of the Act to a specific federal minister.
- The Minister of Employment and Social Development is the lead department responsible for early learning and child care policy in Canada, as the Act falls under the broader mandate of employment, social development, and family support.
- This designation ensures accountability, coordination, and continuity in policy development, funding, and oversight of early learning and child care services across the country.

**4. Role of the Privy Council:**
The regulation specifies that the Minister is designated as a member of the **King’s Privy Council for Canada**. This is a formal recognition of the minister’s status and authority to act on behalf of the Crown in matters of federal legislation and policy. It affirms the minister’s official standing in the federal government structure and provides legal legitimacy to their role under the Act.

**5. Purpose and Significance:**
- This regulation marks a key step in the implementation of the **Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act**, which aims to expand access to high-quality early learning and child care services, particularly for low-income families and Indigenous communities.
- By repealing an earlier order, the government streamlines the regulatory framework and removes potential confusion or inconsistency.
- By formally assigning responsibility to the Minister of Employment and Social Development, the government ensures clear leadership, accountability, and strategic direction in advancing child care policy and funding.

**6. Effective Date and Legal Effect:**
While the exact effective date is not specified in the provided text, such designations and repeals typically take effect immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette or upon being signed into force by the Governor General. The repeal of P.C. 2024-345 is retroactive in effect only to the point of its replacement, and the new designation becomes effective from the date of publication.

---

**Conclusion:**
This regulation serves to:
- Remove outdated or interim provisions (Order P.C. 2024-345),
- Establish a clear and accountable ministerial lead (Minister of Employment and Social Development) for the implementation of the Canada Early Learning and Child Care Act,
- Ensure continuity, coherence, and effective governance in the delivery of early learning and child care services across Canada.

It reflects the federal government’s commitment to modernizing and strengthening the child care system through clear policy leadership and regulatory clarity.
