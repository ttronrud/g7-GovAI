### **Detailed Summary of the Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations are issued under the authority of the **Aeronautics Act**, specifically:

- **Section 5.5**: Requires that proposed regulations be published in official government publications (e.g., *Canada Gazette Part I*) and in local media (e.g., *The News of the North*) to provide public notice and an opportunity for public comment.
- **Section 5.4**: Authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt proposed regulations after a reasonable opportunity for public input.

The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette Part I* on **June 17 and 24, 1995**, and in two successive issues of *The News of the North* on **June 19 and 26, 1995**. This ensured that stakeholders—including residents, businesses, aviation authorities, and environmental groups—had sufficient time to submit written representations to the Minister of Transport.

After review and public consultation, the regulations were formally adopted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, pursuant to section 5.4.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Official Title**: *Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation**: R.S., c. 33 (1st Supp.), s. 1; S.C. 1992, c. 4, s. 10  
- These regulations may be cited as the **Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations**.

#### **3. Definitions of Key Terms**

The regulations define several key spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to Sachs Harbour Airport, located in the vicinity of Sachs Harbour, Northwest Territories. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific reference point on the runway (centerline of runway 084T–264T), located **609.6 meters from the threshold of runway 084T**. It serves as the origin for measuring elevations and distances. |
| **Approach Surfaces** | Imaginary inclined planes extending from each end of the runway strip. They are designed to ensure aircraft have clear visual and spatial access during approach and landing. Each surface has a **1:40 slope** (1 meter rise per 40 meters run), rising to a horizontal line 3,000 meters horizontally from the runway end. The horizontal line is 525 meters from the runway centerline and sits **75 meters above the elevation at the runway end**. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary plane at a constant elevation of **45 meters above the ARP elevation (82.3 m ASL)**. However, if this plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground** to prevent impractical or unsafe land use. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular landing area associated with runway 084T–264T. It is **150 meters wide** (75 meters on each side of the centerline) and **1,339.2 meters long**. This is the primary runway area where takeoffs and landings occur. |
| **Transitional Surfaces** | Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 slope** (1 meter rise per 7 meters run), extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces. These surfaces connect the approach and strip boundaries to the outer surface, ensuring a smooth transition in elevation and space. |

> **Elevation of ARP**: 82.3 meters above sea level (ASL)

#### **4. Scope of Application**

These zoning regulations apply to **all land**—including public road allowances—that is:

- Adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, and  
- Located within the boundaries defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**

The outer boundary of the regulated area is defined as a **circle with a radius of 4,000 meters**, centered on the **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**.

This means that any land within a 4-kilometer radius of the ARP is subject to the restrictions outlined in the regulations.

---

#### **5. Key Prohibitions (Zoning Restrictions)**

No person may:

- Erect or construct  
- Construct an addition to an existing structure  
- Build or place any building, structure, or object  

**If the highest point of such structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces:

1. **Approach Surfaces**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surfaces**

> This restriction ensures that no man-made object (such as towers, buildings, or trees) will interfere with aircraft during takeoff, landing, or approach by obstructing visibility or creating turbulence.

The restriction applies **at the point of elevation**—that is, even a small structure near the edge of the zone may be prohibited if its peak rises above any of the defined surfaces.

---

#### **6. Basis for Design and Planning**

All spatial elements (approach surfaces, outer surface, transitional surfaces, strip) are derived from the **Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Plan No. E.3039**, dated **October 18, 1994**. This plan provides the official spatial framework and is referenced throughout the regulation.

The design of the surfaces is based on:

- **Flight safety standards** (e.g., visibility, obstacle clearance)  
- **Aircraft approach and landing requirements**  
- **Standardized aviation zoning practices** (e.g., 1:40 and 1:7 slopes are common in aviation planning)

---

#### **7. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these regulations are:

- To **ensure safe aircraft operations** by maintaining clear airspace and visual approaches.
- To **prevent obstructions** to aircraft during critical phases of flight (takeoff and landing).
- To **protect the integrity of the airport environment** by limiting construction and development near the airport.
- To **balance aviation safety with community development**, by clearly defining boundaries and permissible land use.

---

#### **8. Enforcement and Compliance**

While not explicitly detailed in the text, enforcement would typically involve:

- The **Minister of Transport** or relevant aviation authority (e.g., Transport Canada)  
- Compliance checks during development applications  
- Refusal of permits or building approvals if structures exceed the defined surfaces  
- Potential penalties for non-compliance (though not specified in this document)

#### **9. Key Features and Implications**

| Feature | Significance |
|--------|-------------|
| **4,000-meter radius boundary** | Creates a large, clearly defined exclusion zone around the airport, protecting a wide area from high-obstruction development. |
| **1:40 approach slope** | Provides a steep enough gradient to ensure aircraft can see the runway during approach, especially in poor visibility. |
| **1:7 transitional slope** | Ensures a gradual transition from runway edges to outer surface, avoiding sudden elevation changes. |
| **Outer surface at 45 m above ARP** | Provides a consistent ceiling for all structures within the zone. Adjusts to ground level if too low. |
| **ARP at 82.3 m ASL** | Establishes a fixed reference point for all elevation calculations. |

#### **10. Conclusion**

The **Sachs Harbour Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for managing land use around the Sachs Harbour Airport. By defining clear spatial boundaries and elevation limits, the regulations:

- Enhance **flight safety**  
- Prevent **obstruction of aircraft approaches**  
- Provide **legal clarity** for developers, landowners, and regulators  
- Reflect **standard aviation safety practices** in a remote Arctic environment

These regulations represent a critical component of Canada’s aviation infrastructure management, balancing the needs of air transport with the realities of northern land use and community development.
