### **Detailed Summary of the St. John's (Quebec) Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"St. John's (Quebec) Airport Zoning Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development around **St. John’s Airport**, located in the town of **St-Jean**, Parish of St-Jean, County of St-Jean, Province of Quebec.

---

#### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation defines several critical spatial and technical terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to **St. John’s Airport**, situated in the town of St-Jean, Parish of St-Jean, County of St-Jean, Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point defined in **Part I of the Schedule**. For regulatory purposes, it is **deemed to be 126 feet above sea level**. This point serves as a datum for elevation measurements. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), at right angles to its centerline. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**. It defines the maximum allowable height for structures near the runway ends during aircraft approach. |
| **Horizontal Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located above and around the airport. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**. It sets a maximum height limit for structures in the general vicinity of the airport. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending upward from the lateral edges of a runway (strip) and its associated approach surfaces. Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. It provides a gradual height limit transition between the runway and surrounding areas. |
| **Strip** | A rectangular portion of the airport’s landing area designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**. Each strip has a centerline and specific dimensions. |

> These surfaces collectively form a set of **elevation boundaries** that restrict construction heights to ensure aviation safety.

#### **3. Scope of Application**

- **Applies to**: All lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of St. John’s Airport, including:
  - Public road allowances
  - A portion of the **Richelieu River**
- **Exclusions**: Lands specifically mentioned in **Item 1 of Part II of the Schedule** are **excluded** from these regulations if they are considered part of the airport at any time (e.g., due to operational needs or ownership changes).

> The regulation applies only to the **outer limits** of these lands as precisely described in **Part II of the Schedule**.

---

#### **4. Height Restrictions (Core Prohibition)**

No person may:
- Erect or construct
- Add to an existing building, structure, or object  
on any land (including underwater areas) subject to these regulations  
**if the highest point of the structure exceeds** any of the following surfaces at that location:

1. **Approach Surface**
2. **Horizontal Surface**
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means all buildings, towers, antennas, or other structures must remain **below or at the level** of these imaginary surfaces at every point of their highest elevation.

---

#### **5. Geographical Reference and Bearings**

- All directional references (bearings) are **astronomical** and are based on the **centerline of Strip 11-29** at St. John’s Airport.
- The primary bearing used is **South 89°48′ East (S 89°48′ E)**.
- The **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** is defined by a detailed legal description starting from the intersection of the centerlines of **Strip 11-29 and Strip 06-24**, then proceeding in a series of precise directions and distances.

> This ensures consistent and unambiguous spatial referencing for land boundaries and elevation limits.

---

#### **6. Description of Land Subject to the Regulations**

The regulation provides a **comprehensive legal description** of the lands covered by the zoning restrictions. The description is a chain of coordinates and boundaries, beginning and ending at the **waters’ edge of the Richelieu River**.

##### **Key Elements of the Boundary Description**:
- Begins at the **intersection of the Richelieu River and the lot line between lots 42 and 43** in the Parish of St-Jean.
- Proceeds through:
  - Highway No. 9b
  - A railroad (part of Lot 235)
  - Public roads (e.g., *Chemin du Grand Bernier*)
  - Lot boundaries (e.g., lots 136, 188, 190, 191)
  - Parish lines (between St-Jean, Ste-Marguerite de Blairfindie, and St-Luc)
  - A line at **10,000 feet** measured along the westward extension of the centerline of Strip 11
  - The **Chambly Canal** (Lot 236)
  - The **county line** between St-Jean and Iberville
  - Returns to the **waters’ edge of the Richelieu River** at the point of commencement.

##### **Geographic Coverage**:
- Encompasses:
  - The **entire town of St-Jean**
  - Parts of the **Parishes of Ste-Marguerite de Blairfindie**, **St-Jean**, and **St-Luc**
- Includes numerous **lots and parcels**, referenced by:
  - Lot numbers (e.g., 1–7, 44–4, 117–128)
  - Subdivisions (e.g., 1-1 to 1-7, 44-1 to 44-4)
  - Designated parcels (e.g., P. 1, P. 44, P. 95, etc.)

> This creates a **precise, legally enforceable boundary map** of the regulated zone.

---

#### **7. Regulatory Purpose and Intent**

The primary purpose of these regulations is to:
- **Ensure aviation safety** by preventing structures from interfering with aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
- Establish **clear, measurable elevation limits** that protect flight paths and approach corridors.
- Provide **legal clarity** for land use planning, development permits, and zoning enforcement.

> The use of imaginary surfaces (approach, horizontal, transitional) allows for **flexible yet standardized** height control across a large area without requiring physical markers.

---

#### **8. Status of the Ministerial Provision**

- The section referencing the **Minister** has been **revoked** by **SOR/93-401, section 2**.
- This indicates that the regulatory authority for enforcement has been transferred or superseded, possibly by a newer administrative body or updated legislation.

> This should be noted when assessing enforcement capacity or current legal authority.

---

#### **9. Reference to Maps**

- The regulated land area is **shown on Department of Transport Plan No. M-3710**, dated **September 20, 1971**.
- This map serves as the **official visual reference** for boundary lines, strip locations, and elevation zones.

> Development applications or disputes involving height or land use should reference this plan.

### **Conclusion**

The **St. John's (Quebec) Airport Zoning Regulations** establish a comprehensive and technically precise framework for land use around a major airport. By defining **elevation limits** through imaginary surfaces and anchoring them in a **detailed legal and geographic description**, the regulation ensures that development does not compromise aviation safety. The boundaries are extensive and cover a significant portion of the surrounding communities, reflecting the importance of the airport in regional infrastructure.

These regulations are essential tools for:
- Municipal land-use planning
- Zoning approvals
- Environmental and aviation safety compliance
- Preventing interference with flight operations

> **Note**: Given the revocation of the Ministerial provision, it is advisable to consult current administrative authorities or updated legislation for enforcement and compliance purposes.
