**Detailed Summary of the "SeaRose FPSO" Repair or Alteration Remission Order, 2012**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 115a of the Customs Tariff** (as amended), and is promulgated by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**. This means that the Order is a formal, legally binding administrative decision made by the federal government, based on statutory powers granted to the Minister of Finance to grant remissions of customs duties.

The reference to **S.C. 2005, c. 38, par. 145(2)(j)** and **S.C. 1997, c. 36** indicates the legislative basis and the specific provisions of the Customs Tariff that authorize such remissions—particularly those related to repairs or alterations of imported or exported vessels or equipment.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **grant a remission of customs duties** for the **"SeaRose FPSO"** (Floating Production Storage and Offloading unit), a major offshore oil platform vessel.  

Specifically, the remission applies to **customs duties paid or payable** under the Customs Tariff in respect of the SeaRose FPSO **after it was exported from Canada in 2012 for repair or alteration**. The vessel was returned to Canada following the repair or modification process, and the government recognizes that such repairs are essential for the continued operation and safety of offshore oil infrastructure.

This remission is consistent with the general principle that **customs duties may be waived or remitted in cases involving the repair or alteration of capital equipment**, especially when such actions are necessary to maintain the functionality and safety of critical industrial assets.

---

**3. Eligibility and Recipient**  
The remission is granted to **Husky Oil Operations Ltd.**, a Canadian oil and gas company headquartered in **Calgary, Alberta**. As the operator of the SeaRose FPSO, Husky Oil is the legal entity responsible for the export, repair, and re-import of the vessel.

**4. Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is not automatic and is subject to two key conditions:

- **Condition 1: Submission of Required Evidence**  
  The importer (Husky Oil Operations Ltd.) must **file with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** all evidence required to establish eligibility for the remission. This includes documentation such as:
  - Proof of export and re-import of the SeaRose FPSO;
  - Evidence of the nature and purpose of the repairs or alterations (e.g., technical specifications, repair reports, engineering assessments);
  - Documentation confirming that the repairs were necessary and not for commercial gain;
  - Any other supporting records that demonstrate compliance with the criteria under section 115a of the Customs Tariff.

  The CBSA has the authority to verify the authenticity and sufficiency of this evidence before approving the remission claim.

- **Condition 2: Timely Claim Submission**  
  A formal **claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness** (the responsible minister under the relevant statutory framework) **within two years** of the date the Order comes into force.

  This two-year deadline is a critical administrative requirement to ensure timely processing and to prevent undue delays in the recovery or adjustment of duties. Failure to meet this deadline will result in the loss of the remission entitlement.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette (the official publication of federal regulations). This is the standard method of establishing the effective date for regulatory instruments in Canada.

---

**6. Legal and Policy Implications**  
- This Order reflects a **pragmatic approach to international trade and industrial operations**, recognizing that offshore oil and gas infrastructure requires periodic maintenance and upgrades, often involving export and re-import of large capital assets.
- It supports the **economic viability of Canada’s energy sector** by reducing financial burdens on operators during essential maintenance.
- It also underscores the **flexibility of Canada’s customs regime** in allowing duty remission for legitimate, non-commercial purposes such as repairs and safety modifications.
- The requirement for evidence and timely claims ensures **accountability, transparency, and compliance** with customs regulations, preventing abuse of the remission provisions.
