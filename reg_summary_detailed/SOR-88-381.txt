The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision in question has been officially repealed.

**Detailed Summary:**

- **Regulation Status**: The provision is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed from force).
- **Repeal Date and Instrument**: It was repealed by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**, which is a statutory instrument (regulation) issued in 2017 by the Government of Canada.
- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**: This section typically contains the formal notice of repeal, identifying one or more prior regulations that are no longer in effect. In this case, the repeated reference to "s. 1" suggests that the specific regulation being repealed was previously listed or referenced in a prior regulation, and its removal was formally enacted in SOR/2017-84.
- **Implication**: Any legal obligations, requirements, or provisions previously established by the repealed regulation are **no longer applicable**. Legal entities, individuals, or institutions that were previously subject to those rules must now comply with current, active regulations (if any) that have replaced or superseded the repealed provision.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason for repeal is not detailed in the provided text, such repeals often occur when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It is redundant or duplicated in another regulation.
  - It has been replaced by a more comprehensive or effective regulation.

**Conclusion**:
The regulation referenced is **no longer in force** and has been formally removed by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**. It should not be cited or applied in current legal or administrative contexts. For accurate and up-to-date regulatory information, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, which may have been replaced or amended by subsequent legislation.
