### ✅ **Definition of a Distributing Company or Distributing Insurance Holding Company**

A company or insurance holding company is considered a **distributing company** or **distributing insurance holding company** if **any one** of the following applies:

#### 1. **Reporting Issuer under Provincial or Federal Securities Legislation**
> The company or insurance holding company is a **"reporting issuer"** under any of the following statutes (as defined and amended over time):

| Legislation | Relevant Section/Paragraph |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| *Securities Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 | Section 1(1) (as amended) |
| *Securities Act*, R.S.Q., c. V-1.1 | Sections 5 and 68 (as amended) |
| *Securities Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418 | Paragraph 2(1)(ao) (as amended) |
| *Securities Act*, S.N.B. 2004, c. S-5.5 | Section 1(1) (as amended) |
| *Securities Act*, C.C.S.M., c. S50 | Section 1(1) (as amended) |

| *Securities Act*, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. S-13 | Paragraph 2(1)(oo) (as amended) |

> A **"reporting issuer"** is a company that is required to file periodic reports with a securities regulator (e.g., provincial or federal), typically due to public disclosure obligations, such as financial statements, corporate updates, or changes in ownership.

> ⚠️ **Note**: These definitions are not static — they are subject to amendments over time, and the regulation references the **current version** of each definition as of the date of enactment.

#### 2. **Filing a Prospectus or Registration Statement**
> For companies or insurance holding companies **not** classified as reporting issuers under the above laws, they are still considered a distributing company **if**:
- They have **filed a prospectus or registration statement** under **provincial or foreign securities legislation**, and
- **Any of their securities are listed and posted for trading** on a stock exchange **in Canada or outside Canada**.

> This provision captures companies that are publicly traded or seeking public investment, even if they are not formally designated as "reporting issuers" under the federal or provincial securities framework.

#### 3. **Involvement in Specific Corporate Transactions**
> A company or insurance holding company is considered a distributing entity **if it is involved in, formed for, results from, or continues after** one of the following corporate events:
- Amalgamation  
- Reorganization  
- Arrangement  
- Statutory procedure  

> **Condition**: At least **one of the participating corporate bodies** in the transaction must be:
- A company or insurance holding company that is a **reporting issuer** under any of the listed securities legislation (as defined above), **or**
- A company or insurance holding company that has filed a prospectus or registration statement and has securities listed on a stock exchange.

> This ensures that companies participating in major corporate restructuring are assessed based on the public market status of at least one party involved.

---

### ❌ **Exclusions**
A company or insurance holding company is **not** considered a distributing company or distributing insurance holding company **if**:
- It is **exempt** under **provincial securities legislation**, **or**
- It is subject to an **order from a provincial securities regulator** that explicitly states it is **not a reporting issuer** for the purposes of that legislation.

> This exclusion protects entities that operate under simplified or exempt regimes (e.g., small private firms, non-publicly traded companies) from being classified as "distributing" entities, which could expose them to additional regulatory obligations.

---

### 📅 **Coming Into Force**
- These regulations **come into force on the day they are registered** in the *Statutes of Canada* (i.e., the official date of publication and legal effect).

> This ensures immediate application upon formal adoption, allowing regulators to begin enforcing the definitions without delay.

## 🔍 Key Implications and Regulatory Context

| Aspect | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Regulatory Scope** | Applies to both **insurance companies** and **insurance holding companies** that engage in distribution activities (e.g., selling insurance products to consumers or intermediaries). |
| **Public Market Link** | The classification hinges on public disclosure or public trading — companies with no public market presence are less likely to be classified as distributing entities. |
| **Cross-Jurisdictional Coverage** | Includes both **provincial** and **foreign** securities laws, reflecting Canada’s federal-provincial structure and international market participation. |
| **Corporate Event Triggers** | Even if a company is not publicly traded, its involvement in a corporate transaction involving a public entity may trigger its classification as a distributing company. |
| **Exemption Protection** | Ensures that small, private, or exempt entities are not unfairly categorized as "distributing" entities, avoiding unintended regulatory exposure. |

## 📚 Summary in Plain Language

> A company or insurance holding company becomes a **"distributing company"** if:
> - It is publicly required to report under a provincial or federal securities law (i.e., a "reporting issuer"), OR  
> - It has filed public documents (like a prospectus) and its shares are traded on a stock exchange (in Canada or abroad), OR  
> - It is part of a major corporate change (like a merger or reorganization) where at least one participant is a publicly traded or reporting entity.

> However, **if** the company is exempt from reporting requirements under provincial law or has been formally ordered by a regulator to not be a reporting issuer, it is **excluded** from being considered a distributing company.

> These rules apply **immediately upon registration** and are designed to ensure that entities with significant public market exposure or involvement in large corporate transactions are appropriately monitored under insurance regulation.

---

## 📎 Conclusion

These regulations provide a **clear, comprehensive, and legally grounded framework** for identifying which insurance companies or holding companies are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny due to their role in distributing insurance products. By linking the classification to public market status, corporate structure, and securities legislation, the rules ensure regulatory consistency across provinces and jurisdictions, while protecting smaller or exempt entities from unnecessary oversight.

This is a critical tool for the **Insurance Companies Act** in monitoring the financial health, transparency, and integrity of entities that play a key role in the insurance distribution chain.
