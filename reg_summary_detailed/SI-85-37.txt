### **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Assignment of Public Lands to the Minister of the Environment – Lake Saint-François National Wildlife Area**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Purpose**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Canada Wildlife Act**, specifically **subsection 4(1)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment) to designate and assign public lands for the purposes of **wildlife research, conservation, and interpretation**.

- **Governing Law**: *Canada Wildlife Act*, S.C. 1973–74, c. 21  
- **Authority**: The Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, exercises administrative power to assign land to the federal government for environmental protection.
- **Objective**: To ensure that specific parcels of public land are protected and managed for the **conservation and scientific study of wildlife**, including habitat preservation, ecological monitoring, and public education.

---

#### **2. Geographic Scope and Jurisdiction**

The lands designated fall within:

- **Province**: Quebec  
- **County**: Huntingdon  
- **Township**: Dundee  
- **Geographic Areas**:
  - The **"broken front range"** (a topographical feature in the region)
  - The **range between Salmon River, Pike Creek, and Bittern Creek**

This area is recognized as a **National Wildlife Area (NWA)** — a category of protected land established under Canadian environmental law to safeguard critical habitats for native species.

#### **3. Land Description and Legal Basis**

The land is described in detail through **a series of deeds** recorded in the Registry Office at Huntingdon. Each parcel is defined by:

- **Lot numbers** (e.g., lot 25A, 26B, etc.)
- **Specific portions** of lots (e.g., "that part of lot 25A described in a deed...")
- **Deed dates** and **deed numbers** (e.g., deposited as 74381 on February 15, 1971)
- **Parties involved** (private individuals, corporations, or municipal bodies transferring land to Her Majesty in right of Canada)

The land is legally transferred to the Crown (Her Majesty in right of Canada) via these deeds, and the **Minister of the Environment** is granted authority over the land as a result.

#### **4. Structure of the Land Designation (34 Parcels + 2 Additional Parcels)**

The regulation outlines **34 distinct parcels** (Firstly to Thirty-Fourthly), followed by **two additional parcels** described under "Firstly and Secondly" in a separate geographic zone (the range between Salmon River, Pike Creek, and Bittern Creek).
