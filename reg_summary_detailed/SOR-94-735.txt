The provided text consists entirely of repeated statements indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2015-200, section 7**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled and no longer in force).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal was enacted through **SOR/2015-200**, which is a statutory instrument (regulation) published in the *Supplemental Orders in Council* of Canada in 2015. Specifically, **Section 7** of that instrument repealed the referenced regulation.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: The repealing provision (Section 7 of SOR/2015-200) explicitly removes the legal effect of the previously existing regulation. This means that the content, provisions, and legal authority of the original regulation are no longer applicable or enforceable under Canadian law.
- **Context**: While the original regulation is not provided in the query, the repeated references suggest that it may have been a rule or order governing a specific area—such as licensing, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures—commonly found in federal regulatory frameworks. Its repeal likely reflects a legislative or policy shift, such as:
  - A change in regulatory structure,
  - A consolidation of rules into a new or broader regulation,
  - A determination that the regulation was outdated, redundant, or inconsistent with current laws,
  - Or a move toward more streamlined or modernized governance.

### Key Takeaway:
This entry serves as a **notice of legal termination**. It does not describe the original regulation's content or purpose, only that it has been formally removed from the legal framework. As such, **no further action or enforcement is required under this repealed regulation**.

### Recommendation:
To understand the original scope or intent of the repealed regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the regulation prior to its repeal—typically accessible through official government databases such as the *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Orders* section of the Government of Canada’s website.

> ⚠️ Note: Since the original regulation is not included in the query, this summary is based solely on the repealing notice. Without access to the original regulation, a detailed content summary cannot be provided.
