### **Detailed Summary of the Canadian Forces Employment Equity Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Authority**

The **Canadian Forces Employment Equity Regulations** were enacted under **Section 41 of the Employment Equity Act (EEA)**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Labour) to adapt the EEA to accommodate the unique structure and operational needs of the **Canadian Forces**.

- The Canadian Forces are recognized as a public sector employer with **100 or more employees** under **Order in Council P.C. 2002-1956**, as specified in paragraph 4(1)(d) of the EEA.
- The regulations are necessary because the Canadian Forces operate under distinct military structures, duties, and operational requirements that differ from civilian workplaces.
- The regulations balance the **principles of employment equity** (ensuring fair representation of designated groups) with the **need for operational effectiveness** and security.

#### **3. Scope of Application**

- **Applies to:**
  - Regular Force members
  - Reserve Force members (excluding those declared **non-effective strength**)

- **Does NOT apply to:**
  - Members of the **Special Force** (e.g., Special Operations Forces)

> This ensures that the employment equity framework is tailored to the mainstream structure of the Canadian Forces while recognizing the distinct nature and operational constraints of special forces.

---

#### **4. Employer Responsibility**

- The **Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)** is the designated employer responsible for:
  - Implementing the obligations under the EEA;
  - Applying these regulations;
  - Conducting workforce surveys, analyses, and equity planning.

> The CDS exercises this authority within the scope of their powers under **Section 18 of the NDA**.

#### **5. Employment Equity Obligations – Key Provisions**

##### **5.1 No Mandatory Enrolment or Promotion for Equity**
- The CDS is **not required** to:
  - Enrol, re-engage, or promote individuals solely to increase representation of designated groups.
- Enrolment, re-engagement, or promotion must be based on:
  - **Applicable criteria** from NDA regulations, orders, or instructions (e.g., qualifications, fitness for duty);
  - **Legal duties** under Section 33 of the NDA (e.g., fulfilling operational needs).

> This protects operational effectiveness and ensures decisions are grounded in military necessity.

##### **5.2 Release as Not an Employment Barrier**
- A **release (termination)** of members due to force reductions or unit restructuring is **not considered an employment barrier** under the EEA.

> This prevents the EEA from being used to challenge legitimate military downsizing.

##### **5.3 Restrictions on Commission and Tribunal Powers**
- The **Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC)**, its officers, and Employment Equity Review Tribunals **cannot**:
  - Issue directions requiring enrolment, re-engagement, or promotion without compliance with **Section 7 requirements**;
  - Issue orders that would **harm operational effectiveness**.

> This ensures that equity measures do not interfere with military readiness or mission success.

  - Number of positions held by:
    - Women;
    - Aboriginal persons;
    - Members of visible minorities;
    - Persons with disabilities.
  - Degree of **underrepresentation** by comparing group representation in each MOG to:
    - The **overall Canadian workforce**, or

> This provides a realistic benchmark for equity analysis.
