**Detailed Summary of the *Public Ports and Public Port Facilities Regulations* (S.C. 1998, c. 10)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Public Ports and Public Port Facilities Regulations*, made under **section 65** of the **Canada Marine Act**, establish a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the operation, safety, environmental protection, and management of designated **public ports** and **public port facilities** in Canada. These regulations define the boundaries of public ports, outline prohibited activities, regulate access and use of facilities, and establish procedures for authorizing specific activities—particularly those involving potential risks to safety, navigation, or the environment.

The regulations are binding on **Her Majesty in Right of Canada** and **provincial governments**, and they apply to all public ports and facilities designated under the Canada Marine Act and managed by the Minister of Transport.

## **Key Provisions and Structure**

---

### **1. Designation of Public Ports**

- **Schedule 1** lists specific ports designated as **public ports**, each with clearly defined **geographic boundaries** (limits).
- These designations are legally recognized and form the basis for the application of these regulations.
- The designation of a public port under **Section 1 of the Canada Marine Act** is **repealed** in two specific cases:
  - If the **entire public port facility** is transferred to a private entity or body by the federal government (Minister of Transport).
  - If the **bed of the navigable waters** at the port is transferred or the last part of it is transferred, **whichever occurs later**.
- **Two specific ports are explicitly repealed**:
  - **Esquimalt**
  - **Nanoose Bay**

> ⚠️ Note: These repeals were later rendered obsolete by **SOR/2002-358, s. 1 and s. 2**, meaning the regulations no longer apply to these locations.
