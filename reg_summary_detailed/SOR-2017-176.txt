**Detailed Summary of the CETA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

### **Regulatory Authority and Basis**
The *CETA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subsection 16(2)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision grants the government the authority to establish rules governing the origin of goods for the purpose of determining eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the **Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)**.

These regulations are part of the implementation framework of CETA, specifically addressing a category of goods known as **"casual goods"**—a distinct classification from goods imported for commercial, industrial, or institutional use.

---

### **Definition of "Casual Goods"**
In these regulations, **"casual goods"** are defined as:
> *Goods that are not imported for sale or for an industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or other like use.*

This means that casual goods are typically personal, non-commercial items—such as items brought into Canada for personal use, gifts, or private consumption—rather than for resale, manufacturing, or business operations. Because they are not intended for commercial purposes, they are treated differently under origin rules than standard commercial imports.

### **Origin Determination for Casual Goods**
Casual goods acquired in an **EU country or another CETA beneficiary country** are considered to **originate in that country** and are entitled to the benefits of the **Canada–European Union Tariff** if **either** of the following conditions is met:

#### **Condition 1: Marking Compliance**
- The goods bear a **mark** that:
  - Complies with the **marking laws of the EU country or CETA beneficiary country**, and
  - Clearly indicates that the goods are:
    - The **product of an EU country or CETA beneficiary country**, **or**
    - The **product of Canada**.

> This ensures transparency and traceability. If the marking meets the legal standards of the country of origin and correctly identifies the product's origin, the goods are deemed to originate in that jurisdiction.

#### **Condition 2: Absence of Marking or Indication**
- The goods **do not bear any mark**.
- There is **no indication** that the goods are:
  - The product of an EU country or CETA beneficiary country, **or**
  - The product of Canada.

> In this case, the absence of any identifying mark or origin information means the goods are presumed to originate in the country where they were acquired (i.e., the EU or CETA country), because there is no evidence suggesting otherwise.

> Importantly, this presumption applies only when there is no indication of origin in either direction. If a mark or label suggests Canadian origin, the goods would not be considered to originate in the EU or CETA country.

### **Effective Date and Implementation**
The regulations come into force on:
- The day that **Section 97 of the Canada–European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement Implementation Act** (S.C. 2017, c. 6) comes into force.

> This section of the Act establishes the legal framework for implementing CETA, including rules of origin and tariff treatment.

**However**, if the regulations are **registered (published) after** the date of Section 97’s coming into force, they will take effect on the **date of their registration**.

> This provision ensures that the rules are not retroactively applied and provides clarity on the effective date depending on when the regulations are formally issued.

### **Relevant Statutory References**
- **S.C. 2001, c. 28, s. 34(1)**: Provides the legal authority for the Governor General in Council to make these rules.
- **S.C. 1997, c. 36**: Refers to the original Customs Tariff, which underpins the framework for origin rules.
- **S.C. 2017, c. 6, Section 97**: Establishes the effective date for the regulations and is central to their activation.

---

### **Key Purpose and Significance**
These regulations:
- Provide a **clear and accessible rule** for determining the origin of casual goods under CETA.
- Facilitate **tariff benefits** for casual goods imported from EU or CETA countries, even when they are not intended for commercial use.
- Promote **fair and predictable trade practices** by ensuring that goods are properly identified in terms of origin.
- Support **trade facilitation** by reducing administrative burdens on importers of personal or non-commercial goods.

---

### **Note on Enforcement and Application**
- The rules apply specifically to **goods acquired in an EU country or another CETA beneficiary**.
- The rules do **not apply** to goods imported for commercial or industrial purposes, which are governed by different origin rules.
- Importers must ensure compliance with marking requirements to qualify for preferential tariff treatment.

> **Reference**: SI/2017-47 – This is the statutory instrument (regulation) published on **September 21, 2017**, which formally enacts these rules into force.

---

### **Conclusion**
The *CETA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* establish a simplified, rules-based approach to determining the origin of personal or non-commercial goods imported from EU or CETA countries. By focusing on the presence or absence of origin markings, the regulations ensure that such goods can benefit from preferential tariff treatment under CETA—without requiring complex production or value-added criteria. This supports fair trade and enhances the practicality of CETA for individuals and small-scale importers dealing with personal or incidental goods.

✅ **Summary in One Sentence**:  
These regulations allow casual goods (non-commercial goods) imported from EU or CETA countries to be considered originating in that country and qualify for preferential tariff treatment if they meet specific marking requirements or lack any indication of origin.
