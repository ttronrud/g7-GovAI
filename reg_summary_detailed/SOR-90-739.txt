### **Detailed Summary of the Swan River Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Legal Basis and Publication Background**

These regulations are established under **Section 5.4 of the Aeronautics Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) to adopt zoning regulations for airports. The proposed regulations were published in two successive issues of the *Canada Gazette, Part I* on **February 25 and March 4, 1989**, and in two successive issues of the local newspaper *Swan River Star and Times* on **March 9 and March 16, 1989**. This publication provided a **reasonable opportunity for interested parties to submit representations** to the Minister of Transport before final adoption.

As a result, the Governor in Council formally enacted the **Swan River Airport Zoning Regulations** on the basis of this public consultation and recommendation.

#### **2. Regulation Title and Citation**

- **Title:** *Swan River Airport Zoning Regulations*  
- **Citation:** *R.S., 1985, c. 33 (1st Supp.)*  
- These regulations are binding on all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of Swan River Airport in Manitoba.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers to the Swan River Airport located near Swan River, Manitoba. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A specific point on the airport used as a vertical reference. Located on the centerline of runway 02–20, 629.0 meters from its northeasterly end. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway strip (for runways 02, 20, 08, and 26). Designed to ensure safe aircraft approach by limiting obstructions. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located 45 meters above the ARP elevation. However, if this plane is less than 9 meters above ground level, it is set at 9 meters above ground. |
| **Strip** | The rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing, including runways. Includes both runway 02–20 and 08–26. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, rising to meet the outer surface or another transitional surface. |

> **Elevation of ARP:** 331.4 meters above sea level.

---

#### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to **all lands**, including public road allowances, that are **adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, as precisely described in **Part VI of the Schedule**. This includes both private and public properties within the designated boundary.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Construction and Development**

No person may:

- Erect or construct any **building, structure, or object** (including additions to existing ones),  
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces:

  - The **approach surfaces**,  
  - The **outer surface**, or  
  - The **transitional surfaces**.

> This restriction ensures that no obstruction—such as trees, towers, or buildings—interferes with aircraft operations during takeoff, landing, or approach.

---

#### **6. Management of Natural Growth**

If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, bushes) on regulated land exceeds the elevation of any of the above-mentioned surfaces, the **Minister of Transport may require the owner or occupier** to:

- Remove or trim the excessive growth.

> This provision ensures that natural features do not become hazards to aviation safety.

---

#### **7. Waste Disposal Restrictions**

No owner or occupier may use any land under these regulations for the **disposal of waste** that is:

- **Edible by birds**, or  
- **Attractive to birds**

> This is to prevent bird strikes, which can be a major hazard to aircraft safety.

#### **8. Detailed Descriptions of Key Surfaces**

##### **A. Approach Surfaces (by runway)**

| Runway | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Runway 02 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:40 slope (1 m vertical per 40 m horizontal). Rises to a horizontal line 2,500 m from the end of the strip. Outer ends of this line are 295 m from the centerline. The horizontal line is 62.5 m above the strip end elevation. |
| **Runway 20 (approach)** | Same as runway 02: 1:40 slope, 2,500 m distance, 295 m from centerline, 62.5 m above strip end elevation. |
| **Runway 08 (approach)** | Inclined plane: 1:20 slope (1 m vertical per 20 m horizontal). Rises to a horizontal line 2,500 m from end, outer ends 280 m from centerline. Horizontal line is 125 m above strip end elevation. |
| **Runway 26 (approach)** | Same as runway 08: 1:20 slope, 2,500 m, 280 m from centerline, 125 m above strip end elevation. |

> The steeper slope (1:20) for runways 08 and 26 reflects their higher approach clearance needs due to longer approach distances and greater risk.

---

##### **B. Outer Surface**

- Located at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the ARP (331.4 m = 376.4 m above sea level)**.
- **Exception**: If the 45-meter plane would be less than 9 meters above ground level, the outer surface is set at **9 meters above ground level** to prevent impractical or unsafe enforcement.

> This surface defines the upper limit of all structures and natural features beyond the airport boundary.

---

##### **C. Strips (Runway Areas)**

| Runway | Width | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Runway 02–20** | 90 meters wide (45 m on each side of centerline) | 1,378 meters long |
| **Runway 08–26** | 60 meters wide (30 m on each side) | 655 meters long |

> These are the primary operational areas where aircraft take off and land.

---

##### **D. Transitional Surfaces**

| Runway | Slope | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Runway 08–26** | 1:5 (1 m vertical per 5 m horizontal) | Inclined plane rising from lateral edges of the strip and approach surfaces to intersect with the outer surface or adjacent transitional surface. |
| **Runway 02–20** | 1:7 (1 m vertical per 7 m horizontal) | Same as above, but with a gentler slope. |

> Transitional surfaces connect the approach and strip areas to the outer surface and prevent obstructions from forming in the critical approach zones.

---

#### **9. Boundary of Regulated Land Area**

The outer boundary of the regulated land area is defined by a detailed, precise legal description based on **sectional boundaries, road allowances, and land titles** in Manitoba. The description begins at the **southwest corner of the southeast quarter of Section 5, Township 37, Range 27, West of the Principal Meridian** and proceeds through a series of directional movements (northerly, easterly, southerly, westerly) across multiple sections and road allowances, eventually returning to the starting point.

Key features of the boundary include:

- Passage through **Sections 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 36, 31, 30, 19, 24, 13, 14, 15, 16**  
- Crossings of **public roads and property lines** (e.g., Poplar Avenue, Willowrun Drive, Westwind Road)  
- Intersections with **registered land plans** such as:
  - Plan No. 292
  - Plan No. 1582
  - Plan No. 1023
  - Plan No. 2547
  - Plan No. 2776
  - Plan No. 1344

> This boundary ensures that only land **within a defined, geographically accurate zone** around the airport is subject to the zoning restrictions.

#### **10. Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of these zoning regulations are:

1. **To ensure aviation safety** by preventing obstructions to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach.
2. **To maintain clear visual and physical corridors** for pilots, especially in critical approach zones.
3. **To protect against bird-related hazards** by prohibiting the disposal of food or waste that attracts birds.
4. **To provide a legally enforceable framework** based on scientific and operational standards for airport operations.

---

#### **11. Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Require removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions.
- The regulations are enforceable by the federal government under the Aeronautics Act.
-
