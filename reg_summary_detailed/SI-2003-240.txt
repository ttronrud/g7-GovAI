**Key Provisions of the Regulation:**

1. **Transfer of Responsibility:**  
   The regulation formally transfers from the **Minister of Transport** to the **Minister of National Revenue** the following:

   - The **control and supervision** of the **Royal Canadian Mint** (RCM); and  
   - The **powers, duties, and functions** of the Royal Canadian Mint as defined under the *Royal Canadian Mint Act*.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   This transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which permits the Government of Canada to reassign responsibilities among federal ministers in order to improve administrative efficiency, align functions with policy priorities, or ensure better oversight.

3. **Purpose and Rationale (Implied Context):**  
   The transfer reflects a strategic realignment of government responsibilities. The Royal Canadian Mint, historically under the Ministry of Transport, was responsible for the production and distribution of Canadian coins. However, given that the mint’s operations are closely tied to fiscal policy, currency issuance, and revenue collection, the transfer to the **Minister of National Revenue**—a minister directly accountable for taxation, financial policy, and currency regulation—was deemed more appropriate. This ensures that the mint’s activities are better integrated with broader fiscal and monetary policy frameworks.

4. **Scope of Transfer:**  
   The transfer includes all aspects of governance and operational authority related to the Royal Canadian Mint, including:
   - Oversight of mint operations (e.g., coin design, production, quality control);
   - Financial management and budgeting;
   - Regulatory compliance and reporting;
   - Public relations and official representation;
   - Management of the mint’s workforce and facilities.

5. **Continuity of Operations:**  
   The regulation does not disrupt ongoing operations. The Royal Canadian Mint continues to function under the same statutory framework (*Royal Canadian Mint Act*), but now falls under the administrative and policy jurisdiction of the Minister of National Revenue.

6. **Statutory Continuity:**  
   The *Royal Canadian Mint Act* remains in full force. The transfer of control does not alter the legal or constitutional status of the mint; it only changes the ministerial oversight structure.

**Significance of the Transfer:**

- **Policy Alignment:** Places the mint within the broader financial and revenue management domain of the federal government.
- **Improved Oversight:** Enables the Minister of National Revenue to ensure that coinage policies align with national fiscal objectives and monetary stability.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** Streamlines inter-ministerial coordination, reducing duplication and enhancing accountability.
- **Historical Context:** This transfer marked a shift in the federal government’s organizational structure, reflecting evolving priorities in public service management and financial governance.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a formal and legally authorized reallocation of ministerial responsibility for the Royal Canadian Mint. Effective December 12, 2003, the mint’s control and operational functions were transferred from the Minister of Transport to the Minister of National Revenue, based on the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. The move enhances policy coherence and ensures that Canada’s currency production is aligned with national fiscal and monetary strategy. The mint continues to operate under its existing legislation, but now under the supervision of a minister with direct responsibility for national revenue and financial policy.
