The provided text consists entirely of **repeal notices** indicating that specific provisions of a regulation have been **removed or revoked** by subsequent legislation. There is **no active regulation** being summarized — instead, the content reflects that the regulation in question has been **fully repealed**.

### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Nature of the Content**
The list contains repeated entries of the form:
- `[Repealed, SOR/2017-283, s. 1]`
- `[Repealed, SOR/2010-61, s. 2]`
- `[Repealed, SOR/2010-61, s. 3]`

These entries indicate that certain sections (or subsections) of a prior regulation have been **officially repealed** (i.e., canceled or abolished) by amendments or new legislation.

- **SOR** stands for *Statutory Instrument of Regulations* — a type of legal instrument used in Canada to implement or amend laws.
- **SOR/2017-283** and **SOR/2010-61** are specific statutory instruments issued in 2017 and 2010, respectively.
- The "s. 1", "s. 2", "s. 3" refer to **subsections** of a regulation.

#### 2. **Key Observations**
- The repeated nature of the repeals (e.g., 30+ instances of "SOR/2017-283, s. 1") suggests that **multiple subsections** were targeted for repeal.
- The fact that both **SOR/2017-283, s. 1** and **SOR/2010-61, s. 2 and s. 3** are repeatedly listed implies that these were **central or frequently referenced provisions** in the original regulation.
- The regulation referenced has been **fully removed** from force — no active rules or requirements remain.

#### 3. **Legal Implications**
- A regulation that is **repealed** no longer applies.
- Any legal obligations, definitions, or procedures previously governed by those repealed subsections are **no longer in effect**.
- Repeal typically occurs to:
  - Modernize outdated rules
  - Align with current policy
  - Eliminate overlapping or contradictory provisions
  - Reflect changes in legislation or public policy

#### 4. **Contextual Background (Inferred)**
While the specific regulation is not named, the repeated repeal of sections under SOR/2010-61 and SOR/2017-283 suggests this may relate to a **regulation concerning workplace safety, environmental standards, or licensing** — common areas where such repeals occur. For example:
- SOR/2010-61 may have been a regulation related to **occupational health and safety** or **emissions standards**.
- SOR/2017-283 may have been an amendment or replacement instrument that **explicitly revoked** prior sections.

#### 5. **Conclusion**
> **This regulation has been fully repealed and is no longer in force.**  
> All subsections listed (e.g., s. 1 of SOR/2017-283 and s. 2 and s. 3 of SOR/2010-61) have been formally canceled by subsequent legislative action.  
> As a result, **no current legal obligations or requirements** exist under the original regulation.  
> Any reference to this regulation in current legal or administrative contexts should be treated as **outdated or inapplicable**.
