### **Core Provisions of the Remission**

#### **Section 2: Remission of GST/HST on Supplies to IOC or IPC**
- **What is remitted?**  
  VANOC is entitled to a **full remission** of any GST/HST collected or collectible **on supplies of property or services** made to the **IOC or IPC** under the Agreement.
  
- **Purpose of the supply**:  
  The supplies must be made **solely for the purpose of planning, organizing, staging, or broadcasting** the Games.

- **Conditions for remission**:
  1. The tax must have been **collected or become collectible** after **July 1, 2003**, and before **January 1, 2012**.
  2. The remission is **only granted if the amount has not already been rebated, remitted, credited, or refunded** under:
     - The *Financial Administration Act*, or
     - Any other Act of Parliament.

> ⚠️ **Important**: This means VANOC cannot claim remission for taxes already compensated through other mechanisms.

#### **Section 3: Remission of Interest and Penalties**
- If VANOC has **paid interest or penalties** on any amount that qualifies for remission under Section 2, then **interest and penalties are also remitted**.
- **Conditions for remission of interest and penalties**:
  1. A **written application** must be filed with the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years** of the later of:
     - The day the Order comes into effect (date of issuance); and  
     - The day the interest and penalties were actually paid by VANOC.

> 🔍 This ensures timely claims and prevents retroactive or delayed claims.

#### **Section 4: Application Requirements (Timing)**
- For any amount **included in VANOC’s net tax calculation** in a return filed under **Division V of Part IX of the Excise Tax Act** (i.e., in a tax return reporting net tax payable):
  - A **written application for remission** must be submitted **within two years** of the later of:
    - The day the Order is made; and  
    - The end of the reporting period to which the return relates.

> 📝 This creates a **strict deadline** for claiming remission of tax that was included in a tax return.

#### **Section 5: Limitation on Remission**
- Remission is **not available** if the tax liability has already been:
  - Reimbursed,
  - Remitted,
  - Credited,
  - Or refunded  
  to VANOC or any other party under the *Financial Administration Act* or any other federal statute.

> This prevents double benefits and ensures fiscal accountability.
