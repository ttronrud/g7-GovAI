**Detailed Summary of the Regulation on the Import of Eggs for Personal Use (Canada, 1994)**

---

### **Background and Context**

This regulation pertains to the **importation of eggs into Canada**, specifically under the framework of the **Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, which governs the control and permitting of goods entering or leaving Canada. The regulation was issued on **December 29, 1994**, by the **Secretary of State for External Affairs**, and serves to **cancel an existing specific import permit** and **replace it with a general, broad-based permit** for the personal importation of eggs.

The key legal foundations for this action are:

- **Section 6.2(1)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 106): This provision allows the Secretary of State to establish an **import access quantity** for certain goods, including eggs, based on trade and economic considerations.
  
- **Section 10** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*: This grants the Secretary of State the authority to **cancel a specific import permit** and issue a new one, particularly when conditions change or when a more flexible, general authorization is appropriate.

- **Section 8.3(3)** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*: This enables the issuance of a **general permit** for the importation of goods, especially when such importation is for personal or household use and does not require a detailed permit for each shipment.

Additionally, the regulation references **sections 74, 106, 109, and 111** of *An Act to implement the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement)* (S.C. 1994, c. 47). These sections relate to the **liberalization of trade**, including the reduction or elimination of import restrictions on certain goods, and their effective date is a key factor in determining when the new general permit becomes effective.

> **Effective Date**: The permit becomes effective on the **latest of the dates** when sections 74, 106, 109, and 111 of the WTO-implementation Act came into force. This ensures alignment with Canada’s WTO obligations and trade liberalization commitments.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

#### 1. **Cancellation of Previous Permit**
- The **specific Import of Eggs Permit (C.R.C., c. 625)** is **cancelled**.
- This means that prior, more restrictive or individualized import authorizations for eggs are no longer valid.

#### 2. **Issuance of a General Permit**
- A new **General Import Permit No. 8 – Eggs for Personal Use** is issued.
- This permit is **general in scope**, allowing broad access to egg imports without requiring individual applications or detailed justifications.

#### 3. **Definition of "Eggs"**
The term *eggs* is clearly defined as:
- Eggs of **fowls of the species *Gallus domesticus*** (domestic chickens),
- In **shell, fresh, preserved, or cooked form**,
- **Excluding hatching eggs for broilers** (i.e., eggs intended for breeding or raising chicks),
- Classified under specific tariff items in the **Customs Tariff**:
  - Tariff item **0407.11.91**, **0407.21.10**, or **0407.90.11**
  - Heading **98.04** or **98.26** in the List of Tariff Provisions (Schedule to the Customs Tariff)

> This ensures that only commercially relevant, non-broiler eggs are covered under the permit.

#### 4. **Import Quantity Limit**
- Any **resident of Canada** may import eggs **for personal use** and for the **personal household**.
- The **maximum quantity per importation is two dozen (24 eggs)**.
- This limit is designed to prevent large-scale commercial importation and to ensure the permit remains aligned with **personal consumption**.

#### 5. **Reporting Requirements**
- If the imported eggs are subject to reporting under the *Customs Act*, the reporting form must include one of the following statements:
  - **English**: *"Imported under the authority of General Import Permit No. 8 — Eggs for Personal Use"*
  - **French**: *"Importé en vertu de la Licence générale d’importation no 8 — Oeufs pour usage personnel"*

> This ensures transparency and compliance with customs documentation requirements.

### **Purpose and Rationale**

The primary purpose of this regulation is to:

1. **Simplify import procedures** for Canadians who wish to bring eggs into the country for personal or household consumption.
2. **Align with WTO trade liberalization commitments**, which reduce or eliminate unnecessary import controls on goods like food products.
3. **Promote consumer choice and access** to eggs without requiring complex permit applications.
4. **Ensure compliance with tariff classifications and trade regulations**, while maintaining controls to prevent misuse (e.g., importing hatching eggs for commercial broiler production).

### **Legal Status and Repeal**

- The regulation was **originally issued in 1994** and remains in force **until it is repealed**.
- It was **repealed by SOR/97-44, section 2**, which means it is **no longer in effect as of the date of that repeal** (likely 1997).
- However, this repeal may be **historical or transitional**, and the regulation may have been **replaced by updated provisions** in subsequent trade or customs legislation.

> **Note**: The regulation is now **repealed**, so this document is **historical** and not currently active. Its relevance today is limited to understanding past trade policy developments.

### **Summary in One Paragraph**

On December 29, 1994, the Secretary of State for External Affairs cancelled the specific import permit for eggs (C.R.C., c. 625) and issued a general permit (General Import Permit No. 8) allowing Canadian residents to import up to **two dozen eggs per importation** for personal or household use. The eggs must be from *Gallus domesticus*, in shell or cooked form, and classified under specific tariff headings, excluding hatching eggs for broilers. The permit became effective when certain WTO implementation provisions came into force. It required reporting under customs forms with a designated statement. Although issued to promote trade liberalization and consumer access, the permit was **repealed in 1997** (SOR/97-44, s. 2) and is no longer in force.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a **key step in Canada’s integration with global trade systems** under the WTO. It reflects a shift from restrictive, individualized import controls to more **flexible, consumer-oriented policies** for food items like eggs. While it is now **repealed**, it serves as an important historical example of how trade policy can evolve to balance **economic openness**, **consumer access**, and **regulatory compliance**.
