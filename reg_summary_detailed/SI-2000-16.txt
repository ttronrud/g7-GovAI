### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation provides for the **remission (partial forgiveness) of excise tax** that was originally paid or became payable by the **Nova Scotia Public Service Long Term Disability Plan Trust Fund (the "Fund")** during a specific period. The remission is intended to support the financial sustainability of the Fund, which administers long-term disability benefits for public servants in Nova Scotia, and to ensure that such a public service benefit program is not unduly burdened by excise tax obligations.

### **Scope of the Remission**

- **Tax Subject to Remission:** Excise tax under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**  
- **Time Period Covered:**  
  From **July 21, 1993**, to **March 26, 1998**  
- **Amount of Remission:**  
  **One-half (50%)** of the excise tax that was paid or became payable during this period is being remitted.

> This means that the Fund is relieved from paying 50% of the excise tax liability for the specified years. The remaining 50% of the tax remains payable.

### **Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following conditions:

1. **Written Application Required:**  
   The Fund must submit a **formal, written application** to the **Minister of National Revenue** (the federal tax authority) for remission.  
   - This application must be submitted **no later than December 31, 2000**.  
   - Failure to meet this deadline will result in the remission not being granted.

2. **No Prior Rebate, Refund, or Remission:**  
   The remission will **not be granted** if the tax in question has already been:  
   - Rebated  
   - Refunded  
   - Remitted (in whole or in part)  
   This ensures that the remission is applied only once and prevents double relief.

### **Legal and Administrative Context**

- The power to make such a remission is derived from **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which allows the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal government) to make orders to remit taxes when it is in the **public interest**.  
- The Minister of Finance recommended the order based on the public interest, suggesting that the burden of excise tax on a public service benefit fund could negatively affect the availability or affordability of long-term disability benefits for Nova Scotia public servants.

---

### **Key Implications**

- **Financial Relief:** The Fund receives a significant financial benefit by reducing its tax liability by half over a five-year period (1993–1998).  
- **Public Interest Justification:** The remission supports the broader public interest by ensuring that public service employees have access to long-term disability benefits without undue financial strain on the fund.  
- **Timeliness:** The December 31, 2000 deadline creates a clear administrative timeline, ensuring that the remission is not indefinitely delayed and that the Fund has a defined opportunity to act.  
- **Exclusivity:** The remission applies only to the specified period and only if the tax has not already been refunded or remitted.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a targeted fiscal relief measure designed to support the financial health of a public service benefit fund. By remitting half of the excise tax liability incurred between July 1993 and March 1998, the federal government recognizes the importance of long-term disability benefits for public servants and ensures that the fund can continue to operate effectively. However, the measure is conditional and requires timely action by the Fund to qualify for the benefit.

This order reflects a balance between fiscal responsibility and public service welfare, underpinned by clear procedural requirements to prevent abuse or misuse of the remission power.
