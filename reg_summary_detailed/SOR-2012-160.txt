#### **4. Authorized Exports and Transfers**

Under this permit, a **resident of Canada** may export or transfer:

##### **A. Goods (from the Guide)**
The following goods may be exported **except** where explicitly excluded:

| Category | Excluded Subcategories |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Item 1-5.A.2** (Cryptography used in information security) | Excludes items under **1-5.A.2.c** |

| **Item 1-5.B.2** (Cryptography for secure systems) | Excludes goods used in development/production of goods listed in: <br> - (a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (b)(ii); <br> - or specially designed to evaluate/validate information security functions of goods in those categories |
| **Item 1-5.D.2** (Software and cryptographic tools) | Excludes software that: <br> - is used in development/production of goods in (a)(i)-(iii), (c)(ii)-(iii); <br> - has characteristics of goods in (a)(i)-(iii); <br> - performs/simulates functions of those goods; <br> - certifies software in (ii); <br> - is specially designed/modified to support technology used in development/production of goods in (a)(i)-(iii), (b)(i), (ii), or (c)(i)-(iii) |
| **Item 1-5.E.2** (Technology related to cryptography) | Excludes technology used in development/production of goods in: <br> - (a)(i)-(iii), (b)(i), (ii), or (c)(i)-(iii) |

> **Note**: All exports must be **for the sole purpose of development or production of a product**, and must not be used for government-specific or military applications.

#### **5. Recipient Eligibility**

Exports are permitted **only to entities or individuals** that meet **one of the following criteria**:

1. **Controlled by a resident of Canada** (e.g., a Canadian-owned company).
2. **An individual** who:
   - Is not acting on behalf of a foreign government,
   - Ordinarily resides in a **designated country**.
3. **An entity** (non-governmental) that:

   - Has its **head office located in a designated country**.

> ❌ **Prohibited Recipients**:
> - Any country classified as an **ineligible destination**.
> - Any country listed on the **Area Control List** (e.g., regions of high proliferation risk).
> - Any country subject to sanctions under:
>   - *Special Economic Measures Act* (SEMA) – e.g., due to human rights violations.

#### **6. Prohibited Uses and Restrictions**

Exports under this permit are **not authorized** if:

- The good or technology is intended for **any use other than development or production of a product**.
- It is used in the development or production of a product intended for:
  - **Exclusive use by the Government of Canada**.
  - **Exclusive use by a foreign government**.
- It is also listed in **any other item of the Guide** (outside the scope of Section 2), **unless** authorized by a **separate export permit** issued under subsection 7(1.1) of the EIPA.

> This ensures that cryptographic tools are not diverted to national security or intelligence uses without additional approval.

#### **7. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements**

All persons exporting or transferring goods under this permit must comply with strict reporting obligations:

##### **A. Pre-Export Submission (Before First Export in Calendar Year)**

#### **8. Key Compliance and Enforcement Notes**

- **No Automatic Authorization**: This is a *general* permit, not a blanket license. Each export must still comply with all restrictions and definitions.
- **Oversight by ECD**: The Export Controls Division retains authority to monitor, inspect, and enforce compliance.
- **No Export to Sanctioned Entities or Countries**: Even if the destination is a designated country, the recipient must meet the eligibility criteria (e.g., not a government entity).
- **Purpose Limitation**: The only allowed use is **development or production of a product** — not for surveillance, intelligence, or defense.

#### **9. Strategic Implications**

- **Supports Innovation**: Enables Canadian companies and researchers to collaborate internationally on secure software and cryptographic solutions.
- **Balances Openness and Security**: Allows limited access to cryptography for legitimate commercial and industrial development while preventing misuse.
