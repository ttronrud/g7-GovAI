- **Legal Basis**: The Order is issued under **Section 23 of the Financial Administration Act**, which empowers the federal government to make remission orders in the public interest.
- **Objective**: To grant a **remission (i.e., reduction or forgiveness)** of certain tax liabilities under the *Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act* (PGRTA) for **Soquip Alberta Inc.** (the "Corporation").

---

#### **2. Name and Citation**
- The Order is officially titled:  
  **Soquip Alberta Inc. (Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act) Remission Order**  
- It may be cited as such in legal and administrative contexts.

---

#### **3. Key Definitions**
- **Act**: Refers to the *Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax Act* (PGRTA), which governs the taxation of petroleum and gas revenues in Canada.
- **Corporation**: Specifically refers to **Soquip Alberta Inc.**, the company affected by this remission.
- **Net Tax**:
  - Defined as the **difference** between:
    - The **total amount of tax assessed** under the PGRTA that is payable by the Corporation
    - The **total amount deemed to have been paid** by the Corporation under the Act, plus any **similar amounts** (e.g., payments made under related provisions or in kind).
  - In simpler terms: *Net tax = Total assessed tax – Total payments already made (including deemed payments)*.

---

#### **4. Scope of Remission**
The Order grants a **remission of the net tax** to the Corporation under the following conditions:

##### **A. Remission of Net Tax**
- The Corporation is entitled to a **full remission** of its **net tax** (as defined above), **up to the amount** of:
  - Grants paid by the Corporation **or**  
  - Grants paid by the **Province of Quebec**  
    to the **Receiver General for Canada**,  
    **within 30 days** of the date this Order is made.

> 🔍 **Key Point**: The remission is not unlimited. It is capped at the total value of qualifying grants made within 30 days of the Order’s issuance. This ensures that the remission is directly linked to financial support provided to the federal government.

##### **B. Remission of Interest and Penalties**

  - **Interest**  
  - **Penalties**  
    that would have been payable in respect of the **net tax** that is remitted under Section 3.

---
