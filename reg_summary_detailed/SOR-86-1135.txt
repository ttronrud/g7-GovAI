**Detailed Summary of the Deer Lake Airport Zoning Regulations (S.C. 1985, c. 28, s. 1)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Deer Lake Airport Zoning Regulations* are a set of official rules established under the **Aeronautics Act** of Canada, specifically pursuant to **Sections 4.4 and 4.5**. These regulations were adopted by the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, to ensure the safe operation of Deer Lake Airport by controlling land use and structures in its vicinity.

The regulations were first proposed and published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 22, 1986**, giving interested parties a reasonable opportunity to submit representations before final adoption. This procedural step ensures transparency and public participation in aviation-related zoning decisions.

These regulations apply to all lands adjacent to or near Deer Lake Airport and establish strict limits on construction, elevation, and environmental practices to minimize hazards to aircraft during takeoff, landing, and approach phases.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations define several key terms used throughout:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | Refers specifically to Deer Lake Airport located in the District of Humber Valley, Province of Newfoundland. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed reference point used for measuring elevations and distances. It is located 975.36 m southwesterly along the centerline of runway 07-25, then 152.40 m northwesterly at right angles from that point. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of the runway (07 and 25). It rises at a 1:50 slope (1 meter vertically per 50 meters horizontally) to a horizontal line 300 meters above the end of the runway, located 15,000 meters horizontally from the runway end. The outer ends of this line are 2,400 meters from the runway centerline. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal plane located at **45 meters above the ARP elevation** (15.24 m above sea level), unless the ground elevation is less than 9 meters, in which case it is set at **9 meters above ground level**. This surface defines the upper boundary for all structures and natural features. |
| **Strip** | The main runway area associated with runway 07-25, measuring **300 meters wide**, **1,948.8 meters long**, and extending 150 meters on each side of the centerline. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined plane rising at a 1:7 slope (1 meter vertically per 7 meters horizontally) from the lateral edges of the strip and its approach surfaces, extending upward until it intersects the outer surface. |

> **Assigned Elevation of ARP**: 15.24 meters above sea level.

### **Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to:

1. **All lands within the outer limits** of the lands described in **Part VI of the Schedule** (a circular area with a radius of 4,000 meters from the ARP).
2. **All lands directly under the portions of the approach surfaces** that extend beyond the outer limits.

This includes public road allowances and private lands adjacent to the airport.

---

### **Prohibited Actions – Structural Elevation Restrictions**

No person may:

- **Erect or construct** any building, structure, or object (or add to an existing one) where the **highest point** of that object exceeds:
  - The **approach surface**,
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface**.

This restriction is designed to prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft during critical flight phases—especially during approach and landing.

> **Exception**: Natural growth (e.g., trees, shrubs) that exceeds the surface elevations may be subject to removal if it poses a hazard.

---

### **Regulation on Waste Disposal**

No owner or occupier of land covered by these regulations may:

- Allow the land to be used for the **disposal of waste that is edible or attractive to birds**.

This provision is critical to prevent bird attraction near the airport, which can lead to dangerous bird strikes with aircraft.

---

### **Surface Descriptions and Mapping**

All surfaces are defined in detail and referenced to **Public Works Canada Zoning Plans (S-441-1 to S-441-8)** dated **November 30, 1984**. These plans serve as official technical drawings that illustrate:

- The **airport reference point**
- The **approach surfaces** (for runways 07 and 25)
- The **outer surface**
- The **strip** (runway area)
- The **transitional surfaces**
- The **outer boundary** (a circle of 4,000 meters radius centered at the ARP)

These maps provide precise geometric and dimensional data essential for compliance and enforcement.

---

### **Key Design Features and Safety Rationale**

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Approach Surfaces (1:50 slope)** | Prevents obstructions from interfering with aircraft during approach, especially at long distances (up to 15,000 meters). |
| **Outer Surface (45 m above ARP)** | Creates a safe zone above the airport where no structure may exceed this height, protecting aircraft from high-altitude hazards. |
| **Transitional Surfaces (1:7 slope)** | Gradually transitions from the strip edges to the outer surface, ensuring smooth and safe flight paths. |
| **4,000-meter radius boundary** | Defines the maximum area under regulation, balancing safety with land use flexibility. |

---

### **Enforcement and Compliance**

- The **Minister of Transport** has the authority to:
  - Issue directives to remove **excessive natural growth** (e.g., trees or shrubs) that exceed the defined surfaces.
  - Enforce compliance with structural and waste disposal rules.

- Landowners and occupiers are legally responsible for ensuring that their properties do not violate these limits.

---

### **Legal Basis and Authority**

- **Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act** authorizes the Minister of Transport to make zoning regulations for airports.
- **Section 4.5** requires that proposed regulations be published in the *Canada Gazette* and allow public comment before finalization.

This ensures that the regulations are both **legally sound** and **democratically accountable**.

---

### **Significance and Impact**

These regulations are vital for:

- **Aviation safety** at Deer Lake Airport
- **Prevention of bird strikes** through waste control
- **Protection of flight paths** from physical obstructions
- **Clear legal boundaries** for land use near the airport

They represent a model of how federal aviation policy integrates technical precision with environmental and community considerations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Deer Lake Airport Zoning Regulations* establish a comprehensive, science-based framework for managing land use around a small regional airport. By defining precise elevation limits for approach, transition, and outer surfaces, and by restricting waste disposal and construction, the regulations significantly enhance flight safety. The use of detailed technical plans and a clear public consultation process underscores the regulatory framework's transparency, accountability, and effectiveness.

These rules remain in force and are referenced in aviation safety planning, land development, and environmental management in Newfoundland and Labrador.
