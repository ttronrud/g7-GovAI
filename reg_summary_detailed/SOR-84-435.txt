### **Detailed Summary of the Uranium Mines (Ontario) Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Purpose**

The **Uranium Mines (Ontario) Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** were established to address a critical gap in occupational health and safety governance within uranium mining operations in the **Province of Ontario**.

- **Problem Identified**:  
  Prior to these regulations, the application of **Part IV of the Canada Labour Code**—which governs employment and occupational health and safety in federal workplaces—was not uniform with Ontario’s existing provincial laws governing health and safety in other types of mines. This inconsistency created legal ambiguity and potential risks for workers in uranium mines, which are highly regulated due to their unique hazards (radiation, toxic chemicals, etc.).

- **Legal Basis**:  
  The regulations were enacted under **section 9 of the Atomic Energy Control Act (AECA)**, which empowers the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) to make regulations concerning occupational health and safety in uranium mines, after consultation with industry, labor, and government stakeholders.

- **Objective**:  
  To ensure **uniformity** and **compliance** with occupational health and safety standards across all mines—including uranium mines—in Ontario by aligning them with the broader provincial framework under the **Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHS Act)**.

---

#### **2. Legal Authority and Approval**

- **Approving Body**:  
  Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources**, approved the regulations.

- **Effective Date**:  
  The regulations came into force on **July 1, 1984**.

- **Citation**:  
  The regulations are officially known as the **Uranium Mines (Ontario) Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulations define key terms used throughout to ensure clarity and consistency:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | The *Occupational Health and Safety Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980* (as it read on March 19, 1984, and as amended by Schedule III). |
| **Employer** | Any individual or entity that employs workers or contracts for services, including contractors and subcontractors. |
| **Owner** | Includes trustees, lessees, tenants, mortgagees, or agents acting on behalf of landowners. |
| **Project** | Encompasses construction, mining development, excavation, and any work related to such activities. |
| **Supervisor** | A person in charge of a workplace or with authority over workers. |
| **Worker** | A person performing work for monetary compensation; excludes inmates or patients in rehabilitation programs. |
| **Licensee** | Any person authorized by the AECB to operate a uranium mining facility. |
| **Director / Inspector** | Appointed officials from the Ontario Ministry of Labour with enforcement authority. |
| **Engineer of the Ministry** | A registered or licensed professional engineer employed by the Ministry. |
| **Medical Officer of Health** | As defined under the *Health Protection and Promotion Act, 1983*. |
| **Officer** | Includes the Minister, Deputy Minister, Directors, Inspectors, Engineers, Medical Officers, and their authorized delegates. |

> These definitions mirror those in the OHS Act, ensuring consistency in rights and responsibilities.

#### **4. Scope of Application**

The regulations apply to all parties involved in uranium mining operations in Ontario:

- **Licensees**: Must operate every uranium mining facility in compliance with both the OHS Act and these regulations.
- **Owners**: Must ensure compliance with health and safety standards.
- **Workers and Supervisors**: Must follow all applicable rules and orders.
- **Employers**: Must provide safe working conditions and comply with all requirements.
- **Constructors**: Those involved in building or developing mining infrastructure must comply.
- **Suppliers**: Persons supplying materials or services to the facility must adhere to safety standards.
- **All persons on premises**: Including visitors and contractors, must follow health and safety rules.

> This broad scope ensures comprehensive coverage of all stakeholders.

---

#### **5. Rights and Powers**

- **Equal Rights and Powers**:  
  All parties—owners, workers, supervisors, employers, constructors, and health and safety representatives—are granted **the same rights and powers** as under the OHS Act or its regulations.

- **Officer Powers**:  
  Officers (e.g., inspectors, directors) are granted **the same powers and duties** as under the OHS Act.  
  However, **subsection 20(6)** of the OHS Act—relating to powers of a board chairman—is **excluded** from interpretation in this context. This ensures that enforcement powers are not expanded beyond what is necessary or appropriate for uranium mine safety.

---

#### **6. Exclusions and Modifications to the OHS Act**

To tailor enforcement to the specific risks of uranium mining, several provisions of the OHS Act are **modified or excluded**:

| Exclusion/Modification | Explanation |
|------------------------|-----------|
| **Subsection 9(1), Sections 10–12, and Subsections 20(10), 24(2)–(8)** | These provisions do **not apply** to the administration or enforcement of these regulations. This streamlines enforcement and avoids overlap with general OHS procedures. |
| **Subsection 28(2)** | Applies **as if** it referenced *section 443 of the Criminal Code* instead of *section 142 of the Provincial Offences Act*. This strengthens penalties for contraventions by aligning them with more serious criminal offenses. |
| **Part IX of the OHS Act** | Does **not apply** to violations of these regulations. This prevents the application of civil penalties (e.g., for breach of duty) in favor of more direct enforcement mechanisms. |

> These exclusions reflect the **specialized and high-risk nature** of uranium mining, requiring stronger, more direct enforcement mechanisms.

---

#### **7. Precedence in Case of Conflict**

- In the event of **inconsistency** between these regulations and the **Atomic Energy Control Regulations (AECR)**, the **AECR prevails** to the extent of the inconsistency.  
> This ensures that nuclear safety and radiation protection requirements take priority over general occupational health and safety rules.

---

#### **8. Incorporation of Other Regulations**

The regulations **incorporate or reference** several existing Ontario OHS regulations, which are deemed to be part of this framework. These include:

| Regulation | Key Provisions |
|----------|----------------|
| **Regulation respecting benzene (732/84)** | Excludes section 18; otherwise applies. Benzene exposure is a known hazard in mining environments. |
| **Regulation respecting acrylonitrile (733/84)** | Excludes section 18; otherwise applies. Acrylonitrile is a toxic chemical used in processing. |
| **Regulation respecting asbestos (654/85)** | Applies to construction and repair operations. Asbestos is a major hazard in older mining infrastructure. |
| **Regulation respecting control of exposure to biological or chemical agents (654/86)** | Applies except sections 10–12. Focuses on managing exposure to hazardous substances. |
