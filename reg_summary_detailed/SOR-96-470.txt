## 📋 Workforce Survey Requirements

### 1. **Mandatory Workforce Survey**
Before preparing an employment equity plan, employers must conduct a **workforce survey** by providing each employee with a **workforce survey questionnaire**.

#### Required Questions:
- Whether the employee is:
  - A member of a **visible minority**;
  - A **person with a disability**;
  - An **Aboriginal person**.

#### Survey Design & Compliance:
- Must include **clear definitions** of:
  - Aboriginal peoples;
  - Members of visible minorities;
  - Persons with disabilities;
  *(As defined in Section 3 of the EEA)*
- Must inform employees that:
  - Responses are **voluntary**;
  - Information is **confidential** and will **only be used internally** to fulfill EEA obligations;
  - Employees may be members of **more than one group**.

#### Exceptions:
An employer is **not required** to conduct a new survey if:
- A prior survey was conducted **before these regulations came into force**;
- The prior survey had **similar questions and methodology**;
- Responses were **voluntary**;
- Results have been **kept up to date** in accordance with **Section 5** of the Act (i.e., updated when employees change roles or leave).

> ✅ *This allows for continuity and avoids redundant data collection where valid historical data exists.*

## 📊 Workforce Analysis Requirements

After collecting survey data, the employer must conduct a **workforce analysis** to determine:

### 1. **Representation by Designated Groups** in each occupational group:
- Aboriginal peoples;
- Persons with disabilities;
- Members of visible minorities;
- Women.

### 2. **Underrepresentation Determination**
Compare representation of each group in the employer’s workforce to:
- The **Canadian workforce as a whole**, or
- **Specific segments** of the Canadian workforce (e.g., by qualification, eligibility, or geographic region) from which the employer may reasonably draw employees.

> 📌 *Example:* A tech company may compare its representation of Indigenous women to the proportion of Indigenous women in the Canadian IT sector.

### 3. **Use of Labour Market Data**
Employers must use **labour market information** provided by the Minister under **Section 42(3)** of the EEA — or other relevant data — to assess representation in the relevant geographic or demographic segments.

> 🔍 *This ensures that comparisons are fair and based on real labour market conditions, not assumptions.*

### 4. **Exemption from Re-analysis**
An employer is **not required** to conduct a new analysis if:
- The previous analysis is **up to date** due to periodic revisions;
- The results are **likely to be the same** as those from a new analysis.

> This promotes efficiency and reduces administrative burden.

## 🔍 Employment Systems Review

If underrepresentation is identified in any occupational group, the employer must conduct a **review of employment systems, policies, and practices** to identify **employment barriers**.

### Areas of Review:
1. **Recruitment & Hiring**  
2. **Selection & Screening Processes**  
3. **Development & Training Programs**  
4. **Promotion & Advancement Opportunities**  
5. **Retention & Termination Practices**  
6. **Reasonable Accommodation of Special Needs** (e.g., for persons with disabilities)

> ✅ *The review must be comprehensive and evidence-based.*

### Follow-Up Review:
If new policies or practices are introduced (e.g., a new hiring process), the employer must **review those changes** to ensure they do not create new barriers.

### Exemption from Re-review:
If a prior review was conducted and results are **likely to remain valid**, no new review is required.
