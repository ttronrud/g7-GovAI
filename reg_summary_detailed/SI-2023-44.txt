### **Summary of the Regulation**

**1. Repeal of Prior Order in Council**  
The Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2021-949**, issued on October 26, 2021.  
- This prior order had previously designated a different individual or set of responsibilities for overseeing the implementation of the National Housing Act.  
- By repealing this order, the government formally removes the previous designation or assignment of ministerial responsibility under the Act, effectively ending any prior ministerial arrangement that was in place at that time.

**2. Designation of a New Minister**  
The regulation **designates the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** as the **Minister for the purposes of the National Housing Act**.  
- This designation means that the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities is now officially responsible for the administration, oversight, and implementation of the provisions of the National Housing Act.  
- The Minister is also recognized as a **member of the King’s Privy Council for Canada**, which is a formal recognition of their status and authority in federal governance.

**3. Legal Basis**  
- The action is taken under **Section 2 of the National Housing Act**, which defines the term "Minister" for the purposes of the Act.  
- This section provides the legal authority for the Governor General in Council to assign or designate a minister to act in a specific capacity under the legislation.

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
- This change streamlines the federal government’s housing policy framework by assigning clear accountability to a specific minister.  
- It ensures that the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities has direct responsibility for housing-related initiatives, programs, and policy development under the National Housing Act.  
- It may reflect a strategic shift in government priorities, aligning housing policy more closely with infrastructure and community development goals.

**5. Effective Date and Authority**  
- The regulation is issued under the authority of the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, which is the standard mechanism for implementing ministerial designations in Canadian federal legislation.  
- The order becomes effective upon publication in the Canada Gazette and is binding on all relevant federal departments and agencies.

### **Key Takeaways**
- The government is **removing an outdated or superseded ministerial assignment** (P.C. 2021-949).  
- It is **designating the current Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** as the official minister responsible for the National Housing Act.  
- This reflects a formal and legally grounded reorganization of ministerial responsibilities to improve coordination and accountability in housing policy.  
- The designation is not merely administrative—it carries legal weight under the Act and affects how housing programs are managed, funded, and evaluated.
