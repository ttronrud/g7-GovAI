## 📚 Key Definitions and Interpretations

### 1. **Core Definitions (Applicable to the Act and Specific Provisions)**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Excise Tax Act*. |
| **Imported Taxable Supply** | Same meaning as in section 217 of the Act — goods or services brought into Canada from outside or from another province. |
| **Provincial Investment Plan (PIP)** | A financial institution whose units are **only sold in one province**. Must meet one of three criteria:<br>• It is a financial institution under section 11 of the *Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations* and its units are restricted to sale in a specific province;<br>• It is a stratified investment plan where all series are provincial series for that province;<br>• It has a permanent establishment only in that province during the taxation year (as defined under section 3 of the Attribution Method Regulations). |
| **Provincial Series** | A subset of a financial institution’s investment offerings where units are **only available for sale in one province**. |
| **Provincial Stratified Investment Plan** | A stratified investment plan (not a PIP) that includes one or more provincial series. |
| **Series / Unit** | As defined in subsection 1(1) of the *Selected Listed Financial Institutions Attribution Method (GST/HST) Regulations*. |

> These definitions are **applicable to subsections 218.1(1), (1.2), 220.07(1)–(4), and 220.08(1)** of the Act, as adapted by these regulations.

## 🏛️ Special Classes of Tax-Exempt Persons (Section 132.1(3))

For the purpose of **exemption from HST**, the following are prescribed:

- Charities  
- Non-profit organizations  
- Selected public service bodies (as defined in subsection 259(1) of the Act)

> A person in this category is deemed to have a **permanent establishment** in a province **if it were a corporation** and its activities constitute a **business** under the *Income Tax Act*.

> ⚠️ This provision was **repealed** by SOR/2019-59, s. 28 — **no longer in force**.

---

## 🚗 Vehicle/Allowance Tax Rules (Paragraph 174(f))

For **allowances paid for motor vehicle use**:

- If **all or substantially all** of the supplies or vehicle use occurs in **one participating province**, the tax rate is:
  > HST rate (from subsection 165(1)) + **the province’s HST rate**

- If the supplies or use occur in **two or more provinces**, the tax rate is:
  > HST rate + **the lowest HST rate** among the participating provinces.

> This ensures that the tax burden is proportional to where the activity occurs.

---

## 🚫 Exclusion of Certain HST Rules (Subsections 178.3(5), (6), 178.4(5), (6))

> These rules **do not apply** to **supplies of exclusive products made by independent sales contractors**.

> This means that HST rules related to **tax on internal charges or expenses** do **not apply** in such cases — simplifying compliance for independent contractors.

---

## 🚘 Vehicle Importation Rules (Description of I in Paragraph 202(4)(b))

For **bringing a vehicle or aircraft into a participating province**:

- **If brought from another participating province**:
  - Tax rate = **HST rate of destination province** – **HST rate of origin province**
  - This creates a **tax differential** based on provincial rates.

- **In any other case** (e.g., from non-participating province or domestic movement):
  - Tax rate = **0%**

> This reflects the principle that **inter-provincial movement between HST provinces** is taxed at the difference between the rates, while movement into non-HST provinces is exempt.

---

## 📏 Provincial Rate and Specified Item Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Provincial Rate** | - In a **participating province**: the HST rate of that province<br>- In a **non-participating province**: 0% |
| **Specified Item (in respect of a province)** | Property or service listed in a **schedule to the Deduction for Provincial Rebate (GST/HST) Regulations**, and for which a **provincial rebate or credit** may be paid by provincial legislation. |

> Example: Certain vehicles, services, or goods may qualify as "specified items" in Ontario, allowing provincial rebates.

## 📦 Application of HST to Imported Supplies (Section 218.1(1))

### When a recipient is a **Provincial Investment Plan or Stratified Investment Plan**

If a person receives an imported taxable supply (property or service) and is a **provincial investment plan or stratified investment plan** at the time the consideration becomes due or is paid, **additional HST must be paid**.

#### Formula:
> **Additional Tax = (Tax Rate for Province) × (Value of Consideration) × (Extent of Use in Province)**

Where:

| Case | Extent of Use |
|------|---------------|
| **Provincial Stratified Investment Plan** | Sum of all percentages (from section 51 of the Attribution Method Regulations) indicating how much of the property/service was used for activities related to a **provincial series** in that province |
| **Provincial Investment Plan (for the province)** | 100% |
| **Provincial Investment Plan (for another province)** | 0% |

> Applies to both **intangible personal property** (e.g., software, licenses) and **physical goods** (e.g., equipment, machinery) under paragraph (b) of *imported taxable supply*.

---

## 🚨 Threshold for Exemption (Paragraph 218.1(1)(a))

If a **provincial stratified investment plan** receives an imported supply of intangible personal property or service, and the **total extent of use** in participating provinces is **less than 10%** of total use across all provinces, then:

> **No additional HST is payable** under section 218.1(1)(a).

> Formula to determine threshold:
> > (Total extent of use in participating provinces) / (Total extent of use in all provinces) < 10%

> This provides **exemption** for minor or non-provincial usage.

## 💼 Qualifying Taxpayers and Internal/External Charges (Section 218.1(1.2))

If a **qualifying taxpayer** (as defined in subsection 217.1(1)) is a **provincial investment plan or stratified investment plan** during a fiscal year ending in a specified year, then:

> Additional tax must be paid on **internal and external charges** and **qualifying consideration** — **only to the extent** that the outlay or expense relates to activities in a **particular participating province**.

### Tax Calculation:

#### 1. **Internal Charges** (e.g., administrative costs)
> Tax = (Sum of internal charges > 0) × (Provincial rate) × (Extent of use in province)

- **Extent of use** = Percentage of internal charge attributable to consumption/use/supply of property/service in a provincial series.

#### 2. **External Charges** (e.g., third-party expenses)
> Tax = (Sum of external charges > 0) × (Provincial rate) × (Extent of use in province)

- Same extent calculation as above.

#### 3. **Qualifying Consideration** (e.g., fees, commissions)
> Tax = (Sum of qualifying consideration > 0) × (Provincial rate) × (Extent of use in province)

> All are calculated using the **extent of use** determined under **section 5
