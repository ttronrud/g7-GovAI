**Regulatory Summary:**

**Regulation Type:** Order in Council (OIC)  
**Legal Authority:** Financial Administration Act (R.S., c. F-11)  
**Effective Date:** Implied upon publication (no specific date provided in the text)  
**Issued By:** Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister  

---

### **Key Provisions:**

1. **Repeal of Previous Order in Council:**
   - The regulation formally **repeals Order in Council P.C. 2011-585**, issued on May 18, 2011.
   - This prior order had previously designated a different Minister as the "appropriate Minister" for the Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC) under the Financial Administration Act.
   - By repealing this order, the government removes the previous designation and eliminates any legal or administrative effect of that earlier decision.

2. **Designation of the New Appropriate Minister:**
   - The regulation **designates the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** as the **appropriate Minister** for the Canada Lands Company Limited.
   - This designation is made under two specific provisions of the Financial Administration Act:
     - **Paragraph (d) of the definition of "appropriate Minister" in section 2** of the Act, which allows for ministerial designation based on policy or administrative responsibility.
     - **Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition in subsection 83(1)** of the Act, which governs the appointment of an appropriate Minister for the purpose of managing or overseeing certain Crown corporations or entities, such as the Canada Lands Company Limited.

---

### **Purpose and Significance:**

- The change reflects a **shift in ministerial oversight** of the Canada Lands Company Limited (CLC), a Crown corporation responsible for managing and developing federal lands and associated infrastructure.
- The designation of the **Minister of Infrastructure and Communities** signals that the management and strategic direction of CLC’s operations—particularly those related to land use, infrastructure development, and community planning—are now aligned with the portfolio of infrastructure and community development.
- This reallocation ensures that CLC’s activities are coordinated with broader federal priorities in infrastructure investment, community development, and sustainable land use.

---

### **Legal and Administrative Context:**

- The **Financial Administration Act** establishes the framework for how federal departments and agencies are governed and how certain Crown entities (like CLC) are managed.
- The term "appropriate Minister" is critical because it determines who has the authority to approve financial decisions, budget allocations, and policy direction for a Crown corporation.
- By designating a specific minister, the government ensures accountability, policy coherence, and administrative efficiency in the management of CLC.

---

### **Implications:**

- **Operational Oversight:** The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities will now have direct responsibility for the financial, strategic, and operational decisions related to CLC.
- **Policy Alignment:** CLC’s activities will now be integrated into the broader national infrastructure and community development agenda.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** The change enhances transparency by clearly assigning responsibility and ensures that CLC’s work is subject to the oversight of a minister with relevant policy expertise.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation represents a formal administrative update to the governance structure of the Canada Lands Company Limited. It removes outdated ministerial designations and assigns oversight to a current minister whose portfolio aligns with the strategic mission of CLC. The move strengthens accountability and ensures that CLC’s operations are effectively integrated into federal infrastructure and community development priorities under the Financial Administration Act.

---

**Note:** The regulation is a standard administrative instrument used by the federal government to realign ministerial responsibilities and ensure that Crown corporations operate under the appropriate policy and oversight framework.
