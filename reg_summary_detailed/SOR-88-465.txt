---

### **5. Key Provision: Marketing Restrictions**
> **No producer may market chicken in interprovincial or export trade unless exempted by order of the Manitoba Chicken Broiler Producers’ Marketing Board.**

#### Interpretation:
- This provision establishes a **strict requirement** that **only producers who are formally approved or exempted** by the Marketing Board may engage in interprovincial or export sales.
- It effectively creates a **market access barrier**, ensuring that only those who meet certain criteria (e.g., compliance with quality standards, market stability, or participation in a cooperative structure) can sell their chicken outside Manitoba.
- The exemption process is **controlled by the Board**, which has the authority to determine eligibility based on factors such as:
  - Market capacity;
  - Compliance with quality and safety standards;
  - Fair competition;
  - Economic sustainability of the industry.

#### Purpose:
- Prevents unregulated or competitive dumping of chicken from small or uncoordinated producers.
- Protects the interests of Manitoba producers by ensuring that marketing is conducted through organized, stable, and equitable channels.
- Promotes **market stability** and **fair pricing** in both domestic and international markets.

---

### **6. Implications and Industry Impact**
- **Producers must apply for exemption** to market chicken outside Manitoba.
- The Board may impose conditions on exemptions (e.g., minimum volume, quality standards, compliance with labeling or traceability requirements).
- This regulation supports a **cooperative marketing model**, where the Board acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that the interests of producers are protected.
- It may also serve as a tool to **manage supply and demand**, prevent oversupply, and maintain consistent product quality in export markets.

---

### **7. Exclusions**
- The regulation **does not apply** to:
  - **Packing and storing of chicken on the producer’s own premises**.
  - Activities that are purely internal or non-marketing in nature (e.g., storage for future sale within the province).

---

### **8. Enforcement and Oversight**
- The **Manitoba Chicken Broiler Producers’ Marketing Board** is responsible for:
  - Reviewing applications for exemption;
  - Issuing or denying exemptions;
  - Monitoring compliance with the Order;
  - Ensuring that marketing activities align with the goals of fair competition and market stability.

---

### **9. Historical and Contextual Background**
- This Order was originally introduced in **1982 (SOR/82-668)** as part of broader efforts to regulate the chicken industry in Manitoba.
- The 1988 date of issuance reflects a potential update or clarification of the original provisions, possibly in response to changes in market conditions, export demand, or producer concerns.
- It reflects a **producers’ cooperative approach** to managing a commodity market, common in agricultural sectors where small-scale producers face challenges in competing with larger, more efficient operations.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Manitoba Chicken Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Order** is a targeted regulatory measure designed to:
- **Restrict direct marketing** of Manitoba-raised chicken outside the province and abroad;
- **Ensure market fairness and stability**;
- **Protect producers** from market volatility and predatory competition;
- **Maintain quality and traceability** in export and interprovincial sales.

By requiring producers to obtain **formal exemption from the Marketing Board**, the Order establishes a structured, controlled pathway for marketing chicken, promoting long-term sustainability and equitable participation in national and international markets.
