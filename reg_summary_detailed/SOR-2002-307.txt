The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2016-307, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Date/Effective Date**: The repeal took effect as part of **SOR/2016-307**, which is a *Statutory Instrument of Ontario* (a type of regulatory or legislative document issued under provincial authority).
- **Section Repealed**: **Section 5** of SOR/2016-307.
- **Implication**: The specific rule, provision, or requirement that was previously set out in Section 5 of that instrument is no longer in force. It has been formally removed from the legal framework and is not applicable anymore.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the exact reason for repeal is not specified in the provided text, such repeals typically occur when:
  - The regulation is outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It conflicts with newer legislation.
  - It is redundant or superseded by a more comprehensive or updated regulation.
  - It was found to be ineffective or causing administrative or legal confusion.

### Key Notes:
- The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2016-307, s. 5]" appearing multiple times) likely reflect a formatting or data duplication issue in the original source, rather than indicating multiple distinct regulations.
- SOR/2016-307 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued by the Government of Ontario, typically used to implement or amend laws passed by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.
- Section 5 of this instrument, having been repealed, is no longer enforceable or binding.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text — the provision formerly contained in **Section 5 of SOR/2016-307** — has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. This means that any legal obligations, definitions, or requirements previously set out in that section are nullified and do not apply under current Ontario law. For accurate and up-to-date legal information, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulatory framework, as the repealed section is no longer part of the legal landscape.
