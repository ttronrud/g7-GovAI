**Detailed Summary of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission By-laws (S.C. 1997, c. 9, effective May 31, 2000)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Purpose**
The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has issued these **By-laws** under **Section 15 of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA)**. These by-laws establish internal governance procedures for the Commission and its panels, particularly regarding the **management, conduct, and procedural framework** of meetings and decision-making processes.

Importantly, these by-laws **supplement and apply to the rules of procedure** already established in the *Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure*. They are specifically designed to govern **procedures not already prescribed** in those rules.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The by-laws define key terms used throughout:
- **Act**: Refers to the *Nuclear Safety and Control Act*, which provides the legal foundation for the CNSC’s mandate.
- **Commission**: The regulatory body established under Section 8 of the Act.
- **Meeting**: A gathering of Commission members or a panel convened for administrative or decision-making purposes.
- **Member**: A person appointed to the Commission under Section 10 of the Act.
- **Panel**: A subgroup of Commission members formed by the President under Section 22 of the Act to handle specific tasks or investigations.
- **President**: The designated head of the Commission under subsection 10(3) of the Act.
- **Secretary**: The officer appointed under Section 16 of the Act to manage administrative functions.

---

### **3. Scope and Application**
These by-laws apply to:
- The **management and conduct of the Commission’s affairs**.
- The **procedures for meetings and decisions** of both the full Commission and any panel.
- **Procedural matters not covered** by the existing *Rules of Procedure*.

This ensures clarity and consistency in how the Commission operates internally, especially in areas where specific procedural rules are not already in place.

---

### **4. Authority to Act in the President’s Absence**
In the event that:
- The **President is absent**, 
- **Incapacitated**, or  
- The **office of President is vacant**,  
and the Commission has **not designated a replacement** under Section 12(2) of the Act,

Then the **Secretary** (or, if unavailable, a **Director General**) may:
- Sign and issue **transfer orders, assignments, contracts, certificates, permits, licenses, approvals, orders, directions**, or other official instruments authorized by the Commission.

This ensures continuity of operations and regulatory functions even during leadership gaps.

---

### **5. Corporate Seal and Record-Keeping**
- The **Secretary is responsible** for maintaining the **corporate seal** of the Commission.
- The seal must be **affixed to any record** that the Commission directs (e.g., official documents, decisions, or approvals).

This provides a formal and legally binding element to official communications and decisions.

---

### **6. Duties of the Secretary**
The Secretary is required to:
- Carry out all duties assigned by the **President** or as required by these by-laws.

This includes administrative, procedural, and record-keeping responsibilities.

---

### **7. Convening and Conduct of Meetings**
- Meetings may be **convened by the Commission or by the President**.
- They may be held at **any time and place** determined by the convenor.
- Meetings may be held either in **public** or in **closed session**, depending on the nature of the matter.

#### **Notice Requirements**
- **Notice of time and place** must be provided to all members.
- If the meeting is **public**, notice must be **published** in a manner determined by the Commission.
- **Urgent matters** may be addressed without prior notice.

#### **Public Meeting Agendas**
- If a meeting is public, the **agenda must be made publicly available at least 30 days in advance**.

> Note: Failure to provide proper notice does **not invalidate** a meeting — decisions and actions taken remain valid.

#### **Adjournment**
- Meetings may be **adjourned at any time** and **reconvened at a different time or place**.
- All attendees must be **notified** of the new time and location.

---

### **8. Voting and Participation**
- A member who **participates in a meeting or decision** is **deemed to have voted in the affirmative**.
- This applies **unless** the member **records a dissent or abstention** in writing.

This rule ensures that active participation implies agreement, unless otherwise stated, which supports efficient decision-making.

---

### **9. Meeting Records and Approval**
- The **record of every meeting** must be **approved at the next scheduled meeting** of the Commission.
- If the meeting was **public**, the **approved record must be made publicly available** in a manner determined by the Commission.

This ensures transparency, accountability, and public access to official decisions.

---

### **10. Quorum Requirements**
Quorum is the minimum number of members required to conduct business legally.

| Type of Meeting | Required Quorum |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Full Commission Meeting** | **3 members** |
| **Panel of 1 or 2 members** | **1 member** |
| **Panel of 3 or 4 members** | **2 members** |
| **Panel of more than 4 members** | **3 members** |

This tiered quorum structure allows flexibility based on the size and complexity of the panel, ensuring that decisions can be made efficiently while maintaining sufficient representation.

---

### **11. Effective Date**
These by-laws **come into force on the day they are made** — **May 31, 2000**.

---

### **12. Repeal Clause**
The by-law includes a **[Repeal]** note, which likely indicates that prior or outdated provisions have been replaced or superseded by this version. This reflects a standard legislative update process.

---

### **Key Implications and Significance**
- **Operational Continuity**: The provisions on the Secretary’s authority in the President’s absence ensure regulatory functions continue without interruption.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Public meetings, agenda availability, and public record access promote public trust.
- **Efficiency**: Clear quorum rules and default affirmative voting streamline decision-making, especially in urgent or technical matters.
- **Governance Clarity**: The definitions and procedural rules provide a clear, consistent framework for internal operations and external accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**
These by-laws are a foundational document for the internal governance of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. They establish a **clear, transparent, and efficient process** for decision-making, meeting conduct, and administrative operations — all while ensuring legal compliance and public accountability. By defining roles, procedures, and quorum requirements, the by-laws provide essential structure for both the full Commission and its specialized panels in managing nuclear safety and control matters across Canada.
