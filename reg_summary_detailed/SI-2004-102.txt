**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, constitutes a formal transfer of administrative responsibilities within the Canadian federal public service under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

### Key Provisions:

1. **Transfer of Responsibility**:
   - The **control and supervision** of the **Office of Infrastructure of Canada** are being transferred from the **Minister of the Environment** to the **Minister of State to be styled Minister of State (Infrastructure and Communities)**.
   - This transfer is not a change in the physical or operational structure of the Office, but a reassignment of oversight and accountability within the federal government's ministerial hierarchy.

2. **Appointment and Authority**:
   - The newly designated **Minister of State (Infrastructure and Communities)** is formally granted the authority to **preside over the Office of Infrastructure of Canada**.
   - This includes the power to direct policy, manage personnel, and oversee the strategic direction and implementation of infrastructure-related initiatives under the Office.

3. **Effective Date**:
   - The transfer and the assignment of presiding authority take effect on **July 20, 2004**.
   - This date marks the official start of the new ministerial oversight of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada.

### Context and Implications:

- **Rationale for Transfer**:
  - The move reflects a strategic realignment of government responsibilities to better align with evolving policy priorities. By transferring infrastructure oversight from the Environment Minister to a dedicated Minister of State (Infrastructure and Communities), the government signals a commitment to strengthening and prioritizing infrastructure development and community-based initiatives.
  - Infrastructure policy—encompassing transportation, housing, utilities, and community development—was likely seen as requiring more focused leadership and cross-sector coordination, distinct from environmental regulation.

- **Legal Authority**:
  - The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which enables the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Prime Minister) to reassign responsibilities among federal ministers, particularly in relation to public service functions and departmental oversight.

- **Impact on Governance**:
  - The Office of Infrastructure of Canada will now operate under a ministerial portfolio that explicitly emphasizes infrastructure and community development, potentially leading to more integrated planning and policy development in these areas.
  - It may also improve interdepartmental coordination, especially between infrastructure, urban planning, and community services.

### Conclusion:

This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal government. It formally assigns the leadership and oversight of the Office of Infrastructure of Canada to the Minister of State (Infrastructure and Communities), effective July 20, 2004. This shift underscores a policy emphasis on infrastructure as a core component of national development and community well-being, and it reflects a broader effort to streamline and clarify ministerial responsibilities within the public service.
