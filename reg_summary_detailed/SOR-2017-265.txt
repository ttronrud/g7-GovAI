### **Background and Context**

1. **Designation of the Eastern Sand Darter as a Threatened Species**  
   The Eastern Sand Darter (*Ammocrypta pellucida*) is a species of freshwater fish found in Ontario. Its Ontario populations are officially listed as **threatened** under **Part 3 of Schedule 1** to the *Species at Risk Act (SARA)*. This designation means the species is at risk of becoming extinct in the wild and warrants protection and recovery efforts.

2. **Recovery Strategy and Critical Habitat Identification**  
   A formal recovery strategy for the Eastern Sand Darter was developed and includes a detailed identification of **critical habitat**—the specific areas essential for the species’ survival and recovery. This information has been **included in the Species at Risk Public Registry**, making it publicly accessible and legally recognized.

3. **Exclusion of Critical Habitat Due to Legal and Indigenous Land Use Concerns**  
   Under **subsection 58(2)b** of SARA, certain portions of critical habitat located within **protected areas** or **lands set aside for Indigenous use** must be excluded from regulatory orders. Specifically, a portion of the identified critical habitat lies within the **Long Point National Wildlife Area (NPWA)**, which is a designated federal protected area.

   Furthermore, under **subsection 58(5)** of SARA, any such excluded portion must not be included in an annexed order that designates critical habitat.

4. **Consultation with Indigenous Communities**  
   The **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (MFO)** determined that including the Long Point National Wildlife Area in the critical habitat designation would **affect reserves or other lands set apart for the use and benefit of First Nations bands**.  
   In accordance with **subsection 58(7)** of SARA, the MFO conducted **consultation with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (MIAND)** and with the **affected Indigenous bands** to ensure their rights, interests, and traditional uses were respected.

### **Key Provisions of the Order**

1. **Scope of the Order**  
   This Order designates the **critical habitat** for the Eastern Sand Darter (*Ammocrypta pellucida*) in Ontario, **but with a specific exclusion**.

2. **Applicable Provisions of SARA**  
   - **Subsection 58(1)** applies to the critical habitat of the species, **except** for the portion located in a place referred to in subsection 58(2) of SARA.
   - The excluded portion is specifically located within the **Long Point National Wildlife Area**, as defined in **Part IV of Schedule I to the Wildlife Areas Regulations**.

3. **Exclusion of Long Point National Wildlife Area**  
   The critical habitat **does not extend into or include** the Long Point National Wildlife Area. This exclusion is legally mandated under SARA to avoid conflicts with federal protected status and to respect Indigenous land use and governance.

4. **Legal Basis for the Order**  
   The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issued this Order **pursuant to subsections 58(4) and 58(5)** of SARA:
   - **58(4)**: Authorizes the Minister to make orders to designate critical habitat.
   - **58(5)**: Requires that critical habitat in certain protected or Indigenous lands be excluded if it would interfere with the use or benefit of those lands.

### **Purpose and Significance**

- **Conservation of the Species**: The Order ensures that the remaining critical habitat is legally recognized and protected to support the recovery of the Eastern Sand Darter in Ontario.
- **Compliance with SARA Requirements**: The Order adheres strictly to the legal framework of SARA, particularly the requirement to exclude critical habitat in areas designated under subsection 58(2)b and to consult with Indigenous communities.
- **Respect for Indigenous Rights and Land Use**: By excluding the Long Point area and consulting with Indigenous bands, the Order upholds the principles of **Indigenous rights**, **co-governance**, and **shared stewardship** under Canadian environmental and Indigenous law.

### **Implementation and Enforcement**

- The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** in the Canada Gazette.
- It will be enforced through existing SARA mechanisms, including:
  - Prohibiting activities that destroy or degrade critical habitat (unless authorized under a permit).
  - Requiring federal and provincial agencies to consider the impact of proposed projects on critical habitat.
- The exclusion of the Long Point National Wildlife Area ensures that no regulatory action will interfere with the protected status or traditional uses of that area.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a legally binding, science-based, and culturally sensitive designation of critical habitat for the Eastern Sand Darter in Ontario. It reflects a balanced approach to species conservation, recognizing both ecological needs and the importance of Indigenous land rights and protected areas. By excluding the Long Point National Wildlife Area from the critical habitat designation and ensuring prior consultation, the Order demonstrates compliance with the *Species at Risk Act*, promotes species recovery, and respects the rights of Indigenous peoples.
