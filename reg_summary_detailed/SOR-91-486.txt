## **Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Import and Export of Contaminated Fuel (Canada)**

### **1. Legal Basis and Background**

This regulation was enacted under **section 34 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999** (as amended), specifically pursuant to **subsection 48(1)** of CEPA, which allows the Minister of the Environment to propose regulations concerning the import and export of toxic substances. 

- The proposed regulations were first published in the *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **March 16, 1991**.
- A **60-day public comment period** was provided under **subsection 48(2)** of CEPA, during which individuals or organizations could file objections.
- **No objections were received** within the 60-day window.
- The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment and the Minister of National Health and Welfare, and after consulting the federal-provincial advisory committee under **section 6** of CEPA, concluded that:
  - The proposed regulations do **not overlap** with any existing federal or provincial regulations on substances.
  - Therefore, the regulations were formally adopted by **Governor in Council** on the basis of section 34 of CEPA.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This regulation was **repealed** by **SOR/2018-11, s. 2** (Statutory Instrument 2018-11, Section 2), and **further repealed by SOR/2000-102, s. 7**. As such, **this regulation is no longer in force** and has been superseded by more recent environmental legislation.

  - The **Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999** (CEPA)
  - The **Canadian Hazardous Materials Regulations (CHMR)** (under Transport Canada)
  - Federal and provincial hazardous waste management frameworks
  - International agreements (e.g., Basel Convention) on the transboundary movement of hazardous substances

---

### **Conclusion**

While this regulation was historically significant in establishing Canada’s framework for controlling the movement of contaminated fuels, it has been **fully repealed** and replaced by more modern, comprehensive, and enforceable environmental and waste management regulations. The original intent—to prevent environmental harm from contaminated fuels through strict import/export controls—remains relevant, but is now implemented through updated legislative and regulatory mechanisms.

> 📌 **Recommendation for Stakeholders**:  
> Anyone involved in fuel handling, transportation, or waste management should consult **current CEPA regulations**, **Hazardous Waste Regulations**, and **Transport Canada’s Dangerous Goods Regulations** for up-to-date compliance requirements.
