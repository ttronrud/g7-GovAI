**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Kemano Completion Project Guidelines Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 6 of the Department of the Environment Act**. It is formally approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of the Environment**. This means that the Order is a formal government directive authorized by the federal executive branch, specifically the Department of the Environment, and carries the force of law.

The Order is titled the **Kemano Completion Project Guidelines Order** and may be cited as such in official documents and legal references.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary purpose of this Order is to **establish and implement guidelines** for the **Kemano Completion Project**. This project involves the completion and operation of the Kemano hydroelectric facility, which is part of the larger hydroelectric system in British Columbia, Canada. The guidelines are designed to provide a framework for the planning, implementation, and management of the project in a manner consistent with environmental, economic, and social considerations.

**3. Exemption from Environmental Assessment and Review Process**  
A key and significant feature of this Order is that it **exempts the Kemano Completion Project from the Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order**. This means:

- The project is **not subject to the standard federal environmental assessment (EA) process** that applies to most major development projects.
- The **Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order**—which typically requires public consultation, environmental impact assessments, and formal review by federal authorities—does **not apply** to the Kemano Completion Project.

This exemption is a critical legal and procedural distinction, indicating that the project has been deemed to fall outside the scope of the standard environmental review regime.

---

**4. Basis for Exemption: The Settlement Agreement of 1987**  
The exemption is explicitly tied to the **Settlement Agreement entered into on September 14, 1987**, between:
- Her Majesty in right of Canada,
- Her Majesty in right of the Province of British Columbia, and
- Alcan Aluminum Limited (a major aluminum producer).

This settlement was a landmark agreement that resolved long-standing environmental and land-use disputes related to the Kemano hydroelectric project, particularly concerning the impacts of the project on the surrounding environment and Indigenous communities.

The agreement was formally approved by the Governor in Council via **Order in Council P.C. 1987-2481**, issued on **December 10, 1987**. The 1990 Order recognizes that the project and its associated decisions—including approvals, operations, and management decisions—have already been addressed and legally settled through this agreement.

---

**5. Legal and Policy Implications**  
By exempting the project from the standard environmental assessment process:
- The federal government acknowledges that the **Settlement Agreement of 1987** provides a comprehensive and legally binding framework for the project.
- The guidelines established in the 1990 Order are intended to **implement the terms and conditions** of that settlement, rather than to conduct a new environmental review.
- This reflects a policy of **finality and closure** of the environmental and legal issues related to the Kemano Completion Project, avoiding duplication of efforts and ensuring consistency with prior agreements.

---

**6. Scope of Application**  
The Order applies to:
- The **Kemano Completion Project** specifically.
- Any **decisions made as a result of the 1987 Settlement Agreement**, including operational decisions, environmental management practices, and regulatory approvals.

It does not apply to other projects or developments, nor does it override or replace the terms of the 1987 settlement.

---

**7. Significance and Context**  
The Kemano Completion Project is a major infrastructure initiative involving the expansion and completion of the Kemano hydroelectric facility on the lower reaches of the Fraser River in British Columbia. The 1987 settlement was historically significant because it:
- Resolved environmental concerns raised by Indigenous communities and environmental groups.
- Included commitments to environmental protection, monitoring, and mitigation.
- Established a collaborative framework between federal, provincial, and private stakeholders.

By issuing these guidelines in 1990, the government formalized the project’s implementation under a legally binding and settled framework, reducing the need for ongoing environmental assessments and public consultations.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Kemano Completion Project Guidelines Order* is a legally binding instrument that:
- Establishes operational and management guidelines for the Kemano Completion Project,
- Exempts the project from the standard federal environmental assessment process due to the prior settlement of environmental and legal issues,
- Confirms the validity and finality of the 1987 Settlement Agreement between Canada, British Columbia, and Alcan Aluminum Limited.

This Order reflects a pragmatic and legally sound approach to managing a major infrastructure project where environmental and social concerns had already been addressed through a comprehensive, collaborative agreement. It ensures continuity, legal certainty, and operational efficiency in the project’s implementation.
