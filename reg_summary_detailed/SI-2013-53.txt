**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

---

### **Regulation Title:**  
*Withdrawal from Disposal of Certain Tracts of Territorial Lands in the Northwest Territories (Tuktut Nogait National Park of Canada) Order*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Pursuant to **paragraph 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, made by His Excellency the Governor General in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

---

### **Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this regulation is to **withdraw specific tracts of territorial land from disposal** (i.e., from being available for sale, lease, or other forms of private or commercial development) in order to **support the proposed expansion of Tuktut Nogait National Park of Canada** in the Northwest Territories.

This action ensures that these lands remain protected for conservation, environmental protection, and cultural significance — particularly within the context of Indigenous land rights and regional ecological values.

---

### **Key Provisions**

#### **1. Withdrawal of Lands**
- The **specific tracts of territorial land** listed in the **Schedule** to the Order are **withdrawn from disposal**.
- This withdrawal includes **both surface rights and subsurface rights** (i.e., rights to minerals, oil, gas, and other subsurface resources).
- The withdrawal is effective for a **period of two years**, beginning on the day the Order is published or comes into force.

> This means that during this two-year period, no government or private party can dispose of (sell, lease, or otherwise transfer) these lands through conventional land disposal mechanisms.

#### **2. Exclusions – Where Section 2 Does NOT Apply**
Despite the general withdrawal, the regulation explicitly **excludes certain mineral-related activities** from being affected by the withdrawal. These exclusions are critical to maintain continuity in existing mining and exploration rights:

- **Mineral Claims Under Prospecting Permits (Pre-existing):**  
  A person who holds a prospecting permit granted **before the date of the Order** may locate a mineral claim without being affected by the withdrawal.

- **Recording of Mineral Claims (Pre-existing):**  
  Any mineral claim that was **already located or recorded before the Order came into effect** is not impacted.

- **Leases for Recorded Claims:**  
  A lease granted under the *Northwest Territories and Nunavut Mining Regulations* to a person with a **recorded claim** — even if the lease covers part of the withdrawn area — is exempt from the withdrawal.

- **Significant Discovery Licences (Pre-existing Exploration Licences):**  
  If a *significant discovery licence* under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* is issued to a holder of an exploration licence issued **before the Order**, and the licence covers an area subject to that exploration licence, it is **not affected**.

- **Production Licences (Based on Pre-existing Exploration or Discovery Licences):**  
  A production licence issued under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* to a holder of:
  - A pre-existing exploration licence, or  
  - A pre-existing significant discovery licence  
  — **if it covers an area subject to the original licence**, is **exempt** from the withdrawal.

- **Surface Leases for Claim Holders:**  
  A surface lease issued to a person with a **recorded claim** or an interest under the *Canada Petroleum Resources Act* — **only if required to allow the holder to exercise rights under the claim or interest** — is **not affected**.

- **Renewal of Interests:**  
  Renewals of mineral interests (e.g., exploration or production rights) that were already in place before the Order is made are **exempt**.

> These exclusions ensure that **existing mining operations and exploration activities are not disrupted** due to the land withdrawal, protecting economic and operational continuity for legitimate, pre-existing rights.

### **Proposed Expansion of Tuktut Nogait National Park**

The Order supports the **addition of a new parcel of land** to Tuktut Nogait National Park within the **Sahtú Settlement Area** in the Northwest Territories.

#### **Description of the New Parcel (Geographic Coordinates – NAD 1927):**

- **Commencement Point:**  
  The northeastern corner of the Sahtú Settlement Area as defined in **Appendix A, Volume I of the Sahtú Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement**.  
  Coordinates:  
  Latitude: 68°00′00″ North  
  Longitude: 120°40′51″ West

- **Thence Southeasterly** along the boundary of the Sahtú Settlement Area to:  
  Latitude 67°45′00″ North, Longitude 119°42′39″ West

- **Thence West** along the parallel of latitude 67°45′00″ North to:  
  Longitude 121°27′00″ West

- **Thence Northwesterly** along a geodesic line to:  
  Latitude 68°00′00″ North, Longitude 122°05′00″ West (on the northern boundary of the Sahtú Settlement Area)

- **Thence Easterly** along the northern boundary of the Sahtú Settlement Area back to the point of commencement.

#### **Area of the Parcel:**  
Approximately **1,841 square kilometers (km²)**.

> This expansion significantly increases the protected area of Tuktut Nogait National Park, enhancing conservation efforts and supporting biodiversity, Indigenous cultural values, and climate resilience.

### **Legal and Policy Context**

- The regulation reflects a balance between **environmental protection** and **economic development**.
- It respects **Indigenous land rights** by aligning with the Sahtú Dene and Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, which recognizes the importance of land-based cultural and traditional practices.
- The withdrawal is **temporary (two years)**, allowing time for environmental assessments, public consultations, and stakeholder engagement before final decisions on park boundaries or land use are made.
- The exclusion of pre-existing mining rights ensures **legal stability** and prevents unintended disruption of existing mineral exploration or development projects.

---

### **Repeal Clause (Note)**  
The regulation includes a **repeal clause**, indicating that any prior provisions conflicting with this Order will be superseded. This ensures legal clarity and up-to-date governance.

---

### **Conclusion**

This Order is a **strategic environmental and land-use decision** that:

- Withdraws approximately **1,841 km² of land** from disposal to expand Tuktut Nogait National Park;
- Protects the ecological and cultural integrity of the Sahtú Settlement Area;
- Maintains continuity for existing mineral rights through specific exemptions;
- Supports the broader goals of sustainable development, conservation, and Indigenous self-determination.

It serves as a key step in Canada’s commitment to protecting natural heritage and advancing the conservation of Indigenous lands in the Northwest Territories.

✅ **Key Takeaways for Stakeholders:**
- Landowners or developers seeking to dispose of land in the withdrawn tracts must wait until the two-year period ends.
- Pre-existing mining or exploration rights remain valid and unaffected.
- The expansion of the national park will benefit biodiversity, climate resilience, and Indigenous communities.
- The Order is grounded in both environmental protection and legal certainty.
