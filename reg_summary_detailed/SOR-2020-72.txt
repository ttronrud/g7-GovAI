**Detailed Summary of the *Export Charges for Certain Dairy Products Regulations***  
*(S.C. 2020, c. 1, s. 46; R.S., c. E-19)*

---

### **1. Purpose of the Regulation**
The *Export Charges for Certain Dairy Products Regulations* establish a framework for calculating export charges that dairy product exporters in Canada must pay under specific conditions. These charges are designed to ensure that Canada's export access to certain dairy products is managed in a way that prevents overuse of export quotas and supports fair market access, particularly in relation to domestic supply and international trade commitments.

This regulation is made under **paragraph 12(c.01)a of the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA)**, which authorizes the Governor in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) to set export charges for certain products when export access is limited.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA), which governs the issuance of export and import permits and related charges. |
| **Dairy Year** | A 12-month period beginning on **August 1** of each year and ending on **July 31** of the following year. This period is used to track and manage the availability of export quotas for dairy products. |
| **Product** | Includes any class of dairy product as defined in the schedule. For example, milk, cheese, butter, or other dairy items categorized under the regulation. |

### **3. Who Must Pay the Export Charge?**

The export charge applies to:
- **Holders of a permit** issued under **subsection 7(1) of the EIPA**, who export a product listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule**.

These permit holders are responsible for paying the charge **if** their export activity exceeds the allowable "export access quantity" for that dairy year.

---

### **4. When Is an Export Charge Applied?**

An export charge is triggered **only when** the total of the following quantities **exceeds** the **export access quantity** for the product in the current dairy year:

#### **Total Quantity Threshold** =  
> (a) Quantity of the product to be exported under the permit  
> + (b) Total quantity previously authorized to be exported under all permits issued to Canadian residents since the start of the dairy year  
> + (c) Quantity allocated for export to Canadian residents under **paragraph 6.2(2)(b)** of the EIPA (including any allocated but unexported quantities)

#### **Export Access Quantity**  
This is the maximum amount of the product that can be exported during the dairy year, as determined under **subsection 6.2(1.1)** of the EIPA. It is a cap set by the government based on supply, demand, and trade agreements.

---

### **5. How Is the Export Charge Calculated?**

The charge is calculated using **two different formulas**, depending on whether the total authorized quantity exceeds or does not exceed the export access quantity.

---

#### **Case 1: Total Authorized Quantity > Export Access Quantity**  
*(Over-quota export – charge applies)*

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Export Charge} = (\text{Quantity to be exported}) \times (\text{Rate per kg})
\]

- The charge is calculated **only on the quantity being exported under the permit**.
- The rate is taken from **Column 3 of the Schedule** (per kilogram).
- No additional charge is applied for prior exports or allocations — only the current permit volume is charged.

> ⚠️ This applies when the exporter is exceeding the total allowable export volume for the year.

---

#### **Case 2: Total Authorized Quantity ≤ Export Access Quantity**  
*(Within quota – no charge or reduced charge)*

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Export Charge} = \left( \text{Quantity to be exported} \right) \times \left( \text{Rate per kg} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Export Access Quantity} - \text{Total of (b) + (c)}}{\text{Total of (b) + (c)}} \right)
\]

- The charge is **proportional** and based on how much of the export access quantity remains after accounting for prior exports and allocations.
- This formula ensures that exporters who are operating within the allowed limits pay a **lower or no charge**, reflecting fair use of the available export quota.

> ✅ This encourages responsible export behavior and prevents overuse of limited export capacity.

---

### **6. Key Features of the Regulation**

- **Quota-Based System**: The regulation ties export charges directly to the **export access quantity** set under the EIPA, ensuring that total exports do not exceed government-defined limits.
- **Progressive Charging**: Charges increase as exporters approach or exceed the allowable export volume, acting as a disincentive to over-export.
- **Fairness and Transparency**: The formula ensures that:
  - Past export authorizations are accounted for.
  - Allocated but unexported quantities are considered.
  - Only the current permit volume is charged when over-quota.
- **Flexibility for Domestic Supply**: By including previously authorized exports and allocations, the system supports Canada’s domestic dairy supply chain and avoids market distortions.

---

### **7. Effective Date**

The regulations come into force on the day that **Section 40 of the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) Implementation Act** comes into force.

- If the regulations are **registered (published) after** that date, they will take effect on the **date of registration**.

> This ensures alignment with broader trade policy objectives under CUSMA, particularly those related to agricultural trade and market access.

---

### **8. Regulatory Background and Context**

- **Reference to SI/2020-33 and SI/2020-46**: These are prior statutory instruments that established and amended the original version of the regulation, effective July 1, 2020. The current version reflects updates and refinements to the export charge mechanism.
- The regulation supports **Canada’s broader agricultural trade strategy**, ensuring that:
  - Exporters do not consume more export capacity than is available.
  - Domestic producers are not disadvantaged by over-exporting.
  - International trade commitments (especially under CUSMA) are respected.

---

### **9. Practical Implications for Exporters**

- Exporters must:
  - Track their **total authorized exports** (past and current).
  - Monitor the **export access quantity** for each product in the current dairy year.
  - Calculate export charges using the appropriate formula based on whether they are within or beyond the quota.
  - Pay the charge to the Canadian government as part of the permit process.

- Failure to comply with the charge calculation or payment may result in:
  - Permit suspension.
  - Penalties or enforcement actions.
  - Disqualification from future export privileges.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Export Charges for Certain Dairy Products Regulations* implement a **market-based, quota-responsive mechanism** to manage Canada’s export of specific dairy products. By linking export charges directly to the total authorized volume and using a tiered formula, the regulation ensures:
- **Sustainability** of domestic dairy supply,
- **Equity** in export access,
- **Compliance** with international trade agreements (especially CUSMA),
- And **financial accountability** for exporters.

This regulation is a key component of Canada’s agricultural export policy, balancing trade interests with domestic food security and market stability.
