### 3. **Power to Dispose of Property by Lease**

#### ✅ Conditions for Leasing Property
EDC may lease property **only if**:
- The property is **not used outside Canada** during the lease term.
- The lease is **not entered for the primary purpose of extending credit**.
- The **Corporation is responsible** for installing, promoting, servicing, cleaning, maintaining, and repairing the property during the lease.
- EDC **does not intend to dispose of its interest** in the property during or at the end of the lease.
- The **capital cost and financing charges** will **not be recovered** by EDC.
- **No contractual arrangement exists** for the final disposal of EDC’s interest in the property, **and** the **estimated residual value** of the leased property (plus all other similarly disposed properties) is **≤ 20%** of the **total cost of acquisition** of all such properties.

#### 🚫 Approval Requirement
- Requires **prior approval** from both the **Minister of International Trade** and the **Minister of Finance**.
- This ensures that leasing is not used as a disguised form of financing or asset management.

---

### 4. **Power to Acquire Equity Interests in Entities**

#### ✅ General Authority
EDC may acquire equity interests in entities — but only under specific conditions.

#### 🚫 Approval Requirement (Subsection 5(2))
An acquisition requires ministerial approval **if**:
- The **value of the equity interest being acquired** (plus any equity interest EDC already holds) **exceeds 25%** of the **total value of all equity interests** in the entity at the time of acquisition.

> This threshold prevents EDC from becoming a dominant shareholder in any entity.

#### 📌 How Total Equity Value is Calculated
For purposes of the 25% threshold:
- Value is calculated on a **fully diluted basis** (includes all potential shares, including those issued to future investors or held by obligations).
- Includes:
  - The equity interest being acquired.
  - Any equity interest that EDC or others are **obligated to acquire**.
- Determined using:
  1. Most recent **audited financial statements** of the entity (if available),
  2. Agreements between the entity and EDC regarding acquisition,
  3. Agreements among investors (including EDC) regarding equity purchases.

#### 🚫 Exceptions Where Approval Is Not Required
Approval is **not required** in the following cases:
- Acquisitions resulting from **restructurings, reorganizations, or workout arrangements** involving entities where EDC already holds an equity interest or is a creditor.
- Acquisitions due to:
  - Dividends or in-kind distributions,
  - Exchange or substitution of equity interests as a result of **mergers, amalgamations, or similar actions**,
  - Settlement of debts arising from:
    - Credit extensions (e.g., loans),
    - Insurance, indemnity, or guarantee arrangements.

> These exceptions ensure flexibility during corporate restructuring and debt settlement.

---

### 5. **Power to Enter into Domestic Financial Transactions**

#### ✅ General Authority
EDC may enter into domestic financial transactions (e.g., loans, lines of credit) for non-export purposes.

#### 🚫 Approval Requirement (Subsection 5(2))
Approval is required **if**:
- The person seeking credit has **annual export transaction and foreign market business volume < 50%** of their **total annual business volume**.

> This ensures that EDC does not lend to businesses that are primarily domestic and not export-oriented.

#### 🚫 Exception: Prior Approval
- Approval is **not required** if the Ministers previously approved a similar domestic financial transaction with the same person **within the last 48 months**.

> This allows continuity of credit relationships with trusted, stable clients.

---

### 6. **Power to Enter into Domestic Insurance Transactions**

#### ✅ General Authority
EDC may provide insurance, reinsurance, indemnity, or guarantees to persons for non-export activities.

#### 🚫 Approval Requirement (Subsection 6(2) & (3))
Approval is required **if**:
- The person receiving insurance has **annual export transaction and foreign market business volume < 50%** of their **total annual business volume**.

> Same threshold as financial transactions — focused on export relevance.

#### 🚫 Exception: Prior Approval
- Approval is **not required** if a similar domestic insurance transaction was previously approved with the same person within the last **48 months**.

---

### 7. **Special Provisions on Insurance Transactions**

- A domestic insurance transaction requires ministerial approval **if** it involves:
  - A class of insurance defined in **column II of the schedule** to these Regulations (specific types of insurance, e.g., property, liability, or specialized risks).
- This ensures that high-risk or complex insurance products are subject to greater scrutiny.

---

### 8. **Temporary Exemption (Repeal and Continuity Clauses)**

> These provisions address a transitional period tied to amendments in the *Export Development Act*.

#### 📌 Provision:
- **Subsections 5(2), 6(2), and (3)** (i.e., the approval requirements for financial and insurance transactions) **do not apply** during the period:
  - From the day **paragraph 10(1)(a)** of the Act (as amended by subsection 260(1)) comes into force,
  - Until that paragraph is repealed.

> This was likely a transitional measure to allow for legislative changes without disrupting existing operations.

#### 📌 Important Exception:
- Despite the repeal of the above provisions, **new transactions** entered into by EDC **during the period** when paragraph 10(1)(a) was in force **are still subject to the rules**.
- Even after repeal, EDC may take **any necessary steps** to implement or finalize such transactions.

> This ensures **continuity and enforceability** of transactions initiated during the transitional period.

## 🔍 Key Objectives and Policy Rationale

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Promote Export-Oriented Business** | EDC’s activities are strictly limited to supporting businesses involved in international trade. |
| **Prevent Financial Risk** | Restrictions on leasing, equity acquisition, and lending prevent EDC from becoming overly exposed to non-export or speculative risks. |
| **Ensure Transparency and Oversight** | Mandatory ministerial approval ensures accountability and alignment with government policy. |
| **Protect Financial Stability** | By limiting credit and insurance to businesses with significant foreign market exposure, EDC avoids supporting domestic-only or low-risk ventures. |
| **Enable Flexibility in Restructuring** | Exceptions for reorganizations and debt settlements allow EDC to support distressed or evolving businesses. |
