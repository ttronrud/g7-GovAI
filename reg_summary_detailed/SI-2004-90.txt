The regulation is issued under the authority granted by **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**.

**2. Key Change: Transfer of Control and Supervision**
- The **Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada (PSHRMA)** — a key agency responsible for overseeing human resources (HR) functions across the federal public service — was previously under the control and supervision of the **President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada**.
- As of **July 20, 2004**, this responsibility is **transferred** to the **President of the Treasury Board**.

This transfer signifies a strategic realignment of public service governance, consolidating HR management authority under a more centralized and operational leadership structure.

  - Recruitment, retention, and performance management
  - Compensation and benefits frameworks
  - Training and development programs
  - Compliance with federal employment standards
- The agency’s mandate remains focused on improving human resource management across the federal public service to enhance efficiency, equity, and effectiveness.

**4. Governance and Leadership:**
- The regulation explicitly **orders that the President of the Treasury Board shall preside over** the PSHRMA.
- This means the President of the Treasury Board assumes both **executive leadership** and **decision-making authority** over the agency.
- This change strengthens the link between fiscal and human resource management in the public service, aligning HR policy with broader government operations and accountability.

---

**5. Effective Date:**

- By placing HR management under the Treasury Board, the government seeks to:
  - Improve consistency and standardization of HR practices across departments

  - Strengthen oversight and accountability mechanisms
- It also reflects a shift toward a more **operational and service-oriented** approach to public service management, moving away from a more ceremonial or advisory role previously held by the Privy Council.

This regulation represents a significant administrative restructuring within Canada’s federal public service. It formally transfers the control and supervision of the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency from the President of the Queen's Privy Council to the President of the Treasury Board, effective July 20, 2004.
