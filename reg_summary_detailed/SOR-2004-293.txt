**Detailed Summary of the Listed Airport Regulations (L.C. 2002, ch. 9, art. 5)**

**1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The Listed Airport Regulations are issued by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. This authority is derived from specific provisions of the *Air Travellers Security Charge Act* (the "Act"):  
- **Section 2** of the Act defines the term "listed airport," which is central to the regulation.  
- **Section 84** provides the legislative power to prescribe specific airports that will be designated as "listed airports" under the Act.  

This means the regulations are not independently created but are a formal administrative implementation of the Act, ensuring that certain airports are officially recognized for the purposes of applying the Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC).

**2. Purpose of the Regulations**  
The primary purpose of these regulations is to identify and formally designate specific airports as "listed airports" for the purposes of the Air Travellers Security Charge Act. These airports are subject to the mandatory collection of a security charge for air travellers, as required by the Act. This charge is typically collected at the point of check-in and is used to fund the security measures at airports and in the aviation sector.

**3. Definition of "Listed Airport"**  
Under the Act, a "listed airport" is an airport that is specifically designated by regulation for the purposes of applying the security charge. The regulations define which airports fall into this category. The two airports designated are:

- **Red Deer Regional Airport** (located in Red Deer, Alberta)  
- **Rivière-Rouge (Mont-Tremblant International Airport)** (located in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec)

These airports are now officially recognized as "listed airports" under the Act, meaning that air travellers arriving or departing from these airports are subject to the security charge.

**4. Scope and Application**  
Once designated as listed airports, the security charge applies to all air travellers (passengers) who board flights departing from or arriving at these airports. The charge is typically collected by airlines or airport authorities and is administered in accordance with the requirements of the *Air Travellers Security Charge Act*. This ensures consistent funding for airport security measures across the Canadian aviation system.

---

**5. Effective Date**  
The regulations come into force on **December 23, 2004**. This date marks the beginning of the legal application of the designated airports under the Act. All operations involving air travel at these airports from that date onward are subject to the security charge as defined in the Act.

---

**6. Key Legal and Administrative Implications**  
- The designation of these airports ensures that the security charge is applied in a targeted and transparent manner, with clear accountability.  
- It reflects a government policy of enhancing aviation security by funding measures directly linked to high-traffic or strategically located airports.  
- The regulations are binding and enforceable under the authority of the federal government, with compliance required by airlines, airports, and travel service providers.

**Conclusion**  
These Listed Airport Regulations formally designate Red Deer Regional Airport and Rivière-Rouge (Mont-Tremblant International) as listed airports under the *Air Travellers Security Charge Act*. By doing so, they establish the legal framework for the collection of a security charge at these facilities, beginning on December 23, 2004. The regulations serve as a critical administrative tool to support national aviation security initiatives and ensure equitable and consistent funding across the Canadian air travel system.
