**Regulation Summary: Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 1989-1700 and Authorization for Fee Prescription under the Export and Import Permits Act**

**1. Legal Authority and Source:**

- The regulation is issued under the **Financial Administration Act (FAA)**, specifically pursuant to:
  - **Paragraph 19(1)(b)**: Which grants the Governor in Council (the federal government) the authority to repeal or amend orders in council that relate to financial administration.
  - **Paragraph 19.1(b)**: Which authorizes the Governor in Council to authorize the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prescribe fees for permits or certificates issued under the *Export and Import Permits Act*.

- The regulation is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **September 24, 1991**, as **Statutory Instrument 1991-24**, under section 6.

- It is based on **Order in Council P.C. 1989-1700**, which was originally issued on **August 24, 1989**, and was previously in force.

---

**2. Key Action Taken:**

- **Repeal of Order in Council P.C. 1989-1700**:  
  The Governor in Council formally repeals the earlier Order in Council (P.C. 1989-1700). This order had previously established or regulated the fees to be charged for export and import permits or certificates under the *Export and Import Permits Act*. By repealing it, the government removes the previous fee structure or rules that were in place.

- **Authorization to Prescribe Fees**:  
  The regulation grants the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** the authority to issue a new **fee order** (by regulation) that specifies the exact fees to be charged to individuals or entities that receive a permit or certificate under the *Export and Import Permits Act*.

---

**3. Scope of the Authorization:**

- The Minister of Foreign Affairs is empowered to:
  - **Prescribe fees** for permits and certificates issued under the *Export and Import Permits Act*.
  - Determine the **amount, conditions, and method** of fee collection based on the type of permit or certificate, the nature of the goods, or other relevant factors.
  - Issue such fees through a **subsequent order in council** (a regulatory instrument), which will be subject to public notice and publication.

---

**4. Purpose and Rationale:**

- The repeal of the 1989 order suggests that the government wanted to:
  - Modernize the fee structure.
  - Improve flexibility in setting fees in response to changing economic, trade, or administrative conditions.
  - Allow the Minister of Foreign Affairs to respond to current needs (e.g., cost of administration, compliance, or market dynamics) rather than relying on outdated or rigid fee levels.

- This move reflects a shift toward **regulatory flexibility** and **cost-based fee setting**, consistent with broader financial administration reforms.

---

**5. Implications:**

- **For Businesses and Individuals**:  
  The repeal means that the previous fee levels or rules no longer apply. New fees will be set by the Minister of Foreign Affairs via a future regulatory order, which will be published and made available to the public.

- **For Government Administration**:  
  The Minister of Foreign Affairs now has the power to establish a transparent, updated, and potentially more equitable fee regime, which can be reviewed and adjusted over time.

- **For Oversight and Accountability**:  
  The process remains within the framework of the Financial Administration Act, ensuring that fee-setting decisions are subject to proper legislative and administrative oversight.

---

**6. Legal and Procedural Notes:**

- The regulation is **not retroactive**—it only affects future fees and permits issued after the new fee order is published.
- The Minister of Foreign Affairs must follow proper procedural requirements when issuing the new fee order, including:
  - Public consultation (if required),
  - Publication in the *Canada Gazette*,
  - Transparency and justification of fee levels.

---

**Conclusion:**

This regulation effectively **repeals outdated fee provisions** from 1989 and **empowers the Minister of Foreign Affairs to set current and future fees** for export and import permits and certificates under the *Export and Import Permits Act*. It represents a modernization of the administrative framework for trade permits, enabling more responsive and efficient fee management in alignment with current economic and regulatory needs.
