**Detailed Summary of the Disposal at Sea Regulations (Canada)**

---

### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These **Disposal at Sea Regulations** are made under **subsection 332(1)** of the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* (CEPA 1999), which empowers the Minister of the Environment to regulate the disposal of waste or other matter at sea.

On **February 17, 2001**, the Minister published a **proposed version** of these regulations in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, providing the public with an opportunity to:
- Submit comments
- File a **notice of objection** requesting a **board of review** and providing reasons for the objection

Following this public consultation period, **Her Excellency the Governor in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, **formally adopted** the regulations under **subsection 135(1)** of CEPA 1999.

### **2. Definitions**

Key terms used throughout the regulations include:

- **Act**: Refers to the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999*.
- **Log-book**: Defined as the official log required under **section 261 of the Canada Shipping Act**. This document is critical for tracking vessel or aircraft operations and emergencies.

---

### **3. Reporting Requirements for Emergencies Involving Disposal at Sea**

When a disposal occurs during an **emergency** (as defined in subsection 130(1) of CEPA), a detailed **report must be submitted** to the enforcement officer designated for the area or to another person designated by the Governor in Council.

#### **Required Information in the Report**:

- **For Ship or Platform Disposal**:
  - Name of the vessel or platform
  - Name of the master or person in charge
  - Owner’s name and address
  - Port of registry, official number (if any), overall length, extreme breadth, overall height, and deadweight tonnage

- **For Aircraft Disposal**:
  - Name of the pilot-in-command
  - Owner’s name and address
  - Type, model, serial number, nationality, registration marks, and maximum certificated take-off weight (from Certificate of Airworthiness)

- **Route Information**:
  - Last point of departure and immediate destination at the time of disposal

- **Disposal Site Details**:
  - Latitude and longitude of the disposal site
  - Depth of the sea at that location

- **Documentation**:
  - Extracts from the **log-book and manifests** related to the emergency

- **Circumstances of Disposal**:
  - Detailed description of why the substance was disposed of
  - Date and time of disposal

- **Substance Details**:
  - Composition and nature (sufficient to identify the substance)
  - Quantity disposed of
  - Physical form (solid, liquid, or gas)
  - Packaging and containment methods (if any)
  - Trade name (if applicable)
  - Estimated time for the substance to disappear below the water surface

#### **Submission Requirements**:
- Must be submitted in **written form** or in an **electronic format compatible** with the recipient’s system.

### **4. National Action List (NAL) Screening Mechanism for Waste**

The regulations establish a **two-tier screening process** under **Sections 9 and 10 of Schedule 6** of CEPA 1999 to determine whether waste or other matter poses a risk to the marine environment.

#### **Lower Level Screening (Initial Assessment)**

- Applies to waste containing substances listed in **Column 1 of the table** at or **below the concentration level in Column 2**.
- If so, the waste is considered to be **below the Lower Level** of the National Action List and does not require further testing.

#### **Upper Level Screening (Biological Testing)**

- If a substance is **above the concentration threshold**, it triggers **biological testing**.
- The tests are required to assess **toxicity to marine or estuarine ecosystems**.

##### **Required Tests**:
- **Acute lethality test**:
  - Method: *Biological Test Method: Reference Method for Determining Acute Lethality of Sediment to Marine or Estuarine Amphipods (EPS 1/RM/35)*, December 1998 (as amended)
  - Assesses immediate mortality of amphipods (small crustaceans)

- **Two sub-lethal tests** (or one sub-lethal + one bioaccumulation test):
  - Method: *Biological Test Method: Sublethal Toxicity Tests to Assess Sediments Intended for Disposal at Sea (EPS 1/RM/40)*, May 2001 (as amended)
  - Evaluates long-term effects such as growth inhibition, behavior changes, or reproductive impacts

- **Bioaccumulation test** (if applicable):
  - Method: *Guidance Manual: Bedded Sediment Bioaccumulation Tests (EPA/600/R-93/183)*, September 1993 (as amended)
  - Measures how much of a substance accumulates in organisms over time

> ⚠️ **All tests must be conducted and interpreted** in accordance with **generally accepted scientific standards** at the time of testing.

#### **Interpretation of Test Results**:

| Result | Outcome |
|-------|--------|
| All three tests (acute + two sub-lethal) meet criteria | Waste is **below the Lower Level** of the NAL |
| Either the acute lethality test OR one of the two sub-lethal tests fails | Waste is **above the Upper Level** of the NAL |
| Acute lethality test AND one sub-lethal test meet criteria | Waste is **between Lower and Upper Levels** (i.e., below Upper Level but above Lower Level) |

> This tiered approach allows for **risk-based decision-making**, ensuring only substances with significant environmental risk trigger more rigorous evaluation.

### **5. Specified Areas Adjacent to Canada’s Territorial Sea**

Certain areas near Canada’s coast are designated as **"specified areas"** where disposal at sea is subject to additional regulatory scrutiny under **paragraph 122(2)(e)** of CEPA 1999.

These areas include:

1. **North Arm of the Fraser River**  
   - Bounded east by a line from the south shore at 123°04′00″W, 49°12′10″N to the north shore at 123°04′00″W, 49°12′23″N

2. **Main channel of the Fraser River**  
   - Downstream of the Alex Fraser Bridge, from south shore at 122°56′33″W, 49°09′28″N to north shore at 122°57′29″W, 49°10′33″N

3. **Northwest Miramichi River**
