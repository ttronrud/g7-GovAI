The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries stating:

> [Repealed, SI/2010-84, s. 5]

This indicates that a particular regulation (or section of a regulation) has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2010-84, section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Status of the Regulation**: The regulation in question is **no longer in force**. It has been formally repealed.
  
- **Repealing Instrument**:  
  The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2010-84**, which is a type of secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (or a similar jurisdiction, depending on context).  
  - The specific section of this instrument responsible for the repeal is **Section 5** of SI 2010-84.

- **Legal Effect**:  
  Any provisions previously contained in the repealed regulation are **no longer legally binding**. This means:
  - The regulation cannot be cited in legal arguments or administrative decisions.
  - Any prior enforcement or application of the regulation is invalid.
  - Legal or regulatory bodies must refer to current, active legislation instead.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  While the exact reason for repeal is not included in the provided text, such repeals typically occur for one or more of the following reasons:
  - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It was superseded by a more comprehensive or modern piece of legislation.
  - It created confusion or inconsistency with current law.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with public policy or human rights standards.
  - It was redundant or overlapping with other regulations.

- **Contextual Note**:  
  The repetition of the same line five times appears to be a formatting or data entry error—likely an accidental duplication. In official legal databases, such a repeated entry would not be meaningful; only one instance of the repeal notice is necessary.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced has been **officially repealed** by **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2010-84**. As such, it is **no longer valid or enforceable** under current law. Any references to it in legal or administrative contexts must be treated as obsolete and replaced with current, active legislation.

👉 **Recommendation**: To understand the original content of the repealed regulation or the rationale behind its repeal, one should consult the full text of the repealed regulation and the explanatory notes or schedule in SI 2010-84, particularly Section 5.
