**Date of Issue**: May 6, 2022

---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

This proclamation amends the **Constitution of Canada** under **Section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982**. Section 43 establishes the procedure for constitutional amendments, which requires:

1. A resolution passed by both chambers of Parliament (the Senate and the House of Commons), and

Once these resolutions are passed, the **Governor General**, acting on the advice of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, may issue a **proclamation** formally amending the Constitution.

### **Key Resolutions That Authorized the Amendment**

1. **Senate Resolution**:  
   Adopted on **April 7, 2022**  
   → Authorized the amendment to the Constitution of Canada.

2. **House of Commons Resolution**:  
   Adopted on **February 9, 2022**  
   → Authorized the amendment to the Constitution of Canada.

3. **Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly Resolution**:  
   Adopted on **November 29, 2021**  
   → Authorized the amendment to the Constitution of Canada, specifically for Saskatchewan.

These three resolutions collectively meet the constitutional requirements under Section 43, enabling the Governor General to issue the proclamation.

---

### **Content of the Amendment**

The proclamation contains **one specific amendment**:

> **Section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act is repealed.**

This means that the legal provision known as **Section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act**—which historically may have imposed restrictions on certain rights or powers (such as those related to land use, Indigenous rights, or legislative authority)—is **removed from the law**.

---

### **Retroactive Effect**

A critical feature of this amendment is its **retroactive application**:

- The repeal of Section 24 is **deemed to have taken effect on August 29, 1966**.  
- This means that the legal consequences of the repeal apply **as if the section had never existed** from that date forward.  
- This retroactive effect is significant because it allows the repeal to be applied to all legal actions, decisions, or statutes that were in effect on or after August 29, 1966, effectively removing the section’s operation from that point in time.

This retroactive application may serve to clarify or correct long-standing legal inconsistencies, particularly in areas involving Indigenous rights, land tenure, or provincial legislative authority.

---

### **Legal Citation and Official Designation**

The amendment is officially cited as:  
👉 **The Constitution Amendment, 2022 (Saskatchewan Act)**

This citation ensures that the amendment is formally recognized in legal and parliamentary records and can be referenced in future judicial or legislative proceedings.

---

### **Purpose and Significance**

While the text of the amendment is brief, its implications are substantial:

1. **Removal of a Restrictive Provision**:  
   The repeal of Section 24 likely removes a barrier to provincial legislative authority, potentially enabling more flexibility in land use, Indigenous self-governance, or environmental regulation within Saskatchewan.

2. **Constitutional Modernization**:  
   The amendment reflects ongoing efforts to update outdated provisions in provincial legislation to align with current legal, social, and Indigenous rights frameworks.

3. **Provincial Sovereignty and Legislative Autonomy**:  
   By repealing a section of the Saskatchewan Act, the province strengthens its ability to legislate independently, particularly in areas where Indigenous rights or land governance are involved.

4. **Legal Clarity and Consistency**:  
   Retroactive repeal ensures legal continuity and prevents ambiguity in how past laws were interpreted or enforced.

---

### **Governor General’s Role**

The Governor General acts as the **formal constitutional authority** to issue the proclamation. However, this role is **ceremonial and symbolic**—the Governor General only issues the proclamation **on the advice of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada**, which represents the federal government and ensures that the amendment proceeds within constitutional and political norms.

---

### **Conclusion**

This proclamation represents a **legally binding constitutional change** specific to the province of Saskatchewan. It:

- Repeals Section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act,  
- Applies retroactively from August 29, 1966,  
- Is authorized by resolutions from Parliament and the Saskatchewan Legislature,  
- Is issued under Section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982,  
- And is formally cited as the *Constitution Amendment, 2022 (Saskatchewan Act)*.

While the amendment is narrow in scope, it reflects broader constitutional and legislative efforts to modernize provincial laws and uphold Indigenous rights and provincial autonomy.

---

### **Note on Accuracy and Context**

It is important to clarify that **this document does not appear to be a broad constitutional amendment** (e.g., changing the structure of government or voting rights). Instead, it is a **targeted repeal of a specific section of a provincial statute**, which is a common type of constitutional amendment under Section 43. The retroactive nature of the repeal suggests it may be intended to correct historical legal imbalances or to align with current constitutional principles, such as those enshrined in the *United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples* (UNDRIP) or the *Criminal Code*’s evolving treatment of Indigenous rights.

---

**Final Summary in One Sentence**:  
On May 6, 2022, Governor General Mary May Simon issued a constitutional amendment repealing Section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act, retroactive to August 29, 1966, under Section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982, following resolutions by the federal Parliament and the Saskatchewan Legislature.
