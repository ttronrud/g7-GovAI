**Detailed Summary of the Nisga’a Final Agreement Indian Remission Order**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

This regulation, issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, pursuant to **subsection 23(2)a of the Financial Administration Act**, establishes a formal **Indian Remission Order** under the **Nisga’a Final Agreement**. The purpose of this Order is to provide **tax remission (exemption or relief)** for certain Indigenous individuals and properties related to the former reserve lands of the Nisga’a Nation.

The Order was enacted as **Section 7(2) of S.C. 1991, c. 24**, and serves as a legal instrument to implement the financial provisions of the Nisga’a Final Agreement, which is a landmark treaty between the Nisga’a Nation and the Government of Canada.

### **Key Definitions**

The following terms are defined to ensure clarity and consistency in the application of the remission:

1. **Former Reserve Lands**  
   - Refers to specific lands described in **paragraph 2(b) of Chapter 3** of the *Nisga’a Final Agreement* that are located within the **Nisga’a Lands**.  
   - These lands were historically designated as reserves under the Indian Act but are now being reclassified or integrated into the broader Nisga’a Lands framework as part of the treaty settlement.

2. **Indian**  
   - Defined in accordance with **subsection 2(1) of the Indian Act**.  
   - This means a person who is recognized as an "Indian" under Canadian law, including those who are members of the Nisga’a Nation and meet the criteria set out in the Act.

3. **Nisga’a Final Agreement**  
   - Has the same meaning as defined in **subsection 2(1) of the Nisga’a Final Agreement Act**.  
   - This is the comprehensive treaty that established the rights, responsibilities, and governance structure of the Nisga’a Nation, including land rights, self-government, and economic development.

4. **Nisga’a Lands**  
   - Defined in **Chapter 1 of the Nisga’a Final Agreement**.  
   - Refers to the lands over which the Nisga’a Nation has title or rights under the Agreement, including both traditional territories and lands acquired through treaty.

### **Scope of Tax Remission**

The Order grants **tax remission** (i.e., a formal cancellation or exemption of tax) for the following categories of property and activities:

1. **Estate or Interest of an Indian in Former Reserve Lands**  
   - Any tax imposed or levied on the estate, property interest, or legal rights of an Indian in respect of former reserve lands.

2. **Personal Property of an Indian Situated on Former Reserve Lands**  
   - Taxes on personal belongings (e.g., vehicles, tools, household goods) owned by an Indian and located on former reserve lands.

3. **Ownership, Occupation, Possession, or Use of Property**  
   - Taxes on an Indian’s ownership, occupation, possession, or use of any property that falls under either of the above categories (a) or (b).

> In essence, the remission applies to **all forms of tax** that would otherwise be payable on property or rights connected to former reserve lands, provided the individual qualifies as an Indian and the property is located within the Nisga’a Lands.

### **Conditions for Remission**

Remission under this Order is **not automatic** and is subject to two key conditions:

1. **No Prior Rebate, Refund, or Remission**  
   - The tax must **not have already been refunded, rebated, or remitted** in any prior instance.  
   - This ensures that the remission is only applied once and prevents double benefits.

2. **Exemption Would Apply Under Section 87 of the Indian Act**  
   - The property or interest in question must **qualify for exemption from taxation under Section 87 of the Indian Act**, *but for the Nisga’a Final Agreement*.  
   - Section 87 of the Indian Act provides that certain property owned by an Indian (especially on reserve) is exempt from taxation.  
   - This condition confirms that the remission is based on the **historical and statutory right** of Indigenous peoples to be exempt from taxation on reserve lands — a right that was preserved or enhanced through the Nisga’a Final Agreement.

> This means the remission is not a general blanket exemption but is tied to the **specific legal basis** of Indian Act exemptions.

### **Timeline of Application**

The remission applies only during specific time periods, depending on the type of tax:

- **For Transaction Taxes** (e.g., property transfers, sales, purchases):  
  - The remission applies from the **date the Nisga’a Final Agreement Act comes into force** until **May 31, 2008**.

- **For All Other Taxes** (e.g., income tax, capital gains tax, property tax):  
  - The remission applies from the **date the Nisga’a Final Agreement Act comes into force** until **December 31, 2012**.

> This staggered timeline reflects the different types of tax obligations and the government’s intent to provide relief over a defined, finite period — allowing for a transition from pre-treaty to post-treaty tax regimes.

### **Legal and Policy Significance**

1. **Recognition of Indigenous Rights**  
   - The Order recognizes the **historical and legal status** of Nisga’a people as Indigenous, with rights to land and property that should be protected from taxation.

2. **Implementation of Treaty Terms**  
   - It directly implements a key provision of the Nisga’a Final Agreement — ensuring that Indigenous peoples are not financially penalized for their traditional land rights or ownership.

3. **Alignment with Section 87 of the Indian Act**  
   - By requiring that the exemption would apply under Section 87, the Order respects the existing legal framework while affirming that treaty rights supersede or modify certain tax obligations.

4. **Financial Fairness and Equity**  
   - Provides a form of **financial justice** by removing tax burdens that would otherwise be imposed on individuals who have no control over the land or its use, especially when the land is part of a self-governing Indigenous community.

5. **Limited Duration**  
   - The finite time frame (up to 2012) reflects a transitional approach — acknowledging that long-term tax policy may evolve as the Nisga’a Nation develops its own economic and governance systems.

### **Conclusion**

This **Indian Remission Order** is a critical component of the **Nisga’a Final Agreement**, designed to ensure that Indigenous individuals are not financially disadvantaged due to their status or ownership of land within former reserve areas. It provides targeted, legally grounded tax relief for specific categories of property and rights, under strict conditions that preserve the integrity of existing tax laws and ensure that the remission is both fair and equitable.

By aligning with Section 87 of the Indian Act and applying only during a defined period, the Order balances **treaty obligations**, **fiscal responsibility**, and **Indigenous self-determination** — serving as both a practical and symbolic step in Canada’s broader reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.

**Note**: This Order is part of a larger framework of Indigenous rights and self-governance established through the Nisga’a Final Agreement, which remains a model for other Indigenous treaty settlements in Canada.
