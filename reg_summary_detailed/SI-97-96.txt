The provided text consists entirely of repeals referencing statutory instruments (SIs) and sections, specifically:

- **SI/2007-62, s. 3** (repealed multiple times)
- **SI/2002-132, s. 1** (repealed once)

However, **no actual regulation content** is included in the text. Instead, it only lists that certain provisions have been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or removed) by specific statutory instruments.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Text:**
The content is not a regulation itself, but a list of repeals. It indicates that the provisions previously governed by:
- Section 3 of Statutory Instrument (SI) 2007/62, and
- Section 1 of Statutory Instrument (SI) 2002/132,

have been **officially repealed** (removed from legal force) by subsequent legislation or administrative action.

**2. Repeal of SI/2007-62, s. 3:**
- This section was repealed by SI/2007/62, under section 3.
- The repealing instrument (SI 2007/62) likely amended or replaced an earlier regulation, possibly related to licensing, public health, safety, or administrative procedures.
- The fact that it is listed multiple times suggests that this repeal was significant or applied to multiple provisions or contexts.

**3. Repeal of SI/2002-132, s. 1:**
- Section 1 of SI 2002/132 was repealed by a later instrument (likely SI 2007/62 or another subsequent SI).
- SI 2002/132 may have introduced a regulatory measure in a specific area (e.g., environmental standards, employment, or public services), which was later superseded or withdrawn.

**4. Legal Significance:**
- Repeal means that the provision no longer exists in the current legal framework.
- Any legal obligations, duties, or rules previously derived from these sections are now void.
- Repeals are typically used to modernize, simplify, or align regulations with current policy or law.

**5. Contextual Notes:**
- The repeated references to SI/2007-62, s. 3 suggest that this repeal may have been part of a broader regulatory reform, possibly related to a sector such as health, safety, or local government.
- Without the original text of the repealed regulation, the specific subject matter (e.g., licensing of premises, fire safety, environmental standards) cannot be determined.

**Conclusion:**
There is **no active regulation** described in the provided text. Instead, it is a **list of repeals** indicating that specific sections of two statutory instruments (SI 2002/132 and SI 2007/62) have been formally removed from legal effect. These repeals reflect legislative updates or reforms, but the original content of the repealed provisions is not included in the provided summary.

To fully understand the implications, one would need to consult:
- The original text of SI 2002/132 and SI 2007/62,
- The reasons for repeal (e.g., policy changes, redundancy, incompatibility),
- The replacement provisions (if any).

Thus, this entry serves as a **legal record of removal**, not a summary of a current or active regulation.
