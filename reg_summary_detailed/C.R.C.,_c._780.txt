**Detailed Summary of the *Railway Rolling Stock (Canadian Manufactured) Remission Order, No. 1***

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is formally titled:  
**Railway Rolling Stock (Canadian Manufactured) Remission Order, No. 1**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a specific Canadian government order under the customs and trade framework to provide remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duties for certain imported materials and articles used in the manufacture of railway rolling stock produced in Canada during a defined period.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

- **Minister**: Refers to the **Minister of National Revenue**, responsible for administering the customs duty remission provisions under this Order.

- **Railway Rolling Stock**: Defined as:
  - Railway passenger, baggage, and freight cars;
  - Manufactured **in Canada**;
  - Purchased **between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1985**;
  - Acquired by **Canadian companies**;
  - Intended for use in **international service** (i.e., operated outside of Canada).

> This definition establishes the scope of eligible rolling stock and sets the historical timeframe for eligibility.

### **3. Scope of Remission (Duty Exemption)**

Under this Order, **customs duty is remitted** (exempted) in respect of the following categories of imported articles and materials:

#### **(a) Materials used in the manufacture, production, or integration of railway rolling stock**
- Includes:
  - Imported articles and materials that are:
    - **Wrought into** (e.g., forged, shaped);
    - **Attached to** (e.g., bolted, welded);
    - **Used in the manufacture** of railway rolling stock.

#### **(b) Imported materials directly consumed in manufacturing or production**
- Applies to all imported materials (excluding fuel or plant equipment) that are:
  - **Directly consumed** during the manufacturing process of railway rolling stock.

#### **(c) Imported materials in sufficient quantity to produce railway rolling stock**
- Applies when:
  1. **Domestic materials of the same class** are used or consumed in the manufacturing process;
  2. The imported materials were **used in the plant** producing the rolling stock during the **12-month period immediately preceding** the date of production of the rolling stock.

> This provision supports domestic content and ensures that imported inputs are only exempted when domestic alternatives were also used — promoting local industry participation.

> **Note**: Paragraph (1)(b) applies **only to customs duties paid on or after April 1, 1981**.

### **4. Conditions for Claiming Remission**

To qualify for remission, the manufacturer must meet **three conditions**:

1. **Claim must be filed after international service entry**  
   - A claim for remission must be submitted to the Minister **after** the railway rolling stock has entered international service.

2. **Customs duty must have been paid within four years prior to filing**  
   - The duty paid on the relevant imported materials must have been paid within the **four-year period immediately before** the date the claim is filed.

3. **Manufacturer must provide required information**  
   - The manufacturer must supply the Minister with:
     - All necessary documentation;
     - In a form and manner **as specified by the Minister**;
     - To facilitate proper administration and audit of the remission claim.

> This ensures accountability and transparency in the remission process.

### **5. Adjustments to Remission Based on By-Products or Waste**

#### **(a) Reduction due to by-products**
- If imported materials are processed and result in a **merchantable by-product** (e.g., a usable chemical or metal by-product):
  - The remission amount is **reduced proportionally**.
  - The reduction is based on the **value of the by-product** relative to the **total value of all production** from the original materials.

> Example: If $100 of imported steel produces $100 of rolling stock and $10 of usable scrap, remission is reduced by 10%.

#### **(b) Reduction due to merchantable scrap or waste**
- If the manufacturing process results in **merchantable scrap or waste** (i.e., materials that can be sold or reused):
  - Remission is reduced by an amount calculated as follows:
    - Apply the **Canadian sales value** of the scrap/waste;
    - Multiply it by the **prevailing customs duty rate** on such scrap/waste when imported as such.

> This ensures that the government is not receiving a benefit from the use of materials that generate a recoverable product.

#### **(c) Limitation on duty rate used for scrap/waste calculation**
- **No reduction can be based on a higher customs duty rate** than the one actually paid on the original imported materials.
- This prevents manipulation or over-reduction by using artificially high duty rates.

> This clause ensures fairness and prevents abuse of the system.

---

### **6. Repayment Requirement (Reversal of Remission)**

- If, **within 10 years** of the date when any railway rolling stock enters international service:
  - The rolling stock is **removed from international service**;
  - And **placed into domestic service in Canada**;
  - For **more than 90 days in any calendar year**;

> Then, the **manufacturer must repay the full amount of remission** granted.

- This provision acts as a **reversal mechanism** to prevent the misuse of remission benefits when rolling stock is repurposed for domestic use — which may have been intended to support international operations.

### **7. Key Objectives and Policy Implications**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Support for Canadian Manufacturing** | Encourages domestic production of railway rolling stock by reducing the cost of imported inputs. |
| **Promotion of Domestic Content** | Requires use of domestic materials when importing, supporting local industries. |
| **Transparency and Accountability** | Mandates documentation and time-bound claims to prevent fraud or misuse. |
| **Prevention of Benefit Abuse** | The repayment clause ensures that remission benefits are not exploited by shifting rolling stock between international and domestic service. |
| **Environmental and Economic Efficiency** | By-products and waste are accounted for, reflecting real-world production costs and resource use. |

---

### **8. Timeframe and Historical Context**

- The Order applies to rolling stock manufactured in Canada between **1969 and 1985**.
- It was likely enacted in the **early 1980s**, following a period of significant investment in Canada’s rail infrastructure and international rail operations (e.g., through Canadian National Railway or Canadian Pacific).
- The focus on post-1969 production reflects a policy period aimed at strengthening Canadian industrial capacity during a time of economic transition.

---

### **9. Summary of Key Provisions (Bullet Points)**

✅ **Remission applies to**:  
- Imported materials used in manufacturing, shaping, or attaching rolling stock.  
- Directly consumed materials (excluding fuel/plant equipment).  
- Materials in sufficient quantity to produce rolling stock, where domestic materials were also used in the 12 months prior to production.

✅ **Eligibility conditions**:  
- Claim filed after international service entry.  
- Duty paid within 4 years before claim.  
- Full documentation provided to Minister.

✅ **By-product and waste adjustments**:  
- Remission reduced by proportion of by-product value.  
- Remission reduced by value of scrap × prevailing duty rate on scrap.  
- No higher duty rates allowed for scrap calculations.

✅ **Repayment clause**:  
- If rolling stock is placed in **domestic service for >90 days in any year** within **10 years** of international service entry, **full remission must be repaid**.

### **Conclusion**

The *Railway Rolling Stock (Canadian Manufactured) Remission Order, No. 1* is a targeted customs policy designed to:

- Support and incentivize the **domestic manufacturing** of railway rolling stock during a critical period (1969–1985);  
- Ensure **economic fairness** by requiring domestic material use and accounting for by-products and waste;  
- Maintain **accountability** through strict claim and repayment rules;  
- Prevent **abuse** of remission benefits by restricting use of rolling stock to international operations.

It reflects a broader Canadian industrial policy aimed at building self-sufficiency in key transportation infrastructure, while balancing trade obligations and fiscal responsibility.

--- 

**Final Note**: This Order is a legacy regulation and may no longer be actively enforced today, given the age of the rolling stock and the current state of Canada’s rail industry. However, it remains a significant example of targeted customs remission policy in Canadian trade law.
