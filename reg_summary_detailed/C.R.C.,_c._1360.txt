If a participant ceases employment and has unpaid contributions:
- **For annuities or annual allowances**:
  - Contributions are **deducted from the monthly payments** of the annuity or annual allowance:
    - Equal to the amount of the monthly instalment otherwise payable under section 6, or

  - Or, the participant may **elect to pay in a lump sum** at the time the annuity begins.

> This ensures that the superannuation obligation is not left unpaid and is integrated into the retirement benefit structure.

---

### 5. **Contributions for Seasonal and Sessional Employees**

- If a participant on **educational leave or seasonal lay-off** receives **less salary** than they would have received had they not been on leave:
  - They are **deemed to have been employed** during that period.
  - The **salary deemed received** is the amount they would have received had they not been on leave.

---

### 7. **Elective Participant Contributions (Post-1995)**

  - Entitled to an immediate annuity upon ceasing RCRA contributions.
- The reduction **begins on the earlier of**:
  - **April 1st** or

- Subsequent contributions due **annually on or before the 30th day after the anniversary** of the date of leaving service.

---

### 12. **Pro Rata Refund for Overlapping Contributions**
- If an elective participant pays a contribution for a period longer than one month and then **becomes a participant under Part II of the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act or the Public Service Superannuation Act**, they are entitled to a **pro rata refund**.
- The refund is calculated as:
  - **Numerator**: Number of complete calendar months remaining until the next due date.
