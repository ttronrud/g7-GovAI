**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Withdrawal from Disposal Order (East Arm of Great Slave Lake National Park — Great Slave Lake, N.W.T.)**

---

### **1. Legal Authority and Context**

This regulation is issued under the authority of the **Territorial Lands Act**, specifically **paragraph 23(a)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) to withdraw certain lands from disposal for public purposes, including the establishment of protected areas such as national parks.

The regulation **repeals** an earlier **Withdrawal from Disposal Order** made by Order in Council **P.C. 1970-526** dated March 24, 1970. This repeal indicates a revision or update to the land-use plan, likely reflecting changes in environmental planning, administrative decisions, or the evolution of national park proposals.

The new Order is officially cited as:  
**"The Withdrawal from Disposal Order (East Arm of Great Slave Lake National Park — Great Slave Lake, N.W.T.)"**  
and is published in the *Canada Gazette, Part II*, on **SOR/70-119, 1970, p. 389**.

### **2. Purpose of the Order**

The primary objective of this Order is to **withdraw a specific parcel of land from disposal** in order to **establish a proposed national park** on the **East Arm of Great Slave Lake**, located in the **Northwest Territories (N.W.T.)**.

By withdrawing these lands from disposal, the federal government ensures that the area will not be available for sale, lease, or other commercial development, thereby protecting it for conservation, ecological, cultural, and recreational purposes.

### **3. Scope of the Withdrawal**

The lands described in the **Schedule** (attached to the Order) are formally withdrawn from disposal. This means:

- The land is no longer available for allocation to private individuals, companies, or institutions.
- It is reserved for the purposes of establishing a **national park**, specifically in the **East Arm of Great Slave Lake**.
- The withdrawal applies to all surface and subsurface rights unless specifically exempted.

The total area of the withdrawn parcel is approximately **7,337 square kilometers**, more or less.

### **4. Detailed Description of the Land**

The land is precisely described using a series of bearings and coordinates, referencing topographic features from the **Artillery Lake map sheet (75 N.W. and 75 N.E.)**, produced in 1966 at a scale of **1:500,000** by the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (now Environment and Climate Change Canada).
