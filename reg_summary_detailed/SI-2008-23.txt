### **Purpose of the Regulation**

This regulation grants a *remission* (i.e., a partial or full forgiveness or waiver) of certain fees that were previously charged or were due to foreign marine carriers under the *Oceans Act*. The remission is intended to serve the public interest by alleviating financial burdens on specific foreign operators, particularly in the context of international maritime activities governed by Canadian ocean policy and regulatory frameworks.

---

### **Background and Context**

- The *Oceans Act* (specifically subsection 47(1)) established a fee structure for marine carriers operating in Canadian waters. These fees were designed to support the management, conservation, and sustainable development of Canada’s ocean resources.
- Between **1997 and 2005**, foreign marine carriers were required to pay these fees under subsection 47(1) of the *Oceans Act*.
- Over time, it was determined that a remission of these fees would be in the **public interest**, particularly to:
  - Encourage international cooperation in marine resource management;
  - Support the economic and environmental sustainability of Canada’s oceans;
  - Recognize the complexity of international maritime operations and the potential for disproportionate financial impact on foreign operators.

### **Key Provisions of the Regulation**

1. **Scope of Remission:**
   - The remission applies specifically to **foreign marine carriers** listed in **Column 1 of the Schedule** attached to the regulation.
   - The amounts being remitted are specified in **Column 2 of the Schedule**.
   - The fees covered pertain to the period from **1997 to 2005**, inclusive.

2. **Legal Basis:**
   - The remission is authorized under **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Governor in Council to make remissions of amounts owed to the Government of Canada when it is in the public interest.
   - This provision allows for flexibility in fiscal policy when public interest considerations outweigh strict revenue collection.

3. **Recommendation and Approval Process:**
   - The decision was made on the **recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** (responsible for ocean policy and marine management) and the **Treasury Board** (responsible for fiscal and administrative oversight).
   - This demonstrates a collaborative, policy-driven approach involving both sectoral and financial authorities.

4. **Public Interest Justification:**
   - The regulation explicitly states that the remission is "in the public interest," indicating that the decision was not based solely on revenue considerations but on broader goals such as:
     - Promoting international maritime collaboration;
     - Enhancing Canada’s ability to manage shared ocean resources;
     - Supporting sustainable marine development through equitable financial arrangements.

### **Implications and Effects**

- **Financial Relief:** Foreign marine carriers listed in the schedule will no longer be required to pay the specified fees for the years 1997 to 2005.
- **Administrative Simplification:** The remission streamlines the collection process and reduces administrative burdens on both the Government and the carriers.
- **Policy Significance:** The regulation reflects Canada’s commitment to international cooperation and sustainable ocean governance, signaling a balanced approach to regulatory compliance and international relations.

---

### **Limitations and Exclusions**

- The remission applies **only to the specified carriers and fees** listed in the schedule.
- It does **not extend to fees paid after 2005** or to other marine users (e.g., domestic carriers or other types of maritime operations).
- The remission is **not retroactive beyond the 1997–2005 period**.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation represents a targeted, public-interest-based financial relief measure. By remitting fees owed by specific foreign marine carriers between 1997 and 2005, the Government of Canada promotes international collaboration, supports sustainable ocean management, and demonstrates fiscal responsibility in the face of complex maritime governance challenges. It is a practical example of how regulatory policy can align with broader environmental and diplomatic objectives.
