**Detailed Summary of the Saskatchewan Egg Order**

---

**Title:**  
*The Saskatchewan Egg Order*  
This regulation may be cited as the *Saskatchewan Egg Order*.

---

**Key Definitions in the Order:**

1. **Act**  
   Refers to *The Natural Products Marketing Act of Saskatchewan* (Loi). This is the foundational legislation that establishes the legal framework under which the Commodity Board operates, particularly in regulating the marketing of agricultural products such as eggs.

2. **Commodity Board**  
   Refers to *The Saskatchewan Commercial Egg Producers’ Marketing Board* (Office de commercialisation). This body is established under the Natural Products Marketing Act and is responsible for overseeing the marketing of eggs produced in Saskatchewan. It has regulatory authority over both local and interprovincial/export markets.

3. **Eggs**  
   Defined as *any shell eggs of the domestic hen offered for sale for human consumption and produced in Saskatchewan*. This definition ensures that only eggs meeting specific criteria—origin, species, and intended use—are included within the scope of the Order.

4. **Plan**  
   Refers to *The Saskatchewan Commercial Egg Producers’ Marketing Plan*, which is established and periodically amended under the Act. The Plan sets out the rules, strategies, and mechanisms for marketing, pricing, and distribution of eggs, including provisions for market stability, producer support, and revenue sharing.

**Core Authority and Purpose of the Order:**

The primary objective of this Order is to **grant the Commodity Board expanded regulatory powers** to manage the **marketing of eggs in interprovincial and export markets**, ensuring fair practices, market stability, and equitable returns for producers.

---

**Key Provisions and Powers Granted to the Commodity Board:**

1. **Regulatory Authority Over Interprovincial and Export Trade**  
   The Commodity Board is authorized to regulate the marketing of eggs beyond Saskatchewan’s borders—specifically in interprovincial trade and export markets. This includes setting rules, standards, and procedures for how eggs are marketed, priced, and distributed outside the province.

2. **Exercise of Powers Equivalent to Local Marketing Authority**  
   For the purpose of regulating interprovincial and export marketing, the Board may exercise *all or any powers* it currently holds in relation to the local marketing of eggs within Saskatchewan. This means the Board can apply the same rules, pricing mechanisms, and oversight tools used domestically to foreign and cross-border markets.

3. **Revocation of Previous Provision (SOR/80-90)**  
   A prior provision in the Order (SOR/80-90) has been *revoked*. This indicates a legislative update or correction, likely to modernize or clarify the Board’s authority, remove outdated or redundant clauses, and strengthen current regulatory frameworks.

4. **Power to Fix, Impose, and Collect Levies or Charges**  
   The Commodity Board is empowered to:
   - **Fix, impose, and collect levies or charges** from individuals or entities involved in the marketing of eggs (as defined in section 3 of the Act).
   - These levies are specifically targeted at persons engaged in the *interprovincial and export marketing* of eggs.

5. **Classification of Marketers into Groups**  
   The Board may **classify marketing entities into different groups** based on factors such as volume, type of operation, or market segment.  
   - Each group may be assigned a **different levy or charge** based on its size, activity level, or market role.  
   - This enables a tiered, equitable system where larger or more active marketers may pay higher fees, while smaller entities may pay less.

6. **Use of Levies and Charges**  
   The funds collected through these levies and charges may be used for several key purposes, including:
   - **Creation of reserves** (to ensure financial stability during market downturns or supply surpluses),
   - **Payment of operational expenses** and **losses** incurred due to the sale or disposal of eggs (e.g., unsold inventory, price drops, or market fluctuations),
   - **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among egg producers.  
     This means that if some producers benefit from strong market conditions (e.g., high prices), the Board can use levy funds to redistribute income to others who may have experienced lower returns—promoting fairness and economic balance across the producer base.

7. **Periodic Determination of Equalization Periods**  
   The Board has discretion to determine *when* and *for how long* such equalization or adjustment will occur. This flexibility allows the Board to respond to changing market dynamics, such as seasonal fluctuations or economic shocks.

---

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Market Stability**: By establishing a system of levies and revenue redistribution, the Order helps stabilize egg prices and protect producers from volatile market conditions.
- **Equity Among Producers**: The equalization mechanism ensures that no single producer bears the full brunt of market volatility, promoting a more sustainable and inclusive industry.
- **Financial Resilience**: The creation of reserves and the ability to fund losses provide a financial safety net for producers, especially during periods of low demand or price drops.
- **Regulatory Clarity and Flexibility**: The Board has broad authority to adapt its approach based on market conditions, allowing for responsive and dynamic regulation.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Saskatchewan Egg Order* empowers the Saskatchewan Commercial Egg Producers’ Marketing Board to effectively manage the interprovincial and export marketing of eggs. By enabling the imposition of tiered levies, classification of marketers, and targeted use of collected funds for reserves, expenses, and revenue equalization, the Order strengthens market stability, supports producer equity, and ensures long-term sustainability in Saskatchewan’s egg industry. The revocation of outdated provisions reflects a commitment to regulatory modernization and efficiency.
