## ⚠️ Important Exception: Real Property Joint Ventures (Paragraph 1(b))

A key exception applies to **real property joint ventures** that are **not residential complexes**:

> If a participant in a joint venture (or someone associated with or related to a participant) uses **all or part of the property** in a non-commercial way, **then the activity is NOT considered a prescribed activity** under subsection 273(1), **unless** the following conditions are met:

### Conditions for Non-Prescribed Status (i.e., activity not exempt):

1. **Use of property is not exclusively commercial**  
   → The participant uses the property for **non-commercial purposes** (e.g., personal residence, family use, non-business activity).

2. **No taxable supply of a right to use/occupy the property**  
   → The person **does not receive** a taxable supply that gives them the right to use or possess the property.

3. **OR**, if they **do receive** such a supply:
   - They **do not pay tax** on it, or
   - The tax paid is **less than the fair market value** of the use, occupation, or possession.

> ❌ If any of these conditions are **not satisfied**, then the activity **is not exempt** — it may be subject to excise tax.

> ✅ This exception protects situations where property is used personally or for non-commercial purposes, even in joint ventures.
