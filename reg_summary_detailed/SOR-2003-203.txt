**Detailed Summary of the Regulations Respecting the Possession of Tobacco Products That Are Not Stamped**  
*(S.C. 2002, c. 22 – Effective July 1, 2003)*

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under the authority of the *Excise Act, 2001*, provide specific exemptions allowing certain individuals or entities to possess tobacco or cannabis products that are **not stamped** with excise duty markings — a requirement under Canadian excise law. The purpose is to ensure that legitimate transport, processing, and distribution activities involving controlled goods are not unduly hindered by the requirement for stamping, while still maintaining compliance with excise duties and regulatory oversight.

The regulations are structured around several key provisions of the *Excise Act, 2001*, and apply to **tobacco products**, **cannabis products**, and **vaping products**. Each category has distinct conditions under which possession of unstamped goods is permitted.

## **1. Possession of Tobacco Products That Are Not Stamped**

Under **paragraph 32(2)(d)** of the *Excise Act, 2001*, a person may possess unstamped tobacco products if one of the following conditions applies:

### **Condition A: Authorized Transporter under Customs Act**
- The person is **authorized by an officer** under **section 19 of the Customs Act** to transport tobacco products.
- The tobacco products were **reported under section 12 of the Customs Act** (i.e., declared in advance).
- The person is acting **in accordance with that authorization**.

> *This allows customs officers or authorized agents to move tobacco products during official transport operations without requiring a stamp at the time of possession.*

### **Condition B: Transporting on Behalf of a Licensed Entity**
The person may possess unstamped tobacco products if they have documentation proving they are transporting the product on behalf of:
- A **tobacco licensee**
- An **excise warehouse licensee**
- A **special excise warehouse licensee**
- A **duty-free shop licensee**
- Any person if the tobacco products are designated as **ships’ stores** under the *Ships’ Stores Regulations*
- An **accredited representative**

> *This permits legitimate business actors (e.g., distributors, warehouse staff, or duty-free agents) to carry unstamped tobacco temporarily during transit, provided they have valid documentation and are acting on behalf of a licensed party.*

## **2. Possession of Cannabis Products That Are Not Stamped**

Under **subparagraph 158.11(3)(a)(i)** of the *Excise Act, 2001*, a person may possess unstamped cannabis products if:
- They have documentation proving they are transporting the cannabis product **on behalf of**:
  - A **cannabis licensee**, or
  - An **industrial hemp grower** (in the case of industrial hemp by-products)

> *This enables lawful movement of cannabis for commercial or agricultural purposes, with proof of authorization.*

---

## **3. Possession of Cannabis Products for Sterilization**

Under **subparagraph 158.11(3)(a)(ii)**, a person may possess unstamped cannabis products if:
1. They are **sterilizing** the cannabis product **on behalf of a cannabis licensee**;
2. The **cannabis licensee owns** the product throughout the period of possession; and  
3. The product is to be **returned to the licensee’s premises as soon as possible after sterilization**.

> *This exception supports the safe and compliant processing of cannabis (e.g., for hygiene or safety purposes), ensuring ownership and accountability are maintained.*

## **4. Possession of Cannabis Products in Specific Provinces (Medical Use)**

Under **paragraph 158.11(6)(a)**, a person may possess cannabis products that are **not stamped** (indicating no additional provincial duty has been paid) **in a specified province** if:

- The person holds a **licence for sale for medical purposes** issued under **section 62 of the Cannabis Act**, **OR**
- The person is **authorized by another province** to sell cannabis in that province, and if the other province is a "specified province," the products are stamped to show payment of additional duty for that province, **OR**
- The person is an **individual** possessing cannabis for **personal use**, and the total amount does **not exceed 30 grams of dried cannabis**, as defined under the *Cannabis Act*.

> *This allows medical cannabis users and licensed sellers to possess unstamped cannabis in specific provinces, with clear limits on personal use and requirements for commercial authorization.*

## **5. Possession of Vaping Products in Specified Vaping Provinces**

Under **subsection 158.44(2)** of the *Excise Act, 2001*, a person may possess unstamped vaping products in a **specified vaping province** if:

- The vaping products are to be **sold or offered for sale** to consumers in **another province**, and:
  - If the other province is a **specified vaping province**, the products must be **stamped** to indicate payment of additional vaping duty for that province; **OR**
- The person is an **individual** possessing the vaping products for **personal use**.

> *This allows for cross-provincial distribution of vaping products, with a requirement that products intended for sale in a specified province must be properly stamped. Personal use is permitted without stamping.*

---

## **6. Possession of Vaping Products (Transport Exception)**

Under **paragraph 158.44(3)(b)**, a person may possess unstamped vaping products if:
- They are **authorized by an officer** under **section 19 of the Customs Act** to transport vaping products that were reported under section 12 of that Act, and are acting in accordance with that authorization; **OR**
- They have documentation proving they are transporting the vaping product on behalf of:
  - A **vaping product licensee**
  - An **excise warehouse licensee**
  - An **accredited representative**

> *This mirrors the tobacco transport exemption, allowing authorized personnel or agents to carry unstamped vaping products during legitimate transport operations.*

## **Key Regulatory Principles and Implications**

| Principle | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Exemptions are limited and conditional** | Possession of unstamped goods is only allowed under strict, documented circumstances — not for general use or unlicensed individuals. |
| **Documentation is required** | Proof of authorization, ownership, or transport responsibility is mandatory for all exceptions. |
| **Provincial specificity** | Some exemptions apply only in certain provinces (e.g., "specified provinces" for cannabis and vaping), reflecting regional differences in regulation. |
| **Ownership and accountability** | In cases involving sterilization or commercial movement, ownership must be clearly established and products must be returned promptly. |
| **Personal use limits** | Personal possession is capped at **30 grams of dried cannabis**; no such limit is specified for vaping products (only for personal use). |

## **Effective Date**

These regulations came into force on **July 1, 2003**.

## **Purpose and Regulatory Context**

These rules are part of a broader framework designed to:
- Facilitate **lawful commerce** in tobacco and cannabis products;
- Allow **authorized transport** and processing without unnecessary delays;
- Ensure **traceability and accountability** of controlled substances;
- Balance **public health and safety** with **commercial and medical needs**.

By permitting temporary possession of unstamped goods under strict conditions, the regulations support efficient operations in customs, warehousing, medical distribution, and interprovincial trade — while preventing misuse or unregulated distribution.

## **Conclusion**

The *Regulations Respecting the Possession of Tobacco Products That Are Not Stamped* (S.C. 2002, c. 22) establish a **targeted, rule-based exemption system** for individuals and entities involved in legitimate transport, processing, and distribution of tobacco and cannabis products. These exemptions are narrowly defined, require verifiable documentation, and are strictly limited to authorized persons or specific uses — ensuring that the integrity of the excise system is preserved while enabling necessary commercial and medical activities.

These regulations reflect a modern, risk-based approach to excise compliance, adapting to evolving market needs and the realities of cross-border and interprovincial trade.
