**Detailed Summary of the Exemption Order on Labelling Requirements for Certain Natural Health Products**

---

### **1. Purpose and Context of the Regulation**

This regulation, titled *Exemption Order in Respect of Labelling Requirements for Certain Natural Health Products*, is issued by the **Minister of Health** under **section 30.05a of the Food and Drugs Act** (S.C. 2024, c. 17, s. 326; R.S., c. F-27). The Minister determines that the order is necessary for a **health or safety purpose** or is otherwise in the **public interest**, and that it will not result in **unacceptable health, safety, or environmental risks**—or an **unacceptable degree of uncertainty** regarding such risks.

The order provides a **temporary exemption** from strict labelling requirements for certain natural health products (NHPs) that were previously compliant with the older labelling standards but are now subject to revised requirements under updated regulations.

### **2. Key Definitions Used in the Order**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| **Commencement Day** | The date on which the *Regulations Amending the Natural Health Products Regulations* (Order in Council P.C. 2022-710, registered as SOR/2022-146) come into force. This is a critical reference point for determining when the new labelling rules apply. |
| **Former Regulations** | The version of the Natural Health Products Regulations in effect *immediately before* the commencement day. |
| **New Regulations** | The version of the Natural Health Products Regulations as they exist *on the commencement day*. |
| **Product Licence** | A licence issued under section 7 of the Regulations, authorizing the marketing and sale of a natural health product. |
| **Regulations** | Refers to the Natural Health Products Regulations generally. |

> *Note:* Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in this Order have the same meaning as in the Regulations.

### **3. Core Provision: Exemption from Labelling Requirements**

#### **Main Exemption Clause (Subsection 1)**
> *Subject to the condition set out in subsection (2), every natural health product for which a product licence has been issued on or after the day on which this Order comes into force and that is not labelled in accordance with the new Regulations is exempt from the application of sections 86 to 94 of the new Regulations as they apply to labelling.*

**What this means:**
- Natural health products that have a **product licence issued on or after the date this Order comes into force** (June 21, 2025) are **exempt** from the new labelling requirements (specifically sections 86 to 94 of the new Regulations).
- However, this exemption **only applies if** the product is **not labelled in accordance with the new Regulations**.
- The exemption is **not automatic**—it is conditional on the product being *non-compliant* with the new labelling rules.

#### **Requirement for Labeling (Subsection 2)**
> *The natural health product must, when it is sold, be labelled in accordance with the former Regulations.*

**What this means:**
- Even though the product is exempt from the *new* labelling rules, it **must still be labelled in accordance with the former (pre-2025) labelling requirements** when sold to consumers.
- This ensures that products continue to be clearly and consistently labelled, maintaining consumer safety and transparency during the transition period.

#### **Condition Exception (Subsection 2 – Exception for Manufacturers and Distributors)**
> *The condition does not apply if the sale of the natural health product is to a manufacturer or distributor.*

**What this means:**
- If a natural health product is being sold **to a manufacturer or distributor** (not to a final consumer), then the requirement to label in accordance with the former Regulations **does not apply**.
- This allows for internal business operations and supply chain continuity during the transition, without requiring compliance with the older labelling standards for non-end-user transactions.

### **4. Timeline and Effective Dates**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **June 21, 2025** | The Order **comes into force**. This is the date from which product licences issued *on or after* this date are eligible for the exemption. |
| **June 21, 2028** | The Order is **repealed** (i.e., it ceases to apply). This marks the end of the transitional period. |
| **Registration Date (if later)** | If the Order is registered after June 21, 2025, it will come into force on the **date of registration**, not June 21, 2025. |

> This phased timeline ensures a **controlled transition** from the old to the new labelling regime, giving industry stakeholders time to adapt.

### **5. Regulatory Rationale and Public Interest Justification**

The Minister has concluded that:
- The new labelling requirements (under the updated Regulations) are **necessary for public health and safety**.
- However, a **gradual transition** is required to allow manufacturers and distributors to adjust to the new rules.
- The exemption is **not intended to undermine safety standards**, but to **avoid disruption** to the market while ensuring that consumers continue to receive accurate and clear product information.
- The risk of **unacceptable health, safety, or environmental risks** is assessed as **low**, and the level of uncertainty is deemed **acceptable**.

### **6. Key Implications for Stakeholders**

| Stakeholder | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Manufacturers & Distributors** | Can continue to use the former labelling standards for products with licences issued on or after June 21, 2025, provided they are not sold to end consumers. Must transition to new labelling by June 21, 2028. |
| **Retailers & Wholesalers** | Must ensure that products sold to consumers are labelled according to the **former Regulations** until the transition is complete. |
| **Consumers** | Will continue to receive products with familiar labelling formats during the transition period. Final labelling will be updated to meet new standards by 2028. |
| **Regulatory Authority** | Will monitor compliance and ensure that the exemption does not lead to safety lapses or misleading information. |

### **7. Conclusion**

This Exemption Order is a **temporary, targeted transitional measure** designed to:

- Facilitate a smooth shift from the former to the new labelling requirements for natural health products.
- Protect public health and safety by ensuring that products remain clearly and accurately labelled.
- Provide flexibility for industry actors during the transition period, especially for internal sales and supply chains.
- Ensure that the public continues to receive reliable product information without disruption.

The exemption is **time-bound**, ending on **June 21, 2028**, after which all natural health products must comply fully with the new labelling standards under the updated Natural Health Products Regulations.

### **Final Note**
This Order reflects a balanced approach to regulation—ensuring public safety while allowing sufficient time for industry adaptation. It is a key component of the government’s broader strategy to modernize natural health product regulation in a way that is both effective and practical.
