**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

The regulation in question is a formal administrative transfer of responsibilities within the Canadian federal public service, issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Issuing Authority**:  
   The regulation is issued by *Her Excellency the Governor General in Council*, acting on the recommendation of the *Prime Minister*. This indicates that the decision is part of a formal, constitutional process whereby the Governor General, acting on the advice of the federal executive (specifically the Prime Minister), exercises the power to reorganize public service functions.

2. **Legal Basis**:  
   The transfer is authorized under *paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. This provision grants the Governor General in Council the power to transfer control and supervision of specific public service functions or offices between different departments or agencies of the federal government, provided such a transfer is consistent with the public service’s operational efficiency and accountability.

3. **Subject of the Transfer**:  
   The transfer involves the *Government Travel Modernization Office (GTMO)*, which is a component of the *Treasury Board Secretariat*.  
   - The GTMO is responsible for overseeing and modernizing government travel policies, procedures, and systems. This includes managing travel standards, procurement of travel services, cost control, and the implementation of technology solutions to improve travel efficiency and transparency across federal departments.

4. **Transfer of Control and Supervision**:  
   The regulation explicitly transfers *control and supervision* of the GTMO from the *Treasury Board* to the *Department of Public Works and Government Services (DPWGS)*.  
   - This means that DPWGS will now be responsible for managing the day-to-day operations, strategic direction, budgeting, staffing, and performance oversight of the GTMO.  
   - Treasury Board, which previously held this responsibility, will no longer have direct oversight over the office.

5. **Implications of the Transfer**:  
   - **Organizational Realignment**: This reflects a broader effort to restructure the federal public service to align functions with current priorities, such as operational efficiency, cost savings, and service delivery improvements.  
   - **Enhanced Oversight**: DPWGS, as a department with a mandate that includes infrastructure, government services, and public works, may bring a more integrated approach to travel modernization, particularly in relation to government operations and service delivery.  
   - **Potential for Cross-Departmental Coordination**: The move may facilitate better coordination between travel policy and broader government services, especially in areas such as procurement, asset management, and public spending oversight.

6. **Purpose and Rationale (Implied)**:  
   The transfer likely aims to:  
   - Improve the effectiveness of government travel policy by placing it under a department with broader responsibilities for government services and infrastructure.  
   - Streamline decision-making and accountability by aligning the GTMO with a department that has a more direct stake in the operational efficiency of government services.  
   - Support ongoing modernization initiatives in public administration, such as digitization and cost reduction.

**Conclusion**:  
This regulation represents a significant reorganization within the federal public service. It formally transfers the operational and supervisory control of the Government Travel Modernization Office from the Treasury Board Secretariat to the Department of Public Works and Government Services. The move is legally grounded in existing legislation and reflects a strategic shift to enhance the efficiency, accountability, and integration of government travel policy within the broader framework of public service delivery. The transfer underscores the government’s commitment to modernizing administrative processes and aligning public service functions with current operational and fiscal priorities.
