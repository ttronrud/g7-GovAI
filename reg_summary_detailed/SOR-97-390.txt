### Detailed Summary:

#### 1. **Repeal of SOR/2007-115, s. 401**
- This section refers to **Section 401** of **SOR/2007-115**, which is a statutory rule (regulation) issued in 2007.
- The notation "[Repealed]" indicates that **this section has been officially canceled or abolished** by subsequent legislation or regulatory action.
- SOR/2007-115 is a **regulation under the Ontario government’s regulatory framework**, likely related to a specific area such as health, safety, environmental protection, or licensing.
- The specific content of Section 401 is **no longer in force**, meaning it no longer applies to any legal or administrative matters.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: The repeated occurrence of this repeal (over 50 times) suggests a formatting or data entry error. It does not imply that the regulation had multiple applications or iterations. Such repetition is likely due to a technical glitch or duplication in the source document.

#### 2. **Repeal of SOR/2002-151, s. 16**
- This refers to **Section 16** of **SOR/2002-151**, another statutory rule issued in 2002.
- Like the previous, this section has also been **repealed**, meaning it is no longer valid or enforceable.
- SOR/2002-151 may relate to a different area of regulation (e.g., employment standards, workplace safety, or public health), depending on the subject matter of that regulation.

> 🔍 **Contextual Insight**: The fact that two different sections from different years (2002 and 2007) are both marked as repealed suggests that these were outdated or superseded by newer legislation or administrative reforms.

### Legal and Regulatory Implications:

- **No Current Legal Effect**: Since both sections are repealed, they **do not apply** to any current legal proceedings, licensing decisions, or regulatory enforcement.
- **Superseded by Newer Rules**: The repealed provisions were likely replaced by updated regulations that better reflect current policy, technology, or legal standards.
- **Legal Research Note**: When researching regulations, it is essential to check the **current status** of a provision. Repealed sections must be excluded from interpretation or application.

### Conclusion:

The provided text is a list of **repealed regulatory provisions**:
- **Section 401 of SOR/2007-115** and

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> These sections are **no longer in effect** and should not be used as legal authority. The repeated listing is likely a data error.
