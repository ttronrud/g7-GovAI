**Detailed Summary of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in (GST) Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Purpose**  
The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in (GST) Remission Order is issued under the authority of the *Financial Administration Act*, specifically subsection 23(2)a. This provision allows the Governor General in Council—on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance—to make orders that provide for the remission (i.e., cancellation or forgiveness) of taxes in the public interest.  

The primary purpose of this Order is to implement a tax relief provision established in the *Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Self-Government Agreement*, thereby recognizing and supporting the self-government rights of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation.

**2. Legal Basis and Reference**  
- **Statutory Reference**: The Order is enacted under *S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2)*, which authorizes the Governor General in Council to issue such remission orders when it is in the public interest.  
- **Underlying Agreement**: The remission is directly tied to the *Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Self-Government Agreement*, which was signed on **July 16, 1998**, and as amended and finalized as of **November 2, 2000**. This version of the agreement is the authoritative text governing the tax provisions in question.

**3. Key Definitions**  
The Order includes two key definitions:  
- **"Agreement"**: Refers to the *Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Self-Government Agreement* as it stood on **November 2, 2000**. This is the legally binding version used to interpret the rights and obligations related to tax remission.  
- **"Person"**: Defined in accordance with *subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act*. This term refers to individuals or entities subject to excise tax obligations, including First Nations, individuals, corporations, or other taxable persons under the Act.

**4. Scope of the Remission**  
- **Tax Subject to Remission**: The Order grants a remission of **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** that was previously paid by a "person" during a specific period.  
- **Time Period**: The period covered is from **September 15, 1998**, to **October 31, 2000**.  
- **Tax Provision**: The remission applies to tax under **Part IX of the Excise Tax Act**, which governs GST.  
- **Limitation**: The remission is limited to the amounts that are specifically provided for in **sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Self-Government Agreement**. These sections outline the conditions and amounts under which tax relief is granted.  
- **Exclusion**: The remission **does not apply** if a refund would otherwise be payable under **section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act**. This means that if a person is otherwise entitled to a refund under that provision, the remission under this Order will not take effect.

---

**5. Conditions for Remission**  
The remission is not automatic or unconditional. It is granted **only to the extent and in the manner** specified in sections 15.7 to 15.11 of the Agreement. This ensures that the remission is consistent with the negotiated terms of self-government and does not exceed the scope agreed upon between the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in and the Government of Canada.

---

**6. Effective Date**  
The Order comes into force on **November 2, 2000**—the date on which the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Self-Government Agreement was finalized and officially adopted. This timing ensures that the remission applies to the tax obligations incurred during the specified period and aligns with the formal implementation of the self-government agreement.

---

**7. Significance and Implications**  
- This Order recognizes the unique status of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation as a self-governing community under the terms of the self-government agreement.  
- It provides financial relief by canceling GST payments made during a key transitional period (1998–2000), which may have been considered a burden in the early stages of self-governance.  
- It reflects a principle of **equity and fairness** in tax policy, acknowledging that First Nations may have faced economic challenges during the implementation of self-government arrangements.  
- The exclusion of refunds under section 18.1 of the Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act ensures that the remission does not create a conflict with other statutory refund mechanisms or obligations.

**Conclusion**  
The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in (GST) Remission Order is a targeted, legally grounded measure that provides tax relief to the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation for GST paid between September 15, 1998, and October 31, 2000. It is rooted in the self-government agreement and operates within defined limits to ensure compliance with broader federal tax and self-government legislation. By coming into force on November 2, 2000, the Order serves as a formal recognition of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in’s right to self-determination and financial autonomy in the context of federal tax policy.
