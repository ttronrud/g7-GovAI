### **Purpose of the Order**
The primary objective of this regulation is to provide a **partial remission of customs duty** on certain types of multi-level railway rolling stock (rail cars) that were imported into Canada from the United States. These cars were originally intended for **international service**, but were **temporarily diverted to domestic service for more than 90 days** in any calendar year prior to 1984.

This remission aims to:
- Support the operational flexibility of Canadian railways.
- Encourage cooperation between Canadian and U.S. railway companies and automotive manufacturers.
- Promote efficient use of shared rolling stock in both international and domestic transportation.
- Address the financial burden on importers due to temporary domestic use of vehicles originally intended for international operations.

### **Definition of "Multi-Level Railway Rolling Stock"**
The term specifically refers to:
1. **Railway cars manufactured in the United States**.
2. That have **more than one level** (i.e., multi-level or multi-deck design).
3. Equipped for the **transportation of motor vehicles** (e.g., trucks or cars).
4. Imported **before December 31, 1983**, for use in **international service**.
5. Imported under an agreement between **Canadian and U.S. railway companies and automotive manufacturers** to **pool** such cars for transporting motor vehicles.
6. Subject to the prior *Railway Rolling Stock (International Service) Remission Order, No. 4* at the time of importation.
7. That were **diverted temporarily from international service to domestic service for more than 90 days** in any calendar year before 1984.

> In essence, only those cars that meet all these criteria are eligible for remission.

### **Remission of Customs Duty**

A **partial remission** of customs duty is granted, meaning the duty is not fully waived but reduced.

#### **Amount of Remission:**
For each eligible car, the remitted amount equals:
- The **original customs duty** paid or payable under the *Customs Tariff*,
- **Less**:
  - **$400 per car** for each calendar year prior to 1984 in which the car was diverted to domestic service for **more than 90 days**.
  - **$33 per car per month (or portion thereof)** during which the car was temporarily diverted to domestic service in any calendar year prior to 1984.

> Example:
> If a car was diverted for 150 days (approximately 5 months) in a single year (e.g., 1982), the remission would be:
> - $400 (for the year exceeding 90 days)
> - $33 × 5 months = $165
> Total remission = $565 per car

> If a car was diverted in two separate years (e.g., 1981 and 1982), with 100 days in 1981 and 120 days in 1982:
> - $400 × 2 years = $800
> - $33 × (100/30 + 120/30) = $33 × (3.33 + 4) = $33 × 7.33 ≈ $242
> Total remission = $1,042 per car

> Note: The remission is **not applied per month or per day** independently; it is calculated cumulatively by year and by duration.

### **Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is subject to the following condition:

> The importer must **pay the calculated remission amounts within 90 days** of being formally notified that such amounts are owing.

Failure to pay within this period may result in:
- Penalties or interest,
- Revocation of the remission,
- Enforcement actions by the Minister of National Revenue.

---

### **Key Exclusions and Limitations**
- The remission applies **only to cars diverted for more than 90 days** in any calendar year before 1984.
- It does **not apply** to cars diverted for less than 90 days.
- It applies only to **cars imported before December 31, 1983**.
- It applies only to cars that were part of a **pooling agreement** between Canadian and U.S. rail and auto companies.
- The remission is **partial**, not full, so the original duty is not waived — only reduced.

---

### **Administrative and Practical Implications**
- The Order provides a **financial incentive** for Canadian railways to use U.S.-built multi-level cars in domestic operations, recognizing the temporary nature of such use.
- It reflects a policy of **economic pragmatism**, balancing trade obligations with operational needs.
- It is a **historical regulation**, applicable only to events occurring prior to 1984, and thus is no longer active in current customs policy.

---

### **Conclusion**
This regulation is a targeted, time-limited measure designed to:
- Reduce the financial impact of temporarily diverting U.S.-built, multi-level rail cars from international to domestic service.
- Encourage efficient and cooperative use of shared rolling stock between Canada and the U.S.
- Promote public interest through cost-effective, flexible transportation infrastructure use.

It serves as a **historical example** of how Canadian customs policy can adapt to cross-border operational realities, particularly in the context of intermodal freight transport involving automotive logistics.

> **Note:** This Order is no longer in force as it pertains only to events before 1984 and has been superseded by modern customs and trade regulations. However, it remains a significant precedent in the development of temporary service remission policies.
