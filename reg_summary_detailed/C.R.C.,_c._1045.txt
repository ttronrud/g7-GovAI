**Detailed Summary of the *Canadian Forces Dental Treatment by Civilians Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**"Canadian Forces Dental Treatment by Civilians Regulations"**  
It may be cited as such and serves as a legal framework governing the provision of dental treatment to Canadian Forces (CF) personnel by civilian dental practitioners.

---

### **2. Scope and Purpose**
These regulations establish the conditions under which **civilian dental practitioners** may provide dental care to **Canadian Forces personnel** when services from the **Canadian Forces Dental Services (CFDS)** are unavailable or insufficient.

The primary objectives are:
- To ensure that CF personnel receive **adequate dental care** to maintain dental fitness.
- To preserve **masticatory efficiency** (ability to chew effectively) and **freedom from pain**.
- To provide a structured, accountable, and cost-effective system for emergency and specialized dental care.

---

### **3. Conditions for Civilian Dental Treatment**

Civilian dental treatment may be provided **only under the following circumstances**:

#### **a) When CFDS Facilities Are Not Available**
Treatment may be authorized when:
- A Canadian Forces Dental Services clinic is **not physically accessible** or operational in the region.

#### **b) When CFDS Personnel Are Unable to Provide Care**
Treatment may be provided if:
- CFDS personnel lack the **specialized equipment**, **facilities**, or other **resources** necessary to deliver the required dental treatment.

> **Important Limitation**:  
> No civilian dental practitioner may begin treatment **without prior written authorization** from the **Command Dental Officer (CDO)** of the CFDS in the relevant region.

---

### **4. Treatment Objectives and Duration**
The treatment provided must:
- Be **sufficient to establish and maintain dental fitness**.
- Provide **reasonable assurance of masticatory efficiency** (ability to chew) and **freedom from pain**.
- Be effective for a period of **12 months**.

This ensures that the treatment is not temporary or palliative but contributes to long-term oral health and operational readiness.

---

### **5. Exceptions: Emergency Treatment Without Prior Authorization**

In **emergency situations**, civilian dental practitioners may provide treatment **without prior authorization** from the CDO, provided the treatment addresses one of the following:

- **Relief of pain** (e.g., acute dental pain).
- **Treatment of acute infection** (e.g., abscess, cellulitis).
- **Repair of broken dentures**.

> ❌ **Prohibited Actions Without Authorization**:
> - **Reconstruction** of dental appliances (e.g., creating new crowns, bridges, or full dentures).
> - **Alteration** of existing dental appliances beyond repair or minor adjustments.

This exception ensures that urgent, life-saving or pain-relieving care can be delivered promptly, without delays due to administrative processes.

---

### **6. Authority and Procedures**

#### **a) Minister of National Defence Authority**
The **Minister of National Defence** has the power to:
- **Prescribe the procedures** for arranging and administering treatment.
- **Specify the forms** (e.g., claims forms, authorization forms) to be used in the process.
- Ensure consistency and compliance across all regions.

This allows flexibility in implementation while maintaining regulatory oversight.

---

### **7. Payment and Fee Structure**

#### **a) Fee Basis**
Civilian dental practitioners are paid based on the **fee scale authorized for dental treatment** for individuals under the care of the **Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)**.

This establishes a **standardized, fair, and government-approved rate** for the services rendered.

> *Note:* The use of DVA fee scales ensures cost alignment with public health standards and prevents overpayment or underpayment.

#### **b) Per Diem Option (Economy Consideration)**
The **Command Dental Officer** may, in the interest of **economy and operational efficiency**, employ a civilian dental practitioner on a **per diem basis** instead of a fee-for-service basis.

This is typically used when:
- The practitioner is providing **short-term, on-call services**.
- The cost of hourly fees is deemed excessive.
- A temporary or rotational arrangement is required.

---

### **8. Payment Conditions and Documentation Requirements**

No payment shall be made unless **two key documents are submitted and verified**:

1. **Signed Certificate by the Practitioner**  
   - Must specify the **exact days of the month** on which services were rendered.  
   - Must clearly indicate the **nature and duration** of the services provided.  
   - Must be signed by the civilian dental practitioner.

2. **Certification by the Authorizing Officer**  
   - The **Command Dental Officer** (or designated officer) must sign and certify that:
     - The certificate is **accurate and complete**.
     - The services were provided **in accordance with the regulations**.

> This dual verification system ensures **accountability, transparency, and fraud prevention** in the payment process.

---

### **9. Oversight and Accountability**
- All actions by civilian practitioners are subject to **supervision and review** by the Command Dental Officer.
- The requirement for **prior authorization** and **certification of services** ensures that:
  - Treatment is medically necessary.
  - Resources are used efficiently.
  - Services align with CF health and operational standards.
