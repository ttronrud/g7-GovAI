**Detailed Summary of the Statutory Instruments Regulations**

---

### **Overview**
The *Statutory Instruments Regulations* (SOR) establish the procedural framework governing the creation, registration, publication, and access to **statutory instruments** (regulations, orders, by-laws, and other instruments) in Canada. These regulations operate under the authority of the *Statutory Instruments Act* (Act), defining how such instruments are made, recorded, disseminated, and made accessible to the public—while also providing exemptions where public access or administrative practicality is not feasible.

The primary objectives of these regulations are:
- To ensure transparency and accountability in the legislative process.
- To streamline the administration of regulations through exemptions where appropriate.
- To protect sensitive national security, personal privacy, and operational interests.
- To balance public access with legitimate government interests.

## **I. Exemptions from Examination**

1. Be **exempt from registration**; or  
2. Be described in **subsection 15(2)** of the Act (other than those in paragraph (d)), and would **be exempt from publication**.
