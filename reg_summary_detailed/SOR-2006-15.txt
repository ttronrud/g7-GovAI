**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order in Council P.C. 2005-1892 – Authorizing Commercial Arrangements and Directing Port Authorities (S.C. 1996, c. 10; SOR/2005-328)**

---

### **1. Background and Context**

This regulation, known as **Order in Council P.C. 2005-1892**, was issued by the **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Industry, who oversees the Competition Bureau), under **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act (CTA)**. The purpose of this Order is to **stabilize the national transportation system** in the face of an **imminent extraordinary disruption**—specifically, a disruption to the movement of containers into and out of key ports in British Columbia.

#### Key Background Points:
- The disruption arises from a **dispute between trucking companies (owners/brokers)** and the **Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association (VCTA)**.
- This dispute threatens to **severely impair the flow of container traffic** through the **Port of Vancouver** and the **Port of Fraser River**, which are critical nodes in Canada’s national transportation network.
- The Governor in Council determined that:
  - The disruption is **imminent** and not attributable to labor issues.
  - A failure to act under Section 47 of the CTA would be **contrary to the interests of users and operators** of the transportation system.
  - No other existing legislation is sufficient to address the crisis.
- Previous emergency orders (P.C. 2005-1356 and P.C. 2005-1365) had been **terminated** on **October 27, 2005**, due to expiry provisions in those orders.
- Therefore, this new Order is issued to **replace and extend emergency measures** necessary to restore stability.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made **pursuant to Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**, which grants the Governor in Council the power to take any action deemed **essential to stabilize the national transportation system** when an extraordinary disruption (other than a labor-related one) is imminent.

This power allows the government to **override certain constraints**, including those under the **Competition Act**, to ensure the **continued functioning of critical infrastructure**.

---

### **3. Definitions**

The Order establishes the following key definitions:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Arbitration Process** | The formal arbitration process outlined in Section 10 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) between trucking companies and the VCTA. |
| **Dispute** | The ongoing conflict causing the imminent disruption to container movement into and out of the ports. |
| **Memorandum of Agreement (MoA)** | The agreement signed on **July 29, 2005**, between trucking companies (owners/brokers) and the Vancouver Container Truckers’ Association (VCTA). |
| **Ports** | Refers to either: (a) the **Port of Vancouver** and the **Port of Fraser River**, or (b) their respective **Port Authorities**: the **Vancouver Port Authority (VPA)** and the **Fraser River Port Authority (FRPA)**. |
| **Public Officer** | Includes federal or provincial ministers, or any public servant employed by Canada or British Columbia. |

### **4. Authorizations Granted**

Under **subsection (1)**, the Order grants specific **authorizations** to various parties involved in the transportation and logistics chain to **cooperate without being bound by the Competition Act**—a critical exception to antitrust rules during a crisis.

#### Authorized Parties Include:
- Operators of trucks and other road transport equipment
- Shippers and brokers
- Port authorities
- Representatives of the above parties
- Public officers (as needed)

#### Authorized Actions:
- To **adhere to** the Memorandum of Agreement (MoA)
- To **renew** their adherence to the MoA
- To **adhere or renew** their adherence to a license granted by either the Vancouver or Fraser River Port Authority under **Section 4 or 5** of the CTA

> ✅ **Purpose**: To allow these parties to cooperate in resolving the dispute and implementing solutions without fear of being penalized under competition laws (e.g., price-fixing, market allocation).

---

### **5. Conditions for Licensing (Directives to Port Authorities)**

The Order imposes **specific directives** on both the **Vancouver Port Authority (VPA)** and the **Fraser River Port Authority (FRPA)** to manage access to their ports.

#### A. Vancouver Port Authority (VPA)

The VPA is directed to:
1. **Establish or maintain a licensing system** for trucks and road equipment to deliver, pick up, or move containers into and out of the Port of Vancouver.
2. **As a condition of any license**, applicants must:
   - Be a **signatory to the July 29, 2005 MoA** with the VCTA
   - Be in **full compliance** with the terms of that MoA
   - **Accept the arbitration process** to resolve any disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the license
3. **Prohibit access** to the Port of Vancouver for any truck or equipment where the applicant fails to meet the above conditions.

#### B. Fraser River Port Authority (FRPA)

The FRPA is similarly directed to:
1. **Establish or maintain a licensing system** for trucks and road equipment at the Port of Fraser River.
2. **As a condition of any license**, applicants must:
   - Be a signatory to the July 29, 2005 MoA
   - Be in full compliance with the MoA
   - Accept the arbitration process for dispute resolution
3. **Prohibit access** to the Port of Fraser River for any applicant who fails to meet these conditions.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: These licensing requirements are **not subject to the Competition Act**, meaning the Port Authorities can enforce these conditions even if they would otherwise be considered anti-competitive under normal circumstances.

> 🔗 **Cross-Port Recognition**: The FRPA is permitted to **recognize licenses issued by the VPA** under Section 4 of the CTA as valid for access to the Fraser River Port. This promotes coordination and avoids duplication of licensing.

- **No prohibition on arbitration**: The arbitration process is central to the resolution mechanism and is **required** for all license disputes.
- **No automatic enforcement of pricing or terms**: The Order does not mandate specific pricing; instead, it requires compliance with the **MoA’s terms**, which govern pricing and service conditions.

### **7. Duration and Effectiveness**

- **Effective Date**: The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., published in the Canada Gazette).
- **Duration**: It remains in effect for **90 days** from the date of coming into force.
- **Termination**: After 90 days, the Order will expire unless extended by further legislation or renewed under Section 47 of the CTA.
