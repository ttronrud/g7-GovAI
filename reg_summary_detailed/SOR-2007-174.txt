### **Purpose of the Regulation:**

This regulation formally withdraws the entitlement of Canadian importers to the *General Preferential Tariff* (GPT) for goods that originate in the **Republic of Belarus**.  

The General Preferential Tariff is a trade benefit under Canada’s customs system that allows certain goods from designated countries to enter Canada at reduced or zero tariffs, provided they meet specific origin requirements (such as being produced or manufactured in a country with which Canada has a preferential trade agreement).

This Order removes that preferential treatment for goods originating in Belarus.

### **Key Provisions:**

1. **Withdrawal of Preferential Tariff Benefit:**  
   - All goods that originate in the Republic of Belarus are no longer entitled to the General Preferential Tariff.  
   - As a result, such goods will be subject to standard Canadian customs duties and tariffs upon importation, unless otherwise provided by law.

2. **Exemption for Goods in Transit Prior to August 1, 2007:**  
   - Section 1 of the Order does **not apply** to goods that were **in transit to Canada before August 1, 2007**.  
   - This means that goods that were already in the process of being transported into Canada prior to the effective date of the Order (August 1, 2007) may still benefit from the preferential tariff if they meet the origin criteria at the time of entry.  
   - This provision provides legal certainty and protects legitimate trade flows that were already underway before the withdrawal took effect.

3. **Amendment and Effective Date:**  
   - The Order is amended to reflect the new status of Belarus in Canada’s preferential trade framework.  
   - The regulation **comes into force on August 1, 2007**.  
   - This date marks the official start of the withdrawal of preferential tariff treatment for Belarus-origin goods.

### **Background and Implications:**

- This action likely reflects a change in Canada’s trade policy or diplomatic relations with Belarus, possibly due to:
  - A deterioration in trade relations.
  - A decision to suspend or terminate a preferential trade agreement with Belarus.
  - A shift in Canada’s trade strategy, such as a move toward stronger trade ties with other countries or a re-evaluation of the economic and political risks associated with Belarus.

- The withdrawal of preferential treatment will increase the cost of importing goods from Belarus, potentially affecting Canadian industries that rely on Belarusian raw materials, components, or manufactured goods.

- The exception for goods in transit before August 1, 2007, ensures that no unintended disruption occurs for shipments that were already in motion, thereby avoiding penalties or trade delays for legitimate and compliant importers.

### **Legal Basis:**

- The regulation is authorized under **paragraph 34(1)(b) of the Customs Tariff Act**, which empowers the Minister of Finance (with the Governor General’s approval) to withdraw or modify preferential tariff benefits for goods originating in specific countries.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This regulation effectively ends Canada’s preferential tariff treatment for goods originating in the Republic of Belarus, effective August 1, 2007. It applies to all new goods of Belarusian origin, but provides a critical exception for goods that were in transit to Canada prior to that date. The move signals a strategic shift in Canada’s trade policy toward Belarus, likely driven by economic, political, or regulatory considerations. Importers of Belarus-origin goods must now account for standard tariff rates, and the rule is designed to ensure clarity and fairness for both existing and future trade flows.
