The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or revoked).
- **Repealing Instrument**: The repeal was enacted through **Statutory Instrument 2017-84**, specifically **Section 1** of that instrument.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **April 1, 2017**, as SOR/2017-84 was published in the Canada Gazette on that date.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: While the original content of the regulation is not provided in the query, the repeated references suggest that this was a specific rule or provision (possibly related to health, safety, licensing, or administrative matters, depending on the context of SOR/2017-84) that was no longer in force after the repeal.
- **Legal Effect**: Once repealed, the regulation is **no longer enforceable**, and any prior application or reference to it is legally invalid. It is replaced by subsequent legislation or regulations, if any, or simply ceases to exist.

### Important Notes:
- The repetition of the same line nine times does not indicate a substantive difference in content — it is likely a formatting or data-entry error.
- Without the original text of the regulation, it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of its content, scope, or purpose. The summary above is limited to the **status and legal implications** of the repeal.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced in the text has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, s. 1**, meaning it is **no longer in force** and **cannot be cited or enforced** under current Canadian law. To understand the original purpose or content of the regulation, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed provision prior to its repeal — which is not available in the provided input.

If you can provide the original regulation or its title, I can offer a more detailed summary of its content and implications.
