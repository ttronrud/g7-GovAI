**Detailed Summary:**

- **Regulation Title and Status**:  
  The specific regulation identified by SI/2015-102 has been officially repealed. This means it is no longer in force and has been replaced, withdrawn, or superseded by another piece of legislation or regulatory framework. The repeal is typically enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument or an amendment to primary legislation.

- **Date of Repeal**:  
  The repeal of SI/2015-102 was enacted on or after the date of its publication in the Statutory Instruments (SI) list, which in this case is 2015.

- **Purpose of the Original Regulation (if known)**:  
  While the specific content of SI/2015-102 is not publicly available in full (as it has been repealed), such instruments typically relate to administrative, technical, or procedural matters. Common examples include rules governing licensing, compliance, data collection, or the operation of public services. Without access to the original text, the precise purpose cannot be confirmed.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are rendered obsolete by new legislation.
  - They conflict with more current or comprehensive laws.
  - They are redundant or no longer necessary.
  - They were found to be ineffective or poorly drafted.
  - A more efficient or modern regulatory framework has been introduced.

- **Legal Effect of Repeal**:

- **Note on Availability**:
