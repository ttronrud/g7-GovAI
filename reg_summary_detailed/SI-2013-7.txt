### **Regulation Summary: Inclusion of Shoreline Lands Along Grace Lake in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**

#### **1. Authority and Legal Basis**
- The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**.
- It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, which grants the government the power to designate certain lands—specifically those adjacent to water bodies—as eligible for inclusion in land grants.
- This provision is typically used to ensure that lands within a defined proximity to water (such as lakes or rivers) are included in land grants, often to protect Indigenous rights, facilitate land use, or support community development.

#### **2. Subject Matter of the Regulation**
- The regulation designates a specific parcel of land located along the shoreline of **Grace Lake** in the **City of Yellowknife**, **Northwest Territories**.
- The lands in question are **all that portion of Lot 2, Block 568**, as it appears on **Survey Plan No. 92689** in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** held at Ottawa.
- A **copy of this survey plan** is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the **Northwest Territories Land Registration District** in Yellowknife under **Reference Number 4155**.

#### **3. Geographic and Boundary Specification**
- The lands are defined as lying **within 30.48 meters (approximately 100 feet)** of the **ordinary high water mark** along the shore of Grace Lake.
- This 30.48-meter buffer zone is a standard measurement used in land tenure and surveying to define the boundary of riparian or shoreline land, often to protect water access, prevent encroachment, or preserve ecological and cultural significance.
- The inclusion of this buffer ensures that any future grant of land within Lot 2, Block 568, will **automatically include** the area within this shoreline boundary—regardless of whether it is explicitly described in the grant documents.

#### **4. Purpose and Implications**
- **Land Grant Inclusion**: Any future land grant involving Lot 2, Block 568, will **necessarily include** the area within 30.48 meters of the ordinary high water mark of Grace Lake. This eliminates ambiguity in land ownership or rights, ensuring that shoreline access is preserved and clearly defined.
- **Legal Certainty**: The regulation provides legal clarity and certainty for land transactions, Indigenous title claims, or land use planning by mandating that this shoreline zone is part of the grant.
- **Potential Indigenous or Community Relevance**: Given that Grace Lake is located in Yellowknife—a major community in the NWT—this regulation may support the protection of traditional use areas, access rights, or cultural sites adjacent to the lake.

#### **5. Record-Keeping and Enforcement**
- The survey plan (No. 92689) is officially recorded in the **Land Titles Office** in Yellowknife under **file number 4155**, making it a publicly accessible and legally binding reference.
- This ensures that the boundary and inclusion of the shoreline lands are transparent and verifiable in land title records.

#### **6. Legal Citation**
- The regulation is cited as: **R.S., c. T-7**, specifically **paragraph 13(b)** of the Territorial Lands Act.

### **Conclusion**
This regulation ensures that a defined strip of shoreline land (30.48 meters from the ordinary high water mark) along Grace Lake within Lot 2, Block 568 of Yellowknife is **automatically included in any future land grant** of that parcel. It is a legally binding directive issued under the Territorial Lands Act, aimed at providing clarity, protecting riparian interests, and supporting consistent land administration in the Northwest Territories. The inclusion of this buffer zone reflects both administrative efficiency and the importance of preserving access to water bodies, particularly in Indigenous and northern communities.
