**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, which provides the legal framework for the inclusion of certain land features—specifically, land adjacent to water bodies—within land grants.

This provision enables the government to designate specific portions of land, particularly those in close proximity to water, as being included in land grants, even if they are not explicitly described in the original survey or grant documents. The purpose is often to ensure that Indigenous or community interests, or to protect public access and environmental considerations, are properly recognized in land ownership and use.

**Subject Matter of the Regulation:**

The regulation specifically addresses a portion of land located in **Yellowknife Bay**, within the **City of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories**.

It mandates that **any portion of the land described in the annexed schedule**—which is not explicitly detailed in the provided text—**that lies within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the shoreline of Yellowknife Bay—must be **included in any future grant of those lands**.

This means that when a land grant is issued for the described property, the government is legally required to include the strip of land adjacent to the shoreline, up to 100 feet (30.48 metres), as part of the grant, regardless of whether it was originally included in the survey or title documents.

**Specific Land Description:**

The regulation refers to a specific parcel of land:

> "All that portion of Lot 1, Block C, in the City of Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, as that lot is shown on the plan of survey number 40350 in the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa, a copy of which is filed in the Land Titles Office for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at Yellowknife under number 70."

This provides a precise legal description of the land in question:
- **Lot 1, Block C** — a specific parcel within a surveyed subdivision.
- **Survey Plan No. 40350** — the official survey document that defines the boundaries of the lot.
- The plan is officially recorded in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** in Ottawa and is referenced in the **Land Titles Office** in Yellowknife under **file number 70**.

**Key Legal and Practical Implications:**

1. **Automatic Inclusion of Shoreline Land:**  
   The regulation ensures that land within 100 feet (30.48 m) of the ordinary high water mark—i.e., the line that marks the highest point reached by water during normal tidal or seasonal conditions—is automatically included in any land grant for the described parcel. This is significant because such land may have ecological, cultural, or navigational value, and its inclusion protects public or Indigenous access.

2. **Compliance with Territorial Lands Act (Section 13(b)):**  
   This regulation is a direct application of the statutory provision allowing for the inclusion of land adjacent to water bodies in land grants. It ensures that the legal description of land grants is not limited by outdated or incomplete survey records and that environmental and access-related considerations are preserved.

3. **Protection of Public and Indigenous Interests:**  
   The inclusion of shoreline land may serve to protect:
   - Access to water for traditional use (e.g., fishing, hunting, cultural practices).
   - Environmental integrity of the bay.
   - Public safety and access to waterfront areas.

4. **Clarity and Legal Certainty:**  
   By referencing a specific survey and filing number, the regulation provides a clear, verifiable source for land boundaries and ensures that future land transactions or grants are legally consistent and transparent.

5. **Potential for Future Land Use and Development:**  
   The inclusion of this shoreline strip may influence future development, zoning, or environmental assessments, as it establishes a legal boundary for land use near the water.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation is a targeted, legally binding directive that ensures the inclusion of a 100-foot strip of land along the shoreline of Yellowknife Bay—within Lot 1, Block C—into any land grant issued for that parcel. It is issued under the authority of the Territorial Lands Act and serves to uphold legal, environmental, and community-based interests by protecting access to and use of water-related land. The regulation enhances land title clarity and ensures compliance with statutory requirements related to shoreline land, particularly in the context of Indigenous rights, environmental protection, and public access.
