### **5. Penalty Amounts by Violation Type**

The maximum penalties are tiered based on the type of violation:

| Violation Type | Individual Maximum | Corporation Maximum |
|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Paragraphs (a) or (b)** | $25,000 | $125,000 |
| **Paragraphs (b.1), (c), or (d)** | $50,000 | $250,000 |

> **Note**:  
> - Paragraphs (a) and (b) likely refer to less severe or operational-level violations.  
> - Paragraphs (b.1), (c), and (d) likely involve more serious breaches—such as failure to comply with emergency directives, rule violations, or equipment safety orders—resulting in higher penalties.

This tiered structure ensures that penalties are proportionate to the severity and impact of the violation.
