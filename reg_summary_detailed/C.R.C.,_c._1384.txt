**Detailed Summary of the Victoria Jubilee Bridge Traffic By-law**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled the **Victoria Jubilee Bridge Traffic By-law** and may be cited as such. This by-law governs the use of the Victoria Jubilee Bridge roadways and establishes specific restrictions on vehicle types, weights, dimensions, speeds, and operational behaviors to ensure public safety and structural integrity.

---

### **2. Definitions**
- **"Company"** refers to the **Canadian National Railway Company (CNRC)**, which is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and enforcement of this by-law.

---

### **3. Permitted Vehicle Types and Weight Restrictions**

The bridge roadways are restricted to vehicles that meet the following criteria:

#### **A. Standard Motor Vehicles**
- Must have **not more than two axles** and **not more than six tires**.

#### **B. Trailers or Vehicles in Tow**
- Must have **not more than two axles** and **not more than four tires**.

#### **C. Tractor-Trailer Combination Units**
- Permitted **only if** the operator holds a **weight slip** showing:
  - **Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)** not exceeding **13½ tons (27,000 pounds)**.
  - Of this, **no more than 9 tons (18,000 pounds)** may be on any single axle.

> *Note:* This restriction ensures that no axle is overloaded, which could damage the bridge structure.

---

### **4. Prohibited Vehicles and Conditions**

A motor vehicle is **prohibited** from using the bridge roadway if it:
- **Lacks pneumatic tires** (i.e., uses solid or non-pneumatic tires), which are less effective at distributing weight and absorbing shocks.
- **Carries dynamite, high explosives, or any substance on fire**, due to the risk of fire or explosion.
- Has a **gross weight (including load)** exceeding **13½ tons (27,000 lb.)**.
  - Operators must provide a **weight certificate** upon request by a bridge attendant.
- Has a **height (including load)** exceeding **12 feet**.
- Has a **width (including load)** exceeding **8 feet**.

> *These limits are critical for preventing structural damage and ensuring safe passage under the bridge's design specifications.*

---

### **5. Speed Restrictions**
- No motor vehicle may drive over the bridge at a **speed that is unsafe or unreasonable**.
- The **maximum speed** is strictly limited to **30 miles per hour (mph)**.
- This restriction is intended to prevent accidents, reduce wear on the bridge, and maintain traffic control during peak times.

---

### **6. Overtaking and Passing Restrictions**

- **No overtaking or passing** of a **moving autobus** (public transit bus) is allowed on the bridge roadways.
- **Autobuses or motor trucks with more than four tires** are **strictly prohibited** from attempting to pass:
  - Any autobus, or
  - Any other truck (whether moving or stopped).
- This rule prioritizes the safety of public transit vehicles and prevents dangerous maneuvers on a shared, high-traffic bridge.

---

### **7. Time-Based Restrictions for Vehicles with More Than Four Tires**

- **Motor vehicles other than autobuses** with **more than four tires** are:
  - **Prohibited from using the traffic lanes** between:
    - **7:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.** (St. Lambert to Montreal direction).
    - **4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.** (Montreal to St. Lambert direction).
- These restrictions are implemented during peak commuting hours to reduce congestion and minimize the risk of accidents involving large vehicles.

---

### **8. Stalled Vehicle Response and Towing Fees**

- If a motor vehicle becomes **stalled on the bridge**, it must be **immediately towed** to a convenient location **beyond the bridge exit**.
- Towing service:
  - If performed by a **Canadian National Railway Company vehicle**: a **fee of $2** is charged.
  - If performed by a **non-company vehicle**: the **actual cost** of towing, as assessed by the towing service provider, is **paid by the vehicle owner**.
- This ensures prompt response and minimizes obstruction of traffic while being fair to both the company and private operators.

---

### **9. Closure of Bridge Roadways**

- The bridge roadways may be **closed to traffic** for:
  - **Emergency situations** (e.g., accidents, natural disasters).
  - **Work or maintenance** activities.
- Closure may be implemented via:
  - Notices,
  - Gates,
  - Or other means.
- During closure:
  - **No vehicle may pass** unless the operator holds a **special permit** issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
- The company has the authority to determine the duration and conditions of closure.

---

### **10. Penalties for Violations**

- Any person who violates this by-law is liable on **summary conviction** to a **penalty not exceeding $40**.
- This penalty is designed to deter non-compliance and enforce adherence to safety and operational standards.

---

### **Key Objectives of the By-law**

1. **Structural Safety**: Prevents overloading and damage to the bridge through strict weight, height, and axle limits.
2. **Public Safety**: Reduces risks from hazardous materials, high-speed driving, and dangerous overtaking.
3. **Traffic Flow and Efficiency**: Manages congestion through time-based restrictions and prioritizes public transit.
4. **Accountability and Enforcement**: Requires documentation (e.g., weight certificates), permits, and clear penalties.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Victoria Jubilee Bridge Traffic By-law** is a comprehensive and safety-focused regulation that balances the needs of commercial and public transportation with the structural and operational limits of the bridge. It ensures that only safe, compliant vehicles operate on the bridge, protects public safety, and maintains the integrity of the infrastructure through strict controls on weight, speed, dimensions, and traffic behavior. Enforcement is supported by clear penalties and the authority of the Canadian National Railway Company to issue permits and close the bridge when necessary.
