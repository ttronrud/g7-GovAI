**Detailed Summary of the Alpine Joe Sportswear Remission Order, 1998 (S.C. 1997, c. 36)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Alpine Joe Sportswear Remission Order, 1998** was issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act**. This section empowers the government to grant remission (i.e., exemption or reduction) of customs duties on specific goods for certain qualifying businesses, typically to support domestic manufacturing or specific economic objectives.

---

### **2. Purpose of the Order**
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **grant a remission of customs duties** on a specific type of fabric—designated as "specified fabrics"—for importation by **Alpine Joe Sportswear Ltd.**, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The remission aims to reduce the cost of raw materials used in the production of certain sportswear items, thereby promoting local manufacturing and supporting the production of outdoor and athletic apparel.

### **3. Definition of "Specified Fabrics"**
The term *specified fabrics* is precisely defined in the Order and includes fabrics that meet the following technical and compositional criteria:

- **Fabric Type**: 4-thread twill fabric  
- **Width**: 109.2 cm (43 inches)  
- **Fibre Composition**:
  - At least **60% polyester staple fibres**  
  - At least **30% cotton**  
  - At least **5% elastomeric monofilaments** (elastic fibers, such as spandex or Lycra)  
- **Yarn Count (Per 10 cm)**:
  - **Warp** (lengthwise threads):  
    - 423 yarns or more, but not exceeding 433 yarns per 10 cm  
    - Equivalent to **172 decitex per single yarn**  
  - **Weft** (crosswise threads):  
    - 252 yarns or more, but not exceeding 262 yarns per 10 cm  
    - Equivalent to **316 decitex per single yarn**  
- **Weight**: Less than **300 grams per square meter (g/m²)**  
- **HS Subheading**: Classified under **No. 5514.22** of the Harmonized System (a category for woven fabrics of cotton and synthetic fibers used in sportswear)

This precise specification ensures that only fabrics meeting strict technical standards are eligible for remission, preventing misuse or broad eligibility.

### **4. Scope of Remission**
- **Beneficiary**: **Alpine Joe Sportswear Ltd.**, headquartered in Vancouver.  
- **Duty Remission**: A full remission of **customs duties** paid or payable on the specified fabrics.  
- **Annual Quantity Limit**:  
  - Up to **13,716 meters** (equivalent to **15,000 linear yards**) of specified fabric per year.  
  - This limit applies annually, meaning the company can import up to this amount each year without duty, but cannot exceed it.  
  - The total annual limit is fixed and not cumulative across years.

---

### **5. Conditions for Remission (Mandatory Requirements)**
The remission is **not automatic** and is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Use in Manufacturing**:
   - The specified fabrics must be used **exclusively** in the **manufacture of**:
     - Uniforms  
     - Hiking pants and shorts  
     - Bicycle touring shorts  
   - This ensures the remission supports the production of specific, functional sportswear products rather than general apparel.

2. **Import Period**:
   - The fabrics must be imported during the period from **January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2002**.  
   - This establishes a time-bound eligibility window, limiting the scope of the remission to a defined five-year period.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**:
   - A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** within **two years of the date of importation**.  
   - Failure to submit a claim within this timeframe will result in the loss of the remission benefit.

---

### **6. Effective Date**
- The Order **comes into force on June 18, 1998**.  
- This means that the remission benefits only apply to imports made on or after this date, within the specified time frame.

---

### **7. Key Implications and Rationale**
- **Economic Support**: The remission helps reduce the cost of production for Alpine Joe Sportswear, enabling more competitive pricing for outdoor and active wear products.
- **Targeted Industry Support**: By limiting the use to specific garments (e.g., hiking and cycling apparel), the policy supports niche, functional clothing that aligns with Canada’s outdoor recreation sector.
- **Quality Control**: The detailed fabric specifications ensure that only high-quality, standardized materials are used, maintaining product consistency and performance.
- **Compliance and Accountability**: The requirement for a claim within two years ensures that the government maintains oversight and accountability for the use of remission benefits.

---

### **8. Exclusions and Limitations**
- The remission does **not extend** to:
  - Any other types of fabrics or apparel not listed in the specified use categories.
  - Any fabric not meeting the exact technical specifications (e.g., incorrect yarn count, fiber content, or weight).
- The annual quantity limit is **not cumulative**; it resets each year.
- The remission is **not available retroactively** beyond December 31, 2002.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Alpine Joe Sportswear Remission Order, 1998** is a targeted, condition-based customs duty relief measure designed to support a specific Canadian manufacturer in producing high-quality, functional sportswear. It reflects a balance between economic support for industry and regulatory oversight to ensure appropriate use of public funds. The Order is binding under Canadian law and remains in force until its expiration or amendment, with its key provisions strictly defined and enforceable through compliance with technical, temporal, and procedural conditions.
