The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2016-188, s. 4]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Regulation SOR/2016-188, section 4**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation:**  
SOR/2016-188 (Statutory Instrument 2016-188)  
**Section 4**  
**Status:** **Repealed**

---

### Background:
SOR/2016-188 is a **Statutory Instrument** issued under the authority of the Canadian government, typically in the area of administrative or regulatory policy. While the exact subject matter of the regulation is not fully specified in your input, the fact that it is cited with "s. 4" and marked as "repealed" means that **Section 4 of this regulation no longer exists or has legal effect**.

### What Does "Repealed" Mean?
- A regulation that is **repealed** is formally canceled or replaced by a new law or regulation.
- It is no longer enforceable, and any prior application or interpretation of the section is invalid.
- Repeal is often done to:
  - Remove outdated or obsolete provisions.
  - Align with updated legislation or policy.
  - Avoid legal ambiguity or conflict with newer rules.

### Context of SOR/2016-188:
Although the full text of SOR/2016-188 is not provided, such instruments are typically issued by a federal department (e.g., Health, Environment, Transport, or Finance) to implement or amend rules under a broader act (e.g., the *Food and Drug Regulations*, *Environmental Protection Act*, or *Canada Labour Code*).

Since the regulation is marked multiple times as "repealed," it suggests that **Section 4 of SOR/2016-188 was specifically removed** by the same instrument — likely because it was redundant, inconsistent, or superseded by other amendments.

---

### Legal Implications:
- Any legal action, compliance requirement, or interpretation based on this section is **no longer valid**.
- Authorities or individuals must refer to the **current version of the regulation** or the **parent act** for applicable rules.
- The repeal is published in the **Canada Gazette**, the official journal of federal regulations, and is legally binding.

---

### Conclusion:
The provision referenced — Section 4 of SOR/2016-188 — has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in force**. This means:
- The regulation no longer applies.
- It should not be cited in legal, compliance, or administrative contexts.
- Its content has been either replaced, merged, or removed due to legislative updates or policy changes.

> 🔍 **Note**: To determine the original content of Section 4 (if needed), one would need to consult the full text of SOR/2016-188 prior to repeal, which may be accessible via the [Government of Canada’s regulations database](https://www.canada.ca/en/regs.html) or the *Canada Gazette* archives.

If you can provide the **name of the parent act** or the **subject area** (e.g., food safety, environmental protection, labor), I can offer a more specific and contextual summary of what the repealed section may have addressed.
