The provided text consists of three identical references to a regulation that has been **repealed**:

> [Repealed, SOR/2018-155, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2018-155, s. 1]  
> [Repealed, SOR/2018-155, s. 1]

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation referenced is **repealed**, meaning it is no longer in force and has been officially removed from the legal framework.

- **SOR/2018-155**: This refers to the *Statutory Instrument of 2018, No. 155*, which was published in the Canada Gazette and contains a set of amendments or regulations. The specific section cited is **Section 1** of that instrument.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2018-155**: While the exact content of the repealed section is not provided in the query, Section 1 of such statutory instruments often serves as a **provision for the repeal of prior regulations** or the **enactment of new rules**. In this case, the fact that it is marked as "repealed" indicates that it was either:
  - A standalone regulation that was replaced by a new one, or
  - A transitional or transitional-in-effect provision that was no longer needed after a change in law.

- **Reason for Repeal**: Regulations are typically repealed when:
  - They are outdated or redundant,
  - They conflict with newer legislation,
  - They have been superseded by a more comprehensive or updated rule,
  - Or they were part of a legislative modernization effort.

- **Implication**: Since the regulation is repealed, it **no longer applies** to any legal or administrative context. Any prior obligations, requirements, or duties derived from it are no longer enforceable. Legal or regulatory bodies must now refer to the current, active version of the regulation or statute in question.

### Conclusion:

The regulation referenced in the three identical entries — **Section 1 of SOR/2018-155** — has been **officially repealed** and is **no longer in effect**. There is no active legal content or operational requirement stemming from this section. The repeal was part of a broader legislative or regulatory update, likely aimed at streamlining or modernizing the legal framework. To understand the current rules, one must consult the **current, active regulations** or the **replacing statute/instrument** that was enacted in place of the repealed section.
