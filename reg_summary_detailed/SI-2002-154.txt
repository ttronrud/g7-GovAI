#### **Legal Description (by coordinates)**  
The parcel is defined by a series of straight-line segments, starting and ending at the same point:

1. **Commence** at the intersection of:
   - Latitude **64° 45′ N**
   - Longitude **119° 23′ W**

2. **Thence easterly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 45′ N, Longitude 119° 09′ W

3. **Thence southeasterly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 38′ N, Longitude 118° 58′ W

4. **Thence southeasterly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 29′ N, Longitude 118° 55′ W

5. **Thence southeasterly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 25′ N, Longitude 118° 41′ W

6. **Thence southerly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 15′ N, Longitude 118° 41′ W

7. **Thence northwesterly** to:
   - Latitude 64° 16′ N, Longitude 119° 23′ W

8. **Thence northerly** back to the **point of commencement**.

> 🔍 This forms a closed, irregular polygonal area.

#### **Area and Measurement**
- Total area: **137,432 hectares** (approximately 339,600 acres)
- The measurement is approximate ("more or less").

> 📍 Geographic coordinates are referenced to the **NAD 27 (North American Datum of 1927)**, which is the older standard used in much of Canada’s historical land surveying.

### **Legal and Policy Context**
- This Order is grounded in **section 23(a) of the Territorial Lands Act**, which allows the government to withdraw land from disposal for specific purposes, including **cultural heritage, environmental protection, or Indigenous interests**.
- The designation of Ezodziti as a **heritage resource** suggests it may have:
  - Cultural or historical significance (possibly related to Indigenous communities),
  - Ecological value,
  - Or both.

> The withdrawal serves as a **proactive measure** to protect the area from industrial development during a defined period, allowing time for:
> - Cultural assessments,
> - Community consultations,
> - Environmental studies,
> - and formal designation as a heritage site.

### **Key Implications**
| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **No Disposal** | The land cannot be sold, leased, or otherwise made available for commercial use during the period (until Sept. 30, 2007). |
| **Existing Rights Protected** | Pre-existing mining, exploration, or surface rights are preserved, ensuring legal continuity. |
| **Temporary Nature** | The withdrawal ends on September 30, 2007 — after which the land may become available again for disposal unless extended or re-designated. |
| **Heritage Focus** | Indicates recognition of Ezodziti’s cultural or environmental importance, possibly tied to Indigenous communities or traditional lands. |

---

### **Conclusion**
This Order is a **targeted, temporary administrative measure** to protect a significant land area in the Northwest Territories — Ezodziti — from commercial exploitation during a specific timeframe. It reflects a balance between:
- **Resource management** (by withdrawing land from disposal),
- **Cultural preservation** (by recognizing the area’s heritage value),
- And **legal continuity** (by protecting existing rights and operations).

While the withdrawal expires in 2007, it underscores the government’s commitment to heritage protection and the importance of engaging with Indigenous and community interests in land use planning.

> 📌 **Note on Timeliness**: As of 2024, this Order has expired (September 30, 2007), and the land may now be subject to disposal again unless re-designated under current heritage or Indigenous land use frameworks. Any future action would require new legislation or regulatory orders.
