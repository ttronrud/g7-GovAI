**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Legal Authority:**  
   The transfer is authorized under **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act (P.S.R.T.D.A.)**, which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the Prime Minister’s recommendation) to reassign functions, responsibilities, and control of public service units between federal departments and agencies. This provision allows for the reallocation of administrative and operational responsibilities within the federal public service to improve efficiency, accountability, or policy alignment.

2. **Transfer of Function:**  
   The regulation specifically transfers the **Official Languages Secretariat**, a key component of the Intergovernmental Policy Branch within the Privy Council Office, from the PCO to the **Department of Canadian Heritage**.

3. **Nature of the Transfer:**  
   The transfer involves **control and supervision** of the Secretariat. This means that:
   - The Department of Canadian Heritage assumes responsibility for the day-to-day management, oversight, and strategic direction of the Secretariat.
   - The Secretariat will now operate under the authority, budget, and policy framework of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
   - The Secretariat’s mandate and operational responsibilities remain unchanged, but its administrative and reporting lines are now aligned with DCH.

4. **Jurisdictional and Policy Context:**  
   The **Official Languages Secretariat** is responsible for implementing and enforcing Canada’s official languages policy—specifically, the *Official Languages Act* (1969) and related legislation. This includes:
   - Ensuring that federal institutions provide services in both English and French.
   - Monitoring compliance with official languages requirements.
   - Supporting language access for citizens and institutions across Canada.
   - Providing policy advice and coordination on language-related issues.

   By transferring this unit to the Department of Canadian Heritage, the federal government strengthens the integration of official languages policy within the broader framework of cultural and linguistic rights, which is a core mandate of the Department of Canadian Heritage.

5. **Effective Date:**  
   The transfer becomes effective on **February 6, 2006**. This date marks the formal transition point when the Secretariat begins operating under the authority of the Department of Canadian Heritage, including changes to reporting lines, staffing, and administrative procedures.

6. **Legal Citation:**  
   The regulation is published in the *Statutes of Canada*, 2003, Chapter 22, Section 207 (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207). This indicates that the transfer was formally enacted through legislative process and is binding under Canadian law.

**Significance and Implications:**

- **Policy Alignment:** The move reflects a strategic realignment to ensure that official languages policy is more closely integrated with broader cultural and heritage initiatives under the Department of Canadian Heritage.
- **Administrative Efficiency:** It streamlines governance by placing a critical policy function within a department that has a direct mandate to promote and protect Canada’s linguistic diversity.
- **Continuity of Service:** Despite the transfer, the core functions of the Official Languages Secretariat remain intact, ensuring that language rights and access continue without disruption.
- **Accountability:** The Secretariat will now be accountable to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, enhancing transparency and policy coherence in the implementation of official languages legislation.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation represents a significant administrative reorganization within the federal public service. By transferring the Official Languages Secretariat from the Privy Council Office to the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government ensures that language policy is managed within a department that has both the mandate and the resources to advance Canada’s official languages framework. The change took effect on February 6, 2006, and was implemented under the legal authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, reflecting a commitment to effective governance and policy coherence.
