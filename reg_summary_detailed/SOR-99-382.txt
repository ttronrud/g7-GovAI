**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Exemption from Deposit Insurance By-law (Exemption Fee)**

---

**Regulatory Framework and Legal Authority:**

This regulation is issued under the *Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act* (CDICA), a federal statute that governs the operations, responsibilities, and financial obligations of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), the institution responsible for insuring deposits in Canadian financial institutions.

The specific provisions invoked are:

- **Paragraph 11(2)(g)a** of the CDICA: Grants the Board of Directors of CDIC the authority to make by-laws related to deposit insurance exemptions, including the establishment of fees associated with such exemptions.
- **Paragraph 26.03(1)(e)b** of the CDICA: Authorizes the imposition of a fee when a federal member institution applies for authorization to accept deposits without being a member institution under section 26.02 of the Act.
- **Section 26.05b** of the CDICA: Empowers the Minister of Finance to approve by-laws made by the CDIC Board of Directors that relate to deposit insurance exemptions, ensuring alignment with broader policy and fiscal objectives.

**Purpose of the By-law:**

The primary purpose of this Exemption from Deposit Insurance By-law (Exemption Fee) is to establish a financial requirement for federal member financial institutions that seek authorization to accept deposits *without* becoming full members of the CDIC.

This is typically done in cases where a federal institution (e.g., a bank or credit union under federal jurisdiction) wishes to operate as a deposit-taking institution but does not wish to be covered under the standard deposit insurance scheme administered by CDIC. Such institutions may be granted a limited authorization to accept deposits under the regulatory framework, but they are not required to participate in the CDIC insurance pool.

To ensure that such exemptions are not granted without financial accountability, this by-law introduces a **fee** to cover the administrative, operational, and risk-related costs associated with the exemption process.

**Key Provision:**

- **Fee Amount:**  
  A fee of **$20,000** is payable by a **federal member institution** that applies under **section 26.02** of the CDICA for authorization to accept deposits without being a member institution.

- **Applicable Entities:**  
  The fee applies specifically to **federal member institutions**, which are financial institutions under the direct jurisdiction of the federal government (e.g., certain federal banks or credit unions).

- **Nature of the Authorization:**  
  The authorization allows the institution to accept deposits, but it does not confer membership in the CDIC. As a result, deposits held by such institutions are **not insured** under the CDIC scheme.

**Approval and Implementation Timeline:**

- **Issued by:** The Board of Directors of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation.
- **Approved by:** The Minister of Finance, confirming the validity and compliance of the by-law with federal legislation.
- **Effective Date:** The by-law comes into force on **October 15, 1999**.

**Context and Significance:**

- This regulation reflects a balance between regulatory flexibility and financial oversight. It allows federal institutions to operate with deposit-taking authority under certain conditions while ensuring that the CDIC is not financially exposed to the risks associated with non-member deposit-taking institutions.
- The $20,000 fee serves as a deterrent against frivolous or unauthorized applications and funds the administrative costs of evaluating and approving such exemptions.
- It also aligns with broader regulatory principles of risk-based pricing and cost recovery in financial regulation.
