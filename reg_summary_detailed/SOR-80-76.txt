The provided text consists entirely of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2017-84, section 1**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished).
- **Repeal Citation**: It was repealed by **Statutory Instrument 2017-84, section 1**.
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal took effect on or around **April 1, 2017**, as SOR/2017-84 was published in the Canada Gazette on that date.
- **Nature of the Regulation**: While the specific content of the original regulation is not included in the provided text, the repeated citations suggest that this was a standalone regulation (likely a rule or order under a broader act) that was no longer in force after the repeal.
- **Implication**: Any legal or operational effect of the regulation—such as requirements, definitions, or procedures it established—is **no longer valid**. Entities or individuals relying on it would need to refer to the current, active legislation or regulations that replaced it (if any).

### Important Notes:
- The fact that the repeal is cited multiple times does not indicate multiple regulations being repealed; it simply emphasizes that this specific regulation was repealed.
- The original regulation is not included in the provided text, so a detailed summary of its content (e.g., subject matter, scope, obligations) cannot be provided without access to the full text of the repealed regulation.
- In practice, such repeals are typically part of legislative modernization, simplification, or alignment with new laws or administrative frameworks.

### Conclusion:
This entry confirms that a specific regulation has been **officially removed from the legal framework** of Canada through **SOR/2017-84, s. 1**. It is no longer in force and should not be referenced or applied. For further details on the original regulation’s content, one would need to consult the full text of the repealed regulation prior to its repeal, which is not available in the current input.

👉 **Recommendation**: To understand the original scope and purpose of the regulation, consult the archived version of the regulation or the full text of SOR/2017-84, which is available through the Government of Canada’s official legislation database (e.g., [laws-lois.justice.gc.ca](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca)).
