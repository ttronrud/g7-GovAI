**Detailed Summary of the *Ontario Wheat Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations***

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Ontario Wheat Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and forms part of Ontario’s regulatory framework governing the marketing of wheat in interprovincial and export markets.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**
The regulation establishes clear definitions for key terms used throughout:

- **Agent**: A person officially appointed by the *Commodity Board* to purchase or receive wheat from producers on the Board’s behalf. Agents act as intermediaries between producers and the Commodity Board.

- **Commodity Board**: Refers to the *Ontario Wheat Producers’ Marketing Board* (also known in French as *Office de commercialisation*). This body is responsible for overseeing the marketing, pooling, and distribution of wheat proceeds.

- **Producer**: A person actively engaged in the production of wheat. This includes farmers or agricultural operators who grow wheat as part of their farming operations.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**
These regulations apply **only** to:
- The **marketing of wheat** in **interprovincial trade** (sales between provinces) and **export trade** (sales outside Canada).
- Persons and property located **within the Province of Ontario**.

**Exclusions:**
- The regulations **do not apply** when one producer sells wheat directly to another producer for use on that second producer’s farm.  
  → Direct farm-to-farm transactions are exempt from these rules.

---

### **4. Restrictions on Sales and Purchases**
To ensure fair and centralized marketing, the following rules govern transactions:

- **No producer may sell or offer to sell wheat to any person other than an agent.**  
  → Producers are prohibited from selling directly to private buyers, businesses, or individuals outside the Commodity Board’s system.

- **No person other than an agent may purchase wheat from a producer.**  
  → Only agents authorized by the Commodity Board can legally buy wheat from producers.

- **No agent may purchase wheat from a producer except on behalf of the Commodity Board.**  
  → Agents are strictly prohibited from buying wheat for personal, private, or non-Board purposes. Their role is solely to serve the Commodity Board.

---

### **5. Transportation and Movement of Wheat**
Producers are restricted in how they can transport wheat, with limited exceptions:

- **General Rule**:  
  No producer may transport or ship wheat to any location **other than the premises of an agent**.

- **Exceptions**:
  1. **Feed Mill Processing**:  
     A producer may transport wheat to a feed mill **for processing and use on their own farm**.
  2. **Terminal Elevator**:  
     A producer may transport wheat to a terminal elevator **only at the direction of an agent**.
  3. **Seed Cleaning Plant**:  
     A producer may transport **seed wheat** to a seed cleaning plant for processing.

> These exceptions allow for necessary agricultural processing while maintaining control over the marketing chain.

---

### **6. Processing Restrictions**
- **No person may process wheat that has not been sold by or through the Commodity Board**, except for:
  - **Seed wheat processed for a producer** (i.e., for use in seed production or planting).

> This ensures that all commercial wheat (outside of seed use) must pass through the Commodity Board’s system before being processed, preventing unauthorized or unregulated processing.

---

### **7. Pooling and Distribution of Proceeds**
The Commodity Board must establish **pools** (collections of wheat sales) to manage and distribute proceeds from wheat sales.

- **Distribution Process**:
  - After deducting all **necessary and proper disbursements and expenses** (e.g., transportation, inspection, administrative costs), the proceeds from each pool are distributed.
  - Each producer receives a share of the total proceeds **in proportion to**:
    - The **quantity** of wheat delivered;
    - The **variety** of wheat;
    - The **grade** of wheat.

> This ensures equitable compensation based on the quality and volume of production.

---

### **8. Payment to Producers**
Producers who sell wheat to the Commodity Board are entitled to:

- **Initial Payment**:  
  Upon delivery of wheat to an agent, the producer receives an **initial payment** set by the Commodity Board.

- **Additional Payments**:  
  The Commodity Board may make **further payments** (in amounts and at times determined by the Board) until all proceeds from the sales of wheat in a given pool have been fully distributed to eligible producers.

> This provides producers with a steady, phased income stream tied directly to the performance of the marketing system.

---

### **9. Appointment and Oversight of Agents**
The Commodity Board has full authority over agents:

- **Appointment**: The Board may appoint any individual as an agent.
- **Duties and Conditions**: The Board may prescribe the **duties, responsibilities, and terms and conditions** of employment for each agent.
- **Remuneration**: The Board may determine and set the **compensation (remuneration)** for agents.

> This ensures accountability, standardization, and transparency in agent operations.

---

### **10. Inspection and Grading Standards**
All wheat sold by producers to agents must be:

- **Inspected and sold based on grades established under subsection 15(1) of the Canada Grain Act and Schedule I to that Act.**  
  → These are national standards defining acceptable quality levels for wheat (e.g., based on protein content, foreign material, test weight, etc.).

- **Tested for moisture content** at the time of sale.

> This ensures consistency, quality control, and fair pricing across transactions.

---

### **11. Sampling Procedures**
When wheat is delivered to an agent, either the agent or the producer may request a sample for verification of grade and moisture content.

**Requirements for a valid sample**:
- Must weigh **at least two pounds**.
- Must be accepted by both the agent and the producer as a **fair and representative sample**.
- Must be placed in a **sealed, moisture-proof container**.
- The container must have a **label** containing:
  - Name and address of the **producer**;
  - Name of the **agent**.
- If required by a **Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) inspector**, the sample must be delivered to the inspector for testing.

> This provides a formal, verifiable process for quality assurance.

---

### **12. Fair Sample and Authorized Agent**
For the purpose of accepting a sample as a fair representation:
- Any person delivering wheat to an agent **on behalf of a producer** is deemed to be the **authorized agent of the producer**.

> This simplifies administrative processes and ensures that delivery representatives are recognized as having authority to act on behalf of the producer.

---

### **13. Dispute Resolution**
If a dispute arises between a producer and an agent regarding:
- The **grade** of the wheat;
- The **moisture content**;
- The **condition** of the load,

→ The matter must be referred to an **inspector of the Canadian Grain Commission**.

- The decision of the inspector is **final and binding** on both parties.

> This provides a neutral, standardized, and enforceable mechanism for resolving disputes, protecting both producers and agents.

---

### **Summary of Key Objectives and Principles**
The Ontario Wheat Marketing (Interprovincial and Export) Regulations are designed to:

1. **Ensure fair and equitable marketing** of wheat in Ontario by centralizing sales through the Commodity Board.
2. **Protect producers** by limiting direct sales and ensuring they receive payments based on quality, quantity, and variety.
3. **Maintain quality standards** through adherence to Canada Grain Act grading and moisture testing.
4. **Prevent fraud or unauthorized processing** by restricting access to wheat beyond the Commodity Board system.
5. **Establish clear accountability** through agent oversight, sampling, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
