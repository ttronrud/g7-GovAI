**Detailed Summary of the North Bay Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Regulation Title and Citation**
These regulations are officially titled the **North Bay Airport Zoning Regulations** and may be cited as such. They establish specific zoning and land-use restrictions around North Bay Airport in Ontario to ensure safety, operational efficiency, and environmental protection for aviation activities.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation begins by defining key terms used throughout:

- **Airport**: Refers specifically to *North Bay Airport*, located in the *City of North Bay*, *District of Nipissing*, *Province of Ontario*.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**: A precise geographic point used as a reference for elevation and spatial measurements. It is defined in **Part I of the Schedule** and is **deemed to be at 1,180 feet above sea level** for all regulatory purposes.

- **Approach Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the end of a runway strip, perpendicular to its centerline. It ensures a clear zone for aircraft during approach and landing. Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.

- **Strip**: A rectangular area of the airport designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction. Includes runways and their associated safety zones. Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.

- **Outer Surface**: An imaginary horizontal plane located above and around the airport, at a constant elevation of **150 feet above the ARP**, unless that elevation would be less than 30 feet above ground level—then it is set at **30 feet above ground**. This surface defines the outer boundary of the airport’s restricted zone. Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.

- **Transitional Surface**: An imaginary inclined plane extending upward from the lateral edges of a runway strip and its approach surface, rising at a **1:7 vertical-to-horizontal ratio** (1 foot vertically for every 7 feet horizontally), until it meets the outer surface or another transitional surface of an adjacent runway. Defined in **Part VI of the Schedule**.

> ⚠️ Note: The term *horizontal surface* was **revoked** by SOR/83-498, s.1 and is no longer in effect.

---

### **3. Geographic Scope of Application**

- The regulations apply to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport**, including public road allowances.
- The **outer limits** of these lands are precisely defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which includes a detailed legal description of the boundary.
- **Exclusions**: Lands that are already part of the airport (e.g., active runways, taxiways, or designated facilities) are **exempt** from these regulations, even if they fall within the described boundary.

---

### **4. Height Restrictions (Prohibited Construction)**

No person may:
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object on land subject to these regulations,
- Where the **highest point** of such object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces at that location:

  - The **approach surfaces**  
  - The **outer surface**  
  - The **transitional surfaces**

> This restriction applies to all new or existing structures, including residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, towers, antennas, or signage.

---

### **5. Management of Natural Growth**

- If **natural vegetation** (e.g., trees, shrubs, grass) on regulated land grows above any of the defined surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), the **Minister of Transport** may issue a direction requiring the **owner or occupier** to remove the excessive growth.

> This provision helps prevent obstructions that could interfere with aircraft operations, especially during approach or landing.

> ⚠️ Note: This provision was previously revoked by SOR/79-896, s.1 — however, it appears to be included here as part of the original text. Given the context, it is likely either a historical footnote or a retained clause. **Clarification is needed** — if this is still active, it is a significant enforcement tool for vegetation management.

---

### **6. Prohibition of Bird-Attractive Waste**

No owner or occupier of regulated land (including land under water) may:
- Use the land for the **disposal or accumulation of waste, materials, or substances** that are:
  - Edible by birds
  - Attractive to birds

> This is a critical measure to reduce the risk of bird strikes, which can be catastrophic for aircraft safety.

---

### **7. Detailed Descriptions of Key Regulatory Surfaces**

#### **A. Approach Surfaces (Part III – Runway Ends)**
Each approach surface is an inclined plane rising at a **1:50 ratio** (1 foot vertical per 50 feet horizontal) from the end of a runway strip, rising to a horizontal line:

- At **200 feet above the end of the strip** in elevation.
- Extending **10,000 feet horizontally** from the end of the strip.
- The outer ends of this horizontal line are **2,000 feet from the runway centerline**.

**Runway-specific approach surfaces:**

| Runway | Vertical Rise | Horizontal Reach | Distance from Centerline |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 08 (approach) | 200 ft | 10,000 ft | 2,000 ft |
| 13 (approach) | 200 ft | 10,000 ft | 2,000 ft |
| 18 (approach) | 156 ft | 7,800 ft | 1,030 ft |
| 26 (approach) | 200 ft | 10,000 ft | 2,000 ft |
| 31 (approach) | 200 ft | 10,000 ft | 2,000 ft |
| 36 (approach) | 157 ft | 7,850 ft | 1,035 ft |

> These surfaces are designed to provide a clear, unobstructed path for aircraft during final approach and landing.

---

#### **B. Outer Surface (Part IV)**
- A horizontal plane at **150 feet above the ARP (1,180 ft ASL)**.
- If this would place the surface below **30 feet above ground level**, it is instead set at **30 feet above ground**.
- This defines the outermost boundary of the airport’s protected zone.

> This surface ensures that no structures or natural features rise above this threshold, maintaining visual and physical clearance.

---

#### **C. Runway Strips (Part V)**

| Runway | Width | Length | Side Distance |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|
| 08–26 | 1,000 ft (500 ft each side) | 10,600 ft | Centerline-based |
| 18–36 | 500 ft (250 ft each side) | 4,874 ft | Centerline-based |
| 13–31 | 1,000 ft (500 ft each side) | 6,589 ft | Centerline-based |

> These dimensions define the active landing areas and are critical for flight operations.

---

#### **D. Transitional Surfaces (Part VI)**

- Inclined planes rising at a **1:7 ratio** (1 foot vertical per 7 feet horizontal).
- Extend from the **lateral edges of each runway strip** and its **approach surface**.
- Rise upward and outward until they meet:
  - The **outer surface**, or
  - The **transitional surface** of an adjacent runway (e.g., between 08–26 and 13–31).

> These surfaces prevent obstructions from appearing between runways and ensure safe separation zones during takeoff and landing.

---

### **8. Reference to Official Maps**

All described surfaces, boundaries, and strip dimensions are **graphically illustrated** on:
- **Department of Transport Plan No. T-2743**, dated **June 22, 1970**.

This plan is the authoritative source for spatial interpretation and enforcement of the regulations.

---

### **9. Regulatory Enforcement and Authority**

- The **Minister of Transport** holds the authority to:
  - Issue directions for removal of excessive natural growth.
  - Enforce compliance with height restrictions and waste prohibitions.
- The regulations are **binding on all landowners and occupiers** within the defined boundaries.

---

### **10. Key Objectives of the Regulations**

1. **Aircraft Safety**: Prevent obstructions (buildings, trees, debris) that could interfere with aircraft during approach, landing, takeoff, or taxiing.
2. **Visual and Physical Clearance**: Maintain clear zones around runways and approach paths.
3. **Bird Hazard Mitigation**: Eliminate food sources and waste that attract birds to the airport.
4. **Consistency and Clarity**: Provide precise, measurable, and enforceable boundaries using defined elevations and geometric surfaces.

### **11. Important Notes and Observations**

- **Historical Revocations**: 
  - The "horizontal surface" was revoked (SOR/83-498, s.1).
  - A clause on waste disposal was revoked (SOR/79-896, s.1), suggesting it may no longer be enforceable. However, its inclusion here implies it may have
