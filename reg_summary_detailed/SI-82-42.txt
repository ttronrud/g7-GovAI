**Detailed Summary of the Unfinished Leather Remission Order**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **section 17 of the Financial Administration Act**, by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **Treasury Board**. This means the Order is a formal, government-enacted directive approved at the highest level of executive authority, based on financial administration powers.

The Order is officially titled the **Unfinished Leather Remission Order** and may be cited as such.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order**  
The primary objective of this Order is to **remit (i.e., reduce or eliminate) the customs duty difference** that would otherwise be payable on **unfinished leather** imported into Canada, when such leather is used in the production of **finished garment leathers**.

Specifically, it provides a financial relief mechanism to prevent double taxation or excessive cost burdens on manufacturers who import raw, unfinished leather (which has undergone only tanning) and later finish it into finished leathers used in apparel (e.g., for shoes, jackets, or clothing).

---

**3. Scope of Remission**  
The remission applies to the **difference in customs duty** between:

- The duty paid or payable on **unfinished leather** imported under **tariff item 60405-1** (which is leather "further finished than tanned" — meaning leather that has been tanned and may have undergone partial finishing), and  
- The duty that would otherwise be payable on **finished garment leathers** imported under tariff items:
  - 60750-1  
  - 60751-1  
  - 60752-11  

In essence, the Order allows manufacturers to claim back the **customs duty difference** that would have been due if the leather had been imported as a finished product, instead of as an unfinished intermediate.

This is a form of **duty relief** designed to encourage efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes by recognizing that unfinished leather is a necessary input in the production of finished garment leathers.

**4. Key Conditions for Remission (Prerequisites)**  
A claim for remission under this Order is **only valid if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Time of Importation**  
   The leather must have been imported during a specific period:  
   → **From July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985**, inclusive.  
   This establishes a limited window of eligibility, ensuring the policy targets a specific historical period.

2. **Use in Manufacturing**  
   The imported leather must be **used in the manufacture of finished garment leathers** within **three years of the date of importation**.  
   This ensures that the leather is not stored or used for non-apparel purposes and remains directly tied to the production of final garment materials.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**  
   A claim for remission must be **submitted to the Minister of National Revenue (Minister)** within **three years of the date of importation**.  
   This creates a strict deadline for claimants to act — failure to submit a claim within this timeframe results in ineligibility.

4. **Submission of Required Documentation**  
   The claimant must provide **complete reports and other information** necessary for the Minister to administer and verify the claim.  
   This includes documentation such as:
   - Import records
   - Production records
   - Evidence of use in garment leather manufacturing
   - Financial records related to the transaction

   The requirement ensures transparency, accountability, and proper oversight by the Minister.

**5. Legal Citation and Historical Context**  
The Order is referenced in the statutory record as:  
**S.C. 1980-81, c. 67, s. 7**  
This indicates that the provision was originally established as part of **Statutory Chapter 67 of the Statutes of Canada in 1980–81**, and the specific section (s. 7) is the legal foundation for this remission.

This Order reflects a policy decision made in the 1980s to support domestic manufacturing in the textile and apparel industries by reducing barriers to input costs, particularly in the leather sector.

---

**6. Key Implications and Outcomes**  
- **Economic Benefit**: Reduces the cost of raw materials for garment manufacturers, potentially increasing competitiveness and output.
- **Administrative Burden**: Requires strict compliance with deadlines and reporting — which may pose challenges for small businesses or those with limited record-keeping capacity.
- **Limited Scope**: Only applies to a specific time period (1984–1985), meaning it does not apply to current or future imports.
- **Targeted Relief**: Only applies to unfinished leather used in the production of finished garment leathers — not to other types of leather or other industrial uses.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Unfinished Leather Remission Order* is a targeted, time-limited customs duty relief measure designed to support the Canadian garment manufacturing industry during a specific historical period. It allows eligible importers to claim back the difference in customs duty between importing unfinished leather and importing finished garment leathers, provided the leather is used in manufacturing within three years of import and a claim is submitted within the same timeframe. The Order emphasizes accountability through documentation and time-bound eligibility, reflecting a balance between economic support and regulatory oversight.

This regulation is no longer active in current Canadian customs policy, as it applies only to imports between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 1985. It serves as a historical example of how duty remission can be used to support specific sectors during economic transitions.
