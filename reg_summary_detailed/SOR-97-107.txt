**Detailed Summary of Regulation: General Export Permit No. 12 — United States Origin Goods**

---

### **1. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**
The regulation is issued under the authority of the **Minister of Foreign Affairs** of Canada, specifically pursuant to:
- **Subsection 7(1.1)a** of the *Export and Import Permits Act* (EIPA)
- **Subsection 10(1)b** of the *Export and Import Permits Act*

These provisions empower the Minister to issue general export permits for certain goods, particularly when they are of foreign origin and fall within specified categories, allowing for their export without the need for individual permit applications under certain conditions.

### **2. Permit Number and Title**
- **Permit Number:** General Export Permit No. 12  
- **Title:** *United States Origin Goods*  
- **Reference Number:** SI/89-120  
- **Effective Date:** January 29, 1997  
- **Issuance Date:** January 24, 1997  
- **Issuing Authority:** Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Government of Canada  

> *Note: The permit is referenced as "GEP-12" or "LGE-12" in customs reporting forms.*

---

### **3. Scope of Authorization**
Under this permit, **any person** may export from Canada:
- **Goods of United States origin**,  
- As described in **Item 5400 of Group 5** of the *Schedule to the Export Control List*.

#### What Does "Item 5400 of Group 5" Entail?
While the full description of Item 5400 is not included in the excerpt, it refers to a specific category of goods listed in the Canadian export control regime. Historically, such items typically include:
- Certain electronic components or devices
- High-tech or specialized equipment (e.g., semiconductors, sensors, or related technologies)

The exact nature of the goods must be determined by reference to the official *Export Control List* (ECL) maintained by the Canadian government. This list classifies goods based on their technical characteristics, potential uses, and national security implications.

> Importantly, this permit is a **general permit**, meaning it allows broad export of specified goods without requiring individual assessments or applications—provided all conditions are met.

---

### **4. Prohibited Export Destinations**
This permit **does not authorize** the export of the listed goods to:
- **Cuba**
- **Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea)**
- **Iran**
- **Syria**

These countries are included on Canada’s **Area Control List (ACL)**, which identifies nations subject to export restrictions due to:
- International sanctions
- Human rights concerns
- Nuclear proliferation risks
- Violations of international norms

> Therefore, even though the goods are of U.S. origin and fall under this general permit, they **cannot be exported to these four countries**.

This restriction aligns with Canada’s foreign policy and international obligations, including adherence to UN Security Council resolutions and multilateral trade agreements.

---

### **5. Reporting Requirements**
If the export of goods under this permit is subject to mandatory reporting under the *Customs Act*, the exporter must include the following designation in the required report:
> **“GEP-12”** or **“LGE-12”**

- **GEP** stands for *General Export Permit*
- **LGE** may refer to *Listed General Export* (a reporting designation used in customs documentation)

This ensures traceability, compliance monitoring, and transparency in the export process.

---

### **6. Cancellation of Prior Permit**
- **General Export Permit No. Ex. 12 — United States Origin Goods** is **cancelled** by this issuance.
- This indicates that the previous version of the permit (possibly dated earlier or with different terms) is superseded and no longer valid.

---

### **7. Legal and Policy Context**
- **S.C. 1994, c. 47, s. 107 and s. 111** are the legislative provisions that authorize the Minister to issue such general export permits.
  - Section 107 allows for the issuance of general permits for goods of foreign origin that do not require individual assessments.
  - Section 111 provides for the cancellation or amendment of existing permits as needed to reflect changing policy or international conditions.

These provisions support Canada’s ability to manage sensitive technology exports while maintaining trade relationships with key partners and complying with international obligations.

---

### **8. Key Implications for Exporters**
- **Simplified Process:** Exporters can export specified U.S.-origin goods without applying for a detailed individual permit.
- **Compliance Obligations:** Must ensure:
  - The goods are indeed of U.S. origin.
  - The destination is not on the restricted list (Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria).
  - Proper reporting is completed with the correct permit code (GEP-12 or LGE-12).
- **Risk of Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with destination restrictions or reporting requirements may result in penalties, fines, or legal action under the *Export and Import Permits Act* and *Customs Act*.

---

### **Conclusion**
General Export Permit No. 12 — United States Origin Goods is a **broadly applicable, non-specific export authorization** allowing Canadian entities to export certain goods of U.S. origin, as defined in Item 5400 of Group 5 of the Export Control List. However, it is strictly limited in scope:
- **Restricted destinations** (Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria)
- **Mandatory reporting** with the code “GEP-12” or “LGE-12”
- **Effective from January 29, 1997**

This permit reflects Canada’s balance between facilitating international trade and upholding national security, non-proliferation, and diplomatic policy goals. It is part of a broader regulatory framework designed to ensure that sensitive technologies are not misused or diverted to countries posing significant risks.
