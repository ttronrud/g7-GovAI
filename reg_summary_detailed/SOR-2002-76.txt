**Detailed Summary of the *Marine Activities in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park Regulations* (S.C. 1997, c. 37)**

---

### **Overview**

These regulations, made under **Section 17 of the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park Act**, establish the legal framework governing all marine-related activities within the **Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (SSMLMP)**. The primary objective is to **protect marine ecosystems, particularly marine mammals**, while allowing sustainable, regulated tourism and scientific activities. The regulations define key terms, outline permit requirements, set operational standards, and establish enforcement mechanisms.

> **Note**: Several definitions and provisions were repealed in 2016 (SOR/2016-257), including "disturbance of a marine mammal," "endangered marine mammal," "Fjord," and "commercial vessel." This summary reflects only the current, active provisions as of the latest amendments.
