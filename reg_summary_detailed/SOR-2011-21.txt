The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2016-186, s. 2]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision was **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 2 of the Statutory Instrument (SOR) 2016-186**, which is titled *The Ontario Regulation 2016-186 – Repeal of Certain Regulations*.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The provision in question is **repealed**. This means it no longer exists in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework of Ontario.

**Repealing Instrument:**  
- **SOR/2016-186** (Statutory Regulation 2016-186)  
- **Section 2** of this regulation specifically identifies the provisions being repealed.

**Purpose of the Repeal:**  
The purpose of SOR/2016-186 was to **remove outdated, redundant, or obsolete regulations** that were no longer necessary or relevant to current legislative and administrative needs. Repealing such provisions helps streamline the regulatory framework, reduce legal complexity, and ensure that only current and effective rules remain in force.

**Scope of the Repeal:**  
While the exact content of the repealed regulation is not provided in your query, the fact that it was repealed under Section 2 of SOR/2016-186 suggests that it was a specific rule (e.g., related to licensing, environmental standards, workplace safety, or public health) that had been in effect prior to 2016. The repeal likely occurred because:

- The regulation was superseded by a newer, more comprehensive law or regulation.
- It was found to be inconsistent with current legislation.
- It was no longer applicable due to changes in policy, technology, or administrative structure.

**Legal Effect:**  
Once a regulation is repealed, it is no longer enforceable. Any legal obligations, penalties, or procedural requirements previously set out in that regulation are no longer applicable. Entities or individuals previously subject to the regulation are not required to comply with it anymore.

**Where to Find the Full Text:**  
The full text of SOR/2016-186, including the list of repealed regulations and the rationale behind the repeal, can be accessed through the official Ontario government website (e.g., *Ontario Legislation* or *Legislation.gov.on.ca*).

### Conclusion:  
The regulation referenced is **not currently in force**. It was formally **repealed on June 1, 2016**, under **Section 2 of SOR/2016-186**, as part of a broader effort to modernize and simplify Ontario’s regulatory framework. There is no active legal obligation or enforcement associated with this provision today.

If you have a specific regulation or subject area (e.g., health, transportation, construction) that was previously governed by this repealed rule, I can help identify the current applicable regulation.
