**Detailed Summary of the Oil Import Compensation Regulations No. 1, 1975**

---

### **Overview**
The *Oil Import Compensation Regulations No. 1, 1975* establish a framework for compensating eligible Canadian importers who bring crude oil or petroleum products into Canada from foreign sources. The primary objective of these regulations is to **offset certain costs incurred by importers** due to the high prices of oil and related products in the producing countries—particularly in the context of rising global energy prices and competitive market conditions—while ensuring that the compensation system remains fair, transparent, and aligned with national economic policy.

These regulations were introduced under the broader legislative context of **Vote 53c of the Appropriation Act No. 5, 1974**, which authorized funding for oil import compensation. They are particularly relevant in the post-1973 oil crisis era when Canada sought to stabilize domestic energy markets and protect domestic refining industries.

## **Key Definitions and Key Terms**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Barrel** | 34.9722 standard gallons (based on the now-repealed Chapter W-7 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970). This is the standard unit of measure used throughout the regulations. |
| **Board** | The Energy Supplies Allocation Board (ESA Board), responsible for administering the import compensation program, reviewing applications, and determining eligibility and compensation amounts. |
| **Date of Loading** | The date when the petroleum was cleared for export by the host government (for crude oil) or national government (for petroleum products) at the port of loading. This is a critical reference point for calculating compensation. |
| **Eligible Importer** | A person who meets specific criteria under Section 5, including purchasing petroleum with a date of loading on or after March 12, 1975, and maintaining price levels as required. |
| **F.O.B. Cost** | Free on board cost at the port of loading. For crude oil, it is the cost at the production site; for petroleum products, it is the cost at the port of origin. |
| **Host Government** | The national government of the country where the oil was produced, extracted, or derived—excluding provinces or state subdivisions. |
| **Import** | Unloading petroleum at a Canadian port or at a location outside Canada for transmission via pipeline to Canada. |
| **Import Compensation** | The monetary payment made to an eligible importer for a quantity of petroleum imported into Canada. Includes special payments under Section 11. |
| **Minister** | The Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, who has authority to approve special payments based on Board recommendations. |
| **Petroleum** | Includes crude oil and petroleum products. |
| **Quantity of Petroleum** | The volume of petroleum loaded for transport to Canada or a pipeline terminal, adjusted by an allowance for ocean loss (up to 1% of loaded volume or actual loss, whichever is less). |
| **Tanker Freight Costs** | Costs associated with transporting petroleum by sea. |
| **Tax Paid Cost** | Includes taxes, royalties, and acquisition costs imposed by the host government, but excludes charges that discriminate by destination or are directly tied to labor, energy, or equipment use. Also includes reasonable operating costs accepted by the host government. |

## **Classification of Petroleum and Petroleum Products**

### **Crude Oil (as defined under Vote 53c, 1974):**
- Any hydrocarbon or mixture recovered from natural reservoirs outside Canada (including oil sands).
- Natural gasoline or condensate derived from gas recovered from natural reservoirs outside Canada.

### **Petroleum Products (as defined under Vote 53c, 1974):**
- Aviation fuels  
- Motor gasoline and blending components  
- Stove oil and kerosene  
- Diesel fuel  
- Fuel oils  
- Semi-refined feedstreams for manufacturing the above products  
- Feedstreams for petrochemicals  
- Slack wax  
- Asphalt  
- Petroleum coke  
- Feedstreams for refining into lubricants, process oils, and hydrocarbon solvents  

### **Excluded from Petroleum Products:**
- Finished aromatics  
- Finished hydrocarbon solvents  
- Finished waxes  
- Finished lubricants and process oils  
- Lubricating oil blending stocks  
- Petrochemicals  

> *Note: This classification is crucial for determining which products qualify for compensation.*

## **Eligibility Requirements for Import Compensation**

An importer is considered **eligible** if:

1. **Purchase Date**: The petroleum was purchased on or after **March 12, 1975**.
2. **Purpose of Import**: The petroleum is imported for:
   - Processing in Canada (e.g., refining) for domestic consumption;
   - Sale to others in Canada for domestic consumption or processing;
   - Use in manufacturing, processing, transportation, or other non-petroleum-related operations (in which case the importer must meet additional conditions).

3. **Price Maintenance Requirement (for refining/importers)**:
   - The importer (or those for whom they imported) must have **maintained the price level** of petroleum products derived from imported petroleum at the level suggested by the Minister from time to time.
   - The importer must provide a **written undertaking** to the Board to maintain these suggested price levels.

4. **Non-Refining Use (Manufacturing/Processing)**:
   - If the imported petroleum is used in non-petroleum-related operations (e.g., manufacturing chemicals), the importer is eligible **only if** they meet the price maintenance and written undertaking requirements.

## **Calculation of Import Compensation**

### **For Crude Oil**
The total import compensation is the **aggregate** of:

1. **Allowance for Changes in Tanker Freight Costs**:
   - Based on changes in freight costs from **September 4, 1973**, calculated using a Board-established scale derived from commercial tanker freight indexes.
   - Also includes changes in non-discriminatory taxes, tolls, or tariffs on marine transport borne by the importer.

2. **Change in Tax Paid Cost**:
   - Any increase in tax paid cost between **November 30, 1973**, and the date of loading.
   - This increase must not exceed the increase in F.O.B. costs incurred or deemed incurred by the importer since November 30, 1973.

> **Exclusions from Crude Oil Compensation**:
> - Any portion of crude oil or derived petroleum products sold or supplied for **export from Canada**.
> - Any portion used as fuel in:
>   - Ships not registered in Canada (unless permitted to engage in Canadian coasting trade or related activities).
>   - Aircraft not registered in Canada.
> - Any portion consumed or lost during refining or processing into petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, diesel).

> **Reduction Clause**:  
> A deduction of **$0.90 per barrel** is applied to the total compensation for crude oil.

### **For Petroleum Products**
The total import compensation is the **aggregate** of:

1. **Allowance for Changes in Tanker Freight Costs** (same as for crude oil).
2. **Change in Tax Paid Cost**:
   - Based on changes in tax paid cost of selected crude oils (chosen by the Board) between **November 30, 1973**, and the date of loading.
   - Again, capped at the increase in F.O.B. costs since November 30, 1973.

> **Exclusions from Petroleum Product Compensation**:
> - Any portion sold or supplied for **export from Canada**.
> - Any portion used as fuel in:
>   - Ships not registered in Canada (unless engaged in Canadian coasting trade).
>   - Aircraft not registered in Canada.

> **Reduction Clause**:  
> A deduction of **$0.90 per barrel** is applied to the total compensation for petroleum products.

## **Time Limits for Compensation**

No compensation can be authorized for petroleum imported **before the latest of the following**:
- Full payment of the purchase price by the importer.
- 30 days after the date of loading.
- Completion of unloading at the port of entry in Canada.

> This ensures that compensation is only granted for imports that are actively underway and properly financed.

## **Special Payments (Section 11)**

If the Board determines that strict application of the regulations would result in **undue financial hardship**, it may recommend a **special payment** to the Minister.

- The Minister may then direct the Board to make such a payment.
- This provides a safety net for importers facing exceptional economic pressures.

> This provision reflects a policy of **economic fairness
