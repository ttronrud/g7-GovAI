The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" — indicates that the specific regulatory provision in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Schedule 1 of the Statutory Rules of Ontario (SOR/2017-84)**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The provision is **repealed**. This means it is no longer in force and has been formally removed from the legal framework.
  
- **Repeal Instrument**: The repeal is found in **SOR/2017-84**, which stands for *Statutory Rules of Ontario, 2017, No. 84*. This is a publication by the Government of Ontario that contains amendments or revocations of various regulations.

- **Section 1 of SOR/2017-84**: Section 1 of this rule specifically contains the repeal of certain regulations. The repeated references to "[Repealed, SOR/2017-84, s. 1]" suggest that the original regulation (which may have been a rule under a particular statute) was explicitly canceled by this section.

- **Purpose of Repeal**: Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are outdated or no longer relevant.
  - They conflict with newer legislation.
  - They are redundant or superseded by more comprehensive or updated rules.
  - They were found to be inconsistent with public policy or legal principles.

- **Implication**: Any legal or administrative action based on the repealed regulation is no longer valid. Entities, individuals, or institutions that previously relied on this regulation must now refer to current, active rules that have replaced it (if any) or operate under the general framework of the parent statute.

### Conclusion:

There is **no active, enforceable regulation** present under the referenced entries. The regulation has been **officially canceled** as of the date of SOR/2017-84. Therefore, it does not currently apply, and any reference to it in legal or operational contexts should be treated as obsolete.

👉 **Recommendation**: To determine what regulation replaced it (if any), one should consult the full text of SOR/2017-84, particularly Section 1, or refer to the parent statute (e.g., the *Ontario Regulation* or *Act* under which the original rule was issued). Additionally, checking the Ontario Government's official legal database (e.g., [www.ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca)) or the *Regulations and Statutes* section of the Ministry of the Attorney General will provide up-to-date and accurate information.

In summary:  
**The regulation is repealed and no longer in force.**
