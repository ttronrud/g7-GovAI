### **Core Regulatory Powers Granted**

The Fédération is authorized to regulate the **bulk marketing** of maple products in two key areas:

#### 1. **Interprovincial and Export Trade Regulation**
- The Fédération may regulate how maple sap and syrup are sold, offered for sale, or delivered in bulk to:
  - Processors (e.g., syrup manufacturers),
  - Wholesalers,
  - Exporters,
  - Any other intermediary involved in the supply chain.

This includes setting rules on pricing, quality standards, packaging, documentation, and trade practices to ensure fairness and consistency across markets.

#### 2. **Exercise of Powers Equivalent to Local Marketing Authority**
- The Fédération may, with respect to persons and property located in Quebec, exercise **all or any powers** that it would otherwise have under the Act in relation to the **local marketing of maple sap and syrup in bulk** within Quebec.
- This means the Fédération can apply the same rules and controls—such as quality standards, volume limits, or pricing mechanisms—to interprovincial and export trade as it does to domestic bulk sales.

---

### **Levies and Charges (Section 3 Powers)**

The Fédération is empowered to:

1. **Fix and impose levies or charges**:
   - Levies or charges may be imposed on individuals or entities involved in:
     - The **production** of maple sap and syrup,
     - The **marketing in bulk** of maple sap and syrup.
   - These levies can be **differentiated by group**, based on the nature of the producer or marketer (e.g., small-scale vs. large-scale producers, processors, exporters).

2. **Classify members into groups**:
   - The Fédération may categorize producers or marketers into distinct groups (e.g., by volume, type of operation, region).
   - Different levies or charges can be set for each group to reflect varying levels of activity or risk.

3. **Collect levies and charges**:
   - The Fédération has the authority to collect these fees directly from producers and marketers.

---

### **Use of Levies and Charges**

Funds collected through levies and charges may be used for a range of purposes, including:

- **Creation of reserves** (to stabilize market conditions during downturns),
- **Payment of operational expenses** (e.g., administrative costs, inspections, marketing campaigns),
- **Covering losses** arising from:
  - The sale or disposal of maple products,
  - Market fluctuations or supply disruptions,
- **Equalization or adjustment of revenues** among producers:
  - During periods of high or low market prices, the Fédération can redistribute funds to ensure that producers are not unfairly burdened by market volatility.
  - This promotes **fairness and economic stability** across the maple industry.

---

### **Purpose and Impact**

This Order serves several critical functions:

- **Market Stability**: By regulating bulk trade, it prevents price manipulation, ensures fair competition, and protects producers from exploitation by large buyers.
- **Producer Protection**: The levy system and equalization mechanism help balance market risks, especially when prices drop due to oversupply or external shocks.
- **Economic Sustainability**: The funds collected support the long-term viability of the maple industry through investment in infrastructure, quality control, and marketing.
- **Consistency with Provincial Policy**: The regulation aligns with Quebec’s broader agricultural marketing framework, ensuring that maple—a vital cultural and economic product—receives appropriate oversight.

---

### **Geographic Scope**

- Applies **only to persons and property located in the Province of Quebec**.
- Does **not extend to retail sales**, individual consumer sales, or non-bulk marketing activities.
- The regulation applies to **all maple sap and syrup produced in Quebec**, regardless of the specific region or producer.

### **Conclusion**

The *Quebec Maple Sap and Maple Syrup Order* is a foundational regulatory instrument that establishes the **Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec** as the governing body for the **bulk marketing of maple products** in interprovincial and export markets. By granting it powers to set levies, classify participants, and manage revenue distribution, the Order ensures a balanced, equitable, and sustainable system that supports both the economic health of producers and the integrity of Quebec’s maple industry.

This regulation reflects a well-structured approach to agricultural marketing, blending market oversight with producer support—ensuring that a traditional and culturally significant product is managed in a modern, transparent, and fair manner.
