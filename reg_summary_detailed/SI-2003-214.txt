The regulation you provided is a formal government order issued under the authority of the *Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act*. Below is a detailed summary of its key elements, implications, and context:

---

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Prime Minister**. This means that the decision is made at the highest level of the federal executive branch, with the Governor General formally approving and issuing the order in accordance with constitutional and statutory procedures.  

The legal foundation for this transfer is **paragraph 2(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act**, which empowers the federal government to reorganize the public service by transferring control and supervision of specific agencies or departments between different ministers. This provision allows for administrative restructuring to improve efficiency, align responsibilities with policy priorities, or reflect evolving government priorities.

---

**2. Key Transfer of Responsibility**  
The regulation transfers **control and supervision** of the **Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)** from the **Minister of Citizenship and Immigration** to the **Solicitor General of Canada**, who will assume the new title:  
> **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**.

This transfer is not merely a change in administrative oversight—it involves a shift in the ministerial responsibility for the CBSA, which is a major federal agency responsible for border security, customs enforcement, immigration enforcement, and the prevention of illicit activities at Canada’s borders.

---

**3. Effective Date**  
The transfer becomes effective on **December 12, 2003**. This date marks the point at which the new minister assumes formal authority over the CBSA, and the agency begins operating under the purview of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.

---

**4. Significance and Implications**  
- **Policy Alignment**: The transfer reflects a strategic government effort to consolidate public safety and security functions under a single, high-level minister. The CBSA, being central to national security and border integrity, was moved into a portfolio that emphasizes public safety and emergency preparedness—consistent with broader policy goals at the time.
  
- **Enhanced Oversight**: By placing the CBSA under the Deputy Prime Minister, the government likely intended to strengthen coordination between border enforcement and other national security or emergency response functions (e.g., during natural disasters, terrorism threats, or cross-border crime).

- **Leadership and Visibility**: The appointment of the Solicitor General to the role of Deputy Prime Minister underscores the importance of border security within the broader national security framework. It also elevates the profile of public safety as a cross-cutting priority.

- **Reorganization of Government Structure**: This move represents a significant reorganization of the federal public service. It reflects a shift in how responsibilities are allocated across ministries, with an emphasis on integration and inter-ministerial coordination.

---

**5. Scope of the Transfer**  
The transfer specifically applies to the **portion of the public service known as the Canada Border Services Agency**. This means that the operational, administrative, budgetary, and policy-related responsibilities of the CBSA are now under the supervision of the new minister. However, the regulation does not indicate a full merger or dissolution of the CBSA—it retains its institutional identity and functions, but now reports directly to a different minister.

---

**6. Historical Context (2003)**  
This transfer occurred in 2003, during the government of Prime Minister **Paul Martin**, following the 2002 federal election. At that time, Canada was undergoing significant efforts to modernize its border management and improve coordination between immigration, customs, and security agencies. The move to place the CBSA under a public safety portfolio aligned with growing concerns about terrorism, smuggling, and cross-border threats.

---

**7. Limitations and Clarifications**  
- The regulation does not specify whether the transfer includes personnel, funding, or specific programs—only the control and supervision of the agency.
- It does not alter the legal or statutory status of the CBSA, which remains a federal agency under the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (or its predecessor).
- The title "Deputy Prime Minister" is a ceremonial and symbolic designation, indicating the minister’s elevated status within the government, though it does not confer additional executive powers beyond those of a minister.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a formal government reorganization that transfers the oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency from the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to the Solicitor General, who is now styled as **Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness**, effective December 12, 2003. It reflects a strategic shift to strengthen national security and public safety by integrating border enforcement into a broader public safety framework. The move underscores the government’s commitment to coordinated, effective responses to emerging threats at Canada’s borders.
