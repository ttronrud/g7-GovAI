The reference "[Repealed, SI/2018-66]" indicates that the regulation in question has been formally repealed by a statutory instrument (SI) numbered SI/2018-66, issued in 2018.

However, without additional context—such as the full title of the regulation, the governing statute, or the jurisdiction (e.g., United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, etc.)—it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the specific content, scope, or provisions of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a regulation is marked as "repealed," it means that:

1. **It is no longer in force** – The regulation has been officially canceled and is not applicable anymore.
2. **It was replaced** – The repeal is typically part of a legislative or administrative update to modernize, simplify, or consolidate laws.
3. **The repeal is legally binding** – The repeal is enacted through a statutory instrument (SI), which is a form of secondary legislation, and is subject to the rules of parliamentary procedure in the relevant jurisdiction.
4. **SI/2018-66** – This is the specific statutory instrument that carried out the repeal. It would normally be published in the official government journal (e.g., the UK Statutory Instruments database or equivalent) and would list the regulation being repealed, the reason for repeal, and any transitional provisions (if applicable).

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:
- Full title of the repealed regulation
- Jurisdiction (e.g., United Kingdom, England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, etc.)
- Original purpose or subject matter (e.g., environmental standards, workplace safety, licensing, etc.)
- Date of enactment and repeal
- Reasons for repeal (e.g., redundancy, duplication, obsolescence, merger with another regulation)

Until such information is available, the most accurate summary is:
