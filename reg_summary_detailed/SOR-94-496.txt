**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

---

**1. Legal Basis and Authority**

This regulation is issued under the authority of **Section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**, which empowers the Governor in Council (the federal government) to review, amend, or rescind decisions made by the National Transportation Agency (NTA) regarding pilotage authorities. Specifically, the Governor in Council has been authorized to vary or modify existing decisions—such as Decision No. 712-W-1993—based on recommendations from the Minister of Transport and in accordance with the statutory framework governing pilotage.

Additionally, the regulation is grounded in **Section 33 of the Pilotage Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. P-14)**, which mandates that a Pilotage Authority must, with the approval of the Governor in Council, establish tariffs for pilotage services. These tariffs must be:

- **Fair and reasonable**,  
- And sufficient to ensure the Authority operates on a **self-sustaining financial basis**,  
- Including revenue from other sources, so that it does not rely on external funding to cover operational costs.

**2. Background and Context**

The regulation addresses the long-standing financial challenges faced by the **Laurentian Pilotage Authority (LPA)** since its inception in 1983. Key facts include:

- The LPA has **consistently failed to achieve financial self-sufficiency**.
- It has incurred **substantial operating deficits** over the years.
- These deficits have been **funded directly by the Department of Transport**, indicating a long-term financial dependency on government support.

This financial shortfall raises concerns about the sustainability and accountability of the LPA’s operations and undermines the principle of fair and reasonable tariffs under Section 33 of the Pilotage Act.

**3. Justification for Tariff Increase**

The Governor in Council has concluded that an increase in pilotage tariffs is **both appropriate and necessary**. The rationale for the increase is based on:

- A comparative analysis of **tariffs in other pilotage regions** across Canada.
- The finding that the current tariff levels for the Laurentian Pilotage Authority are **inadequate** to cover operational costs and maintain a self-sustaining financial model.
- The need to align the LPA’s tariff structure with **market-based and regional standards**, ensuring fairness and equity across pilotage services.

The decision reflects a shift from a model of government-funded operations to one where the Authority generates its own revenue through fair and market-responsive tariffs.

**4. Key Action Taken**

The Governor in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, **varies Decision No. 712-W-1993** of the National Transportation Agency (dated October 19, 1993), which previously established the pilotage tariff structure for the Laurentian Pilotage Authority.

**The specific change is:**

> An **increase of 8.9%** in the pilotage charges levied by the Laurentian Pilotage Authority.

This adjustment is intended to ensure that the Authority can cover its operating expenses, maintain service quality, and operate without further reliance on government subsidies.

**5. Objectives and Implications**

- **Financial Sustainability**: The primary objective is to establish a financially viable and self-sustaining model for the LPA, reducing the burden on the Department of Transport.
- **Equity and Fairness**: By aligning tariffs with those in comparable regions, the regulation promotes equity in the national pilotage system.
- **Operational Independence**: The increase supports the LPA’s transition toward operational independence and greater accountability.
- **Long-Term Viability**: It signals a commitment to maintaining safe, efficient, and economically sound maritime operations in the Laurentian region (particularly along the St. Lawrence River).

**6. Conclusion**

This regulation represents a significant policy shift in the governance of pilotage services in Canada. It responds to persistent financial deficits and reinforces the statutory requirement that pilotage tariffs be fair, reasonable, and sufficient to support self-sustaining operations. By increasing tariffs by 8.9%, the federal government ensures that the Laurentian Pilotage Authority can operate independently and efficiently, in line with national standards and best practices in maritime regulation.

**In short:**  
The federal government, under the National Transportation Act and the Pilotage Act, has increased pilotage charges for the Laurentian Pilotage Authority by 8.9% to ensure financial sustainability, eliminate long-term government funding of deficits, and align tariff levels with those in other pilotage regions. This change is legally justified and reflects a move toward a more accountable, market-based, and self-sufficient pilotage system.
