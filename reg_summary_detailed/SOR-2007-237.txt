### **Detailed Summary of the Ontario Fishery Regulations, 2007**

The **Ontario Fishery Regulations, 2007** (S.C. 1991, c. 1, s. 12) were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pursuant to **Section 43a of the Fisheries Act**. These regulations establish the rules governing sport fishing, fishing gear, species protection, licensing, and conservation in Ontario. They are designed to ensure sustainable fish populations, protect vulnerable species, prevent the spread of invasive species, and promote responsible fishing practices.
