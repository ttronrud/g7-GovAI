**1. Legal Authority and Source:**
The regulation is issued under the authority of **paragraph 2(a)(a) of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act** (S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207). This provision enables the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to transfer certain responsibilities, including control and supervision, between federal ministers within the public administration.

**2. Key Action:**
The regulation formally **transfers the control and supervision** of a specific federal office — the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada** — from the **Minister of Canadian Heritage** to the **Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (IAND)**.

**3. Scope of the Transfer:**
The transfer specifically applies to the **portion of the federal public administration** known as the **Office of Indian Residential Schools Resolution of Canada**. This office is responsible for overseeing the federal government’s efforts to address the legacy of Indian residential schools, including:
- Investigating the history and impact of residential schools;
- Supporting truth and reconciliation;
- Coordinating with Indigenous communities;
- Managing the process of providing redress and compensation;
- Developing and implementing policies related to the resolution of historical injustices.

**4. Presiding Officer Designation:**

By placing the office under IAND, the federal government affirms its commitment to Indigenous self-determination and ensures that the resolution process is led by a minister with direct responsibility for Indigenous peoples and their affairs.

**7. Significance:**
- This transfer marked a significant step in the federal government’s efforts to move toward **truth and reconciliation** with Indigenous communities.
- It institutionalized a formal, government-led process to address the historical trauma caused by residential schools.
- It strengthened the role of Indigenous voices in shaping the policy and implementation of the resolution process.

**8. Legal Citation:**
The regulation is cited as **S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 207**, which is a section of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act. This section provides the legal basis for such inter-ministerial transfers of administrative responsibilities.
