### **Key Provisions and Their Implications**

#### 1. **Designation as a "Department" under the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**  
- **Legal Basis**: Paragraph (b) of the definition of "department" in **section 2** of the Financial Administration Act.  
- **Action Taken**: The **Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women (OCSW)** is officially designated as a "department" for the purposes of the Financial Administration Act.  
- **Significance**:  
  - This grants the Office the status and financial accountability of a department under federal financial rules.  
  - It allows the Office to have a formal budget, administrative structure, and financial management responsibilities consistent with other departments.  
  - It enables the Office to be included in financial reporting, procurement processes, and internal controls governed by the FAA.

#### 2. **Designation as a "Department" under the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA)**  
- **Legal Basis**: The definition of "department" in **subsection 2(1)** of the Public Service Employment Act.  
- **Action Taken**: The Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women is also designated as a "department" for the purposes of the PSEA.  
- **Significance**:  
  - This ensures that the Office is subject to the same employment standards, human resources policies, and public service employment rules as other departments.  
  - It impacts hiring, promotion, leave, and employee benefits within the Office.  
  - The designation allows the Office to operate under the full scope of the PSEA’s employment framework, including compliance with public service codes and equity requirements.

#### 3. **Amendment to Schedule I.1 of the Financial Administration Act**  
- **Legal Basis**: Subsection **3(1.1)** of the Financial Administration Act.  
- **Action Taken**:  
  - The reference to the **Minister of National Health and Welfare** in **Column II** of **Schedule I.1** (which lists departments and their responsible ministers) is **struck out**.  
  - It is **replaced** with a reference to the **Minister of Communications**.  
- **Significance**:  
  - This reflects a **change in ministerial responsibility** for the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women.  
  - The Office is now under the authority and oversight of the **Minister of Communications**, not the Minister of National Health and Welfare.  
  - This change may indicate a reorganization of government portfolios or a shift in policy priorities (e.g., integrating women’s issues within communications or federal policy coordination).  
  - It affects interdepartmental coordination, reporting lines, and accountability structures.

#### 4. **Designation of the Co-ordinator as Deputy Head under the Public Service Employment Act**  
- **Legal Basis**: The definition of "deputy head" in **subsection 2(1)** of the Public Service Employment Act.  
- **Action Taken**: The **Co-ordinator of the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women** is designated as the **deputy head** of the Office for the purposes of the PSEA.  
- **Significance**:  
  - This grants the Co-ordinator formal leadership status within the public service employment framework.  
  - The Co-ordinator now has the authority and responsibilities associated with a deputy head, including leadership of staff, policy implementation, and administrative oversight.  
  - It enhances the Office’s autonomy and visibility within the federal public service structure.  
  - It also ensures that the Co-ordinator is accountable under employment regulations and reporting requirements.

### **Historical Context and Status**

- **Original Purpose**: The Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women was established to coordinate federal government policies and programs related to women’s issues.  
- **Timeline**: This regulation was issued in **1992**, during a period of reform in federal women’s policy and government structure.  
- **Repeal**: The regulation was **repealed by SI/95-113** (Statutory Instrument 1995-113), which indicates that the Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women was either:  
  - Merged into another office (e.g., the Office of the Minister of Women and Gender Equality),  
  - Reorganized under a new structure, or  
  - Discontinued as a standalone entity.  

> Note: The repeal suggests that the formal designation of the Office as a department and the appointment of the Co-ordinator as deputy head were temporary or transitional measures. The Office likely evolved into a different form within the federal government.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation formally recognized the **Office of the Co-ordinator, Status of Women** as a department with full financial and employment status within the federal government. It restructured ministerial oversight by transferring responsibility to the **Minister of Communications** and elevated the Co-ordinator to a formal leadership role.
