### **Regulation Summary: Fruit and Vegetable Remission Order, 2003**

#### **1. Legal Authority and Source**
- The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Finance**.
- It is based on **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff Act** (S.C. 1997, c. 36), which authorizes the government to grant remissions (reductions or waivers) of customs duties under specific conditions.

#### **2. Purpose of the Order**
- The primary purpose is to **grant remission of customs duties** for certain **fruit and vegetable imports** that were processed in Canada during a specified year.
- This remission applies to companies that import these products for **processing purposes**, such as canning, freezing, or other food processing, to support domestic food manufacturing and reduce the cost of processing inputs.

#### **3. Scope of the Remission**
- The remission applies to:
  - **Specific products** listed in **Column II** of the attached schedule (e.g., apples, tomatoes, carrots, etc.).
  - **Specific companies** listed in **Column I** of the schedule (i.e., eligible importers).
  - **Specific fiscal years** listed in **Column III** (e.g., the year of importation during which processing occurred).
- The remission is **limited to the amount specified in Column IV** of the schedule for each qualifying product and company.

> **Key Point**: The remission is not a full exemption of duties but a **partial refund or waiver up to a capped amount** per product and per company.

#### **4. Conditions for Eligibility**
To qualify for the remission, the following conditions must be met:
- The product must have been **imported into Canada for processing** during the year specified in Column III.

- The claim must be made **by or on behalf of the company** listed in Column I.

> **Deadline Significance**: The December 31, 2005 deadline is critical. Any claim submitted after this date will not be accepted under this Order.

#### **5. Effective Date**
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** (i.e., officially published and recognized by the government), not on a fixed date such as January 1 or the start of a fiscal year.

#### **6. Regulatory Context and Implications**
- This Order is part of a broader policy to **support domestic food processing industries** by reducing the cost of raw material imports.
- It reflects a **targeted relief measure** designed to encourage the processing of agricultural goods within Canada, thereby promoting value-added production and job creation in the agricultural sector.
- The limitation to a specific year (the year of processing) and a cap on the remission amount ensures that the benefit is **fiscal responsible and limited in scope**.
