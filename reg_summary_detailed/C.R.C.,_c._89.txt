**Detailed Summary of the Kelowna Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

### **1. Title and Citation**
The regulation is officially titled:  
**Kelowna Airport Zoning Regulations**  
It may be cited as such and governs land use and development within a defined area surrounding Kelowna Airport in British Columbia.

---

### **2. Key Definitions**

The regulation establishes specific technical definitions critical to its implementation:

- **Airport**: Refers to Kelowna Airport, administered by the City of Kelowna, located in the Province of British Columbia.

- **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**:  
  A fixed geographic point used as a reference for measuring elevations and distances.  
  - Defined in **Part I of the Schedule**.  
  - **Deemed to be 1,371 feet above sea level** for all purposes in these regulations, even if the actual elevation differs.

- **Approach Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from each end of a runway (strip), perpendicular to the runway centerline.  
  - Described in **Part III of the Schedule**.  
  - Designed to ensure aircraft have a clear visual and physical path during landing and takeoff, preventing obstacles from interfering with approach visibility.

- **Outer Surface**:  
  An imaginary surface located above and in the immediate vicinity of the airport.  
  - Described in **Part IV of the Schedule**.  
  - Covers a broader area than the approach surfaces and is intended to protect the entire airport’s airspace from vertical obstructions.

- **Strip**:  
  The rectangular portion of the airport’s landing area designated for takeoff and landing in a specific direction.  
  - Defined in **Part V of the Schedule**.  
  - Includes runways and associated taxiways or active landing zones.

- **Transitional Surface**:  
  An imaginary inclined plane extending upward and outward from the lateral edges of the strip and its associated approach surfaces.  
  - Described in **Part VI of the Schedule**.  
  - Acts as a buffer zone between the strip and surrounding land, ensuring no structures or natural features obstruct aircraft during approach or departure.

---

### **3. Scope of Application**

- These regulations apply to:
  - All **land and underwater areas** adjacent to or in the vicinity of Kelowna Airport.
  - The **outer limits** of this area are defined in **Part II of the Schedule**, which provides a detailed legal description (via a legal description in survey terms) of the boundary line.

- **Exclusions**:  
  The regulations do **not apply** to land that is currently part of the airport’s operational or administrative infrastructure (e.g., active runways, taxiways, terminal buildings, or lands formally designated as airport property).

---

### **4. Prohibited Development**

**No person may:**
- Erect, construct, or add to any building, structure, or object (including existing ones)  
- On any land subject to these regulations  
- Where the **highest point** of that object exceeds the elevation of any of the following surfaces **at the location of that point**:

1. **Approach Surface**  
2. **Outer Surface**  
3. **Transitional Surface**

> This means that any structure (e.g., buildings, towers, trees, antennas, fences, or even small signs) must remain **below or at the level** of these defined imaginary surfaces at every point on the structure.

---

### **5. Natural Growth Exceptions**

- If a **natural object** (e.g., a tree, bush, or hill) grows on land covered by these regulations and **exceeds the elevation** of any of the three surfaces (approach, outer, or transitional), then:

- The **Minister of Transport** (Minister) may issue a **direction** to the **owner or occupier** of the land to **remove or trim** the excessive growth.

> This provision allows regulatory oversight over natural features that could pose a safety risk to aircraft operations.

---

### **6. Legal Description of the Boundary**

The outer limits of the regulated area are defined by a detailed legal description in **Part II of the Schedule**, which includes:

- A series of directional bearings and distances (e.g., "thence easterly along the northerly boundary... to a point 500 feet southerly...")
- Reference to specific **land parcels**, **plats**, **plans**, and **sections** (e.g., Township 23, Section 26)
- Key reference points such as:
  - A point 250 feet west of runway 15–33, measured at right angles from a point 4,000 feet south along the runway centerline from its northern end.

> This legal description ensures precise geographic boundaries for enforcement, allowing officials to determine which properties fall under the regulation.

---

### **7. Status and Revocation**

- The regulation was **revoked by SOR/81-173, Section 1**.  
  > This is a critical note: **The regulation is currently invalid or has been repealed**.

- However, the content provided appears to be a **draft, historical, or archived version** of the regulation.  
  The revocation suggests that the current governing rules may differ or have been replaced by updated legislation or policy.

> **Important Interpretation**:  
> While the summary above reflects the **content and structure** of the regulation as presented, **it is no longer in force** due to revocation. Any current development or land use decisions near Kelowna Airport must follow **current, active regulations** issued by the City of Kelowna or the Ministry of Transportation.

---

### **8. Purpose and Intent**

The primary goals of these regulations are:

- To **ensure aviation safety** by preventing vertical obstructions near the airport.
- To **protect aircraft during approach and departure** by maintaining clear lines of sight and unimpeded airspace.
- To **establish a consistent, measurable standard** for land use and development near the airport through clearly defined surfaces (approach, outer, transitional).
- To provide **flexibility** for natural growth through a ministerial oversight mechanism.

### **Summary Table**

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Regulation Title** | Kelowna Airport Zoning Regulations |
| **Applicable Area** | All land and water adjacent to Kelowna Airport, as defined in Part II of the Schedule |
| **Key Surfaces** | Approach Surface, Outer Surface, Transitional Surface |
| **Elevation Reference** | Airport Reference Point = 1,371 ft above sea level |
| **Prohibited Activity** | Construction or addition of any object exceeding any of the three surfaces |
| **Natural Growth** | Excessive natural growth may be removed by Minister’s direction |
| **Status** | **Revoked** by SOR/81-173, s. 1 – **No longer in effect** |
| **Primary Purpose** | Aviation safety through vertical obstruction control |

### **Conclusion**

While the **Kelowna Airport Zoning Regulations** as presented contain a comprehensive and technically detailed framework for managing development near the airport—centered on three imaginary surfaces to ensure aircraft safety—they are **currently revoked** and **not enforceable**.

Any current land use, development, or planning decisions near Kelowna Airport must be based on **up-to-date municipal or provincial regulations**. This document serves as a historical or archival reference, illustrating the type of zoning controls applied to airport zones in British Columbia.

> **Recommendation**: Stakeholders (developers, landowners, planners) should consult the **City of Kelowna’s current zoning bylaws**, the **Ministry of Transportation’s aviation safety policies**, or the **BC Ministry of Environment** for active guidance on land use near Kelowna Airport.
