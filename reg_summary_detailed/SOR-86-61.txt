**Detailed Summary of the DHC Shares Sale Regulations**

**Regulatory Text and Legal Basis:**

The *DHC Shares Sale Regulations* (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") were made by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, acting on the recommendation of the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and the Treasury Board, under **section 34 of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1984, c. 31, s. 7). This section empowers the Governor General to adopt regulations to govern the sale of shares in a Canadian corporation, specifically in this case, *The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Limited* (DHC).

These Regulations are formally cited as the **DHC Shares Sale Regulations** and are intended to provide the legal framework for the sale of specific classes of shares in DHC to The Boeing Company.

**Core Provision: Minister’s Authority to Participate in the Acquisition Agreement**

The central and most significant provision in the Regulations is:

> *"The Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada, may become a party to the Acquisition Agreement with The Boeing Company regarding the sale of 31,999 Class A shares and 10,000 Class B common shares of DHC to The Boeing Company, including all amendments thereto, and may assume all liability of CDIC thereunder in respect of any obligation assumed towards The Boeing Company."*

**Interpretation and Significance of This Provision:**

- **Minister’s Role:** The Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion (a federal department responsible for promoting regional economic development, including in industrial and manufacturing sectors) is granted the authority to **join as a party** to the Acquisition Agreement between DHC and The Boeing Company. This means the Minister can formally sign and bind Canada to the terms of the sale.

- **Scope of Shares:** The sale involves:
  - **31,999 Class A shares**  
  - **10,000 Class B common shares**  
  These are specific classes of equity in DHC, indicating a targeted transfer of ownership and control, likely aimed at ensuring a smooth transition of the company’s assets and operations.

- **Assumption of Liability:** The Minister may **assume all liabilities** of CDIC under the Acquisition Agreement. This is a critical legal and financial mechanism. It means:
  - If CDIC had previously held or been involved in obligations related to the shares (such as guarantees, commitments, or indemnities), the Minister (acting on behalf of Canada) can take over those responsibilities.
  - This protects Canada’s financial exposure and ensures continuity in the transaction, especially if CDIC had been a shareholder or had made financial commitments to DHC prior to the sale.

- **Inclusion of Amendments:** The Minister’s participation and liability assumption extend to **all amendments** to the Acquisition Agreement. This ensures legal certainty and stability in the transaction, even if contractual terms are modified during the process.

**Purpose and Context of the Regulations:**

- The sale of DHC shares to Boeing was part of a broader strategy to:
  - Transition DHC from a Canadian-owned aerospace company to a more globally integrated entity.
  - Ensure the preservation and continued operation of key Canadian aerospace capabilities under a reliable international partner.
  - Facilitate the orderly transfer of assets and operations, minimizing disruption to the Canadian aerospace industry.

- The involvement of CDIC and the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion underscores the **federal government’s interest in protecting and supporting strategic Canadian industrial assets**, particularly in the aerospace sector.

- By allowing the Minister to become a party and assume CDIC’s liabilities, the Regulations provide **legal clarity and enforceability** for the transaction, ensuring that Canada’s financial and strategic interests are safeguarded.

**Legal and Policy Implications:**

- **Government Oversight:** The Regulations reflect a high level of federal oversight in a major industrial transaction involving a Canadian-owned company.
- **Risk Mitigation:** The liability assumption provision allows Canada to manage financial risks associated with the sale, particularly if the transaction involves guarantees or performance obligations.
- **Economic Development Focus:** The involvement of the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion highlights the importance of regional industrial expansion and the role of government in supporting key manufacturing industries.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *DHC Shares Sale Regulations* establish a formal legal mechanism for the federal government—specifically through the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion—to participate in and assume responsibility for the sale of a significant portion of DHC’s shares to The Boeing Company. This provision ensures that Canada can maintain control over the transaction’s financial and strategic outcomes, protects its interests under the Acquisition Agreement, and supports the broader goal of industrial stability and growth in Canada’s aerospace sector.

These Regulations are not merely procedural—they represent a strategic policy decision to ensure that a major Canadian industrial asset is transitioned in a manner that is financially sound, legally secure, and aligned with national economic development objectives.
