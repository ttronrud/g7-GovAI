## 📚 **What Constitutes a Pest Control Product?**

Under subsection 2(1) of the PCA, the following are classified as pest control products:

1. **Devices** that control, destroy, attract, repel pests, or mitigate pest-related harm.
2. **Compounds/substances** added to or used with pest control products to enhance or modify their physical/chemical properties or effects on host organisms.
3. **Active ingredients** used to control pests or mitigate pest damage.
4. **Treated articles** (inanimate products treated during manufacturing).
5. **Treated seeds** (seeds with pest control product incorporated or applied).

> ✅ This broad definition ensures that even non-agricultural uses (e.g., industrial cleaning, antifouling, disinfection) are covered.
