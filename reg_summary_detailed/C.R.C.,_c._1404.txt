This indicates that a specific section of a prior regulation—Section 200 of the regulation referenced in **SOR/2007-86** (Supplement to the Statutory Rules, 2007, No. 86)—has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by the same document, specifically under **section 200** of that regulation.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation in Question**: SOR/2007-86 (Statutory Rules of Ontario, 2007, No. 86)  
  This is a collection of amendments or new rules introduced into Ontario's regulatory framework in 2007. The specific section referenced (Section 200) was part of this regulation.

- **Status**: **Repealed**  
  The section has been formally removed from the law. This means it is no longer in force and does not apply to current legal or administrative practices.

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  The repeal is typically enacted when a regulation is outdated, redundant, inconsistent with current legislation, or superseded by a newer or more comprehensive rule. The specific reason for the repeal of Section 200 is not detailed in the provided text, but such repeals are often part of a broader legislative modernization or consolidation effort.

- **Legal Effect**:  
  Any legal obligations, definitions, procedures, or requirements previously set out in Section 200 are no longer binding. Legal or administrative bodies must refer to the current version of the regulation or related statutes, if any, instead.

- **Source of Repeal**:  
  The repeal is formally enacted in **SOR/2007-86, section 200**, which means that the repeal is not a standalone law but an amendment to the original regulation. This is a common practice in regulatory updates where outdated provisions are removed without creating a new rule.

- **Implication**:  
  Any prior enforcement, interpretation, or application of Section 200 is now invalid. Legal professionals, government agencies, or private parties must ensure they are relying on current, active provisions of the regulation.
