The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-88" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 88 of 2018 has been formally repealed.

However, without additional context (such as the full title, the enabling act, or the subject matter — e.g., environmental protection, health, transport, or employment), it is not possible to provide a detailed summary of the content of the regulation that was repealed.

In general, when a statutory instrument is marked as "repealed," it means:

- The regulation is no longer in force.
- It has been formally cancelled by a subsequent legislation, typically through a new statutory instrument or an amendment to a parent Act.
- The repeal is usually published in the Canada Gazette (if in Canada) or the official government gazette of the relevant jurisdiction.
- The repeal may be due to redundancy, inconsistency with newer laws, or a change in policy.

To provide a detailed summary, the following information would be required:

1. Full title of the statutory instrument (e.g., "The [Name] Regulations, SI 2018/88").
2. The parent Act under which it was made.
3. The date and reason for repeal.
4. The scope and content of the original regulation (e.g., what it governed — such as workplace safety, product standards, or licensing procedures).

Until such information is available, the most accurate statement is:

**Summary:**  
SI/2018-88 has been repealed, meaning it is no longer in effect. A detailed summary of its original content cannot be provided without the full title and subject matter of the regulation. The repeal suggests that the regulation was either outdated, superseded by new legislation, or deemed unnecessary. For further details, consultation of the official government gazette or legislative database (such as the Canada Gazette or the legislation database of the relevant jurisdiction) is required.

If you can provide the full title or subject of SI/2018-88, I would be happy to offer a more detailed and accurate summary.
