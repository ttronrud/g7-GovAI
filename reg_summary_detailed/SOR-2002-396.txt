**Detailed Summary of the CCRFTA Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations**

---

**Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**  
The *Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance**, under **subparagraph 16(2)(a)(i)a of the Customs Tariff**. This provision provides the legal authority to establish rules of origin for specific types of goods under the Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement (CCRFTA).

The regulation is formally enacted under **Section 34(1) of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2001, c. 28)**, and is referenced in the broader legislative framework established by **S.C. 1997, c. 36** (the original implementation legislation for the CCRFTA).

**Definition of "Casual Goods"**  
The term **"casual goods"** is defined in the regulations as goods that are **not imported for sale or for any industrial, occupational, commercial, institutional, or similar purpose**.  
This means casual goods are typically **personal, non-commercial, or non-business-use items** such as:
- Personal items brought into Canada for private use (e.g., clothing, electronics, household goods),
- Goods acquired as gifts or for personal consumption,
- Items not intended for resale or business operations.

This distinction is critical because it establishes a separate regime from standard commercial goods, which are subject to different rules of origin and tariff treatment.

**Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Acquired in Costa Rica**  
For casual goods acquired in **Costa Rica**, the following conditions determine whether they are deemed to **originate in Costa Rica** and thus qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement:

1. **Marking Requirement**  
   The goods must be **marked in accordance with Costa Rica’s marking laws**, and the marking must:
   - Clearly indicate that the goods are the product of **Costa Rica or Canada**.

   This marking serves as objective evidence of origin and is essential for determining eligibility for tariff benefits.

2. **Absence of Marking with No Evidence of Foreign Origin**  
   If the goods **do not bear any mark**, they are still deemed to originate in Costa Rica **if there is no evidence to suggest they are not of Costa Rican or Canadian origin**.  
   In such cases, the absence of a mark is not sufficient to disqualify the goods from origin status—only the presence of evidence (such as documentation, labels, or provenance) showing foreign origin would be sufficient to negate the origin claim.

This rule ensures that casual goods, especially those with no commercial intent, are not unfairly denied preferential treatment simply because they lack visible branding.

**Effective Date**  
These regulations come into force on the **date when subsection 34(1) of the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (S.C. 2001, c. 28) comes into force**.  
This date is not specified in the text, but historically, such provisions typically come into effect upon the formal commencement of the CCRFTA, which was **November 1, 2002**.

The regulation explicitly notes that the rules were in force as of **November 1, 2002**, and is referenced in **Supplemental Information (SI/2002-146)**, confirming its official implementation date.

**Key Objectives and Implications**  
- **Simplifies Origin Determination**: By establishing clear, practical rules for casual goods (which are often not subject to formal commercial documentation), the regulation reduces administrative burden for individuals and small importers.
- **Supports Free Trade Principles**: It ensures that casual goods imported from Costa Rica—especially those used for personal consumption—can still benefit from preferential tariff treatment under the CCRFTA, promoting bilateral trade.
- **Balances Trade Fairness and Enforcement**: The rules provide flexibility (e.g., no marking required if no evidence of foreign origin exists) while maintaining a reasonable standard to prevent fraud or misuse of origin benefits.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Rules of Origin for Casual Goods Regulations* provide a clear, accessible, and fair framework for determining the origin of non-commercial goods imported from Costa Rica into Canada. By focusing on marking and the absence of evidence of foreign origin, the regulation ensures that casual goods—despite lacking commercial intent—can still qualify for preferential tariff treatment under the Canada–Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement. The rules are designed to support trade in personal and non-commercial items while remaining consistent with the principles of origin and transparency required under international trade agreements.
