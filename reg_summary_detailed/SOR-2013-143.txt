### **4. Key Differences Between Categories**
| Category       | Deadline for Standard Tariffs | Deadline for New Tariffs (Post-Cessation) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Authors**   | Until Dec 31, 2013           | 7 years after cessation                    |
| **Performers**| Until Dec 31, 2016           | 7 years after cessation                   |
| **Makers**    | Until Dec 31, 2013           | 5 years after cessation                  |

- The **longer deadline for performers** reflects the extended period during which performance rights are used in private copying (e.g., in music or live performances).
- The **shorter deadline for makers** may reflect the shorter lifecycle or different market dynamics of recorded works.
- All parties have a **fixed endpoint** (December 31) for the standard tariffs, with the exception of new tariffs, which are governed by a fixed number of years after the tariff ends.

---

### **6. Enforcement and Compliance**

---

### **7. Effective Date**

### **Conclusion**
This regulation establishes a **structured, time-bound framework** for eligible creators (authors, performers, and makers) who are not part of collective societies to claim private copying remuneration. It differentiates the deadlines based on the type of creator and the tariff period, with authors and performers receiving longer windows (up to 7 years) and makers receiving a shorter window (up to 5 years). The rules ensure that claims are made within a defined period, promoting fairness, legal certainty, and effective administration of the private copying remuneration system under Canadian copyright law.

> ⚠️ **Important Reminder**: These deadlines are **non-renewable** and **non-extendable**. Once the deadline passes, the entitlement is lost. Rights holders are strongly advised to act promptly and consult the Copyright Board or a legal advisor if they believe they are eligible.
