---

### **Background and Legal Authority**

This regulation, known as the *Chicken Farmers of Canada Delegation of Authority Order* (SOR/2002-1), is a delegated administrative instrument issued under the **Farm Products Agencies Act (FPA Act)** and specifically the **Chicken Farmers of Canada Proclamation** (SOR/79-158; SOR/98-244). It establishes a formal delegation of authority from **Chicken Farmers of Canada (CFC)** to **Provincial Commodity Boards (PCBs)** in Canada.

#### Key Legal Foundations:
- **Section 13(b) of the Farm Products Agencies Act (S.C. 1993, c. 3, par. 13(b))**: Authorizes the Governor in Council to establish a farm products agency, such as Chicken Farmers of Canada.
- **Section 2 of the FPA Act (S.C. 1993, c. 3, s. 2)**: Provides the framework for the operation and governance of such agencies.
- **Subsection 22(3)d of the FPA Act**: Grants CFC the authority to delegate powers to other bodies (such as provincial boards) to carry out specific functions related to marketing and quota administration.
- **Section 9e of the Chicken Farmers of Canada Proclamation**: Empowers CFC to make delegation orders to manage marketing activities.

This Order was approved by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food**, on **March 27, 2003**, and came into force upon registration.

### **Purpose of the Order**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **delegate to Provincial Commodity Boards (PCBs)** the authority to administer and manage **federal quotas and federal market development quotas** within their respective provinces. This enables a more localized and efficient administration of chicken marketing quotas while ensuring compliance with national regulatory standards.

---

### **Key Provisions and Interpretations**

#### 1. **Definitions**
All terms used in the Order (such as *CFC*, *chicken*, *federal market development quota*, *producer*, *registered production facilities*, etc.) have the **same meaning as defined in Section 1 of the Canadian Chicken Marketing Quota Regulations**. This ensures consistency and clarity in interpretation across federal and provincial levels.

---

#### 2. **Delegation of Authority to Provincial Commodity Boards**

Under **subsection (1)**, CFC grants each Provincial Commodity Board the authority to:
- **Allot and administer** federal quotas and federal market development quotas within the province.
- **Exercise the powers** that CFC would otherwise exercise in carrying out this function.

This includes the ability to:
- Determine the size, allocation, and validity of quotas.
- Manage quota banks (specifically for federal quotas).
- Set rules governing who qualifies as a producer and their associated entities (e.g., partners, affiliates, subsidiaries).
- Decide on quota utilization, transfer, leasing, or cancellation.
- Establish marketing arrangements with processors.
- Require producers to submit information, documents, and reports.

> ⚠️ **Important Limitation**:  
> The delegation **does NOT include** the authority to:
> - Allot quotas to producers who are **not in good standing** with CFC.
> - Allocate federal market development quotas to producers who would allow marketing to **primary processors without a valid, active market development licence** issued by CFC under the *Canadian Chicken Licensing Regulations*.

This ensures that only compliant and properly licensed producers can access market development quotas, maintaining market integrity and regulatory oversight.

---

#### 3. **Application of Provincial Rules (with Compliance Checks)**

When performing its delegated functions, a Provincial Commodity Board **must apply provincial laws and regulations** (if any) relating to:
- Provincial quotas and provincial market development quotas.

However, such provincial rules **may only apply if they are not inconsistent** with the *Canadian Chicken Marketing Quota Regulations*.

The areas where provincial rules may be applied include:
- Quota banks (for federal quotas)
- Entitlement to quotas
- Basis for determining quota amounts
- Increases or reductions in quotas
- Allotment of quotas to producers
- Validity period of quotas
- Maximum and minimum quota sizes
- Determination of producer status and related entities
- Cancellation or suspension of quotas due to breaches or non-payment of levies
- Reduction or loss of quotas due to non-utilization
- Ownership, leasing, or transfer of quotas
- Definition of registered production facilities and their impact on quotas
- Utilization of quotas
- Marketing arrangements with processors
- Required information, documents, and reports from producers

> This provision allows provinces to maintain some local regulatory flexibility, **as long as they do not conflict with federal standards**.

---

#### 4. **Information Collection and Reporting**

CFC grants each Provincial Commodity Board the authority to:
- **Receive from market development licensees** the information, documents, and reports required under **subsection 5(3) of the Canadian Chicken Licensing Regulations**.

However, **all such information, documents, and reports must be forwarded to CFC**. This ensures that CFC retains central oversight and access to critical data for national-level monitoring, compliance, and policy development.

---

#### 5. **Revocation of Prior Authority**

This Order **revokes the prior administrative authority** granted under the *Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency Quota Grant of Administrative Authority*, approved by **Order in Council P.C. 1991-1090** (June 13, 1991).

This indicates a **transition in governance structure** — shifting from a centralized agency model to a more decentralized, province-based administration under CFC’s oversight.

---

### **Effective Date and Publication**

- The Order **comes into force on the day it is registered** in the *Canada Gazette*.
- It is **not published in the Canada Gazette** (as noted in the text), which may indicate it was issued as an internal or administrative instrument rather than a publicly accessible regulatory document. However, its effects are binding upon all parties involved.

### **Significance and Implications**

| Aspect | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Decentralization** | Empowers provincial boards to manage local quota administration, improving responsiveness to regional market conditions. |
| **Regulatory Consistency** | Ensures alignment with national marketing rules while allowing provincial input where permissible. |

### **Conclusion**

The *Chicken Farmers of Canada Delegation of Authority Order (SOR/2002-1)* is a critical piece of regulatory infrastructure that enables **efficient, localized management of chicken marketing quotas** in Canada. By delegating administrative responsibilities to Provincial Commodity Boards, it promotes regional adaptability while preserving federal oversight and compliance standards. The restrictions on quota allotment to non-compliant producers and processors reinforce market integrity, and the requirement to report to CFC ensures national accountability.

This Order reflects a balanced approach to agricultural policy — combining **local governance with national regulatory coherence** — and supports the long-term sustainability of the Canadian chicken industry’s marketing system.
