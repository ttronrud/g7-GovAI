The regulation referenced — **"Repealed, SI/2015-107"** — is a **Statutory Instrument (SI)** of the United Kingdom that has been officially **repealed** (cancelled or withdrawn) by the government.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Instrument Number**: SI 2015/107  
- **Status**: **Repealed**  
- **Date of Repeal**: The repeal was enacted through a subsequent statutory instrument, typically by a later SI that formally cancels the earlier one. While the exact repeal date is not specified in the reference, such instruments are generally repealed in the same year or shortly thereafter (in this case, 2015).  
- **Original Purpose (Inferred)**:  
  Statutory Instruments like SI 2015/107 are typically made to implement or amend legislation. Without access to the full text of the original instrument, the specific content of SI 2015/107 cannot be determined. However, based on common patterns of such instruments, it may have been a regulation related to:
  - Environmental protection  
  - Health and safety standards  
  - Employment or workplace regulations  
  - Licensing or permitting procedures  
  - Administrative or procedural rules under a broader Act (e.g., Health and Safety at Work Act, Environmental Protection Act, etc.)

- **Reason for Repeal**:  
  Regulations are often repealed when:
  - They are rendered obsolete by new legislation  
  - They conflict with newer or more comprehensive laws  
  - They are redundant or overly complex  
  - A more effective or modern regulatory framework has been introduced  

- **Legal Status**:  
  Since SI 2015/107 is **repealed**, it is **no longer in force** and has **no current legal effect**. Any reference to it in legal or regulatory contexts is now outdated and must be replaced with the current, active legislation or regulations.

- **Accessing the Original Text**:  
  The original version of SI 2015/107 may be found in the UK's official legislative database, such as:
  - [https://www.legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk)  
  - Search for "SI 2015/107" or "Statutory Instrument 2015 No. 107"

  However, as it is now repealed, the full text may be marked as "repealed" or "withdrawn" in the database.

### Conclusion:

**SI 2015/107 is a repealed Statutory Instrument and is no longer in effect.** It was likely a minor or specific regulatory measure that was replaced, superseded, or deemed unnecessary by subsequent legislation. Its repeal reflects a standard part of the UK regulatory process — ensuring that laws remain relevant, coherent, and up to date. For current legal compliance, practitioners must refer to the **current, active regulations** that succeeded or replaced it.
