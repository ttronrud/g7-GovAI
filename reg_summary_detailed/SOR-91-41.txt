### **Purpose of the Regulation**
The primary objective of these regulations is to ensure transparency and accurate identification of individuals applying for registration under *section 240 of the Excise Tax Act*. Specifically, the regulation mandates that applicants provide their **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** when submitting a registration application to the Minister of National Revenue.

This requirement supports the government’s administrative and compliance functions by enabling the Minister to verify the identity of applicants, maintain accurate records, and prevent fraud or misuse in the registration process related to excise tax obligations.

### **Key Provisions**

1. **Mandatory Disclosure of Social Insurance Number**  
   Every individual who applies to the Minister of National Revenue to be registered under *section 240 of the Excise Tax Act* must include their **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** in the application form prescribed by the Minister for that purpose.

   - The application must be submitted in the official form designated by the Minister.
   - The SIN is not optional; its inclusion is a legal requirement under these regulations.
   - The SIN must be disclosed in the form itself, meaning applicants cannot omit it or provide only a partial number.

2. **Scope of Application**  
   This regulation applies specifically to:
   - Individuals seeking registration under *section 240 of the Excise Tax Act*, which typically relates to the registration of persons or entities involved in the sale or distribution of taxable goods (such as alcohol, tobacco, or fuel).
   - The requirement is not extended to other types of tax registrations or administrative processes outside the scope of section 240.

3. **Legal Basis**  
   The regulation is enacted under paragraph 277(1)(d) of the *Excise Tax Act*, which authorizes the Minister of National Revenue to make regulations concerning the disclosure of personal information—specifically, the Social Insurance Number—when required for administrative purposes such as registration.

4. **Enforcement and Compliance**  
   - Failure to disclose a valid SIN in an application may result in the application being rejected or deemed incomplete.
   - The Minister has the authority to verify the authenticity and validity of the SIN provided, and may take appropriate action if the information is found to be false or incomplete.

5. **Confidentiality and Use of SIN**  
   While not explicitly detailed in the provided text, the underlying principle of the regulation assumes that the SIN will be used solely for the purpose of identity verification and registration under the Excise Tax Act. The Minister is expected to handle such personal information in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws (e.g., the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* or PIPEDA), although these are not part of the current regulation.

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Administrative Efficiency:** The requirement ensures that the Minister can efficiently process applications by verifying identities and cross-referencing with official databases.
- **Fraud Prevention:** Mandating SIN disclosure reduces the risk of fraudulent registrations, which could otherwise lead to tax evasion or improper taxation.
- **Compliance with Federal Standards:** The regulation aligns with broader federal practices of requiring identity verification in administrative and tax-related processes.
- **Public Awareness:** The regulation serves as a clear directive to applicants, emphasizing the importance of providing accurate personal information during registration.

### **Conclusion**

The *Social Insurance Number Disclosure Regulations* establish a clear and enforceable requirement that individuals applying for registration under *section 240 of the Excise Tax Act* must disclose their full Social Insurance Number in the prescribed application form. This regulation enhances the integrity of the registration process, supports compliance with excise tax laws, and ensures that the government can accurately identify and verify applicants. It operates within the legal framework of the *Excise Tax Act* and reflects a broader trend in Canadian tax administration toward identity verification and data accountability.
