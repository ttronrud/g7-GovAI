### **Detailed Summary of the Gully Marine Protected Area Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Legal Basis**
The **Gully Marine Protected Area Regulations** were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under:
- **Subsection 35(3)** and  
- **Section 52.1 of the Oceans Act**

These regulations establish a designated marine protected area (MPA) in the **Atlantic Ocean** known as the **Gully Marine Protected Area (GMPA)**, with specific environmental protections and management zones.

---

#### **2. Geodetic Reference System**
All geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) referenced in the regulations are expressed in the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD83)** geodetic reference system, ensuring accuracy and consistency in spatial mapping.

---

#### **3. Geographic Boundaries of the Gully Marine Protected Area**
The GMPA is defined by a **rhumb line** (a line of constant bearing) connecting six specific points (labeled 1 to 6 in Schedule 1):

1. **44°13′N, 59°06′W**  
2. **43°47′N, 58°35′W**  
3. **43°35′N, 58°35′W**  
4. **43°35′N, 59°08′W**  
5. **43°55′N, 59°08′W**  
6. **44°06′N, 59°20′W**

The area is bounded by a closed loop connecting these points and returning to the starting point. This area includes:
- The **seabed**
- The **subsoil to a depth of 15 meters**
- The **water column above the seabed**

This defines the **entire physical extent** of the protected zone.

---

#### **4. Management Zones Within the GMPA**
The GMPA is subdivided into three distinct **management zones** as depicted in **Schedule 2**:

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Zone 1** | A core protected area with the highest level of protection. Includes sensitive habitats and species. |
| **Zone 2** | A surrounding buffer zone around Zone 1. Provides transitional protection and allows for limited, regulated activities. |
| **Zone 3** | The remaining portion of the GMPA, excluding Zones 1 and 2. Offers a moderate level of protection, permitting certain activities under strict conditions. |

Each zone has different levels of allowable human activity based on environmental sensitivity and conservation goals.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities (Section 4)**
**No person may**:
- Disturb, damage, destroy, or remove from the GMPA:
  - Any **living marine organism** or part of its **habitat**;
  - Any part of the **seabed**, including the subsoil to a depth of **15 meters**;
- Carry out any activity (including **depositing, discharging, or dumping** any substance) that could result in such disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal.

> This prohibition applies throughout the GMPA and in the **vicinity** of the area.

---

#### **6. Pre-Approval Requirement for Activities (Section 5)**
Any individual or entity proposing to carry out an activity within the GMPA must submit a **detailed plan** to the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** at least **60 days before** the activity begins. The plan must include:

1. **Purpose of the activity**  
2. **Detailed description of the activity**  
3. **Identity of all ships and aircraft** involved  
4. **Proposed period(s)** of activity  
5. **Exact location** in latitude and longitude  
6. **Two copies of all plans and specifications**  
7. **Two copies of an environmental impact report** that:
   - Assesses the impact of the activity on the GMPA
   - Considers **cumulative effects** from:
     - Past and current activities
     - Anticipated future activities
8. **List of all licenses, permits, authorizations, or consents** obtained or applied for  
9. **Contact information** of the responsible person (name, address, phone, fax, email)

> This ensures transparency, accountability, and environmental assessment prior to any intervention.

---

#### **7. Minister’s Approval Conditions (Section 6)**
The Minister must approve the submitted plan within **30 days**, subject to specific conditions depending on the **type of activity** and **zone**:

##### **(a) Scientific Research or Monitoring in Zone 1**
- Must be for one of the following purposes:
  - Managing the GMPA or monitoring conservation effectiveness
  - Investigating environmental incidents
- **If for other purposes**, must:
  - Not cause damage or destruction in **Zone 1 or Zone 2**

##### **(b) Scientific Research or Monitoring in Zone 2 or 3**
- Must be for one of the following purposes:
  - Managing the GMPA or monitoring conservation effectiveness
  - Investigating environmental incidents
- **If for other purposes**, must:
  - Not cause damage or destruction in **Zone 1 or Zone 2**
  - Not cause damage or destruction in **Zone 3**, or only cause damage **within natural ecosystem variation**

##### **(c) Any Other Activity (e.g., commercial fishing, infrastructure, etc.)**
- Must be limited to **Zone 3**
- Must not cause damage or destruction in **Zone 1 or Zone 2**
- Must not cause damage or destruction in **Zone 3**, or only cause damage **within natural variation of the ecosystem**

> The Minister may reject the plan if the **cumulative environmental effects** of the activity (combined with past, present, and future activities) would exceed the thresholds defined in these conditions.

---

#### **8. Reporting of Accidents (Section 4)**
Any person involved in an incident that could result in prohibited disturbance, damage, destruction, or removal must:
- Report the accident to the **Canadian Coast Guard within two hours** of occurrence.

> This ensures rapid response to potential environmental harm.

---

#### **9. Exceptions to Prohibited Removal of Living Organisms (Section 4(c))**
Living marine organisms **may be removed** from **Zone 2 or 3** under the following conditions:

##### **(i) Swordfish, Tuna, or Shark Fishing**
- Holder has a valid commercial fishing licence
- Fishing is for species authorized by the licence
- Compliance with licence terms and conditions

##### **(ii) Groundfish (e.g., halibut) Fishing**
- Holder has a valid commercial fishing licence
- Fishing for halibut
- Compliance with licence terms and conditions

##### **(iii) Other Commercial Fishing Licences**
- Valid commercial fishing licence (not for swordfish, tuna, or shark, or groundfish)
- Must:
  - Comply with licence terms
  - Not cause damage in **Zone 2**
  - Cause only damage in **Zone 3** that is **within natural ecosystem variation**
  - Remove organisms only to an extent within **natural variation** of the ecosystem

> This allows for limited, sustainable fishing while protecting the core zones.

---

#### **10. Exceptions to Prohibitions (Section 5 – Exemptions)**

The prohibitions in **Sections 4 and 5** do **not apply** in the following cases:

| Exception | Description |
