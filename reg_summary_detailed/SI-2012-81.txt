**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

**Regulatory Authority and Basis:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. It is grounded in **paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)**, which provides the legal basis for including specific land parcels adjacent to water bodies—particularly along shorelines—within the scope of land grants.

This provision enables the government to ensure that land rights and land grants include areas of strategic or practical significance, especially those adjacent to rivers or other natural water features, such as the **Mackenzie River**, which is vital to the region’s geography, infrastructure, and Indigenous communities.

**Scope of the Regulation:**

The regulation specifically orders that **any portion of the lands described in the annexed schedule**—which includes two designated lots near the Town of Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories—**lying within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** along the **shoreline of the Mackenzie River** must be **included in any future grant** of those lands.

This means that when a land grant is issued for these lots, the government is required to **automatically include** the area within 100 feet of the river’s ordinary high water mark, regardless of whether that area was originally included in the original survey or land description.

**Specific Land Descriptions:**

The regulation applies to two specific lots located near the Town of Norman Wells:

1. **Lot 501**  
   - As shown on the **plan of survey number 95608** in the *Canada Lands Surveys Records* at Ottawa.  
   - A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under reference number **4238**.

2. **Lot 502**  
   - As shown on the **plan of survey number 95609** in the *Canada Lands Surveys Records* at Ottawa.  
   - A copy of this survey plan is filed in the same Land Titles Office at Yellowknife, under reference number **4237**.

**Key Implications and Objectives:**

1. **Environmental and Safety Considerations**:  
   Including land within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark ensures that critical shoreline areas—vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and changing water levels—are protected and accounted for in land use decisions. This helps safeguard infrastructure, access points, and potential Indigenous land use rights.

2. **Legal Clarity and Consistency**:  
   The regulation removes ambiguity in land grants by mandating that shoreline areas within the specified distance are automatically included. This ensures uniformity in land administration and prevents disputes over boundary definitions or exclusions.

3. **Indigenous and Community Relevance**:  
   Given that the Town of Norman Wells is located in a remote and culturally significant region of the Northwest Territories, this provision may support Indigenous land rights, traditional use, and access to water-based resources. The inclusion of shoreline land may reflect recognition of traditional territories or usage patterns.

4. **Infrastructure and Access**:  
   The 100-foot buffer may also facilitate access to river transport, emergency services, or future development projects along the Mackenzie River, which is a major transportation and resource corridor in northern Canada.

**Legal and Administrative Context:**

- The **Territorial Lands Act (R.S., c. T-7)** is the foundational legislation governing land administration in the Northwest Territories.  
- Paragraph 13(b) empowers the government to include certain areas—particularly those adjacent to water bodies—when granting land, ensuring that such areas are not inadvertently excluded due to survey limitations or outdated records.  
- The regulation is binding and enforceable in all land transactions involving these lots, including sales, leases, or transfers.

**Conclusion:**

This regulation ensures that any future land grant for **Lot 501** and **Lot 502** near Norman Wells will **automatically include all land lying within 30.48 metres (100 feet) of the ordinary high water mark** of the Mackenzie River. This is a clear exercise of statutory authority under paragraph 13(b) of the Territorial Lands Act, designed to enhance legal certainty, protect vulnerable shoreline areas, and support sustainable land use in a region with unique environmental and cultural significance.

The regulation reflects a balance between administrative efficiency and environmental stewardship, ensuring that land rights and protections are aligned with both legal standards and practical needs in northern Canada.
