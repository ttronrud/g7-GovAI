**Detailed Summary of the Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area Regulations (S.C. 1996, c. 31)**

---

### **1. Legal Basis and Authority**
The **Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area Regulations** were enacted by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, pursuant to **subsection 35(3) of the Oceans Act**. This provision grants the federal government the authority to designate marine areas for protection under the Oceans Act, enabling the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to conserve marine ecosystems.

---

### **2. Definition of Key Terms**
- **Marine Protected Area (MPA):**  
  Refers to the specific area of sea designated under **Section 2** of the Regulations. It is a legally defined zone established to protect marine biodiversity and ecosystems.

- **Geographic Coordinates:**  
  All coordinates in the Schedule are expressed in the **North America Datum 1983 (NAD 83)** reference system, ensuring accuracy and consistency in mapping and boundary definition.

---

### **3. Geographic Boundaries of the Laurentian Channel MPA**
The MPA is defined by a combination of **rhumb lines** (lines of constant bearing) and a **geodesic line** (a straight line on the Earth’s surface, following the shortest path between two points):

- A series of **rhumb lines from point 1 to point 8**  
- A **geodesic line from point 8 to point 9**  
- A series of **rhumb lines from point 9 to point 18**, then back to **point 1**

This creates a closed, polygonal boundary that defines the spatial extent of the MPA.

> **Note:** The exact coordinates of the points are detailed in the Schedule, which serves as the official map of the area.

---

### **4. Scope of the Protected Area**
The MPA includes:
- The **seabed**
- The **subsoil to a depth of 5 meters**
- The **water column above the seabed**

This comprehensive definition ensures that both the physical substrate and the overlying water environment are protected from harmful disturbances.

---

### **5. Management Zones**
The MPA is subdivided into **four distinct management zones**, each with specific rules and purposes. These zones are depicted in the Schedule:

| Zone | Boundary Description |
|------|------------------------|
| **Zone 1a** | Rhumb lines from point 6 to 7, then to points 19–23, then back to point 6 |
| **Zone 1b** | Rhumb lines from point 24 to 27, then back to point 24 |
| **Zone 2a** | Rhumb lines from point 1 to 6, then to point 23, to 22, to points 14–18, then back to point 1 |
| **Zone 2b** | Rhumb lines from point 7 to 24, to 27, to 26, to 25, to point 8; geodesic line from point 8 to 9; rhumb lines from point 9 to 13, to 21, to 20, to 19, then back to point 7 |

These zones allow for differentiated management strategies based on ecological sensitivity, activity types, and risk levels.

---

### **6. Prohibited Activities**
It is **strictly prohibited** to carry out any activity in the MPA that:
- Disturbs, damages, destroys, or removes any **living marine organism** or **part of its habitat**
- Is **likely to do so**

This prohibition applies universally across all zones and forms the foundation of the MPA’s conservation objective.

---

### **7. Permitted Activities (Despite Section 4)**
Certain activities are **allowed under specific conditions**, even though they might otherwise be restricted:

1. **Vessel Navigation**  
   - Permitted in all zones  
   - **Exception:** No anchoring is allowed in **Zone 1a or Zone 1b** to prevent seabed disturbance.

2. **Fishing (Non-Commercial)**  
   - Only **Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences** are permitted  
   - Commercial fishing is not allowed.

3. **Cable Laying, Maintenance, and Repair**  
   - Permitted in **Zones 2a and 2b**  
   - **Condition:** Must not be likely to destroy marine habitat.

4. **Public Safety, National Defence, National Security, Law Enforcement, or Emergency Response**  
   - Activities related to these purposes are allowed without prior approval.

5. **Activities Under Approved Activity Plans**  
   - Any activity that is part of a plan **approved by the Minister** is permitted.

---

### **8. Submission and Approval of Activity Plans**
Any individual or organization may submit an **activity plan** to the Minister for scientific research, monitoring, or educational activities.

#### **Required Elements of an Activity Plan:**
- Personal and organizational contact information (name, address, phone, email)
- Responsible individual for the activity (if submitted by an institution)
- Details of each vessel:
  - Name, registration, registration number, radio call sign
  - Owner, master, and operator details
- Detailed description of:
  - Purpose and methods
  - Data to be collected
- Geographic coordinates and map showing location within the MPA
- Proposed dates and alternative dates
- Equipment list and deployment/retrieval methods
- Anchoring or mooring details
- Type and quantity of samples to be collected
- List of any substances to be deposited (excluding those authorized under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*)
- Description of likely adverse environmental effects and mitigation measures
- Background on prior or planned research/monitoring in the area
- Description of anticipated outcomes (e.g., reports, studies) and completion timeline

---

### **9. Ministerial Approval Criteria**
The Minister must approve an activity plan **only if**:

#### For Scientific Research or Monitoring:
- The activity is **not likely to destroy marine habitat**
- It will **increase knowledge** of:
  - Marine organism habitats
  - Biodiversity
  - Ecosystem structure and function
  - Or assist in the **management** of the MPA

#### For Educational Activities:
- Will **not damage, destroy, or remove** any living organism or habitat
- Will **increase public awareness** of the MPA

> These criteria emphasize **environmental protection** and **scientific value** over mere novelty or convenience.

---

### **10. Conditions for Denial of Approval**
The Minister **must not approve** an activity plan if:
- Any substance to be deposited is a **deleterious substance** (as defined in subsection 34(1) of the *Fisheries Act*) **unless** the deposit is authorized under subsection 36(4) of that Act
- The **cumulative environmental effects** (including past and current activities) of the proposed activity, combined with other activities in the MPA, are such that:
  - The activity is likely to **destroy habitat**
  - Or **adversely impact biodiversity or ecosystem function**

This reflects a precautionary approach to cumulative impacts and environmental risk.

---

### **11. Timeline for Approval and Reporting**
- The Minister must make a decision on an activity plan within:
  - **60 days** of receiving the original plan  
  - **60 days** after receiving an amended plan

- If approved, the applicant must submit a **post-activity report within 90 days** of the last day of the activity, containing:
  - Collected data
  - Sample details (type, quantity, date, location)
  - Evaluation of mitigation measures
  - Any unplanned events that could have harmed marine life

- The applicant must also provide a **copy of any resulting study, report, or work** related to conservation and protection within **90 days** of completion.

> This ensures **transparency, accountability, and ongoing monitoring** of environmental impacts.

---

### **12. Effective Date**
These Regulations come into force on the **day they are registered** with the Statutes of Canada.

---

### **Key Objectives and Implications**

| Objective | Summary |
|---------|--------|
| **Conservation** | Protects marine biodiversity, habitats, and ecosystem functions through strict prohibitions on harmful activities |
| **Scientific Research** | Encourages research that advances understanding of marine ecosystems while minimizing risk |
| **Public Engagement** | Supports educational activities to raise public awareness of marine conservation |
| **Regulatory Oversight** | Establishes a clear, structured process for reviewing and approving activities with environmental implications |
| **Precautionary Principle** | Requires assessment of cumulative effects and prohibits activities with high environmental risk |

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area Regulations* establish a legally binding framework to protect a significant portion of the Canadian marine environment. By defining clear boundaries, distinguishing between protected and permitted activities, and instituting a rigorous approval and reporting process, these regulations balance ecological conservation with legitimate human activities such as scientific research and emergency response.

They exemplify Canada’s commitment to **marine conservation**, **sustainable management**, and **environmental accountability** under the *Oceans Act*, setting a precedent for future marine protected areas across the country.
