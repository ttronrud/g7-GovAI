### **4. Conditions for Remission**

The remission is **not automatic** and is granted **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. **Origin Requirement**:  
   The goods must **originate in Costa Rica** and comply with the **CCRFTA Rules of Origin Regulations**. This ensures that the product meets the necessary criteria for preferential treatment under the free trade agreement.

2. **No Processing in Costa Rica Free Zone**:  
   The goods must **not have undergone any manufacturing, processing, or transformation operations** within a **Costa Rica Free Zone**. This restriction prevents circumvention of the remission by shifting value-addition to exempt zones.

3. **Timely Claim Submission**:  
   A claim for remission must be submitted to the **Minister of National Revenue** **within four years** of the date the goods were imported into Canada.  
   - This creates a strict deadline for claim filing, requiring importers to act promptly and maintain records.

4. **No Prior Claims for Refund or Drawback**:  
   The importer must **not have previously filed a claim for refund or drawback** under the **Customs Act or Customs Tariff** with respect to these goods.  
   - This prevents double benefits or overlapping claims and ensures fiscal integrity.

---

### **5. Legal Authority and Enforcement**

- The Order is issued under **Section 115 of the Customs Tariff**, which authorizes the Governor General in Council (on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance) to make remission orders for duties under the Customs Tariff.
- The Order comes into force on the **day it is registered** with the Canada Gazette or official registry, making it immediately enforceable upon publication.

---

### **6. Key Implications and Considerations**

- **Trade Facilitation**:  
  This remission supports Canadian trade with Costa Rica by reducing the cost of importing refined sugar, which is a significant commodity in both economies.

- **Origin and Compliance Focus**:  
  The emphasis on **rules of origin** and **exclusion of Free Zone processing** ensures that only genuinely origin-based, non-processed goods benefit from the remission, maintaining the integrity of the CCRFTA.

- **Time-Bound Claims**:  
  The **four-year deadline** for claiming remission is critical for importers. Failure to file within this window results in forfeiture of the benefit, underscoring the importance of record-keeping and timely action.

- **Non-Revocable and Specific**:  
  The remission is tied to **specific annual quantities**, meaning that once the aggregate limit is reached for a given year, no further remission applies for that year’s imports. It is not a blanket duty reduction.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

This **Sugar Aggregate Quantity Limit Remission Order** is a targeted, time-limited, and conditionally granted measure designed to enhance trade flows between Canada and Costa Rica under the CCRFTA. It provides a structured and transparent mechanism for duty relief on refined sugar imports, while safeguarding the principles of origin, fiscal accountability, and compliance with free trade agreement rules.

Importers must ensure that:
- The goods meet origin requirements,
- They were not processed in a Costa Rica Free Zone,
- A claim is filed within four years of importation,
- No prior refund or drawback claim exists.

Failure to satisfy any of these conditions will result in the denial of remission.
