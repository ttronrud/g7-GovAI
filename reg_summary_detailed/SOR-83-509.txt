**Detailed Summary of the Cheticamp/Grand Etang Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Limited Regulations**

---

### **1. Purpose and Legal Basis**
These regulations establish a framework for **government-backed insurance of loans** made to the **Cheticamp/Grand Etang Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Limited (the Co-op)**. The regulations are issued under the authority of the **Governor General in Council**, based on recommendations from the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce** and the **Treasury Board**.

The legal foundation for these regulations comes from two provisions of the **Appropriation Acts**:
- **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1a of Appropriation Act No. 1, 1980–81**
- Extended by **Industry, Trade and Commerce Vote 1e of Appropriation Act No. 4, 1981–82**

This authority allows the government to provide insurance on loans made to the Co-op, subject to specific conditions and limits.

---

### **2. Name and Scope of the Regulations**
The regulations are formally titled:  
**"Cheticamp/Grand Etang Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Limited Regulations"**  
They apply specifically to the Co-op, which is:
- A **co-operative incorporated under Nova Scotia law**
- Based in **Cheticamp, Nova Scotia**

This means the rules are narrowly tailored to support this specific fishing co-operative and do not extend to other co-operatives or industries.

### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Cheticamp/Grand Etang Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Limited** | The specific co-operative entity receiving the loan insurance. It must be a Nova Scotia-incorporated co-operative with its business office in Cheticamp. |
| **Minister** | Refers to the **Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce**. This minister has the primary responsibility for administering the loan insurance program. |
| **Private Lender** | Any individual or entity that provides a loan to the Co-op, **excluding**: <br> - The Government of Canada <br> - Any provincial government <br> - Any agency of a government (including federal or provincial) or any company effectively controlled by such a government or agency <br> - Any municipal corporation |

> **Note**: The exclusion of government entities and their controlled subsidiaries ensures that only **independent private lenders** can qualify for insurance under this program.

---

### **4. Eligibility and Purpose of the Loan**

For the Minister to provide insurance, the loan must be made **for the purpose of**:
1. **Promoting the growth, efficiency, or international competitiveness** of the Co-op  
2. **Fostering the expansion of Canadian trade** by the Co-op

This ensures that the loan is used to strengthen the economic viability and market presence of the fishing co-operative, contributing to broader national trade objectives.

---

### **5. Insurance Coverage Limits**

The Minister may provide insurance, **subject to the following caps**:
- The **maximum insurance amount** is the **lesser of**:
  - **$360,000**, or  
  - **90% of the total amount of the loan**

> This cap ensures that the government does not assume unlimited risk and limits exposure to a reasonable, predictable level.

For example:
- If a loan is $400,000, the maximum insurance would be **90% of $400,000 = $360,000** (limited by the $360,000 cap).
- If a loan is $300,000, the maximum insurance would be **90% of $300,000 = $270,000**.

Thus, the insurance amount is capped at **$360,000** regardless of the loan size.

---

### **6. Application Process**

A private lender wishing to obtain insurance must:
- **Submit a formal application** to the Minister
- Provide **all information and documentation** that the Minister may reasonably require

This includes financial details, loan terms, purpose of the loan, and any other data needed to assess risk and ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria.

The Minister has discretion in reviewing applications and may deny them if they do not meet the required conditions.

---

### **7. Insurance Payment Upon Demand**

When a private lender demands repayment of a loan **for which insurance has been provided**, the amount payable to the lender under the insurance policy **shall not exceed the amount of insurance that was in effect on the date of the demand**.

This means:
- The insurance does **not cover the full loan amount** after repayment is demanded.
- It only covers the **portion of the loan that was insured at the time of demand**.
- The insurance is **not retroactive** or expanded beyond the original coverage.

> Example: If a $400,000 loan had $360,000 in insurance (capped at $360,000), and the lender demands repayment after 18 months, the insurer will pay **up to $360,000** — not more.

---

### **8. Oversight and Approval**

The Minister has the authority to approve insurance under this program, but **must obtain prior approval from the Treasury Board**.  
This ensures that the use of public funds (through insurance) is subject to **fiscal accountability and policy review**.

---

### **9. Key Objectives of the Regulation**

The overarching goals of these regulations are:
- To **support small, rural, or sector-specific co-operatives** like the Cheticamp/Grand Etang fishing co-op
- To **enhance the competitiveness and sustainability** of Canadian fisheries
- To **promote Canadian trade** through improved access to capital
- To **protect private lenders** from risk of loss in the event of default — while limiting government exposure

---

### **10. Limitations and Exclusions**

- **No insurance** is available for loans made to:
  - Government entities (federal, provincial, municipal)
  - Government-controlled companies or agencies
- The program is **not open-ended** — insurance is limited in both amount and purpose.
- The **purpose of the loan** must align with economic growth and trade expansion.
- The **maximum insurance cap** is fixed at $360,000, regardless of loan size.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Cheticamp/Grand Etang Fishermen’s Co-operative Society Limited Regulations** represent a targeted, risk-managed form of **government financial support** designed to:
- Encourage investment in a key Canadian fishing co-operative
- Strengthen local economic development
- Support national trade interests
- Provide a safety net for private lenders in a high-risk sector (fishing)

By setting clear eligibility criteria, caps on insurance, and requiring transparent application processes, the regulations balance **economic development goals** with **fiscal responsibility and accountability**.

### **Relevance and Historical Context**
These regulations were enacted in the early 1980s during a period of active government support for rural and small-business development in Canada. The fishing industry, particularly in Atlantic Canada, faced challenges such as market volatility and capital constraints. This regulation reflects a policy approach of **targeted financial assistance** to preserve and grow community-based enterprises.

While outdated in terms of current policy frameworks (e.g., modern co-operative financing, climate resilience, or digital transformation), the structure of the regulation remains a model for **sector-specific, government-insured lending programs**.
