**Detailed Summary of the Regulation**

This regulation is a formal administrative decision issued by the **Governor in Council** (on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport) under **Section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987 (S.C. 1987, c. 34)**. It pertains to the **abandonment of the Avonlea Subdivision** of the Canadian National Railway Company (CN Rail) and modifies the timeline and legal status of that abandonment order.

### **Background and Context**

1. **Original Abandonment Order (1983):**  
   On **November 28, 1983**, the **Railway Transport Committee of the Canadian Transport Commission** issued **Order No. WDR1983-00225**, ordering the **Canadian National Railway Company** to abandon the operation of the **Avonlea Subdivision** between:
   - **Parry (mile 29.81)** and  
   - **Avonlea (mile 51.45)**.

   This order was intended to formally end rail service on this section of track, typically due to economic or operational inefficiencies.

2. **Stay of Enforcement (1985):**  
   On **December 2, 1985**, the Commission issued **Order No. WDR1985-00264**, which **stayed the enforcement** of the original abandonment order. This meant that the abandonment did not take effect immediately and was suspended — likely to allow for further review, cost-benefit analysis, or potential alternative use of the line.

3. **Rescission of the Stay (1987):**  
   On **November 16, 1987**, **Order No. WDR1987-293** was issued, which **rescinded (cancelled)** the stay from Order No. WDR1985-00264. This effectively **reinstated the original abandonment order**, meaning the abandonment was set to proceed **until further order of the Commission**.

4. **Public Interest Consideration:**  
   The Governor in Council has determined that it is in the **public interest** to:
   - Rescind Order No. WDR1987-293 (which had reinstated the abandonment),
   - Vary (modify) Order No. WDR1985-00264 (the stay order),
   - Vary (modify) the original abandonment order (WDR1983-00225), by changing the effective date.

### **Key Actions of the Regulation**

The regulation takes three primary actions:

#### 1. **Rescinds Order No. WDR1987-293 (November 16, 1987)**  
   - This order had previously **removed the stay** on the abandonment of the Avonlea Subdivision.
   - By rescinding it, the government **removes the reinstatement of the abandonment**, effectively **reversing the 1987 decision** that had allowed the original abandonment to proceed.

#### 2. **Varies Order No. WDR1985-00264 (December 2, 1985)**  
   - The original stay order stated: *"until further order of the Commission"*.
   - This regulation **replaces that phrase** with:  
     **"until November 28, 1989"**.
   - This provides a **clear, fixed end date** for the stay — meaning the abandonment will not take effect until **November 28, 1989**.
   - This gives certainty to stakeholders (rail operators, local governments, communities) about when the abandonment will be finalized.

#### 3. **Varies Order No. WDR1983-00225 (as amended in 1985)**  
   - The original abandonment order had a clause stating that the abandonment would take effect on **January 1, 1986**.
   - This regulation **replaces that date** with:  
     **November 28, 1989**.
   - This change aligns the effective date of the abandonment with the end of the stay period in the 1985 order, ensuring **consistency and coherence** in the timeline.

---

### **Effective Date**

- The changes take effect on **November 28, 1989**.
- This is both the **date of the new abandonment effective date** and the **date the stay ends**.

---

### **Legal Authority**

- The regulation is issued under **Section 64 of the National Transportation Act, 1987**, which empowers the Governor in Council to:
  - Rescind or vary orders made by the Canadian Transport Commission,
  - Adjust the timing or scope of abandonment decisions,
  - Ensure that such decisions are in the public interest.

---

### **Significance and Implications**

- **Public Interest Justification:** The government concluded that the original abandonment (scheduled for 1986) was not in the public interest — possibly due to:
  - Potential economic benefits from preserving the line (e.g., freight, regional connectivity),
  - Environmental or community concerns,
  - Opportunities for alternative uses (e.g., heritage rail, tourism, or infrastructure development).
- **Clarity and Predictability:** By setting a clear end date (November 28, 1989), the regulation provides certainty to:
  - Railway companies,
  - Local governments,
  - Ratepayers,
  - Landowners,
  - and the public.
- **Prevents Premature Abandonment:** The original 1986 date was too early; delaying the abandonment allows time for:
  - Re-evaluation of track use,
  - Potential rehabilitation or repurposing,
  - Community consultation.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation **reverses a prior decision to abandon the Avonlea Subdivision** and **delays the abandonment from January 1, 1986, to November 28, 1989**. It does so by:
- Canceling the 1987 order that had reinstated abandonment,
- Modifying the stay order to have a fixed end date,
- Updating the original abandonment order to reflect the new timeline.

The decision reflects a **public interest-based approach**, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of economic, social, and environmental factors before permanently ending rail service on a segment of the Canadian rail network.

This action demonstrates the Canadian Transport Commission’s and federal government’s role in balancing operational efficiency with regional development and community needs.
