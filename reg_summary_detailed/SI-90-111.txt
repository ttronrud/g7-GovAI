### **Background and Context**

1. **Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait (August 2, 1990)**  
   The regulation begins by referencing the unprovoked invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on August 2, 1990. This act of aggression was widely condemned by the international community and formed the basis for a coordinated response under the United Nations Security Council.

2. **UN Security Council Resolutions 661 and 665**  
   - **Resolution 661 (August 6, 1990)**: Imposed comprehensive economic sanctions on Iraq under **Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter**, which authorizes measures to maintain or restore international peace and security. These sanctions included restrictions on trade, financial transactions, and the movement of goods and services.
   - **Resolution 665 (August 25, 1990)**: Called upon member states, including Canada, to deploy maritime forces to the Arabian Peninsula region to enforce the sanctions. Specifically, it authorized such states to:
     - Halt all inward and outward maritime shipping in the area;
     - Inspect and verify the cargoes and destinations of ships;
     - Ensure strict compliance with the provisions of Resolution 661, particularly those related to maritime trade.

3. **Canada’s Role and Obligations**  
   The regulation emphasizes that it is both advisable and consistent with Canada’s obligations under the **Charter of the United Nations** for Canada to:
   - Participate in actions authorized by Resolutions 661 and 665;
   - Take any further actions that are appropriate and necessary under international law and the Charter.

### **Legal Authority and Activation of Forces**

The regulation is issued under **paragraph 31(1)(b)** of the **National Defence Act** (R.S., c. 31 (1st Supp.), s. 60 (Sch. I, s. 14)).

- This provision allows the Governor General in Council (on the advice of the Minister of National Defence) to place Canadian Forces personnel on active service **beyond Canada** when required by national security or international obligations, particularly in response to actions by other states or under the authority of international bodies like the United Nations.

- The activation applies to:
  - **Regular Force** of the Canadian Forces (active-duty personnel);
  - **Reserve Force** of the Canadian Forces (including reservists who are mobilized or serving in support roles).

### **Scope of Deployment**

The personnel activated are those who:
- Are **part of** the multinational military effort in and around the Arabian Peninsula; or
- Serve in **immediate support** of such efforts.

This includes roles in maritime operations, logistics, intelligence, command, and other functions essential to enforcing the UN-sanctioned maritime restrictions.

### **Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objectives of this regulation are:
1. To **enforce the economic sanctions** imposed by UN Resolution 661 through the inspection and monitoring of maritime traffic.
2. To **support international peace and security** by contributing to the multinational coalition effort to respond to Iraq’s aggression.

### **Key Legal and Diplomatic Significance**

- The regulation demonstrates Canada’s commitment to multilateralism and international law.

### **Conclusion**

This regulation authorizes the deployment of Canadian military personnel beyond Canadian borders to support the enforcement of UN Security Council Resolutions 661 and 665 in the Arabian Peninsula. It is grounded in Canada’s legal framework under the National Defence Act and its international obligations under the United Nations Charter. The activation is targeted at personnel serving in or supporting the multinational military effort, with the core mission being the inspection and verification of maritime shipments to ensure compliance with economic sanctions against Iraq.

This action exemplifies Canada’s role in collective security, its adherence to international law, and its contribution to global peace and stability during a period of international crisis.
