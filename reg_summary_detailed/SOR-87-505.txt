**Detailed Summary of the *Security for Debts Due to Her Majesty Regulations* (S.C. 1984, c. 31, s. 12)**

---

### **Overview**

The *Security for Debts Due to Her Majesty Regulations* are a statutory instrument issued under the authority of **section 157 of the Financial Administration Act**. These regulations establish the legal framework governing the acceptance, enforcement, and release of security interests in respect of debts, obligations, or claims owed to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**.

The regulations were made by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of the **Minister of Finance** and the **President of the Treasury Board**. This reflects the administrative and financial authority vested in these officials to manage public debt recovery and security arrangements.

The regulations may be cited as the **Security for Debts Due to Her Majesty Regulations**.

### **Key Definitions**

The regulations introduce or clarify key terms used throughout:

1. **"Charge"**  
   - Broadly defined to include any form of security interest, such as:
     - A **pledge**
     - An **assignment**
     - A **debenture**
     - A **mortgage**
     - An **encumbrance**
     - A **hypothec** (a type of security interest, particularly common in certain jurisdictions)
     - A **lien**  
   - This expansive definition ensures that various forms of financial security can be recognized under the regulations.

2. **"Debtor"**  
   - Refers to any individual or entity that is **indebted to Her Majesty** (i.e., owes money or has a legal obligation to the Government of Canada).

3. **"Her Majesty"**  
   - Refers to **Her Majesty in right of Canada**, meaning the Government of Canada as a sovereign entity. This is a formal expression used in Canadian public law to denote the Crown's legal standing.

### **Core Provisions and Powers**

#### **1. Acceptance of Security**
Any **appropriate Minister** responsible for the recovery or collection of a debt, obligation, or claim due to Her Majesty may:
- Accept any security that is **deemed to be a security** under **section 4** of these regulations.

> *Note:* Section 4 (not included in the excerpt) likely defines what constitutes a "security" in the context of public debt. This provision gives flexibility to government officials to accept various types of security instruments—such as mortgages, pledges, or liens—provided they meet the criteria set out in section 4.

#### **2. Execution and Delivery of Instruments for Release**
Upon payment of a debt, obligation, or claim, the Minister may:
- Execute and deliver an instrument that **effectively releases or discharges** any security previously accepted in respect of:
  - The **entire debt or obligation**, or
  - A **portion** of the debt or obligation that has been paid.

> This ensures that once a debt is settled, the government formally releases the debtor (or guarantor) from the security interest, thereby preventing ongoing claims or encumbrances on property.

---

### **Scope of Recognized Security Interests**

Crucially, the regulations **limit the types of charges** that are deemed to be valid security under these rules:

> **Only a charge in favour of Her Majesty on:**
> - The **existing or future personal or real property** of a **debtor**, **or**
> - The **existing personal or real property** of a **surety or guarantor** of the debtor  
>   
> **shall be deemed to be a security.**

#### Key Implications:
- **Personal property**: Includes tangible assets such as vehicles, equipment, or inventory.
- **Real property**: Includes land and buildings.
- **Future property**: The charge must apply to future property (e.g., future income or assets) of the debtor.
- **Guarantors**: A surety or guarantor (a third party who agrees to pay if the debtor defaults) may have their property charged to secure the debt, but only if the charge is on their **existing personal property**.
- **Exclusions**:
  - Charges on future personal property of a guarantor are **not** deemed valid security.
  - Charges on property of a third party not acting as a debtor or guarantor are excluded.
  - Charges on intangible assets (e.g., shares, intellectual property) not tied to personal or real property are not covered.

> This narrow scope ensures that only specific, tangible, and clearly defined property interests are recognized as valid security for government debts.

### **Purpose and Policy Objectives**

The regulations serve several important functions:

1. **Clarity and Consistency**: Provides a clear, standardized definition of what constitutes a valid security interest in the context of government debts.

2. **Enforceability**: Enables government officials to legally enforce security interests when collecting public debts.

3. **Finality and Discharge**: Allows for a formal and legally binding release of security upon payment, protecting both the debtor and the government from future disputes.

4. **Administrative Efficiency**: Gives Ministers the discretion to accept and manage security instruments without requiring complex legal processes, streamlining debt recovery.

5. **Public Accountability**: Limits the scope of government security interests to avoid overreach and ensure accountability in public finance.

### **Legal and Practical Context**

These regulations operate within the broader framework of **public finance and debt recovery** in Canada. They are particularly relevant in situations where:
- A government entity (e.g., a department or agency) has a claim against a private individual or corporation.
- A security interest (e.g., a mortgage or pledge) has been created to secure payment of a debt.
- The government wishes to enforce that security or release it upon repayment.

They also reflect the principle that **the Crown (Her Majesty)** has the right to secure its claims, but only within defined and limited boundaries to maintain fairness and legal certainty.

---

### **Conclusion**

The *Security for Debts Due to Her Majesty Regulations* provide a **structured, legally grounded mechanism** for the Canadian government to:
- Accept and enforce security interests in personal or real property,
- Release such interests upon full or partial payment of a debt,
- Limit the scope of valid security to protect against abuse or overreach.

By defining what constitutes a "charge" and restricting it to property interests of debtors or guarantors, the regulations balance the need for effective debt recovery with the need for legal clarity, fairness, and accountability in public financial administration.

**Note**: While the regulations are dated 1984, they remain in force and are still referenced in modern debt recovery practices, particularly in federal government financial operations. Their continued relevance underscores the importance of clear, stable rules for public debt enforcement.
