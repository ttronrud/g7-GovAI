**Detailed Summary of the Voyageur Colonial Limited Acquisition Exemption Order**

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

The regulation is issued under the authority of the *National Transportation Act, 1987* (S.C. 1987, c. 34), specifically pursuant to **subsection 253(6)** of that Act. This subsection empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the National Transportation Agency) to grant exemptions from certain provisions of Part VII of the Act when specific conditions are met—particularly in cases involving acquisitions that may not otherwise trigger regulatory scrutiny due to their nature or impact.

**2. Title and Citation:**

The Order is officially titled the **Voyageur Colonial Limited Acquisition Exemption Order** and may be cited as such.

**3. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of this Order is to **exempt a specific acquisition** involving Voyageur Colonial Limited from the application of **Part VII of the National Transportation Act, 1987**. Part VII of the Act typically governs the **regulation of mergers, acquisitions, and control changes** in the transportation sector, particularly those that could affect competition, market structure, or public interest. By granting this exemption, the government acknowledges that the specific transaction does not pose a significant risk to competition or transportation market integrity and therefore does not require the usual regulatory review or approval under Part VII.

**4. Nature of the Acquisition:**

The exempted transaction involves:

- **Acquisition by:** Voyageur Colonial Limited  
- **Target Company:** C.F. Kingsway Inc.  
- **Shares Acquired:** All shares of C.F. Kingsway Inc. that were previously held by **Groupe CSL Inc.**  
- **Nature of Transaction:** A full acquisition of the shares held by Groupe CSL Inc., resulting in Voyageur Colonial Limited gaining full ownership of C.F. Kingsway Inc.

**5. Scope of Exemption:**

The exemption specifically applies to the **application of Part VII** of the *National Transportation Act, 1987* to this acquisition. This means that:

- The transaction is **not subject to the usual regulatory requirements** under Part VII, such as:
  - Notification requirements
  - Market impact assessments
  - Competition reviews
  - Public interest evaluations
- The exemption is **limited in scope** to this specific acquisition and does not extend to other transactions or entities.

**6. Basis for Exemption:**

While the full rationale for the exemption is not detailed in the text provided, such decisions are typically based on factors including:

- The **non-competitive nature** of the transaction (e.g., no significant market share change or reduction in competition)
- The **lack of direct impact** on transportation services or infrastructure
- The **absence of overlapping operations** or synergies that would raise antitrust or market concentration concerns
- The **relevance of the companies involved** (e.g., C.F. Kingsway Inc. may not be a direct participant in regulated transportation services)

The exemption is granted **on the recommendation of the National Transportation Agency**, indicating that the agency has reviewed the transaction and determined it meets the criteria for exemption under subsection 253(6).

**7. Legal Effect and Duration:**

- The Order is effective from the date of publication and applies to the specified acquisition.
- It does **not create new obligations** for Voyageur Colonial Limited beyond those already in place under the Act.
- The exemption is **specific and limited** to this transaction and does not confer general immunity or future approval for similar transactions.

**8. Significance:**

This Order demonstrates the regulatory framework's flexibility in allowing certain business acquisitions to proceed without full regulatory scrutiny when they are deemed to have **minimal or no impact on transportation markets or competition**. It reflects a balance between facilitating business growth and maintaining market integrity.

Kingsway Inc. by Voyageur Colonial Limited from the regulatory requirements of Part VII of the *National Transportation Act, 1987*, as recommended by the National Transportation Agency and approved by the Governor General in Council.
