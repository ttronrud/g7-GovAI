The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a particular regulation has been **repealed** under **SOR/2007-99, section 23**.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Status:**  
The regulation in question is **repealed** (officially canceled or revoked). This means it is no longer in force and does not apply to current legal or administrative practice.

**Repeal Authority:**  
The repeal was enacted by **Statutory Instrument (SOR) /2007-99, section 23**.  
- SOR stands for "Statutory Instrument of Ontario" (in the context of Ontario, Canada).  
- SOR/2007-99 is the official number of the Statutory Instrument passed in 2007, specifically numbered 99.  
- Section 23 of that instrument explicitly **repeals** the referenced regulation.

**Implications of Repeal:**  
- The regulation is **no longer enforceable** or legally binding.  
- Any prior applications, enforcement actions, or legal interpretations based on this regulation are no longer valid.  
- The repeal may have been part of a broader legislative update, consolidation, or reform effort to modernize, simplify, or replace outdated rules.

**Why Was It Repealed?**  
While the specific reasons for repeal are not detailed in the provided text, common motivations include:  
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant to current practices.  
- It was redundant or overlapping with other existing laws.  
- It created administrative burdens or legal ambiguity.  
- It was replaced by a more effective, comprehensive, or modern regulation.  

**Note on Repetition:**  
The repeated line "[Repealed, SOR/2007-99, s. 23]" suggests that this repeal notice may have been listed multiple times in a database or document (e.g., in a legal registry or legislative reference), possibly due to indexing, formatting, or a technical error. However, the content remains identical — each instance confirms the same repeal.

### Conclusion:

This entry does **not** describe an active regulation. Instead, it confirms that a prior regulation has been **officially repealed** by **SOR/2007-99, section 23**. As such, it is **no longer in effect** and should not be referenced in current legal or regulatory contexts. For any current legal obligations, one should consult the current version of the relevant statute or regulation, if available.

> 🔍 Recommendation: To determine what regulation was repealed, a search of the full text of **SOR/2007-99** (specifically section 23) is required. This would identify the original regulation being replaced. However, based solely on the provided text, the only actionable summary is that the regulation has been formally canceled.
