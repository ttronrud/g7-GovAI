**Detailed Summary of the Solicitations by Mail Regulations**

---

**Regulation Title:**  
*Solicitations by Mail Regulations*  
These regulations are designed to ensure transparency and prevent consumer confusion when mailers send documents that resemble bills, invoices, or statements of account—yet are actually solicitations for goods, services, or both.

---

### **Core Purpose**
The primary objective of these regulations is to **protect consumers** from being misled into believing that a letter or mailable document is a legitimate bill or invoice that they are legally obligated to pay. By clearly identifying such documents as *solicitations* rather than due accounts, the regulations help prevent unintended payments and promote fair business practices in the postal system.

### **Key Provisions and Requirements**

#### **1. Mandatory Endorsement of a Notice**
Every letter or mailable matter (e.g., mail, email, or other deliverable communication) that:
- Is **not** a genuine bill, invoice, or statement of account due, and  
- **Appears in form** to be a bill, invoice, or statement of account due  

**must carry a specific notice** on its face. The notice must read:

> “This is a solicitation for the order of (goods, services or goods and services, as the case may be) and not a bill, invoice or statement of account due. You are under no obligation to make any payments on account of this offer unless you accept this offer.”

This notice serves as a clear legal and consumer-facing warning that the document is not a demand for payment.

#### **2. Formatting Requirements for the Notice**
To ensure visibility and readability, the notice must meet strict formatting standards:

- **Boldface capital letters**: The notice must be printed in **boldface capital letters**.
- **Conspicuity**: The print must be **no less conspicuous** than any other text on the document.
- **Minimum size**: The font size must be **equal to or greater than**:
  - The largest font used elsewhere on the document, **or**
  - **12-point type**, whichever is larger.
- **Clear space**: There must be a **clear space of at least 6 mm** (approximately 0.24 inches) surrounding the notice. This space prevents the notice from being visually overwhelmed by surrounding text or design elements.
- **Contrast requirement**: The **contrast between the background and the print** of the notice must be **at least as high** as the contrast of any other text on the document. This ensures the notice stands out and is easily readable.

> *Purpose of these formatting rules*: To make the notice highly visible and unmistakable, so that consumers can quickly and easily recognize it as a solicitation and not a legitimate billing document.

---

#### **3. Prohibition of Misleading Statements**
No such solicitation document may:
- Claim to have been **approved by the Canada Post Corporation**, or  
- State that it **conforms to any federal statute or regulation**.

> *Rationale*: These claims could create a false impression of legitimacy or official endorsement, potentially leading consumers to believe the document is authorized or legally binding. This provision prevents deceptive marketing or regulatory misrepresentation.

---

#### **4. Compliance and Enforcement**
- **Non-compliance results in prohibition**:  
  Any letter or mailable matter that fails to comply with these regulations **shall not be sent by post** through Canada Post.

> This means that businesses or individuals sending solicitation mail must ensure full compliance before mailing. Failure to do so results in the document being rejected by postal services and not delivered.

---

### **Scope of Application**
- Applies to **all letters or mailable matter** (including digital mail, as defined under postal law) that:
  - Are **not actual bills, invoices, or statements of account due**.
  - **Resemble** such documents in appearance (e.g., format, layout, style, layout of headers, dates, amounts, etc.).

> Example: A company sending a brochure or promotional offer that looks like a monthly service bill must include the required notice and meet all formatting requirements.

---

### **Consumer Protection Implications**
- Consumers are protected from **unintended payments** due to misrepresentation.
- The clear, prominent notice ensures that individuals understand:
  - The document is not a bill.
  - They have **no obligation to pay** unless they formally accept the offer.
- The rules help prevent fraud and promote responsible business communication.

---

### **Enforcement and Oversight**
- Canada Post is responsible for enforcing these regulations.
- Non-compliant mail will be **rejected** during processing.
- The regulations are part of broader consumer protection frameworks in Canada, aligned with principles of transparency and fair dealing in commercial communications.

---

### **Summary in Plain Language**
If a company sends a letter that looks like a bill (e.g., for a service or product), but is actually just asking for a customer to order something, it **must**:
- Clearly state: *"This is not a bill. You have no obligation to pay unless you accept the offer."*
- Print this statement in **bold, capital letters**, **at least 12-point size**, and with a **6 mm clear space** around it.
- Ensure the text stands out in **contrast** to the background.
- **Never** claim it was approved by Canada Post or that it follows any law or regulation.
- If any of these rules are violated, the mail will **not be delivered**.

---

**Conclusion**  
The *Solicitations by Mail Regulations* are a critical consumer protection measure that enhances transparency in commercial communications. By mandating clear, visible, and unambiguous labeling of non-bill solicitations, the regulations help prevent consumer fraud, reduce accidental payments, and ensure that businesses operate with honesty and accountability in their outreach.
