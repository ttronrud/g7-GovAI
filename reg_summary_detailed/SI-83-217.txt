The regulation you provided is a formal government authorization that outlines the legal basis and scope for setting fees for water supply and sewage disposal services. Below is a detailed summary of its key components and implications:

---

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, which is the formal title for the Canadian government’s executive authority when acting on behalf of the Crown. This authority is exercised on the **recommendation of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board**, indicating that the decision is a collaborative administrative action involving both transportation policy and financial governance.

The legal foundation for this authorization is **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act (FAA)**. This provision empowers the federal government to authorize the setting of fees and charges by federal departments or agencies when such fees are necessary to cover the costs of services provided under federal jurisdiction. In this case, the service in question—water supply and sewage disposal—is being provided by a federal entity (Fort St. John Airport), which may operate under federal oversight or funding.

**2. Purpose of the Regulation**  
The primary purpose is to **authorize the Minister of Transport to prescribe (establish) fees and charges** that the **Regional District of Peace River-Liard** in British Columbia must pay for two essential municipal services:

- **Water supply service**  
- **Sewage disposal service**

These services are being provided by **Fort St. John Airport**, which is a federal institution or entity (likely a federal infrastructure or airport authority). The airport is extending its infrastructure to serve the residential community of the Peace River-Liard Regional District.

---

**3. Scope of the Authorization**  
- The authorization is **specific** to the **Regional District of Peace River-Liard**, a local government entity in British Columbia responsible for regional planning and service delivery.
- The services are **water supply and sewage disposal**, which are critical for public health and community sustainability.
- The Minister of Transport is granted the power to issue a **regulatory order** (a formal, legally binding directive) to set the exact fees and charges to be paid by the Regional District.

---

**4. Key Implications**  
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: The fees are intended to ensure that the cost of providing these services is fairly and transparently recovered, preventing undue financial burden on the regional district.
- **Federal Oversight**: The involvement of the Minister of Transport and the Treasury Board highlights that this service is likely under federal jurisdiction or involves federal infrastructure, and thus requires federal-level financial oversight.
- **Administrative Flexibility**: The Minister of Transport is not required to follow a fixed formula or rate structure; instead, the authority allows for a tailored, case-specific fee structure based on cost recovery, service level, and other relevant factors.
- **Public Accountability**: The regulation ensures that the fee-setting process is transparent and grounded in established legal authority, which supports public trust in the administration of public services.

---

**5. Practical Application**  
Once the Minister of Transport issues the actual **order** (the fee schedule), it will:

- Specify the exact amounts for water and sewage services.
- Define the billing cycle, payment terms, and any adjustments based on usage or inflation.
- Be subject to review and potential appeal by the Regional District or the public, depending on the provisions of the Financial Administration Act and provincial regulations.

---

**6. Limitations and Considerations**  
- The regulation does not establish the fees themselves—it only authorizes the Minister to do so. The actual fees will be determined in a subsequent order.
- The services are provided by **Fort St. John Airport**, which may raise questions about the appropriateness or efficiency of using an airport to deliver municipal water and sewage services. This may be a case of infrastructure repurposing or a temporary arrangement.
- The regional district must comply with the prescribed fees, and non-compliance could result in legal or financial consequences.

---

**Conclusion**  
This regulation is a legally valid and administratively sound step that enables the federal government to authorize the setting of fees for essential services provided by a federal entity (Fort St. John Airport) to a local community (Peace River-Liard). It ensures financial accountability, aligns with federal financial governance standards, and provides a clear pathway for the Minister of Transport to establish a fair and transparent fee structure for water and sewage services. However, the actual implementation will depend on the content of the subsequent regulatory order issued by the Minister.
