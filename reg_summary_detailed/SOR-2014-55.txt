**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: Order Imposing Measures to Address the Extraordinary Disruption to the National Transportation System in Relation to Grain Movement**

---

### **1. Context and Purpose**

This regulation, known as the *Order Imposing Measures to Address the Extraordinary Disruption to the National Transportation System in Relation to Grain Movement*, was issued under **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act (CTA)**. It was enacted in response to an **extraordinary disruption** to the effective operation of Canada’s national transportation system — specifically, a critical disruption affecting the movement of grain across the country.

Key reasons for the Order include:

- The disruption is **not due to labour issues**, which would fall under different regulatory frameworks.
- A failure to act under Section 47 of the CTA would be **contrary to the interests of both users (farmers, processors, exporters) and operators (rail companies)** of the transportation system.
- No other existing legislation or provisions in Parliament are deemed sufficient or appropriate to address the situation and prevent significant economic and logistical damage.

The Order is therefore a **temporary, emergency measure** designed to ensure the continued and reliable movement of grain — a vital component of Canada’s agricultural economy — during a period of severe operational strain.

### **2. Legal Authority**

The Order is made by **His Excellency the Governor in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Transport** and the **Minister of Industry**, who serves in the capacity of Minister responsible for the **Competition Bureau**. This reflects the dual importance of transportation efficiency and fair market competition in ensuring the stability of grain movement.

The Order is validly made under **Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**, which empowers the federal government to impose emergency measures when there is an extraordinary disruption to the national transportation system and when such action is necessary to protect public interest.

### **3. Definitions**

Two key terms are defined in the Order:

- **Grain**: Refers to any grain, crop, or product listed in **Schedule II to the Canada Transportation Act**. This includes major agricultural commodities such as wheat, barley, canola, and other specified crops.

- **Move**: Defined as carrying grain over a railway line from a point **on any rail line west of Thunder Bay or Armstrong, Ontario**, to any point in **Canada or the United States or beyond**, for unloading. This establishes the geographic scope of the obligation — focusing on grain transport from central and western Canadian regions to markets across North America.

> *Note:* The geographic threshold (west of Thunder Bay or Armstrong, Ontario) is significant because it identifies the core grain-producing and export regions of Canada, particularly in the Prairie provinces.

### **4. Minimum Grain Movement Requirements**

The Canadian National Railway Company (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CP) are required to meet **minimum weekly grain movement targets** during the first four crop weeks following the Order’s coming into force, with increasing volumes thereafter.

| Crop Week | Minimum Volume of Grain to Move (in tonnes) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1st full crop week | 250,000 t |
| 2nd full crop week | 312,500 t |
| 3rd full crop week | 375,000 t |
| 4th full crop week | 437,500 t |
| Any subsequent full crop week | 500,000 t |

> **Key Notes:**
> - These are **minimums**, not maximums. Rail companies are expected to move **at least** these volumes, but may move more depending on demand and capacity.
> - The targets are based on **crop week** — a standard agricultural period typically defined as a week starting around the time of planting or harvest, depending on the crop.
> - The volume increases progressively, reflecting growing demand during the peak harvest season.

This structure ensures that rail capacity is gradually ramped up to meet rising agricultural output and market demand, helping to avoid bottlenecks during a critical period.

### **5. Reporting Obligations**

To ensure transparency and accountability, both CN and CP are required to:

- Submit a **weekly report** to the **Minister of Transport** within **one week after the end of each crop week**.
- The report must include:
  - The **weekly volume demand** for grain movement.
  - The **actual volumes of grain moved** in each transportation corridor.

> This reporting mechanism allows the government to monitor compliance, assess the effectiveness of the Order, and adjust policy if needed.

---

### **6. Duration and Effective Date**

- **Effective Date**: The Order comes into force on the day it is **registered** (i.e., officially published in the Canada Gazette).
- **Duration**: The Order remains in effect for a period of **90 days** from the day it comes into force.

> This temporary nature underscores the emergency and situational basis of the Order. It is not intended to be a long-term policy but rather a targeted intervention during a specific period of national transportation crisis.

---

### **7. Legal Validity and Enforcement**

The Order is **deemed validly made under Section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act**, meaning that the government has fulfilled all legal requirements to issue such an emergency measure. This includes:
- Demonstrating an extraordinary disruption.
- Confirming that no other existing laws can adequately address the issue.
- Ensuring the measures are proportionate and necessary.

This legal validation ensures that the Order is enforceable and not subject to challenge on constitutional or procedural grounds.

### **8. Key Implications and Objectives**

| Objective | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stabilize Grain Supply Chains** | Prevents agricultural losses due to transportation delays, which could lead to price volatility and reduced export capacity. |
| **Protect Farmer and Exporter Interests** | Ensures timely delivery of grain to markets, preserving income and market access. |
| **Maintain System Resilience** | Addresses a systemic risk in the national transportation network, particularly in the face of seasonal demand spikes. |
| **Promote Fair Competition** | By requiring both major rail carriers to meet minimum volumes, the Order helps prevent one company from dominating grain transport and creating market imbalances. |

---

### **9. Limitations and Considerations**

- The Order **does not apply to all types of freight** — only to grain as defined in Schedule II of the CTA.
- It is **not a mandate to increase capacity** — rail companies are only required to meet minimum volumes, which depend on **volume demand and corridor capacity**.
- The Order assumes that **market demand is high** and that disruptions are occurring due to structural or logistical issues, not market failure or poor planning.
- It is **not a substitute for infrastructure investment** or long-term policy reform in rail capacity and logistics.

---

### **Conclusion**

This regulation is a **targeted, temporary emergency measure** designed to mitigate a severe disruption in the movement of grain across Canada’s national transportation network. By mandating minimum grain movement volumes from key western rail corridors and requiring regular reporting, it ensures that the critical flow of agricultural products continues during a period of high demand and potential supply risk.

The Order reflects the federal government’s ability to use emergency powers under the Canada Transportation Act to protect national economic interests, particularly in sectors vital to food security and rural livelihoods. However, its effectiveness depends on the cooperation of the rail operators and the actual conditions of supply and demand during the 90-day period.
