- Age pensions  
- Disability support pensions  
- Carer payments  
- Pensions payable to widowed persons  
- Additional child amount (for beneficiaries of the above)

> ❌ **Exclusion**: Any new laws introduced *after* the Agreement’s signature (even if intended to implement social security agreements) are excluded unless explicitly included.

---

### 🔹 **4. Who Is Covered?**

The Agreement applies to individuals who:
- Are or have been **Australian residents**, or  
- Are residing or have resided in **Canada** (under OASA or CPP), or  
- Have made contributions to the **Canada Pension Plan**

Additionally, it extends to:
- **Partners, spouses, common-law partners, dependents, or survivors** of the above individuals.

> 🚫 **Exclusion**: Paragraph 1 does **not apply** to individuals who have **never been Australian residents**.

---

### 🔹 **5. Equal Treatment Principle**

All persons covered under the Agreement shall be treated **equally** by either country in terms of rights and obligations — whether arising directly from domestic legislation or through this Agreement.

---

### 🔹 **6. Residency and Claim Rules (Key Provisions)**

#### 🔹 **Residency Deemed for Claim Purposes**
A person who:
- Is **not an Australian resident** on the date of claim,  
- But **was an Australian resident or residing in Canada or a third country with a social security agreement**,  
- And is **in Australia, Canada, or that third country** at the time of claim,

➡️ Shall be **deemed to be an Australian resident and in Australia** for the purpose of lodging the claim.

> ⚖️ This ensures that individuals not physically in Australia can still access benefits if they meet residency criteria through work or residence in another country.

---

### 🔹 **7. Canadian Creditable Periods as Australian Residency (Key Benefit)**

If a person:
- Has **less than the required period of Australian residency** to qualify for a benefit,  
- But has **a sufficient period of Australian working life residence** (≥ required threshold),  
- And has accumulated a **Canadian creditable period**,

➡️ That Canadian creditable period **shall be deemed** as a period of **Australian residency** **only for the purpose of meeting minimum qualifying periods** under Australian law.

> ✅ This is a major mechanism for **overcoming residency gaps** and enabling access to benefits.

---

### 🔹 **8. Special Rules for Specific Benefits**

#### 📌 **Disability Support Pension (DSP) and Widowed Person Pensions**
- The rule in paragraph 1 applies **only** to Canadian creditable periods under the **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**.
- For **widowed persons**, a person is deemed to have accumulated a Canadian creditable period for any period during which their **partner** had a creditable period under CPP.
- However, **any period when both the person and their partner had CPP creditable periods is counted only once**.

#### 📌 **Continuous Periods**
- If a person has a **discontinuous** period of Australian residency but has accumulated **multiple Canadian creditable periods** totaling more than the minimum required:
  - The **total Canadian creditable periods** shall be **deemed as one continuous period**.

> 📌 Example: A person with two separate 6-month CPP periods (totaling 12 months) would count as one continuous 12-month period for residency purposes.

#### 📌 **Coincident Periods**
- If a Canadian creditable period and a period of Australian working life residence **overlap**, the overlapping time is counted **only once** as a Canadian creditable period.
- Similarly, if a person has both OASA and CPP creditable periods overlapping, the overlap is counted only once.

### 🔹 **9. Income Assessment and Benefit Rates**

#### 📌 **For Individuals Outside Australia**
When calculating the rate of an Australian benefit for someone **outside Australia**, the following rules apply:

1. **Disregard certain Canadian income sources**:
   - Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) under OASA  
   - Equivalent portion of GIS  
   - Other Canadian federal, provincial, or territorial welfare payments (means-tested, similar in nature)

2. **Assess only a portion of other Canadian benefits**:
   - Multiply the number of **whole months** of Australian working life residence (up to 300 months) by the **amount of the Canadian benefit**.
   - Divide that product by 300 to determine the **proportion of income** to be assessed.

> 🔍 This ensures that only a **portion** of Canadian benefits is considered as income, preventing over-inclusion.

3. **Concessional Assessment**:
   - A person is only entitled to this income adjustment **if the rate of their Australian benefit is proportionalized** (i.e., reduced due to income).

#### 📌 **For Individuals Inside Australia**
If the person is **in Australia** and entitled to an Australian benefit under this Agreement:
- Calculate income **excluding Canadian benefits**.
- Deduct the Canadian benefit from the **maximum rate** of the Australian benefit.
- Apply the Australian rate formula using the adjusted income.

> ⚖️ **If the resulting rate is lower than what would be payable if the person were outside Australia**, the rate is **increased** to match the outside rate.

#### 📌 **Comparison of Rates**
- A comparison is made:
  - On the **first pension payment date after claim lodgment**, and  
  - On **each anniversary** of that date while the person receives the benefit.
- The comparison uses the **number of months of Australian working life residence** at
