**Detailed Summary of the *Seaway International Bridge Corporation, Ltd. Regulations* (S.C. 1998, c. 10)**

---

### **Background and Purpose**

These regulations were enacted under **Section 142 of the Canada Marine Act**, which empowers the Governor in Council (the federal government) to, by regulation, extend certain provisions of the *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act (SLSAA)* to a corporation incorporated under that Act — specifically, **The Seaway International Bridge Corporation, Ltd.** (the "Corporation").

The original *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act* authorized the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority (SLSA) to undertake various functions related to the operation and management of the St. Lawrence Seaway, including bridge infrastructure. Section 26 of the Act allowed for the creation of a subsidiary corporation (like the Seaway International Bridge Corporation) to carry out those functions.

However, when the *St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act* was repealed in 1998, the automatic application of its provisions to the subsidiary corporation ceased. To preserve continuity and ensure that the Corporation could continue to operate effectively, the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, issued these regulations to **reapply key provisions of the SLSAA to the Seaway International Bridge Corporation, Ltd. in a modified form**.

The regulations came into force on **December 1, 1998**.

### **Key Provisions and Their Legal Significance**

#### **1. Corporate Status as an Agent of Her Majesty in Right of Canada**
> *Based on subsection 3(2) of the SLSAA*

- The Corporation is treated **for all purposes as an agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada**.
- This means that the Corporation acts on behalf of the federal government and is not an independent entity with full autonomy in legal and financial matters.
- It is subject to the authority and oversight of the Crown.

> **Implication**: The Corporation does not operate independently in the same way as a private corporation. Its actions are considered to be those of the federal government, which provides a legal basis for governmental control and accountability.

---

#### **2. Legal Proceedings in the Name of the Corporation**
> *Based on Section 4 of the SLSAA*

- Any legal actions (suits, claims, or proceedings) arising from rights or obligations incurred by the Corporation **may be brought or defended in the name of the Corporation**.
- This applies even if the Corporation is acting as an agent of the Crown — courts will treat the Corporation as a separate legal entity capable of being sued or suing others.

> **Implication**: The Corporation can enter into contracts, face lawsuits, and be a party in legal disputes independently, despite being an agent of the Crown.

---

#### **3. Employment of Officers and Employees**
> *Based on Section 9 of the SLSAA*

- The Corporation has the authority to **hire officers and employees** for any purpose, on terms and conditions it determines.
- These employees are **not considered officers or servants of Her Majesty** — they are employees of the Corporation only.

> **Implication**: The Corporation has operational flexibility in staffing. It can manage its workforce independently, without being bound by Crown employment rules or structures, which enhances its operational efficiency.

---

#### **4. Fee Setting and Collection**
> *Based on Subsection 16(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of the SLSAA*

- The Corporation may **set fees** for:
  - Use of buildings, plant, property, or facilities;
  - Services provided;
  - Pedestrians or vehicles using bridges or highways under its administration;
  - Passengers or goods carried in such vehicles.

- Fees can be charged for:
  - Specific parts of bridges;
  - The entire bridge or infrastructure;
  - Specific services.

- **Fees must be filed with the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA)** and become effective upon filing.

- **Complaint mechanism**: Any person with a legitimate interest may file a complaint with the CTA alleging **unjust discrimination** in existing fees. The CTA will review the complaint and issue a finding, which is then reported to the Corporation.

- **Section 40 of the Canada Transportation Act applies** to the CTA’s findings — meaning the findings are treated as if they were formal decisions under that Act, giving them binding weight in administrative and legal contexts.

> **Implication**: The Corporation has significant financial autonomy in setting user fees, but is subject to public accountability and administrative review. This ensures transparency and fairness in pricing.

---

#### **5. Fairness and Reasonableness of Fees**
> *Based on Section 17 of the SLSAA*

- Fees must be:
  - **Fair and reasonable**;
  - Designed to generate **adequate revenue** to cover the Corporation’s operating costs and obligations.

- The revenue must cover:
  - Interest on amounts borrowed to carry out its mandate;
  - Amortization of principal over a maximum period of **50 years**;
  - Operating and maintenance costs of the bridges and infrastructure;
  - Approved reserves (as determined by the Minister).

> **Implication**: The Corporation cannot charge excessive or arbitrary fees. Revenue must be sufficient to fund operations and repay debt, ensuring financial sustainability and public accountability.

---

#### **6. Public Service Superannuation (Retirement Benefits)**
> *Based on Subsection 22(1) of the SLSAA*

- For employees who were previously contributors under the *Public Service Superannuation Act* and were hired with the **consent of the Minister of the relevant Public Service department**:
  - If they were in a position covered by the Public Service Employment Act before joining, they may be appointed to a **position of equal or higher class** upon retirement (excluding misconduct).
  - If they were in a position not covered by the Act, they may be appointed to a **similar non-covered public service position of equal or higher class** upon retirement.

> **Implication**: This provision ensures that employees transitioning into the Corporation (especially those from federal public service roles) retain certain benefits and career continuity upon retirement, promoting stability and fairness in employment transitions.

---

#### **7. Government Employees’ Compensation**
> *Based on Subsection 22(2) of the SLSAA*

- The **Government Employees Compensation Act (GEC Act)** applies to officers and employees of the Corporation.
- Despite the Corporation being an agent of Her Majesty, these employees are **deemed to be in the service of Her Majesty** for the purposes of the GEC Act.

> **Implication**: Employees of the Corporation are entitled to the same workers’ compensation protections and benefits as federal public service employees, even though the Corporation is not a direct department of the Crown.

---

#### **8. Contracting with the Crown**
> *Based on Section 24 of the SLSAA*

- Although the Corporation is an agent of the Crown, it **may enter into contracts with Her Majesty**.

> **Implication**: This allows the Corporation to engage in formal agreements (e.g., service contracts, lease agreements) with the federal government, enabling it to operate with greater independence in managing infrastructure and services.

---

#### **9. Auditor General Oversight**
> *Based on Section 25 of the SLSAA*

- The **Auditor General of Canada** is the **auditor of the Corporation**.

> **Implication**: The Corporation is subject to rigorous financial and administrative oversight by an independent federal institution. This ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with public finance standards.

### **Overall Objectives and Significance**
