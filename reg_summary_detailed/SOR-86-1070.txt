### **Overview**

The *Cree-Naskapi Land Registry Regulations* were enacted by Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, under **Section 151 of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act**. These regulations establish and govern a formal **land registry system** for the registration of rights and interests in **Category IA and IA-N Cree-Naskapi lands** and in **buildings situated on those lands**.

The primary objective is to ensure **clarity, transparency, and legal enforceability** of land rights and property interests held by Cree and Naskapi bands, while respecting the unique governance structures and land use principles of these Indigenous communities.
