Certainly. Below is a detailed and structured summary of the provided regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**1. Authority and Legal Basis**  
The regulation is issued under the authority of **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development**. This authority is derived from **paragraph 13(a) of the Territorial Lands Act** (Terra Nova, 1970, as amended). This provision empowers the government to designate certain lands for sale, particularly those that are subject to specific administrative or economic considerations.

**2. Scope of the Order**  
The order specifically designates a portion of land located in the **Northwest Territories** that lies within **30.48 metres (100 feet)** of the **Ordinary High Water Mark of the Beaufort Sea**. This geographic boundary is significant because it defines the extent of coastal land subject to potential sale or development, particularly in relation to maritime jurisdiction and land use planning.

- The lands in question are described in a **schedule attached to the regulation** (not included in the text provided).  
- The inclusion of this land in the sale is not arbitrary—it is based on a defined physical boundary from the sea, which may reflect environmental, economic, or administrative considerations, such as access to marine resources, infrastructure development, or Indigenous land use rights.

**3. Specific Land Designation**  
In addition to the general coastal area, the regulation also explicitly includes **Lot 11 in Block 12B** of the **Hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk**, Northwest Territories. This lot is:

- Clearly identified by its **legal description**: Lot 11, Block 12B, Hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk.
- Referenced on a **plan of survey of record number 56088**, which is held in the **Canada Lands Surveys Records** at Ottawa.
- A copy of this survey plan is filed in the **Land Titles Office** for the Northwest Territories Land Registration District at **Yellowknife**, under file number **607**.

This specific inclusion indicates that the lot is being treated as a distinct parcel within the broader sale, likely due to its unique location, use, or significance (e.g., residential, infrastructure, or Indigenous community use).

**4. Purpose and Implications**  
The primary purpose of this regulation is to **include specified lands in a proposed land sale**. This could serve several functions:

- **Revenue generation** for the federal or territorial government through land disposal.
- **Land use planning** or development, particularly in remote or resource-rich areas like the Beaufort Sea coast.
- **Implementation of land management policies**, potentially in coordination with Indigenous communities, given the region’s proximity to Indigenous territories and the role of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**5. Jurisdiction and Record-Keeping**  
- The regulation is governed under the **Territorial Lands Act**, which provides the legal framework for land administration in the Northwest Territories.
- All land descriptions and survey records are officially maintained and accessible through the **Land Titles Office** in Yellowknife, ensuring transparency and legal accountability.
- The reference to the Canada Lands Surveys Records at Ottawa underscores the federal oversight and standardization of land surveys across Canada.

**6. Key Takeaways**  
- A coastal strip (within 100 feet of the Beaufort Sea) is being included in a land sale under paragraph 13(a) of the Territorial Lands Act.  
- A specific lot (Lot 11, Block 12B, Tuktoyaktuk) is explicitly designated for inclusion, with full legal documentation in the public land records.  
- The action reflects a combination of administrative, geographic, and economic decision-making in northern land governance.  
- The inclusion of Indigenous-relevant land management considerations is implied through the involvement of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation formally authorizes the inclusion of both a defined coastal zone and a specific parcel of land in a land sale transaction. It reflects a structured, legally grounded process for land disposition in the Northwest Territories, with attention to precise geographic boundaries, survey records, and administrative oversight. The inclusion of Indigenous-related ministry involvement suggests potential sensitivity to community interests, land rights, or cultural significance in the area.
