### **Detailed Summary of the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport Zoning Regulations**

---

#### **1. Regulatory Background and Legal Authority**

These regulations were established under the **Aeronautics Act (R.S., c. A-2)**, specifically pursuant to **subsection 5.5(1)a** and **paragraphs 5.4(2)(b)a and (c)a**, which authorize the Minister of Transport to issue zoning regulations to protect airport safety and operational integrity.

- A **notice of proposed regulations** was published in multiple local and national newspapers (e.g., *The Suburban*, *La Presse*, *Montreal Gazette*) on **March 16 and 30, 2016**, and in *The Canada Gazette, Part I* on **February 27 and March 5, 2016**.
- This provided a **reasonable opportunity for public comment** to stakeholders, including residents, developers, and aviation authorities.
- The final regulations were approved by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.

#### **2. Purpose of the Regulations**

The primary objectives are:

1. **To prevent development or use of land adjacent to or near the airport** that could interfere with the **safe operation of aircraft**.
2. **To prevent interference with critical aeronautical signals and communications** (e.g., radar, radio, navigation systems) between aircraft and airport facilities.

These protections are essential for maintaining aviation safety, minimizing risks from obstacles, and ensuring uninterrupted communication during takeoff, landing, and flight operations.

#### **3. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Airport** | The Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, located in the Cities of **Dorval, Montréal (Borough of Saint-Laurent)**, and **Pointe-Claire**, Quebec. |
| **Airport Reference Point (ARP)** | A fixed geographic point used as a datum for all surface measurements. Located at grid coordinates **N 5,036,571.602 and E 285,055.641**, at an elevation of **32.42 m above sea level**. It is derived from the intersection of runways 06L-24R and 10-28. |
| **Approach Surface** | An imaginary inclined plane extending from each end of a runway (e.g., 06R, 24L, etc.). It slopes upward at a **1:50 ratio** (1 meter vertically per 50 meters horizontally) from a base elevation to a horizontal line 6,000 meters from the runway end. The outer ends of this line are 1,050 meters from the runway centerline and 120 meters above base elevation. |
| **Outer Surface** | An imaginary horizontal surface at a **constant elevation of 45 meters above the airport reference point**. However, if this would place it below **9 meters above ground level**, it is adjusted to **9 meters above ground**. This surface defines the outer boundary of protected airspace. |
| **Strip Surface** | An imaginary surface associated with each runway, extending from the runway edges outward. It serves as the foundation for approach and transitional surfaces. |
| **Transitional Surface** | An inclined surface that extends upward and outward from the lateral limits of the strip surface and its approach surfaces. It slopes at a **1:50 ratio** and ensures no obstructions extend beyond the safe operational envelope. |
| **Zoning Plan** | Official plan **Plan No. M2016-10278 (Sheets 1–45)**, prepared by the Department of Public Works and Government Services and dated **November 28, 2016**, which provides the spatial layout and boundaries of the regulated area. |

#### **4. Scope of Application**

- Applies to **all lands adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport** within the boundary described in **Part 6 of the Schedule**.
- Includes:
  - **Lands under water**, such as those in the **bed of Lake Saint-Louis**.
  - **Public road allowances** (rights-of-way).
- The protected zone extends beyond the physical airport boundaries to ensure safety from all directions.

---

#### **5. Prohibited Activities and Developments**

A person is **prohibited from**:

1. **Constructing or placing** any building, structure, or object (or an addition to an existing structure) that would **penetrate** any of the following:
   - Approach surface
   - Outer surface
   - Transitional surface
   - Strip surface

2. **Using or developing** any land under any of these surfaces in a way that would **interfere with signals or communications** to or from:
   - Aircraft
   - Aeronautical service facilities (e.g., radar stations, control towers)

3. **Allowing natural growth** (e.g., trees, bushes, vegetation) to grow in a way that would **penetrate** any of the above surfaces.

4. **Engaging in activities that attract wildlife**, especially **birds**, which may pose a hazard to aircraft during flight operations.

> ⚠️ **Exception**:  
> Despite the above prohibitions, a person may use land as a **temporary open water storage reservoir** for a period of **no more than 48 hours**. This exception supports emergency or seasonal water management needs without compromising aviation safety.

#### **6. Surface Descriptions and Geometric Details**

##### **Airport Reference Point (ARP)**
- Located at:
  - **Grid coordinates**: N 5,036,571.602, E 285,055.641
  - **Elevation**: 32.42 m above sea level
- Derived from the intersection of runways 06L-24R and 10-28, following a precise geometric path.

##### **Approach Surfaces (6 total, one per runway end)**
- Each surface:
  - Begins at a specific elevation (e.g., 29.91 m at 06R end of 06R-24L)
  - Slopes at **1:50 ratio** (1 m vertical per 50 m horizontal)
  - Extends **6,000 meters horizontally** from the runway end
  - Outer ends are **1,050 meters** from the runway centerline and **120 meters above base elevation**
- Example: The surface for 06R-24L’s 06R end starts at 29.91 m and rises to 120 m at 6,000 m distance.

> 🔍 **Elevation Rule**: At any point, the elevation of an approach surface is equal to the elevation of the **nearest point on the centerline** of that surface. The centerline elevation is calculated from the base elevation of the abutting runway end and increases linearly at the 1:50 slope.

##### **Outer Surface**
- Fixed at **45 meters above the ARP**.
- If this would place it **below 9 meters above ground**, it is capped at **9 meters above ground**.
- This surface defines the **outermost boundary** of the protected zone.

##### **Boundary of the Outer Surface (Detailed Path)**
The outer surface boundary is described in a detailed, step-by-step geometric path across several municipalities:
- Starts at the **northern corner of Lot 5,596,752** in Montréal (Borough of Saint-Laurent)
- Follows a series of directional lines (azimuths) through various lots and roads
- Includes segments along:
  - Bois-Franc Road
  - Henri-Bourassa Boulevard
  - Brabant-Marineau Street
  - Côte-de-Liesse Road
  - Montée de Liesse
- Ends at the **intersection with the approach surface** near the 24R end of runway 06L-24R
- Then continues via the approach surface to the **northern corner of Lot 1,238,720**, completing the loop

> 📌 The boundary is **precisely defined using grid coordinates and azimuths**, ensuring consistency and legal enforceability.

#### **7. Coordinate System and Datum**

- **Grid Coordinates**: Based on the **1983 North American Datum (NAD 83), Zone 8, Quebec Plane Coordinate System (SCOPQ)**.
- **Scale Factor**: A combined average scale factor of **0.999902** is applied to correct for projection distortions.
- **Elevations**: Based on the **Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928 (CGVD28)**.

> This ensures accuracy in mapping and enforcement across a large and complex urban-rural area.

---

#### **8. Repeal of Previous Regulations**

- The **Montreal International Airport Zoning Regulations (C.R.C., c. 96)** are **repealed** by this new regulation.
- This ensures that only the current, updated, and safety-focused regulations apply.

---

#### **9. Effective Date**

- These regulations come into force on the day when the **requirements in subsection 5.6(2) of the Aeronautics Act** are met.
- As of **October 30, 2017**, these regulations were in force.
