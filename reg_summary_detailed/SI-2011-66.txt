**Detailed Summary of the Regulation: "Certain Marine Carriers Remission Order, 2011"**

---

**1. Legal Authority and Issuance:**

The regulation is issued by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the **recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans** and the **Treasury Board**. This authority is derived from **subsection 23(2.1)a of the Financial Administration Act** (S.C. 1991, c. 24, s. 7(2); R.S., c. F-11). This provision enables the federal government to make orders that remit (i.e., waive or cancel) certain fees when it is deemed to be in the **public interest**.

---

**2. Purpose of the Order:**

The primary purpose of the *Certain Marine Carriers Remission Order, 2011* is to **grant a remission of fees** associated with **marine navigation services** provided by the **Canadian Coast Guard (CCG)**. These fees are specifically those that are:

- Fixed under **subsection 47(1) of the Oceans Act**;
- Paid or payable by **marine carriers** for the year **2011**;
- Related to the operation of ships in **Canadian waters**.

---

**3. Scope of the Remission:**

The remission applies to:

- **Marine navigation services** provided by the Canadian Coast Guard;
- Fees that are **fixed under subsection 47(1) of the Oceans Act**;
- Fees paid or payable by **marine carriers** for the year **2011**;
- Ships operating in Canadian waters **between two geographic locations**:
  - One location **north of 60° north latitude**;
  - Another location **south of 60° north latitude**.

This geographic scope implies that the remission applies to vessels transiting through or operating between regions that span the **60°N latitude line**, which includes significant maritime routes in the Canadian Arctic and northern waters. This may include routes in the **North Atlantic**, **Arctic Archipelago**, or other northern Canadian waters.

---

**4. Public Interest Justification:**

The Governor General in Council makes the order **"considering that it is in the public interest to do so"**. This indicates that the decision to waive these fees was based on a policy rationale that prioritizes:

- Supporting marine operations in northern and remote regions;
- Encouraging maritime safety, navigation, and environmental protection in sensitive or challenging environments;
- Reducing financial burdens on carriers operating in high-cost or remote areas;
- Promoting economic activity and connectivity in northern Canada, which may be vital for Indigenous communities, resource sectors, or emergency response.

---

**5. Legal and Financial Implications:**

- The fees in question are **mandatory, fixed charges** under the Oceans Act, typically collected from marine carriers as part of their operational costs.
- By remitting these fees for 2011, the federal government **exempts marine carriers from paying** the required amounts for that specific year.
- The remission is **limited in time** to the year **2011**, meaning it does not extend to future years unless a new order is issued.
- The order does **not apply to all marine navigation services**—only those specifically defined under subsection 47(1) of the Oceans Act and related to operations between the specified latitudinal zones.

---

**6. Key Provisions and Definitions:**

- **Canadian Coast Guard (CCG):** The federal agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental protection.
- **Marine carriers:** Vessels or companies that operate ships in Canadian waters and are required to pay fees for navigation services.
- **Navigation services:** Services provided by the CCG such as aids to navigation, vessel traffic services, search and rescue, pollution response, and other maritime safety functions.
- **60°N latitude threshold:** Defines the geographic boundary of the operational area covered by the remission. This boundary is significant because it separates more accessible southern waters from the more remote, often more hazardous, northern waters.

---

**7. Policy Context and Significance:**

This remission reflects a broader federal policy of **supporting northern development and maritime safety**. By reducing the financial burden on carriers operating in northern waters, the government aims to:

- Improve maritime safety and reliability in remote areas;
- Encourage the use of Canadian waters for trade, transport, and resource development;
- Support Indigenous and northern communities that rely on maritime transport;
- Promote environmental stewardship through better-coordinated and accessible navigation services.

---

**Conclusion:**

The *Certain Marine Carriers Remission Order, 2011* is a targeted, temporary financial relief measure that waives specific fees owed by marine carriers for the year 2011, in relation to navigation services provided by the Canadian Coast Guard. The remission applies only to ships operating between locations north and south of 60°N latitude, and it is grounded in a public interest determination to support safe, efficient, and sustainable maritime operations in Canada’s northern waters.

This order demonstrates the federal government’s ability to use discretionary powers under the Financial Administration Act to address specific economic or operational challenges in the maritime sector, particularly in geographically remote or strategically important regions.

**Note:** This regulation is a **one-time, year-specific order** and does not establish a permanent or recurring fee exemption. Future remissions would require new legislative or administrative action.
