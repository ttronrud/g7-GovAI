The provided text consists entirely of repeated references to the **repeal** of certain provisions in a regulatory document. Specifically, the entries state:

> `[Repealed, SOR/2015-17, s. 21]`  
> `[Repealed, SOR/97-543, s. 14]`  
> `[Repealed, SOR/97-543, s. 16]`

These indicate that specific sections of a former regulation (likely under the *Canada Shipping Act* or a related statute) have been **officially repealed** by a **Supplemental Order in Council (SOR)**.

---

### Detailed Summary of the Regulation Status:

#### 1. **Nature of the Entries**
Each line indicates that a particular section of a former regulation has been **repealed** (i.e., officially canceled or abolished). This means:
- The legal provisions referenced no longer exist.
- They are no longer enforceable or applicable.
- Any obligations, rights, or duties previously derived from those sections are now void.

#### 2. **Key Repeal References**

| Repeal Reference | Meaning |
|------------------|--------|
| `SOR/2015-17, s. 21` | Section 21 of the Supplemental Order in Council dated 2015-17 (issued on May 18, 2015) repeals multiple prior provisions. This order is a formal legislative instrument used by the federal government to amend or remove rules. |
| `SOR/97-543, s. 14` | Section 14 of the Order in Council dated 1997-543 (issued on March 27, 1997) was repealed. This likely refers to a prior regulation related to vessel safety, environmental protection, or maritime licensing. |
| `SOR/97-543, s. 16` | Section 16 of the same 1997 order was also repealed. |

> These references suggest that the repealed sections were part of a regulation governing **maritime safety, environmental protection, or vessel operations**, likely under the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001* or a related regulation.

#### 3. **Context and Purpose of Repeal**
Repealing a section of a regulation typically occurs when:
- The original provision is outdated or no longer relevant.
- A new, more effective, or modern regulation has been introduced.
- There is a need to simplify or streamline regulatory frameworks.
- The provision conflicts with current laws or international standards.

In this case, the repeals appear to be part of a **modernization effort** in Canadian maritime regulation, possibly in response to changes in safety standards, environmental concerns, or technological advances.

#### 4. **Significance of the Repeal**
- The repeated appearance of `SOR/2015-17, s. 21` suggests that **this single section of the order repealed multiple provisions** across various regulations or subsections.
- The inclusion of both **1997** and **2015** repeal references indicates a long-term evolution of maritime policy.
- The fact that these provisions were repealed implies that the **original rules were either redundant, ineffective, or inconsistent** with current requirements.

#### 5. **Legal and Practical Implications**
- **No current legal effect**: Any legal action, compliance requirement, or enforcement based on these repealed sections is invalid.
- **Regulatory updates**: Authorities now refer to the current version of the regulation (post-repeal) for compliance, safety, or licensing purposes.
- **Historical record**: These repeals are important for legal historians, compliance officers, or maritime professionals to understand the evolution of Canadian shipping law.

### Conclusion

The provided text does **not describe an active regulation**, but rather a **list of repealed provisions**. The regulation referenced has been officially canceled, with the repeal being enacted through:
- **SOR/2015-17, section 21** (a key repeal instrument),
- And **SOR/97-543, sections 14 and 16** (older provisions also removed).

These repeals were likely part of a broader reform to modernize Canadian maritime safety and environmental regulations. As such, **no active legal obligations or requirements exist under these repealed sections**.

> ✅ **Final Summary**:  
> The listed entries indicate that specific sections of a prior maritime regulation (likely under the *Canada Shipping Act*) have been formally repealed by Orders in Council. The most significant repeal was under **SOR/2015-17, s. 21**, which removed multiple provisions, including those from **SOR/97-543, s. 14 and s. 16**. These provisions are no longer in force and are of historical interest only. The repeal reflects a regulatory update to align with current safety, environmental, or operational standards in Canadian maritime law.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is not a current regulation. It is a record of **legal repeal**. Any current compliance must be based on the current, active version of the regulation.
