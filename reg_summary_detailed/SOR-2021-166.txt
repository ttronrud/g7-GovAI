### Key Provisions:

1. **Number of Directors under Subsection 13(2):**  
   - The total number of directors to serve on the Board of the College of Patent Agents and Trademark Agents is fixed at **nine**.  
   - This provision applies to the overall governance structure of the College, ensuring that the Board has sufficient representation to oversee the College’s operations, policies, and regulatory functions.

2. **Number of Directors under Subsection 13(3):**  
   - A specific subset of directors—those appointed under subsection 13(3)—is fixed at **five**.  
   - This likely refers to a distinct category of directors, potentially including members with specialized expertise (e.g., legal, technical, or industry experience), or those with specific mandates such as oversight of professional standards, ethics, or education.  
   - The distinction between the nine directors and the five under subsection 13(3) suggests a tiered or functional board structure, where some directors may have more specific or operational responsibilities.

3. **Regulatory Context:**  
   - This Order is a formal administrative instrument used to implement the legislative framework provided by the Act.  
   - It ensures clarity and consistency in the governance of the College by specifying the exact size of its Board, which is essential for effective oversight, accountability, and democratic representation.

4. **Enforcement and Registration:**  
   - The Order is subject to the standard process of registration in the *Canada Gazette*.  
   - If the Order is registered after the initial effective date (when Section 13 of the Act comes into force), its enforcement is delayed until the date of registration. This provides a safeguard against premature implementation and ensures legal validity and public notice.

### Legal and Practical Implications:

- **Governance Structure:**  
  The fixed number of directors (9 total, 5 under a specific mandate) establishes a clear, stable, and transparent governance framework. This supports the College’s ability to maintain professional standards, ensure regulatory integrity, and respond effectively to industry needs.

- **Accountability and Representation:**  
  A board of nine directors allows for diverse perspectives, including technical, legal, and industry representation, while the five designated directors may be tasked with specific strategic or regulatory functions.

- **Stability and Predictability:**  
  By fixing the number of directors, the regulation provides long-term stability in the College’s leadership structure, which is critical for consistent policy development and public trust.

- **Compliance with Legislative Intent:**  
  This Order directly fulfills the legislative requirement under subsections 13(2) and 13(3) of the Act, which empowers the Minister to establish the size of the Board. It demonstrates how legislation is operationalized through administrative orders.
