**Detailed Summary of the Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations (S.C. 1991, c. 1, s. 12)**

---

### **Overview of the Regulation**

The *Maritime Provinces Fishery Regulations*, 1993 (C.R.C., c. 849), are a comprehensive set of fishing rules enacted by **His Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Fisheries and Oceans**, under **sections 8, 43*, and 46 of the Fisheries Act**. These regulations **repeal and replace** the previous provincial fishery regulations of:

- Nova Scotia (C.R.C., c. 848)  
- New Brunswick (C.R.C., c. 844)  
- Prince Edward Island (C.R.C., c. 850)

They came into force on **February 24, 1993**, and apply to the **provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island**, as well as to **adjacent Canadian fisheries waters**.

These regulations are designed to **standardize and harmonize** fishing practices across the three Maritime provinces, ensuring consistent enforcement, protecting fish stocks, and promoting sustainable recreational and commercial fishing.
