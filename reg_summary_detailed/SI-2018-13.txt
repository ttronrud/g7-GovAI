The regulation referenced — "Repealed, SI/2018-76" — indicates that the specific statutory instrument (SI) numbered 76 of 2018 has been officially repealed.

### Detailed Summary:

**Regulation Title and Status:**  
The regulation identified as SI/2018-76 has been formally repealed by a subsequent legislative or administrative action. The designation "Repealed" means that the instrument is no longer in force and has been replaced, cancelled, or superseded by another law or regulation.

**Statutory Instrument (SI) Context:**  
Statutory Instruments are secondary legislation in the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth jurisdictions) that implement or amend primary legislation. SI/2018-76 would have been a piece of such secondary legislation, issued under the authority of a primary act (e.g., a statute), and typically concerned with administrative, procedural, or technical matters.

**Reason for Repeal:**  
While the exact content of SI/2018-76 is not publicly available in the provided information, the repeal likely occurred for one or more of the following reasons:
- The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant to current policy or practice.
- It was redundant or duplicated by a more comprehensive or updated piece of legislation.
- A new regulation or primary law rendered its provisions obsolete.
- It was inconsistent with current legal or regulatory frameworks.
- It was found to be in conflict with a higher-level statute or international obligation.

**Legal Effect of Repeal:**  
Upon repeal:
- The regulation ceases to have legal effect.
- Any provisions or obligations previously imposed by it are no longer enforceable.
- References to the regulation in other legislation or administrative processes are typically updated or removed.
- The repeal is formally recorded in the official legal database (e.g., the UK Statutory Instruments database).

**Public Access:**  
The full text of SI/2018-76 may be accessible through official government databases such as:
- [UK Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/)
- [Statutory Instruments (SI) database](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/si)

However, since the instrument is now repealed, the original text may still be archived for historical reference.

**Conclusion:**  
SI/2018-76 has been formally repealed and is no longer in force. Its repeal reflects a regulatory update or consolidation effort to ensure legal clarity, consistency, and relevance. Without the original text, the precise subject matter of the regulation cannot be determined, but the repeal confirms its removal from the current legal framework.
