**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:** Designation of the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as Minister for the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act

**Legal Basis:**  
The regulation is issued under **section 3 of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act** (S.C. 2017, c. 20), which empowers the Governor General in Council (acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister) to designate a minister to serve as the "Minister for the purposes of the Act."

**Key Provision:**  
Section 403 of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act (S.C. 2017, c. 20, s. 403) provides that:

> *"His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, pursuant to section 3 of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act, designates the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, to be the Minister for the purposes of that Act."*

**Purpose and Function:**  
This designation establishes the **Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs** as the **principal minister responsible for administering and overseeing the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB)** under the authority of the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act. The minister is formally appointed to this role through the Privy Council mechanism, which is a formal and constitutional process used to appoint individuals to key government roles.

**Significance of the Privy Council Appointment:**  
By designating the minister as a member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada, the regulation confers upon the minister the **formal legal authority and status** necessary to act on behalf of the federal government in relation to the CIB. This includes the power to:

- Approve or direct the operations of the Canada Infrastructure Bank;
- Exercise delegated powers under the Act;
- Represent the federal government in matters related to the Bank’s governance, financing, and strategic direction;
- Ensure alignment with federal policy objectives in infrastructure development.

**Context and Background:**  
The Canada Infrastructure Bank Act was enacted in 2017 to establish a federal institution dedicated to financing large-scale infrastructure projects across Canada. The CIB is intended to support infrastructure development in areas such as transportation, energy, water, and digital connectivity—particularly in underserved or remote regions.

By designating a specific minister, the government ensures that there is a clear point of accountability and leadership for the Bank’s operations, promoting transparency, policy coherence, and effective implementation.

**Legal and Constitutional Implications:**  
- The Governor General in Council acts on the **Prime Minister’s recommendation**, reflecting the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister leads the executive branch and recommends key appointments.
- The appointment is not merely administrative—it is a formal constitutional designation that confers legal standing under the Act.
- The minister’s role is distinct from other infrastructure-related portfolios, as it is specifically tied to the governance and operational oversight of the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

**Effectiveness and Duration:**  
The designation is effective immediately upon publication in the Canada Gazette and remains in force unless amended or revoked by subsequent legislation. It serves as a foundational administrative step in establishing the operational framework of the CIB.

**In Summary:**  
This regulation formally appoints the Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs as the designated minister responsible for the Canada Infrastructure Bank under the Canada Infrastructure Bank Act. Through a constitutional process involving the Governor General and the Prime Minister, the minister gains the legal authority and status to lead and oversee the Bank’s activities, ensuring effective federal implementation of infrastructure financing policy.

This provision is critical for the operational legitimacy and governance of the Canada Infrastructure Bank and reflects the federal government’s commitment to establishing a clear, accountable, and policy-aligned infrastructure financing mechanism.
