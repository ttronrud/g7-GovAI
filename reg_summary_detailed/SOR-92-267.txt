### **Detailed Summary of the Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans Regulations**

---

#### **1. Background and Legal Basis**

These regulations were enacted under **section 34 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), 1999** (formerly known as the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1989*), which empowers the Governor in Council to regulate substances that pose a risk to the environment or human health.

- The **proposed regulations** were first published in *Canada Gazette, Part I*, on **December 14, 1991**, as part of a broader effort to control the release of toxic pollutants—specifically **polychlorinated dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs)** and **polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs)**—into the environment from pulp and paper mills.
- The **Governor in Council** approved the regulations after confirming that:
  - They do **not overlap** with existing environmental or health regulations under other federal Acts.
  - They were developed with input from the **federal-provincial advisory committee**, as required by **section 6** of CEPA.
- The regulations are **based on scientific evidence** that chlorinated dioxins and furans are highly toxic, persistent, and bioaccumulative, posing significant risks to ecosystems and human health.

#### **2. Name and Citation**

- The regulations are officially titled:  
  **Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans Regulations**  
  (C.R.S., c. 16 (4th Supp.), S.C. 1989, c. 9, s. 2)

#### **3. Key Definitions**

The regulation establishes precise definitions to ensure clarity and consistency in enforcement:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999* |
| **Mill** | A factory producing pulp or paper products that includes a chlorine bleaching plant and any associated effluent treatment plant owned by the same entity |
| **Operator** | The person responsible for the day-to-day operation of the mill |
| **Effluent Flowrate** | The volume of effluent produced by a mill in one day, measured in cubic meters |
| **Final Effluent** | Water released directly into the environment or into an off-site treatment system after processing |
| **Intermediate Effluent** | Water released during processes within the chlorine bleaching plant (before final treatment) |
| **Measurable Concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD** | A concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) above the detection limit defined in the *Reference Method* |
| **Measurable Concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDF** | A concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) above the detection limit, and when multiplied by 0.1, exceeds **5 ppq** (parts per quadrillion) |
| **Reference Method** | The official method for measuring PCDDs and PCDFs in mill effluents, published by the Department of the Environment in 1992 and updated periodically |
| **2,3,7,8-Substituted PCDDs/PCDFs** | Specific congeners of dioxins and furans where chlorine atoms are located at positions 2,3,7,8 on the molecular structure |
| **Total PCDDs/PCDFs** | The sum of all congeners within the specified molecular formulas (C₁₂H₈₋ₙClₙO₂ or C₁₂H₈₋ₙClₙ) with 4–8 chlorine atoms |

> *Note: ppq = parts per quadrillion = 1 part per 10¹⁵ parts*

#### **4. Core Provisions and Compliance Requirements**

##### **(1) Prohibition on Release of Measurable Concentrations**
- **Effective July 1, 1992**:  
  No operator may release or permit the release of **final effluent** containing:
  - A **measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD**, or  
  - A **measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDF** (defined as exceeding 5 ppq when multiplied by 0.1).

> This establishes a strict zero-tolerance policy for these two of the most toxic dioxin congeners.

##### **(2) Exemptions for Mills That Operated Before June 1, 1990**
- For operators running **chlorine bleaching plants that began operations before June 1, 1990**:
  - The regulation **does not apply until January 1, 1994**.
  - These operators must submit **plans, specifications, and implementation schedules** to the Minister of the Environment within **60 days** of the regulations coming into force (December 1991).
  - These plans must demonstrate how the operator will achieve compliance with the zero-tolerance rule by January 1, 1994.

> This provision provides a **transition period** to allow older mills to modernize their processes without immediate penalties.

#### **5. Monitoring and Sampling Requirements**

The regulations establish a **tiered sampling schedule** that evolves over time based on performance and compliance:

| Period | Sampling Requirement |
|--------|------------------------|
| **July 1, 1992 – December 31, 1993** | One **24-hour composite sample** of final effluent must be collected during the **first month of each quarter** (i.e., every 3 months), only when the chlorine bleaching plant is operating. |
| **January 1, 1994 – December 31, 1994** | One **24-hour composite sample** per month, with a **minimum of 21 days between samples**. |
| **January 1, 1995 – onward** | If **no measurable concentrations** of 2,3,7,8-TCDD or 2,3,7,8-TCDF are detected for **three consecutive months**, then:  
  - A sample is taken **once every quarter** (every 3 months), with the plant operating. |
| **January 1, 1996 – onward** | If **no measurable concentrations** are detected for **three consecutive quarters**, then:  
  - A sample is taken **annually**, with a **minimum of 350 days between samples**. |

> These schedules reflect a **risk-based approach**: as mills demonstrate consistent compliance, the frequency of testing decreases.

##### **Accelerated Transition Pathway**
- An operator may **begin monthly sampling before January 1, 1994**.
- After collecting **at least 12 consecutive monthly samples**, the operator may:
  - Move to **quarterly sampling** if conditions are met (i.e., no measurable dioxins in the last three months).
  - Move to **annual sampling** if conditions are met (i.e., no measurable dioxins in the last three quarters).
- If an accelerated schedule is adopted, **item 6 (the condition for reduced sampling)** still applies.

> This allows flexibility for mills to demonstrate compliance faster than the standard timeline.

##### **Trigger for Increased Sampling**
- If **any sample** contains a measurable concentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD or 2,3,7,8-TCDF:
  - The operator must **return to monthly sampling** until **three consecutive months** of clean results are achieved.
  - Only then can the operator move back to quarterly or annual sampling.

> This ensures that **any detectable contamination triggers immediate corrective action**.

#### **6. Reporting Obligations**

Operators must report regularly to the **Minister of the Environment**:

- **Frequency**: Every month (from January 1, 1994 onward, under specific conditions).
- **Content of Reports**:
  - Concentrations of **specific substances** listed in **Schedule II** (e.g., PCDDs, PCDFs, and other relevant chemicals).
  - The **effluent flowrate** (volume of effluent produced per day).
- **Submission Deadline**: Within **60 days** of the day when a sample is taken (as per Schedule I).
- **Additional Requirement**: Any report must also include **data required by the Reference Method**.
- **Format**: Reports must be submitted in **writing or in electronic format** (as provided by the Department of the Environment).
- **Signature**: All reports must be **signed by the operator** to confirm authenticity and accountability.

#### **7. Minister’s Right to Request Testing and Studies**

The Minister has the authority to request the operator to:

1. **Conduct specific tests**:
   - To detect PCDDs and PCDFs in:
     - Final effluent
     - Intermediate effluent
     - Pulp and sludge produced in the mill
   - To assess how **operating conditions** (e.g., chlorine dosage, temperature, pH) affect dioxin formation
   - To perform **toxicological studies** on effluents and mill byproducts

2. **Submit results and information**:
   - Results of any tests or studies
   - Information on the presence of dioxins and operating conditions

- These requests must be carried out **within the
