### **Detailed Summary of the Vessel Registration and Tonnage Regulations (S.C. 2005, c. 29, s. 16(1))**

These regulations, made under the authority of the **Canada Shipping Act, 2001**, specifically govern the **registration and tonnage measurement of vessels** in Canada. They establish clear definitions, exemptions, procedures for tonnage calculation, and requirements for International Tonnage Certificates (1969), ensuring compliance with international standards and Canadian maritime safety and regulatory frameworks.

## **I. Regulatory Authority and Legal Basis**

- The regulations were issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, on the recommendation of the **Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities**.
- Authority stems from:
  - **Paragraph 35(1)(d) and (f)a** of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001
  - **Section 77** of the Canada Shipping Act, 2001
- These provisions empower the Minister to set rules related to vessel registration, tonnage measurement, and certification in accordance with international conventions and national safety requirements.

## **II. Key Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **1969 Convention** | The *International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969*, as amended. This sets the global standard for calculating a vessel’s tonnage (gross tonnage and net tonnage). |
| **Act** | Refers to the *Canada Shipping Act, 2001*. |
| **International Tonnage Certificate (1969)** | A formal document certifying a vessel’s tonnage. For Canadian vessels: issued under subsection 8(5), sections 12 or 13 of the Act. For foreign vessels: issued under Article 7 or 8 of the 1969 Convention or paragraph 15(2)(b). |
| **Length** | For vessels in Part 1: measured parallel to the waterline from the forward end of the foremost hull surface to the aft end of the aftermost hull surface. For vessels in Part 2: 96% of total length on a waterline at 85% of the least moulded depth from the keel, or the distance from stem to rudder stock, whichever is greater. In vessels with a raked keel, the measurement must be parallel to the designed waterline. |
| **Power** | The power (in kilowatts) declared by the manufacturer in accordance with the current version of **ISO 8665** (Standard for marine engine power measurement). |
| **TP 13430** | The *Standard for the Tonnage Measurement of Vessels*, published by the Department of Transport, as amended. It provides the technical methodology for calculating tonnage in Canada. |

## **III. Exemptions from Vessel Registration Requirement (Section 46(1))**

Certain small or specialized vessels are **exempt from registration** under subsection 46(1) of the Act, including:

1. **Low-power vessels**  
   - Vessels equipped with one or more primary propulsion engines whose **aggregate power is less than 7.5 kW**.

2. **Sail-only vessels**  
   - Vessels **8.5 meters or less in length** that are **propelled solely by sail**.

3. **Human-powered vessels**  
   - Vessels powered by human effort (e.g., rowboats, canoes), **except** those covered under the *Special-purpose Vessels Regulations*.
