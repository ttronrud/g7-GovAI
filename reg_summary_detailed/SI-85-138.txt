**Detailed Summary of the Regulation:**

This regulation establishes a formal authorization for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Musical Ride to impose performance fees on event sponsors, with the aim of sharing part of the cost of providing the performances.

**Key Elements of the Regulation:**

1. **Authority and Legal Basis:**
   - The regulation is issued by **Her Excellency the Governor General in Council**, acting on the recommendation of two key government officials:
     - The **Solicitor General of Canada**
     - The **Treasury Board**
   - The authority is derived from **paragraph 13(b) of the Financial Administration Act**, which permits the Governor General in Council to authorize the setting of fees or charges for services provided by federal departments or agencies, particularly when such costs are shared with external parties.

2. **Purpose:**
   - The primary objective is to **share the financial burden** of organizing and presenting performances by the RCMP Musical Ride.
   - The RCMP Musical Ride is a well-known and often public-facing cultural and ceremonial performance, and its costs (such as travel, logistics, musicianship, and equipment) are significant.
   - By requiring sponsors to contribute financially, the government ensures that the cost of these performances is not entirely borne by taxpayers or the federal budget.

3. **Scope of the Authorization:**
   - The Governor General in Council authorizes the **Solicitor General of Canada** to issue a specific **order** that:
     - Defines the **performance fees or charges** that sponsors must pay.
     - Specifies the **amounts, conditions, and circumstances** under which these fees will be applied.
     - Establishes the **process** for determining and collecting such fees, including eligibility criteria and payment terms.

4. **Implications:**
   - Sponsors of the RCMP Musical Ride (such as corporations, organizations, or institutions hosting or promoting the performances) will be required to **pay a fee** to cover a portion of the operational costs.
   - The fees are not arbitrary; they are to be prescribed in a formal, transparent, and legally binding manner through an official order.
   - This ensures consistency, fairness, and accountability in how sponsorship costs are calculated and collected.

5. **Governance and Oversight:**
   - The Solicitor General, as the legal representative of the government, will be responsible for drafting and issuing the actual fee schedule.
   - The Treasury Board’s involvement indicates that the financial implications of the fee structure have been reviewed for fiscal responsibility and alignment with government financial policies.

**In essence:**
This regulation legally enables the federal government to require sponsors of the RCMP Musical Ride to contribute financially to the cost of the performances. It provides a structured, lawful, and transparent mechanism for cost-sharing, ensuring that the RCMP can continue to deliver its cultural and public service performances without placing undue strain on public funds.

**Note:** While the regulation does not specify the exact fee amounts or the list of eligible sponsors, it authorizes the government to establish such details through a formal order, which would be published and made available to the public.
