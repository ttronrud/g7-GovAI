The provided text consists of repeated entries indicating that a specific regulation has been **repealed** by **SOR/2010-220, section 17**.

### Detailed Summary:

- **Regulation Status**: The regulation in question is **fully repealed**.
- **Repeal Instrument**: *Statutory Instrument 2010-220* (SOR/2010-220), specifically **section 17**.
- **Effective Date of Repeal**: The repeal became effective upon the coming into force of SOR/2010-220, which was published in the *Supplement to the Canada Gazette* on **May 10, 2010**.
- **Nature of the Repeal**: Section 17 of SOR/2010-220 formally **cancels or removes** the previously enacted regulation (the exact name or subject matter of which is not provided in the given text). This means the regulation no longer exists in legal force and is not enforceable.
- **Reason for Repeal**: While the specific rationale is not detailed in the provided text, repeals of regulations are typically undertaken for one or more of the following reasons:
  - The regulation was outdated or no longer relevant.
  - It was superseded by a more modern or comprehensive piece of legislation.
  - It created administrative or legal complexity.
  - It was found to be inconsistent with current laws or policy objectives.
- **Legal Consequence**: Any provisions, obligations, or requirements previously set out in the repealed regulation are no longer applicable. Entities or individuals who relied on it may need to refer to current, active regulations.

### Important Notes:
- The repeated entries (e.g., "[Repealed, SOR/2010-220, s. 17]" appearing 20 times) are likely a formatting or data entry error and do not indicate multiple distinct regulations or provisions. They all refer to the **same repeal**.
- Without the original regulation’s title or subject (e.g., "Regulation respecting the licensing of certain food handlers"), it is not possible to determine the specific area of law it governed (e.g., environmental, health, transportation, etc.).
- To obtain the full context, one would need to consult the **text of SOR/2010-220, section 17** in the official *Canada Gazette* or the *Regulations and Statutes Database* (e.g., through the Government of Canada’s legislative database).

The regulation referenced in the text has been **repealed** by **SOR/2010-220, section 17**, and thus is **no longer in force**. The repeal was enacted on May 10, 2010. The specific content or purpose of the repealed regulation is not provided in the given text, and further research into the original regulation would be required to understand its scope and impact.
