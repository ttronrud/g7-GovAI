The regulation you have referenced — multiple instances of "[Repealed, SI/2008-104, s. 5]" — indicates that the specific rule or provision in question has been **repealed** (officially canceled or abolished) by **Statutory Instrument (SI) 2008-104, Section 5**.

### Detailed Summary:

**1. Nature of the Regulation:**
The original regulation (which is no longer in force) was likely a legislative or administrative provision governing a specific area of law or public policy — such as health, safety, environmental standards, or administrative procedures. However, the exact subject matter of the repealed regulation is **not specified** in your input. The repeated references to "SI/2008-104, s. 5" suggest that the repeal was part of a broader legislative update or reform.

**2. Repeal by Statutory Instrument SI 2008-104, Section 5:**
- **SI 2008-104** is a Statutory Instrument enacted in 2008, which typically serves as a secondary piece of legislation that implements, amends, or repeals provisions from primary acts.
- **Section 5** of this instrument explicitly **repeals** the previously existing regulation (or regulations) that were referenced.
- The repeal means that the original provision is **no longer legally valid or enforceable** as of the date of the instrument’s coming into force.

**3. Legal Effect:**
- Any legal obligations, duties, or requirements derived from the repealed regulation are **no longer applicable**.
- Legal actions, compliance requirements, or administrative processes based on the repealed rule are **void** or must be updated to reflect current law.
- The repeal may have been introduced to:
  - Modernize outdated legislation.
  - Align with new policy objectives.
  - Avoid legal inconsistency or redundancy.
  - Improve clarity or efficiency in regulatory frameworks.

**4. Contextual Notes:**
- The fact that the repeal is listed **four times** in your input may indicate a formatting or data entry error, possibly from a database or document where the same repeal notice is redundantly cited.
- Without the original regulation’s title or subject (e.g., "Regulation on Workplace Safety" or "Rules for Food Hygiene"), it is not possible to determine the precise scope or impact of the repealed rule.

**5. Recommendations for Further Research:**
To understand the full context, one should:
- Consult the full text of **SI 2008-104** (available via official government legislation databases such as [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/)).
- Identify the original regulation being repealed (often listed in the instrument’s schedule or preamble).
- Review the legislative rationale provided in SI 2008-104 to understand why the repeal was necessary.

### Conclusion:
The regulation referenced is **repealed** and no longer in force due to **Section 5 of Statutory Instrument 2008-104**. This means it has been formally removed from the law. While the specific content of the original regulation is not provided, the repeal reflects a deliberate legislative decision to remove outdated or obsolete provisions. To obtain the full details, access to the original SI 2008-104 and its schedule is required.
