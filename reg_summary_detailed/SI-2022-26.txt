The regulation you have provided is a formal government order issued under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA), specifically referencing the acknowledgment of scientific assessments conducted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Here is a detailed summary of the regulation:

---

**Regulation Summary:**

**Title:**  
Order acknowledging receipt of COSEWIC assessments under the *Species at Risk Act*  
**Statutory Authority:**  
Species at Risk Act (SARA), specifically subsection 23(1)  
**Governing Body:**  
Her Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of the Environment  
**Date of Publication:**  
S.C. 2002, c. 29 (Statutory Instrument 2002-29)  

---

**Key Provisions and Meaning:**

1. **Purpose of the Order:**  
   This regulation serves as an official acknowledgment by the federal government that it has received and accepted the scientific assessments prepared by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) regarding the status of certain species listed in the annexed schedule.

2. **Legal Basis:**  
   The Order is made under subsection 23(1) of the *Species at Risk Act*. This subsection empowers the Minister of the Environment to accept COSEWIC’s assessments as the basis for determining the status of species (e.g., whether a species is at risk, endangered, threatened, or of special concern) and to use these assessments in the process of listing or delisting species under SARA.

3. **Role of COSEWIC:**  
   COSEWIC is an independent scientific body responsible for assessing the status of wildlife species in Canada. It evaluates species based on scientific data, including population trends, distribution, threats, and ecological requirements. Its assessments are critical to informing government decisions under SARA.

4. **Content of the Order:**  
   The Order confirms that the assessments for specific species—listed in an annex to the regulation—have been received and are now formally recognized by the federal government. These species are subject to the legal protections and management measures outlined in SARA, depending on their status as determined by COSEWIC.

5. **Legal Effect:**  
   - The acceptance of COSEWIC’s assessments by the Minister under this Order establishes the scientific foundation for the subsequent listing or reclassification of the species under SARA.  
   - It triggers the next steps in the regulatory process, such as the potential designation of a species as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “special concern,” which may lead to the development of recovery strategies and action plans.  
   - The Order ensures transparency and accountability by formally recognizing the scientific process and the role of independent experts in species conservation decisions.

6. **Annexed Schedule:**  
   The regulation includes a schedule listing the species for which COSEWIC assessments have been received. These species are typically those identified as being at risk of extinction in the wild, and the assessments may include data on population size, habitat loss, threats, and recovery potential.

7. **Timeline and Implementation:**  
   This Order is effective upon its making (i.e., upon publication in the Canada Gazette). It does not itself impose new restrictions or protections but serves as a procedural step in the SARA process. The actual protection measures (e.g., prohibitions on harm, habitat protection, recovery plans) are implemented through subsequent regulatory actions by the Minister, based on the COSEWIC findings.

---

**Significance:**

- This regulation exemplifies the collaborative, science-based approach to species conservation in Canada.  
- It strengthens the legitimacy of species listings by formally recognizing independent scientific evaluation.  
- It ensures that conservation decisions are grounded in up-to-date, peer-reviewed data, promoting effective and equitable wildlife protection.

**Conclusion:**  
This regulation is a procedural and administrative step in the implementation of the *Species at Risk Act*. By acknowledging the COSEWIC assessments, the Government of Canada affirms its commitment to using scientific evidence in making decisions about the conservation status of species at risk. It marks the beginning of a formal conservation pathway for the species listed in the annex, which may ultimately lead to legal protection, recovery planning, and enhanced conservation efforts.
